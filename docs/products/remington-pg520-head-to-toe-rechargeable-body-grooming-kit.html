            <li>It works great and does everything that I need.</li>

            <li>Have not yet had a lot of use experience but am happy with that Which I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Aside from that the kit came with everything listed and would have been a great kit if it just cut shorter.</li>
            <li>It does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great Razor / Trimmer ...</li>
            <li>The razor itself isn&#x27;t even that great.</li>
            <li>Try to one-hand it out of the charger, and parts fly everywhere.</li>
            <li>life isnt that great.</li>
            <li>A LOT OF ATTACHMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;I am not too happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I like it, I had been using a corded clipper, but this is great.</li>
            <li>LOOKS GREAT HOPE</li>
            <li>It is great to use for a body trimmer and a beard trimmer too</li>
            <li>This is a great grooming kit.  </li>
            <li>The close trimmer works great and gets as close as you need without a razor.</li>
            <li>They were great.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice system but the design of the combs could be better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why this vertical blade is so amazing!</li>
            <li>It has to many pieces but was the best thing we could find.  </li>
            <li>The trimmers are great, and the additional slip on combs are good too.  </li>
            <li>It is ok, not the best quality.</li>
            <li>Awesome find so glad I purchased from you at a amazing price.  </li>
            <li>Both worked fairly well for about 1 1/2 yr.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking at this for a while now looking for a good price.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li>does a good job.</li>
            <li>It was in good condition, but I kept having issues with razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything good to say about this product.</li>
            <li>Good price for the product.</li>
            <li>one seems to be identically good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is as good as any out there.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re about to read a lot of these reviews trying to figure out whether this is any good or not.</li>
            <li>Remington makes good men&#x27;s grooming products.  </li>
            <li>However, my son says it works good.  </li>
            <li>but I have never had a good trim since using it either.</li>
            <li>The price was also a good value.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before I purchased this kit trying to find a good grooming kit for trimming neck, ears, sideburns, face, etc.</li>
            <li>it starts to not shave as good if not at all</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good it was</li>
            <li>Oh good times.</li>
            <li>I had good luck with that one, so I decided to give Remington another shot with my trimmer.  </li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;ve always given it a good trim using a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Good product, cuts well.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Good for men and women as well.</li>
            <li>Good for legs.</li>
            <li>Good for a man with a beard</li>
            <li>Has lot Of bells and whistles but some of them are not that good.</li>
            <li>Good wouldn&#x27;t try to cut your hea?d hair but good for body hair</li>
            <li>My bf loved this for his birthday.</li>
            <li>and I loved.</li>
            <li>This is a product I will share with my beautiful spouse because her comfort is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Trims great and all the attachments make the job easy!</li>
            <li>Excellent item ,I&#x27;ve received excellent item for a low price</li>
            <li>The packaging was very attractive and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Husband was Happy, Happy, Happy to get this for Christmas and likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Run time is fine,and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>A very interesting set.</li>
            <li>Nice product, good power.</li>
            <li>To us, they took a Huge Step Backwards by doing that!!  </li>
            <li>I love this one!</li>
            <li>I must say that I am very impressed with how well Remington worked to correct a relatively minor problem with an otherwise very good grooming kit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s did an amazing job and lasted for 7 years before the head cracked when I dropped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was working amazing then broke within a month of purchase</li>
            <li>The primary trimmers are great.  </li>
            <li>but for the money it is a nice groomer.</li>
            <li>Both trimmer heads work nicely as do the adjustable comb attachments.</li>
            <li>The vertical groomer is a nice accessory... if it would work.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, what did they use in testing?  </li>
            <li>Body hair trimmer is nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked what I read.</li>
            <li>Real happy with the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy another kind.</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain in the...</li>
            <li>so he now takes a liking in making himself look nice.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>The body outer shell is plastic and has a nice look and feel.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses his to trim his mustache and it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>handy....  </li>
            <li>Would have been nice if Remington would have put a bag that holds all components for travel etc..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice trimmer/cutter, works well</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I purchased this thinking it would be a great full body shaver.  </li>
            <li>got this for my fianc√©e, he&#x27;s been saying he needs a new one for a while, perfect Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>But they are very easily knocked out of the display cradle that can function as a charging stand.</li>
            <li>The razor works good after using the fine trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best ball shaving attachment I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The motor on this is strong and lasts for days!</li>
            <li>The shave is all plasic and very light weight.</li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It probably was, but I still regret buying it without doing the research to find a better model.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would be able to handle my beard and cut my head.</li>
            <li>I guess it is ok</li>
            <li>hes going to love it.. got all the tips and so on..its for xmas</li>
            <li>but there are many increments.  </li>
            <li>The nose/ear trimmer is okay</li>
            <li>When I tried to change heads by twisting off and on even more plastic fell off.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with a wahl, much better.</li>
            <li>It sounded like it was clipping hairs, but it sure didn&#x27;t change how my neck stubble looked.  </li>
            <li>I know he&#x27;s gonna love it like I do.</li>
            <li>I use almost all attachments at some point, but mostly the comb attachments &amp; trimmer combo for my goatee.  </li>
            <li>This is SO much more nicer and better, minds blew.</li>
            <li>There are more accessories than I thought.</li>
            <li>I Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>After a while I was able to disassemble it and to make it working</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know of too many ways to shave excess body hair.</li>
            <li>More attachments than I will ever use.</li>
            <li>and I thought to give it one more chance</li>
            <li>For the price, there ought to be more attachments though.</li>
            <li>Amazon was easier, but maybe not cheaper, than just getting it at the store, but I was ok with having everything arrive at once.</li>
            <li>Meh, it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>and it worked much better.</li>
            <li>I saw what I thought was going to be and even better product to replace</li>
            <li>ALL the attachments are more than functional, but the one attachment is the difference maker.</li>
            <li>Clipper works ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still able to use it, but there&#x27;s an adjustable part that I have to hold in place now while I shave.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>sure not a head to toe groomer.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even touching my hair.</li>
            <li>I have never had so many cuts and scrapes from a trimmer.</li>
            <li>A top of the line product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Enjoy my friends!</li>
            <li>Wish it felt more substantial and sturdier.</li>
            <li>Be sure to test somewhere</li>
            <li>Or, were you hope that I would elaborate?</li>
            <li>After reviewing many of the grooming units on Amazon</li>
            <li>I am exceedingly pleased that I chose this Remington PG520B.  </li>
            <li>but glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>It has more attachments than any I have seen.</li>
            <li>me start by saying I love the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li>This is better, with improved cutter head designs.</li>
            <li>For this price, I doubt there is a better grooming kit at twice the price.</li>
            <li>Battery is starting to go but when charged it works great and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>This grooming kit does everything you could possibly think of and does it excellent.  </li>
            <li>Am glad I decided to go with the Remington because of the quality of it and everything it can do, they thought of everything, and head to toe as they claim.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There are so many attachments and ways to use the Remington Grooming Kit.</li>
            <li>He used it and said it works okay.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t very powerful to begin with but the attachments are nice.</li>
            <li>The best part of the kit is the long comb looking attachment.  </li>
            <li>My first which I absolutely loved was</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to discover the best trademark of eletronic shavers (I have already tried Phillips, Gillete, etc.)</li>
            <li>Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned in a long time!</li>
            <li>The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a very long charge but it is perfect for my husband.</li>
            <li>Lots of attachments and overall seems to be very good quality.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product close close shaver alone is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>As far as functionality goes, this is definitely a great product.  </li>
            <li>Wow what a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a birthday gift for someone; so far he says it works great</li>
            <li>Though the top blades are of plastic, they fit snug and cut well.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been really happy with how compact it is and all the attachments.</li>
            <li>Great for grooming sensitive areas and keenly your man&#x27;s hair trimmed.</li>
            <li>There could be a better way to secure all the parts.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to look good and want a precision length  or have a lot of time to play with this</li>
            <li>Works very well, good grooming tools.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of good attachments and doesn&#x27;t take too much counter space.</li>
            <li>The batter holds adequate charge and it is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>This new Remington Body Grooming Kit is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Best used without the guide, but be careful!</li>
            <li>The nose/ear trimmer will easily cut you.</li>
            <li>Aesthetics: 5 stars, easily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rest easily on the charging station, you have to apply some force to lock it in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>This will cut your hair, but it won&#x27;t shave as close or as easily as you&#x27;re hoping.</li>
            <li>Easy to control.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>and the manufacturer has easy to order replacement parts and accessories.</li>
            <li>I have went through tons of miniture grooming clippers and they all break so easily.</li>
            <li>trims nicely and good enough battery life per charge.</li>
            <li>The body hair trimmer is not that strong it seems to lose strength</li>
            <li>Works AWESOME and has all the right attachments for longer facial hair to a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Other wise it is a good trimmer</li>
            <li>I had an electric Lady Remington before, but it was no where near as effective as this razor!</li>
            <li>I played with the seating of the heads, because it seems to run fine without them on.  </li>
            <li>Blades work fine</li>
            <li>However it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The Remington PG520B is fine for grooming, but all the parts just flip/flop around in the holder.  </li>
            <li>This item worked fine when it worked..</li>
            <li>This product was fine at the outset.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>Very complete with a good price.</li>
            <li>easy to use and travel with, a lot of accessories that I dont really use but come in handy every once in a while.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, have tried others and they do not compare, would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>It seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Does not produce a blended or smooth trim.</li>
            <li>-- It feels cheap.    </li>
            <li>The product looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This was a great present for my b/f</li>
            <li>Felt a bit cheap when I got it.</li>
            <li>Cheap is the word.</li>
            <li>I like the smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Design is modern / nice.</li>
            <li>Removable plastic makes it easy to clean.</li>
            <li>really light and cheap...doesn&#x27;t cut anything...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and does what it&#x27;s supposed to without tugging on hairs.</li>
            <li>The components lightly clicked in.</li>
            <li>This one is very similar and works great.  </li>
            <li>Adding to my frustration is the fact that once I got the Wahl out of the box and discovered how cheap it was I decided to return it.</li>
            <li>In the picture it appeared that this is what I was purchasing when in fact it was identical to the Wahl which has a cheap plastic base(no weight to it) and the cord plugs into the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li>Made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>Appears to be well built and the various attachments seem as though ithey will provide a great deal of versatility.</li>
            <li>As for the combs they are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>It also has a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li>stand is a fantastic idea and the way the cord is integrated into it</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was cheap (elaboration below) and it functioned.</li>
            <li>Seems like the primary job of clippers is to cut hair.</li>
            <li>charge light is always amber.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a charge light, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;I&#x27;m plugged in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and lightweight.</li>
            <li>As soon as the package arrived I charged it up and got a complete haircut from my neighbor who loved using the Remington</li>
            <li>With the right attachments, you can safely use this to shave ANYWHERE without any mishaps.</li>
            <li>This thing will cut hair ok, but I find most of the attachments don&#x27;t work particularly well, and are all flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>Very handy and enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li>Motor is very powerful and hold a charge well.  </li>
            <li>The blades are very precise and the ergonomically designed body makes for a comfortable fit in my large hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told it is great for ears and noses by someone far less attractive.</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to switch attachments and works as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Best it can do is maybe a #2 or #3, and that is with the small trimmer head on.  </li>
            <li>The unique angle of the body shaving attachment compliments the contouring required when shaving below the belt.</li>
            <li>recently cropped my hair short, and wanted to be able to maintain it, and the vertical attachment with the comb is perfect!  </li>
            <li>Product has a lot of useful attachments, some of which I haven&#x27;t even used yet!</li>
            <li>This hair grooming set is much better than the first Remington set.  </li>
            <li>works great and keep a charge for a long time, says my brother in law.</li>
            <li>And tonight I tried to trim off my goatee, since I need to be clean shaven for an appointment tomorrow morning.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good and the attachment method is simple and secure.</li>
            <li>Just clean it and oil it every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Overall a great and useful product.</li>
            <li>and so do I because he keeps himself clean cut and shaved.</li>
            <li>It has worked great and well worth it if you can grow  facial hair!!!</li>
            <li>He really enjoys it and it is good for a very close shave</li>
            <li>6,99 is also the most positive of another $ 7me at:</li>
            <li>nothing special....</li>
            <li>That thing almost seems like it&#x27;s going to buzz right off the handle!</li>
            <li>I was optimistic at first buying a Remington Razor but after such great reviews of this product I gave in and bought it.  </li>
            <li>At it&#x27;s closest setting, #1, the comb is 1/4&amp;#34; in front of and a full 1/2&amp;#34; below the cutter blades, at it&#x27;s longest setting, #10, the comb is 7/8&amp;#34; in front of and 7/8&amp;#34; below the cutter blades.</li>
            <li>Good product at a low price.</li>
            <li>versatility is superior to any similar product that I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using a 2 guard on the Wahl for my bear and the only thing this is good for is neck and beard lines.  </li>
            <li>Overall this was a good bang for my buck</li>
            <li>cool but battery</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, if you&#x27;ve made it this far into the review, you might want to take a quick look inward.</li>
            <li>The blades on all the attachments are crisp and strong (they never tug).</li>
            <li>later found out it would be a better use of time to try to chew my own hair off first.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more to get a good device.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly!   </li>
            <li>/&gt;-The battery wont last for 35 minutes on a charge, the best you can get is maybe 15, and it is not even enough to get your beard</li>
            <li>Way too many attachments, no human could have this many hair requirements.</li>
            <li>It does lose power fairly quick but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Shipped and arrived quickly and well</li>
            <li>However it got older (more than 8 years), and the battery wasn&#x27;t recharging well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Back to Norelco for me, the $15 all in one works much better and has a lot more adjustments.</li>
            <li>The fine trimmer blade cuts extremely close and the larger trimmer is the perfect length for my goatee.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and easy to use - very reasonably priced and well-constructed!</li>
            <li>quickly.the big beard trimmer is pretty good and does what you would expect.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most razors</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Head-to-Toe&#x27; name is a tad ambitious (12-15 sq ft!).  </li>
            <li>The shaver is great, quite, lightweight, and powerful, just until you get to what I believe is half battery</li>
            <li>The power switch is positive and it stays on and has a good solid click to it when turning it off.</li>
            <li>I certainly felt comfortable with my product selection from the visuals, the brand</li>
            <li>the good side, the vertical body groomer is really comfortable and easy to use, but then again, your body hair will show even if you just groomed it, it does not cut it short enough.</li>
            <li>Alright, so I had some cheap grooming kit that I absolutely ran into the ground.</li>
            <li>The beard and facial trimmers are amazing, the body trimmer is a godsend, the clippers are a must-have, and the foil razer is...</li>
            <li>The motor even when fully charged doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s got much &#x27;oomph&#x27;</li>
            <li>What kind of clipper can&#x27;t cut through a standard bit of goatee on a man&#x27;s chin?  </li>
            <li>when I first tried to use it, the battery lasted a full 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase I made for this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about this set up.  </li>
            <li>On my old Phillips Norelco trimmer I set my hair and facial hair at a 3 and was always happy.</li>
            <li>hooked up and in use at the same time which would of been really handy</li>
            <li>But it was the \\&quot;body\\&quot;, or vertical trimmer that surprised me most of all.</li>
            <li>Works okay the best at cutting or trimming.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Works very well, the attachments are very useful and it gives a close trim, all over the body.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>The shaver is ergonomically pleasing, versatile and easy to change attachments, easy to use on various areas of the anatomy</li>
            <li>It was like that right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned 15 minutes; I haven&#x27;t timed it, but that sounds about right.  </li>
            <li>construction feels \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, but the price is right and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>It really helps keep a clean look.  </li>
            <li>but if you want something quick and easy its not worth the money and this is neither quick nor easy.</li>
            <li>A more solid stand with a snugger fit for the attachments would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad product with some good general use accessories.</li>
            <li>This grooming kit is so easy to use, easy to change heads, and it holds it charge for very long periods of time.  </li>
            <li>However, I would suggest spending a few more dollars and buying a better quality electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>This Remington shaver is quite nice, it&#x27;s quiet, and really gives me a close shave around my goatee.  </li>
            <li>Simply the BEST shaving system in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>Other than than, very pleased.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good but a little overpriced.</li>
            <li>I like the small size and great fit, would appreciate a little bit more of a battery life though.</li>
            <li>Thanks Remington for renewing my faith in your company!   </li>
            <li>Within the first couple months of owning this kit, the battery would no longer hold a charge, or some of the attachments wouldn&#x27;t work at all even when the battery was fully charged.</li>
            <li>The blades on the trimmer attachments did pretty well at first (first 2-3 months?).  </li>
            <li>The battery does not last more than about 15 minutes.    </li>
            <li>This is the first time I took it off its stand and tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sending a lovely letter of gratitude to Remington... and will be purchasing a Wahl trimmer again shortly.  </li>
            <li>Earlier versions of this shaver were great, you only had to replace the blades, not the whole thing.</li>
            <li>If this is a faulty unit, I&#x27;d love an exchange to try a different one, but no, screwed.</li>
            <li>Many different attachments.</li>
            <li>Last year we purchased two of these trimmers for $30 and we love them.  </li>
            <li>I just finished trying to trim his beard and neaten up his haircut and the thing did not last more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>He likes it better than the last one he had</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering tearing into the machine and replacing the battery with a higher grade of battery.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s body isn&#x27;t very hairy so that aspect of the product isn&#x27;t really useful for him</li>
            <li>The makers have tried their best to put out a quality product, the only thing is they overlooked one small part.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My last trimmer was AA battery powered, had more power, and lasted over 10 years.</li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it it died halfway through</li>
            <li>Love the price and we have an more expensive one and this is the favorite.</li>
            <li>The only thing i would improve is to add more sizes.</li>
            <li>The guards do not stay in place so you cannot get a consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>What could I possibly say more?</li>
            <li>this item was exactly what i needed and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Works very well !</li>
            <li>On my first go I charged it up all the way, used it, then put it away.</li>
            <li>The adapter is way too tall to be useful for much of anything.</li>
            <li>This arrived to me promptly and worked fairly well for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>no small brush included to clean the unit.</li>
            <li>The product works great to shave  small spaces!</li>
            <li>The other attachments are also handy for doing touch ups when needed.</li>
            <li>in practical use, for me, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I only used it for &#x27;personal grooming&#x27;, meaning on occassion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually cut myself with the trimmer a couple times trying to shape (my fault entirely) but that&#x27;s how good</li>
            <li>It does a great job trimming overly long arm and leg hair to a normal length, I&#x27;d buy it if you want to manscape your gorilla back and</li>
            <li>I was pleased with how well it worked and how long it lasted</li>
            <li>I had expected more, such as trimmers in more sizes.</li>
            <li>Replaced with a trimmer made by Wahl, 9818 model, long standby life, plenty more attachments.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty flimsy, but for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much...</li>
            <li>This razor allowed me to trim down to the length I desired and create a nice design.</li>
            <li>I have less hair than I used to and now cut (buzz) my own.  </li>
            <li>If you do not have a large vanity or drawer to stow</li>
            <li>but it is far superior to the remington product for less money</li>
            <li>you try to groom your beard with this, on one hand you will get a one day beard at the best (so if its been one day since you last shaved, dont even bother) and, on the other hand, it will take you forever, because that accesory is not even one inch wide (the pictures are misleading) and you need to go through the same area several times (to get a one-day beard, thats as good as it gets..</li>
            <li>I really like the body clipper, and the nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I picked this up in a StuffMart because I wanted one fast and this sounded like the best/most flexible option.  </li>
            <li>The depth combs are very shintzy</li>
            <li>The unit operates really well.</li>
            <li>Everyone has plastic pieces, but if the attachments are meant to fit together, there should be no problem if handled properly.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten this as a birthday gift for my husband and it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It otherwise sat on the sinktop taking up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>That is almost 30% of the cost of the entire system to replace a cheap piece of plastic, one of five attachments.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys</li>
            <li>I really recommend this Remington pg520 a b c d</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I got my money worth so far....  </li>
            <li>and it just didn&#x27;t trim his hair very well.</li>
            <li>This product really did surprise me.</li>
            <li>And really does well ALL over the body.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t care much about the foil shaver I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll just have to buy a wired one to really &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see how on earth they would put this product out.</li>
            <li>but I really like the range of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The point is, the option is there and it is very enticing...</li>
            <li>One reviewer found it very helpful in genital areas.</li>
            <li>What lady wants a bunch of hairs getting in the way?  </li>
            <li>Of note, this can be used for very close grooming as it has an attachment for that.</li>
            <li>The vertical orientation of the trimming head makes the ergonomics of ball shaving much easier, not to mention how close the blade trims!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really like it.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, does not work as it should, had to send it back.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is unusable because of the battery.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves the attachments, takes care of all of his needs.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and he really likes it</li>
            <li>The battery goes through a charge FAST but takes a while to charge up.</li>
            <li>It is a very well made unit and does all that I require with ease of operation.  </li>
            <li>It should be noted that even when the battery was &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; it didn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I give this a 2 instead of a 1 is because it is cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every make and model of electric shaver on the market over the past 32 years and this is by far the most versatile, easy to use system out there.</li>
            <li>If you google my old model number you will see right away the differences.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>(\\&quot;Narrow\\&quot; works pretty well around the mouth, for instance, but it would take too long on the rest of my full beard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>No proper clean out of the attachments or body;</li>
            <li>They give you a nice long cord, suggesting this might be possible, but when you turn the razor on it stops charging and runs off the battery.</li>
            <li>The long clipper is very useful, but it does pinch the skin, in intimate areas.  </li>
            <li>The straight-line trimmer is sufficient for minor trimming but the ear/nose hair trimmer is not sharp enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not particularly durable nor strong, and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I must say that I was pleasantly surprised on my first use.</li>
            <li>This is so worth buying no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li>everything works fine so far but the trimmer for the face only cuts in one direction or else it cuts tour face all up.</li>
            <li>Overall it has served me fairly well, however I do wish the trimmer cut a little finer around the neck areas.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m a new person!</li>
            <li>Just like brushing your hair to keep an even length without the awkwardness of using a traditional horizontal clipper, and without the comb, it&#x27;s great for gettting around the ears and back of the neck as wel as other parts of the body.  </li>
            <li>The set is less than OK.</li>
            <li>My previous groomer of many years had a cover over everything.</li>
            <li>My facial bumps were everywhere with my old shaver and now my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>This razor is a decent buy for the money.  </li>
            <li>My fiance has had a older cheaper one for yeeaars and uses the fire out of it.</li>
            <li>I mainly use mine for the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>But one of the main reasons I bought it was to use it to buzz my hair, which I do about once a week.</li>
            <li>However, after several months you will be lucky getting through a hair cut before the battery dies.</li>
            <li>Like with most electric shavers, you will be satisfied, but not impressed.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace to replace my older Wahl trimmer thinking it would be an upgrade.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older trimmer I had.</li>
            <li>It is a clever design and well made.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality does seem to be high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this grooming kit.</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to remove the heads to replace with other attachments.</li>
            <li>Anyway, so far he seems to really like it and works like a champ.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s underpowered, the attachments aren&#x27;t useful, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This unit does not hold a charge for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I used the product, it is only worth about $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that it acted like it barely had a charge.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and hope it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Most nose trimmers are round, this is a flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the hair is long enough it also feels like it pulls more then it does cut.</li>
            <li>The batteries last as long as I need them to, and everything works as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s supposed to...</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ll await his trial a few more times and update my review.</li>
            <li>Does not hold a charge very long, Good for a few uses per charge.</li>
            <li>Have bought other similar products and some by the same manufacturer, but this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Given the volume of other negative reviews on this product, I feel I&#x27;m better off rolling that $8.00 into a better</li>
            <li>Every time I try to pick up the trimmer on the new unit EVERYTHING falls out of it because it doesn&#x27;t have any weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was like a kid with a new toy</li>
            <li>I switched to one of the other alternative heads, and was able to continue trimming a few more times with each head, but they all suffered the same fate.</li>
            <li>, the rare use meant it usually had no charge when I needed it, so I had to either wait or plan ahead for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>The larger attachment that seems fit for a haircut only cuts at a height of 1&amp;#34; or so.  </li>
            <li>so some heads only fit in specific sockets.</li>
            <li>The main unit and accessories are well made and stand up to frequent use.</li>
            <li>but when it arrived I was very surprised at all the attachments that came with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>What took more than an hour before with wet shaving products is completed in less than ten minutes with a smooth closeness and no nicks or pulling.</li>
            <li>(I usually do a touch-up every couple days, with a more thorough mowing on Saturday morning.  </li>
            <li>First this is smaller</li>
            <li>I wish it had a longer battery life as it&#x27;s pretty short (around 1/2 hour).</li>
            <li>Purchased product to get a more diversified shaving system other than the standard electric razor.  </li>
            <li>is ok - not outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got pretty coarse hair though so cleaning it thoroughly gets a bit tasking.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I had this trimmer for less than 4 months and used it lightly (1-2 times per week).</li>
            <li>Not bad; the main unit is a lot lighter than my previous trimmer, but I&#x27;ve learned to like that about it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is a nice compact design, with a decent little stand and appearance, but it does not cut short enough.  </li>
            <li>Device has more than enough attachments to do it all and the unit holds a charge long enough to do so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger and more powerful then those small types and works well with the different attachments allover the body.</li>
            <li>Lots of useful accessories, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap but it should last as my last clipper worked for 7 years so this one should last just as long.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver works okay for tight areas but not to shave your entire face.  </li>
            <li>It now operates at full power for roughly 5 minutes before beginning to losing power and quickly dwindling down to a complete stop.</li>
            <li>Now they seem dull - they don&#x27;t cut as well, and there&#x27;s a lot more pulling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great having an all in one but the main unit is a little weak and doesn&#x27;t have the remington buzz that numbs your arm when you turn it on.</li>
            <li>Steer clear of this product</li>
            <li>old father in law.  </li>
            <li>:  The battery doesn&#x27;t last very well.  </li>
            <li>There are many flaws with this and at least for me I&#x27;m going to have to use barber clipper again</li>
            <li>The one I bought is over a year old and it still works.</li>
            <li>so far it seems like its a quality product and not cheep.</li>
            <li>biggest irritant was paying nearly 2x for what you can get it for at Walmart or a beauty cosmetic store.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver is very inefficient and takes multiple passes to produce marginal results.</li>
            <li>The only two complaints that I have are that the accessories don&#x27;t stay in the storage tray very well,</li>
            <li>I am comparing the PG520 to an old Remington MB40    </li>
            <li>Truth be told, I bought this to replace my Wahl trimmer that was 6 years old.  </li>
            <li>Then plugged in and let it charge completely.  </li>
            <li>This thing is complete junk.  </li>
            <li>I just got this Kit to replace a Norelco shaver that I was using, which was about 18 months old.  </li>
            <li>He is very picky about his groomers, but he loves this entire set.  </li>
            <li>stand is very compact, the accessory sockets however are not all the same shape</li>
            <li>The Vertical Trimmer works very well, but the comb slides on from the end and only has three slots.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used all of the different heads that come with the trimmer</li>
            <li>So far battery life hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li>After using it his cheeks are baby soft.</li>
            <li>so I had to get out my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>I picked up this item because my old Remington PG250 wasn&#x27;t holding a charge anymore.</li>
            <li>No problems so far.</li>
            <li>No problems yet, works as it should and has a pretty long battery life.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that I have only used this razor maybe 5-8 times because I need it very often, and the battery still has already died.</li>
            <li>The other tools work very well, and it certainly has an abundance of those.  </li>
            <li>Wish Remington would put a long lasting higher grade battery the first time out of the Chinese factory !  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:  Lots of different attachments; I particularly like the \\&quot;wide\\&quot; and \\&quot;narrow\\&quot; trimmer heads.  </li>
            <li>Decent grooming kit, except for short beards.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing about that is I only use it for my goatee, eyebrows, back of my neck and armpits.</li>
            <li>I bought and older version of this, which I used mainly to trim my facial hair and, occasionally, problem areas in my hair.</li>
            <li>I surprised at how small and cheap looking the battery is...</li>
            <li>I keep my hair and facial hair pretty short</li>
            <li>The guide is a little on the flimsy side, I use this trimmer to do my initial trimming and then use a different trimmer to actually make things look nice</li>
            <li>I highly regret this purchase and will be going with a different brand.</li>
            <li>It is easy enough to put the other pieces away or give it to my husband who has the same thing.  </li>
            <li>It really stays charge for a long while.</li>
            <li>, the fine trimmer didn&#x27;t work well and the electric razor part is not very good.  </li>
            <li>The large trimmer guide can not be adjusted low enough to use as a body/beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>As others have reported, this trimmer only works marginally when new, and for me the battery life fell off rapidly and the unit would not hold a charge at all after just 6 months.</li>
            <li>A huge disappointment would be an accurate way to describe my feelings about this hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Recommended, unless you wear your beard at lengths less than a two weeks&#x27; worth of growth.</li>
            <li>The first time he used it, the charge did not last long at all.</li>
            <li>The item cuts my skin, I cannot use it directly to get a close enough shave or it grabs the skin or cuts it directly.</li>
            <li>I bought him a cheap one a few years back</li>
            <li>The smaller clipper head has a much lower adapter, but only works on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time with the full battery charge of approximately 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>I tried every attachment blade on various areas of my frame and was very surprised with the ease of changing and cleaning each under running water.</li>
            <li>Not like most heavy duty combs and as I was using the long one you see on the left in the picture, it came apart fell off the blade and made me look like I had mange.</li>
            <li>But nothing major.</li>
            <li>I later came back to it for another shave, expecting it to work just fine and half way through it lost power.</li>
            <li>But i like the little attachments, they are all useful to him.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to cut my hair on my head with it and it seemed like my beard was to tough for it also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bald guy and wanted to use this for haircuts and general trimming - seemed like that was its purpose.  </li>
            <li>Guys (or girls, apparently) who want to trim areas besides their face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it will just barely hold a charge now.  </li>
            <li>I purchased an old Remington 7 years ago and it finally broke (wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge).</li>
            <li>I purchased the Wahl because it was the closest thing to a match of my ten year old Remington.</li>
            <li>The body recently cracked near the shaver head attachment area.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product a couple of times, but have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I am, 8 months later and unless I use it immediately after a charge, the battery drains completely before I get a chance to use</li>
            <li>Battery barely holds a charge.</li>
            <li>, I normally like a #1 cut on the head and this trimmer does not have a setting that goes low enough.  </li>
            <li>well its a foil razer (I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m biased here, I hate foil razers) but it seems to be pretty good quality like the rest of the tool.</li>
            <li>(although there is some assembly required, a little pressure here and there to get the charger set right) and a spot for all the attachments to keep things organized.</li>
            <li>main issues with the combs is their limited adjustability;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you set it higher, as soon as it meets any resistance, like when sliding on skin, it clicks down to the lowest</li>
            <li>battery is pretty small, judging for the weight, so it needs to live on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the last several months, output was weaker than when new, even when fully charged.(It never has been a powerhouse.)</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer 2 times coz the first time I ordered it it broke in less than 4 days</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The ear/nose trimmer hurt me (not a slight itch, I actually bled) twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sadly all I did was waste my money, like I said this Remington seemed like a real nice kit, but just doesn&#x27;t cut short enough.</li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon thinking it was the normal fair price I am used to, but I was shocked when I found the same kit for $24.99 at a brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li>The other attachments including the foil razor worked very well</li>
            <li>The old Remington body and clippers were all metal and built to last, this appears to be built for display purposes only.</li>
            <li>Like really buzz it SHORT, military buzz.</li>
            <li>I spent decent money on this</li>
            <li>Good item, works well, wish the base recesses were slightly deeper as the various parts fall off a bit too easily.  </li>
            <li>This thing would be the death of a lumberjack, considering how much of an annoyance it is to the average man.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I rate it as a buy, just barely because of the design flaws.  </li>
            <li>I have 2 days worth of stubble on my neck (usually have a trimmed beard or goatee on my face).  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s the best trademark for personal use).&lt;br /&gt;Because of the negative commentaries posted here, I was afraid of buying this one.</li>
            <li>Virtually every need you can imagine in personal grooming is included in this package whether it&#x27;s for beard trimming, hair cutting and trimming, nasal hair removal, those hard to reach hairs on the top and inside the ears and for those more personal areas that require some cleaning up as well.</li>
            <li>Also the main head that is on it in the picture right now behind</li>
            <li>The body hair comb is more of a gimmic, you can get by with a normal hair cutting attachment.</li>
            <li>Loses battery life quickly; I have to pre-charge it for awhile each time or else</li>
            <li>The plastic on the clippers is paper thin and it just literally fell apart, it felt like a strong cough directed towards the plastic would break it.</li>
            <li>this trimmer cannot hold a charge for more than 5 minutes, less if you have a thick beard.</li>
            <li>One of the items fell down when I opened the box and broke right away, they are not very sturdy at all.</li>
            <li>Whereas my old Wahl had an attachment with 7 different length options, this one had half of that and was almost completely ineffective.</li>

            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> Aside from that the kit came with everything listed and would have been a great kit if it just cut shorter.</li>
            <li> It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great Razor / Trimmer ...</li>
            <li> The razor itself isn&#x27;t even that great.</li>
            <li> Try to one-hand it out of the charger, and parts fly everywhere.</li>
            <li> life isnt that great.</li>
            <li> A LOT OF ATTACHMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;I am not too happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> I like it, I had been using a corded clipper, but this is great.</li>
            <li> LOOKS GREAT HOPE</li>
            <li> It is great to use for a body trimmer and a beard trimmer too</li>
            <li> This is a great grooming kit.  </li>
            <li> The close trimmer works great and gets as close as you need without a razor.</li>
            <li> They were great.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice system but the design of the combs could be better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why this vertical blade is so amazing!</li>
            <li> It has to many pieces but was the best thing we could find.  </li>
            <li> The trimmers are great, and the additional slip on combs are good too.  </li>
            <li> It is ok, not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome find so glad I purchased from you at a amazing price.  </li>
            <li> Both worked fairly well for about 1 1/2 yr.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at this for a while now looking for a good price.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li> does a good job.</li>
            <li> It was in good condition, but I kept having issues with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything good to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Good price for the product.</li>
            <li> one seems to be identically good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is as good as any out there.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re about to read a lot of these reviews trying to figure out whether this is any good or not.</li>
            <li> Remington makes good men&#x27;s grooming products.  </li>
            <li> However, my son says it works good.  </li>
            <li> but I have never had a good trim since using it either.</li>
            <li> The price was also a good value.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I purchased this kit trying to find a good grooming kit for trimming neck, ears, sideburns, face, etc.</li>
            <li> it starts to not shave as good if not at all</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how good it was</li>
            <li> Oh good times.</li>
            <li> I had good luck with that one, so I decided to give Remington another shot with my trimmer.  </li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;ve always given it a good trim using a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good product, cuts well.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Good for men and women as well.</li>
            <li> Good for legs.</li>
            <li> Good for a man with a beard</li>
            <li> Has lot Of bells and whistles but some of them are not that good.</li>
            <li> Good wouldn&#x27;t try to cut your hea?d hair but good for body hair</li>
            <li> My bf loved this for his birthday.</li>
            <li> and I loved.</li>
            <li> This is a product I will share with my beautiful spouse because her comfort is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Trims great and all the attachments make the job easy!</li>
            <li> Excellent item ,I&#x27;ve received excellent item for a low price</li>
            <li> The packaging was very attractive and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Husband was Happy, Happy, Happy to get this for Christmas and likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Run time is fine,and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> A very interesting set.</li>
            <li> Nice product, good power.</li>
            <li> To us, they took a Huge Step Backwards by doing that!!  </li>
            <li> I love this one!</li>
            <li> I must say that I am very impressed with how well Remington worked to correct a relatively minor problem with an otherwise very good grooming kit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s did an amazing job and lasted for 7 years before the head cracked when I dropped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was working amazing then broke within a month of purchase</li>
            <li> The primary trimmers are great.  </li>
            <li> but for the money it is a nice groomer.</li>
            <li> Both trimmer heads work nicely as do the adjustable comb attachments.</li>
            <li> The vertical groomer is a nice accessory... if it would work.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, what did they use in testing?  </li>
            <li> Body hair trimmer is nice.  </li>
            <li> I liked what I read.</li>
            <li> Real happy with the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy another kind.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain in the...</li>
            <li> so he now takes a liking in making himself look nice.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> The body outer shell is plastic and has a nice look and feel.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses his to trim his mustache and it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> handy....  </li>
            <li> Would have been nice if Remington would have put a bag that holds all components for travel etc..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice trimmer/cutter, works well</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would be a great full body shaver.  </li>
            <li> got this for my fianc√©e, he&#x27;s been saying he needs a new one for a while, perfect Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> But they are very easily knocked out of the display cradle that can function as a charging stand.</li>
            <li> The razor works good after using the fine trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best ball shaving attachment I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The motor on this is strong and lasts for days!</li>
            <li> The shave is all plasic and very light weight.</li>
            <li> Very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> It probably was, but I still regret buying it without doing the research to find a better model.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would be able to handle my beard and cut my head.</li>
            <li> I guess it is ok</li>
            <li> hes going to love it.. got all the tips and so on..its for xmas</li>
            <li> but there are many increments.  </li>
            <li> The nose/ear trimmer is okay</li>
            <li> When I tried to change heads by twisting off and on even more plastic fell off.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a wahl, much better.</li>
            <li> It sounded like it was clipping hairs, but it sure didn&#x27;t change how my neck stubble looked.  </li>
            <li> I know he&#x27;s gonna love it like I do.</li>
            <li> I use almost all attachments at some point, but mostly the comb attachments &amp; trimmer combo for my goatee.  </li>
            <li> This is SO much more nicer and better, minds blew.</li>
            <li> There are more accessories than I thought.</li>
            <li> I Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> After a while I was able to disassemble it and to make it working</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know of too many ways to shave excess body hair.</li>
            <li> More attachments than I will ever use.</li>
            <li> and I thought to give it one more chance</li>
            <li> For the price, there ought to be more attachments though.</li>
            <li> Amazon was easier, but maybe not cheaper, than just getting it at the store, but I was ok with having everything arrive at once.</li>
            <li> Meh, it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> and it worked much better.</li>
            <li> I saw what I thought was going to be and even better product to replace</li>
            <li> ALL the attachments are more than functional, but the one attachment is the difference maker.</li>
            <li> Clipper works ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still able to use it, but there&#x27;s an adjustable part that I have to hold in place now while I shave.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> sure not a head to toe groomer.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even touching my hair.</li>
            <li> I have never had so many cuts and scrapes from a trimmer.</li>
            <li> A top of the line product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Enjoy my friends!</li>
            <li> Wish it felt more substantial and sturdier.</li>
            <li> Be sure to test somewhere</li>
            <li> Or, were you hope that I would elaborate?</li>
            <li> After reviewing many of the grooming units on Amazon</li>
            <li> I am exceedingly pleased that I chose this Remington PG520B.  </li>
            <li> but glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> It has more attachments than any I have seen.</li>
            <li> me start by saying I love the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> This is better, with improved cutter head designs.</li>
            <li> For this price, I doubt there is a better grooming kit at twice the price.</li>
            <li> Battery is starting to go but when charged it works great and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> This grooming kit does everything you could possibly think of and does it excellent.  </li>
            <li> Am glad I decided to go with the Remington because of the quality of it and everything it can do, they thought of everything, and head to toe as they claim.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> There are so many attachments and ways to use the Remington Grooming Kit.</li>
            <li> He used it and said it works okay.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very powerful to begin with but the attachments are nice.</li>
            <li> The best part of the kit is the long comb looking attachment.  </li>
            <li> My first which I absolutely loved was</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to discover the best trademark of eletronic shavers (I have already tried Phillips, Gillete, etc.)</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned in a long time!</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a very long charge but it is perfect for my husband.</li>
            <li> Lots of attachments and overall seems to be very good quality.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product close close shaver alone is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> As far as functionality goes, this is definitely a great product.  </li>
            <li> Wow what a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for someone; so far he says it works great</li>
            <li> Though the top blades are of plastic, they fit snug and cut well.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been really happy with how compact it is and all the attachments.</li>
            <li> Great for grooming sensitive areas and keenly your man&#x27;s hair trimmed.</li>
            <li> There could be a better way to secure all the parts.  </li>
            <li> If you really want to look good and want a precision length  or have a lot of time to play with this</li>
            <li> Works very well, good grooming tools.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of good attachments and doesn&#x27;t take too much counter space.</li>
            <li> The batter holds adequate charge and it is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> This new Remington Body Grooming Kit is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Best used without the guide, but be careful!</li>
            <li> The nose/ear trimmer will easily cut you.</li>
            <li> Aesthetics: 5 stars, easily.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rest easily on the charging station, you have to apply some force to lock it in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> This will cut your hair, but it won&#x27;t shave as close or as easily as you&#x27;re hoping.</li>
            <li> Easy to control.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> and the manufacturer has easy to order replacement parts and accessories.</li>
            <li> I have went through tons of miniture grooming clippers and they all break so easily.</li>
            <li> trims nicely and good enough battery life per charge.</li>
            <li> The body hair trimmer is not that strong it seems to lose strength</li>
            <li> Works AWESOME and has all the right attachments for longer facial hair to a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Other wise it is a good trimmer</li>
            <li> I had an electric Lady Remington before, but it was no where near as effective as this razor!</li>
            <li> I played with the seating of the heads, because it seems to run fine without them on.  </li>
            <li> Blades work fine</li>
            <li> However it works just fine.</li>
            <li> The Remington PG520B is fine for grooming, but all the parts just flip/flop around in the holder.  </li>
            <li> This item worked fine when it worked..</li>
            <li> This product was fine at the outset.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> Very complete with a good price.</li>
            <li> easy to use and travel with, a lot of accessories that I dont really use but come in handy every once in a while.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, have tried others and they do not compare, would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> It seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Does not produce a blended or smooth trim.</li>
            <li> -- It feels cheap.    </li>
            <li> The product looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This was a great present for my b/f</li>
            <li> Felt a bit cheap when I got it.</li>
            <li> Cheap is the word.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Design is modern / nice.</li>
            <li> Removable plastic makes it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> really light and cheap...doesn&#x27;t cut anything...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and does what it&#x27;s supposed to without tugging on hairs.</li>
            <li> The components lightly clicked in.</li>
            <li> This one is very similar and works great.  </li>
            <li> Adding to my frustration is the fact that once I got the Wahl out of the box and discovered how cheap it was I decided to return it.</li>
            <li> In the picture it appeared that this is what I was purchasing when in fact it was identical to the Wahl which has a cheap plastic base(no weight to it) and the cord plugs into the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> Made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> Appears to be well built and the various attachments seem as though ithey will provide a great deal of versatility.</li>
            <li> As for the combs they are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> It also has a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li> stand is a fantastic idea and the way the cord is integrated into it</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was cheap (elaboration below) and it functioned.</li>
            <li> Seems like the primary job of clippers is to cut hair.</li>
            <li> charge light is always amber.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a charge light, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;I&#x27;m plugged in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and lightweight.</li>
            <li> As soon as the package arrived I charged it up and got a complete haircut from my neighbor who loved using the Remington</li>
            <li> With the right attachments, you can safely use this to shave ANYWHERE without any mishaps.</li>
            <li> This thing will cut hair ok, but I find most of the attachments don&#x27;t work particularly well, and are all flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> Very handy and enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li> Motor is very powerful and hold a charge well.  </li>
            <li> The blades are very precise and the ergonomically designed body makes for a comfortable fit in my large hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told it is great for ears and noses by someone far less attractive.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to switch attachments and works as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Best it can do is maybe a #2 or #3, and that is with the small trimmer head on.  </li>
            <li> The unique angle of the body shaving attachment compliments the contouring required when shaving below the belt.</li>
            <li> recently cropped my hair short, and wanted to be able to maintain it, and the vertical attachment with the comb is perfect!  </li>
            <li> Product has a lot of useful attachments, some of which I haven&#x27;t even used yet!</li>
            <li> This hair grooming set is much better than the first Remington set.  </li>
            <li> works great and keep a charge for a long time, says my brother in law.</li>
            <li> And tonight I tried to trim off my goatee, since I need to be clean shaven for an appointment tomorrow morning.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good and the attachment method is simple and secure.</li>
            <li> Just clean it and oil it every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Overall a great and useful product.</li>
            <li> and so do I because he keeps himself clean cut and shaved.</li>
            <li> It has worked great and well worth it if you can grow  facial hair!!!</li>
            <li> He really enjoys it and it is good for a very close shave</li>
            <li> 6,99 is also the most positive of another $ 7me at:</li>
            <li> nothing special....</li>
            <li> That thing almost seems like it&#x27;s going to buzz right off the handle!</li>
            <li> I was optimistic at first buying a Remington Razor but after such great reviews of this product I gave in and bought it.  </li>
            <li> At it&#x27;s closest setting, #1, the comb is 1/4&amp;#34; in front of and a full 1/2&amp;#34; below the cutter blades, at it&#x27;s longest setting, #10, the comb is 7/8&amp;#34; in front of and 7/8&amp;#34; below the cutter blades.</li>
            <li> Good product at a low price.</li>
            <li> versatility is superior to any similar product that I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using a 2 guard on the Wahl for my bear and the only thing this is good for is neck and beard lines.  </li>
            <li> Overall this was a good bang for my buck</li>
            <li> cool but battery</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, if you&#x27;ve made it this far into the review, you might want to take a quick look inward.</li>
            <li> The blades on all the attachments are crisp and strong (they never tug).</li>
            <li> later found out it would be a better use of time to try to chew my own hair off first.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more to get a good device.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly!   </li>
            <li> /&gt;-The battery wont last for 35 minutes on a charge, the best you can get is maybe 15, and it is not even enough to get your beard</li>
            <li> Way too many attachments, no human could have this many hair requirements.</li>
            <li> It does lose power fairly quick but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived quickly and well</li>
            <li> However it got older (more than 8 years), and the battery wasn&#x27;t recharging well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Back to Norelco for me, the $15 all in one works much better and has a lot more adjustments.</li>
            <li> The fine trimmer blade cuts extremely close and the larger trimmer is the perfect length for my goatee.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and easy to use - very reasonably priced and well-constructed!</li>
            <li> quickly.the big beard trimmer is pretty good and does what you would expect.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most razors</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Head-to-Toe&#x27; name is a tad ambitious (12-15 sq ft!).  </li>
            <li> The shaver is great, quite, lightweight, and powerful, just until you get to what I believe is half battery</li>
            <li> The power switch is positive and it stays on and has a good solid click to it when turning it off.</li>
            <li> I certainly felt comfortable with my product selection from the visuals, the brand</li>
            <li> the good side, the vertical body groomer is really comfortable and easy to use, but then again, your body hair will show even if you just groomed it, it does not cut it short enough.</li>
            <li> Alright, so I had some cheap grooming kit that I absolutely ran into the ground.</li>
            <li> The beard and facial trimmers are amazing, the body trimmer is a godsend, the clippers are a must-have, and the foil razer is...</li>
            <li> The motor even when fully charged doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s got much &#x27;oomph&#x27;</li>
            <li> What kind of clipper can&#x27;t cut through a standard bit of goatee on a man&#x27;s chin?  </li>
            <li> when I first tried to use it, the battery lasted a full 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase I made for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this set up.  </li>
            <li> On my old Phillips Norelco trimmer I set my hair and facial hair at a 3 and was always happy.</li>
            <li> hooked up and in use at the same time which would of been really handy</li>
            <li> But it was the \\&quot;body\\&quot;, or vertical trimmer that surprised me most of all.</li>
            <li> Works okay the best at cutting or trimming.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> Works very well, the attachments are very useful and it gives a close trim, all over the body.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> The shaver is ergonomically pleasing, versatile and easy to change attachments, easy to use on various areas of the anatomy</li>
            <li> It was like that right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned 15 minutes; I haven&#x27;t timed it, but that sounds about right.  </li>
            <li> construction feels \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, but the price is right and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> It really helps keep a clean look.  </li>
            <li> but if you want something quick and easy its not worth the money and this is neither quick nor easy.</li>
            <li> A more solid stand with a snugger fit for the attachments would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad product with some good general use accessories.</li>
            <li> This grooming kit is so easy to use, easy to change heads, and it holds it charge for very long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> However, I would suggest spending a few more dollars and buying a better quality electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> This Remington shaver is quite nice, it&#x27;s quiet, and really gives me a close shave around my goatee.  </li>
            <li> Simply the BEST shaving system in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> Other than than, very pleased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good but a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> I like the small size and great fit, would appreciate a little bit more of a battery life though.</li>
            <li> Thanks Remington for renewing my faith in your company!   </li>
            <li> Within the first couple months of owning this kit, the battery would no longer hold a charge, or some of the attachments wouldn&#x27;t work at all even when the battery was fully charged.</li>
            <li> The blades on the trimmer attachments did pretty well at first (first 2-3 months?).  </li>
            <li> The battery does not last more than about 15 minutes.    </li>
            <li> This is the first time I took it off its stand and tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sending a lovely letter of gratitude to Remington... and will be purchasing a Wahl trimmer again shortly.  </li>
            <li> Earlier versions of this shaver were great, you only had to replace the blades, not the whole thing.</li>
            <li> If this is a faulty unit, I&#x27;d love an exchange to try a different one, but no, screwed.</li>
            <li> Many different attachments.</li>
            <li> Last year we purchased two of these trimmers for $30 and we love them.  </li>
            <li> I just finished trying to trim his beard and neaten up his haircut and the thing did not last more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> He likes it better than the last one he had</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering tearing into the machine and replacing the battery with a higher grade of battery.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s body isn&#x27;t very hairy so that aspect of the product isn&#x27;t really useful for him</li>
            <li> The makers have tried their best to put out a quality product, the only thing is they overlooked one small part.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My last trimmer was AA battery powered, had more power, and lasted over 10 years.</li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it it died halfway through</li>
            <li> Love the price and we have an more expensive one and this is the favorite.</li>
            <li> The only thing i would improve is to add more sizes.</li>
            <li> The guards do not stay in place so you cannot get a consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> What could I possibly say more?</li>
            <li> this item was exactly what i needed and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works very well !</li>
            <li> On my first go I charged it up all the way, used it, then put it away.</li>
            <li> The adapter is way too tall to be useful for much of anything.</li>
            <li> This arrived to me promptly and worked fairly well for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> no small brush included to clean the unit.</li>
            <li> The product works great to shave  small spaces!</li>
            <li> The other attachments are also handy for doing touch ups when needed.</li>
            <li> in practical use, for me, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I only used it for &#x27;personal grooming&#x27;, meaning on occassion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually cut myself with the trimmer a couple times trying to shape (my fault entirely) but that&#x27;s how good</li>
            <li> It does a great job trimming overly long arm and leg hair to a normal length, I&#x27;d buy it if you want to manscape your gorilla back and</li>
            <li> I was pleased with how well it worked and how long it lasted</li>
            <li> I had expected more, such as trimmers in more sizes.</li>
            <li> Replaced with a trimmer made by Wahl, 9818 model, long standby life, plenty more attachments.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty flimsy, but for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much...</li>
            <li> This razor allowed me to trim down to the length I desired and create a nice design.</li>
            <li> I have less hair than I used to and now cut (buzz) my own.  </li>
            <li> If you do not have a large vanity or drawer to stow</li>
            <li> but it is far superior to the remington product for less money</li>
            <li> you try to groom your beard with this, on one hand you will get a one day beard at the best (so if its been one day since you last shaved, dont even bother) and, on the other hand, it will take you forever, because that accesory is not even one inch wide (the pictures are misleading) and you need to go through the same area several times (to get a one-day beard, thats as good as it gets..</li>
            <li> I really like the body clipper, and the nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I picked this up in a StuffMart because I wanted one fast and this sounded like the best/most flexible option.  </li>
            <li> The depth combs are very shintzy</li>
            <li> The unit operates really well.</li>
            <li> Everyone has plastic pieces, but if the attachments are meant to fit together, there should be no problem if handled properly.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten this as a birthday gift for my husband and it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It otherwise sat on the sinktop taking up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> That is almost 30% of the cost of the entire system to replace a cheap piece of plastic, one of five attachments.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys</li>
            <li> I really recommend this Remington pg520 a b c d</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but I got my money worth so far....  </li>
            <li> and it just didn&#x27;t trim his hair very well.</li>
            <li> This product really did surprise me.</li>
            <li> And really does well ALL over the body.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t care much about the foil shaver I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll just have to buy a wired one to really &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see how on earth they would put this product out.</li>
            <li> but I really like the range of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The point is, the option is there and it is very enticing...</li>
            <li> One reviewer found it very helpful in genital areas.</li>
            <li> What lady wants a bunch of hairs getting in the way?  </li>
            <li> Of note, this can be used for very close grooming as it has an attachment for that.</li>
            <li> The vertical orientation of the trimming head makes the ergonomics of ball shaving much easier, not to mention how close the blade trims!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really like it.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made, does not work as it should, had to send it back.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is unusable because of the battery.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves the attachments, takes care of all of his needs.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he really likes it</li>
            <li> The battery goes through a charge FAST but takes a while to charge up.</li>
            <li> It is a very well made unit and does all that I require with ease of operation.  </li>
            <li> It should be noted that even when the battery was &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; it didn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I give this a 2 instead of a 1 is because it is cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every make and model of electric shaver on the market over the past 32 years and this is by far the most versatile, easy to use system out there.</li>
            <li> If you google my old model number you will see right away the differences.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> (\\&quot;Narrow\\&quot; works pretty well around the mouth, for instance, but it would take too long on the rest of my full beard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> No proper clean out of the attachments or body;</li>
            <li> They give you a nice long cord, suggesting this might be possible, but when you turn the razor on it stops charging and runs off the battery.</li>
            <li> The long clipper is very useful, but it does pinch the skin, in intimate areas.  </li>
            <li> The straight-line trimmer is sufficient for minor trimming but the ear/nose hair trimmer is not sharp enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly durable nor strong, and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised on my first use.</li>
            <li> This is so worth buying no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> everything works fine so far but the trimmer for the face only cuts in one direction or else it cuts tour face all up.</li>
            <li> Overall it has served me fairly well, however I do wish the trimmer cut a little finer around the neck areas.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a new person!</li>
            <li> Just like brushing your hair to keep an even length without the awkwardness of using a traditional horizontal clipper, and without the comb, it&#x27;s great for gettting around the ears and back of the neck as wel as other parts of the body.  </li>
            <li> The set is less than OK.</li>
            <li> My previous groomer of many years had a cover over everything.</li>
            <li> My facial bumps were everywhere with my old shaver and now my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> This razor is a decent buy for the money.  </li>
            <li> My fiance has had a older cheaper one for yeeaars and uses the fire out of it.</li>
            <li> I mainly use mine for the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> But one of the main reasons I bought it was to use it to buzz my hair, which I do about once a week.</li>
            <li> However, after several months you will be lucky getting through a hair cut before the battery dies.</li>
            <li> Like with most electric shavers, you will be satisfied, but not impressed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace to replace my older Wahl trimmer thinking it would be an upgrade.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older trimmer I had.</li>
            <li> It is a clever design and well made.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality does seem to be high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this grooming kit.</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to remove the heads to replace with other attachments.</li>
            <li> Anyway, so far he seems to really like it and works like a champ.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s underpowered, the attachments aren&#x27;t useful, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This unit does not hold a charge for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I used the product, it is only worth about $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it acted like it barely had a charge.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and hope it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Most nose trimmers are round, this is a flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the hair is long enough it also feels like it pulls more then it does cut.</li>
            <li> The batteries last as long as I need them to, and everything works as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s supposed to...</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ll await his trial a few more times and update my review.</li>
            <li> Does not hold a charge very long, Good for a few uses per charge.</li>
            <li> Have bought other similar products and some by the same manufacturer, but this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Given the volume of other negative reviews on this product, I feel I&#x27;m better off rolling that $8.00 into a better</li>
            <li> Every time I try to pick up the trimmer on the new unit EVERYTHING falls out of it because it doesn&#x27;t have any weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was like a kid with a new toy</li>
            <li> I switched to one of the other alternative heads, and was able to continue trimming a few more times with each head, but they all suffered the same fate.</li>
            <li> , the rare use meant it usually had no charge when I needed it, so I had to either wait or plan ahead for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> The larger attachment that seems fit for a haircut only cuts at a height of 1&amp;#34; or so.  </li>
            <li> so some heads only fit in specific sockets.</li>
            <li> The main unit and accessories are well made and stand up to frequent use.</li>
            <li> but when it arrived I was very surprised at all the attachments that came with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> What took more than an hour before with wet shaving products is completed in less than ten minutes with a smooth closeness and no nicks or pulling.</li>
            <li> (I usually do a touch-up every couple days, with a more thorough mowing on Saturday morning.  </li>
            <li> First this is smaller</li>
            <li> I wish it had a longer battery life as it&#x27;s pretty short (around 1/2 hour).</li>
            <li> Purchased product to get a more diversified shaving system other than the standard electric razor.  </li>
            <li> is ok - not outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got pretty coarse hair though so cleaning it thoroughly gets a bit tasking.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I had this trimmer for less than 4 months and used it lightly (1-2 times per week).</li>
            <li> Not bad; the main unit is a lot lighter than my previous trimmer, but I&#x27;ve learned to like that about it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a nice compact design, with a decent little stand and appearance, but it does not cut short enough.  </li>
            <li> Device has more than enough attachments to do it all and the unit holds a charge long enough to do so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger and more powerful then those small types and works well with the different attachments allover the body.</li>
            <li> Lots of useful accessories, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap but it should last as my last clipper worked for 7 years so this one should last just as long.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver works okay for tight areas but not to shave your entire face.  </li>
            <li> It now operates at full power for roughly 5 minutes before beginning to losing power and quickly dwindling down to a complete stop.</li>
            <li> Now they seem dull - they don&#x27;t cut as well, and there&#x27;s a lot more pulling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great having an all in one but the main unit is a little weak and doesn&#x27;t have the remington buzz that numbs your arm when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> Steer clear of this product</li>
            <li> old father in law.  </li>
            <li> :  The battery doesn&#x27;t last very well.  </li>
            <li> There are many flaws with this and at least for me I&#x27;m going to have to use barber clipper again</li>
            <li> The one I bought is over a year old and it still works.</li>
            <li> so far it seems like its a quality product and not cheep.</li>
            <li> biggest irritant was paying nearly 2x for what you can get it for at Walmart or a beauty cosmetic store.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver is very inefficient and takes multiple passes to produce marginal results.</li>
            <li> The only two complaints that I have are that the accessories don&#x27;t stay in the storage tray very well,</li>
            <li> I am comparing the PG520 to an old Remington MB40    </li>
            <li> Truth be told, I bought this to replace my Wahl trimmer that was 6 years old.  </li>
            <li> Then plugged in and let it charge completely.  </li>
            <li> This thing is complete junk.  </li>
            <li> I just got this Kit to replace a Norelco shaver that I was using, which was about 18 months old.  </li>
            <li> He is very picky about his groomers, but he loves this entire set.  </li>
            <li> stand is very compact, the accessory sockets however are not all the same shape</li>
            <li> The Vertical Trimmer works very well, but the comb slides on from the end and only has three slots.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used all of the different heads that come with the trimmer</li>
            <li> So far battery life hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li> After using it his cheeks are baby soft.</li>
            <li> so I had to get out my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> I picked up this item because my old Remington PG250 wasn&#x27;t holding a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> No problems so far.</li>
            <li> No problems yet, works as it should and has a pretty long battery life.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that I have only used this razor maybe 5-8 times because I need it very often, and the battery still has already died.</li>
            <li> The other tools work very well, and it certainly has an abundance of those.  </li>
            <li> Wish Remington would put a long lasting higher grade battery the first time out of the Chinese factory !  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:  Lots of different attachments; I particularly like the \\&quot;wide\\&quot; and \\&quot;narrow\\&quot; trimmer heads.  </li>
            <li> Decent grooming kit, except for short beards.  </li>
            <li> Funny thing about that is I only use it for my goatee, eyebrows, back of my neck and armpits.</li>
            <li> I bought and older version of this, which I used mainly to trim my facial hair and, occasionally, problem areas in my hair.</li>
            <li> I surprised at how small and cheap looking the battery is...</li>
            <li> I keep my hair and facial hair pretty short</li>
            <li> The guide is a little on the flimsy side, I use this trimmer to do my initial trimming and then use a different trimmer to actually make things look nice</li>
            <li> I highly regret this purchase and will be going with a different brand.</li>
            <li> It is easy enough to put the other pieces away or give it to my husband who has the same thing.  </li>
            <li> It really stays charge for a long while.</li>
            <li> , the fine trimmer didn&#x27;t work well and the electric razor part is not very good.  </li>
            <li> The large trimmer guide can not be adjusted low enough to use as a body/beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> As others have reported, this trimmer only works marginally when new, and for me the battery life fell off rapidly and the unit would not hold a charge at all after just 6 months.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment would be an accurate way to describe my feelings about this hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Recommended, unless you wear your beard at lengths less than a two weeks&#x27; worth of growth.</li>
            <li> The first time he used it, the charge did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> The item cuts my skin, I cannot use it directly to get a close enough shave or it grabs the skin or cuts it directly.</li>
            <li> I bought him a cheap one a few years back</li>
            <li> The smaller clipper head has a much lower adapter, but only works on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time with the full battery charge of approximately 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried every attachment blade on various areas of my frame and was very surprised with the ease of changing and cleaning each under running water.</li>
            <li> Not like most heavy duty combs and as I was using the long one you see on the left in the picture, it came apart fell off the blade and made me look like I had mange.</li>
            <li> But nothing major.</li>
            <li> I later came back to it for another shave, expecting it to work just fine and half way through it lost power.</li>
            <li> But i like the little attachments, they are all useful to him.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to cut my hair on my head with it and it seemed like my beard was to tough for it also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bald guy and wanted to use this for haircuts and general trimming - seemed like that was its purpose.  </li>
            <li> Guys (or girls, apparently) who want to trim areas besides their face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it will just barely hold a charge now.  </li>
            <li> I purchased an old Remington 7 years ago and it finally broke (wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge).</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wahl because it was the closest thing to a match of my ten year old Remington.</li>
            <li> The body recently cracked near the shaver head attachment area.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a couple of times, but have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I am, 8 months later and unless I use it immediately after a charge, the battery drains completely before I get a chance to use</li>
            <li> Battery barely holds a charge.</li>
            <li> , I normally like a #1 cut on the head and this trimmer does not have a setting that goes low enough.  </li>
            <li> well its a foil razer (I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m biased here, I hate foil razers) but it seems to be pretty good quality like the rest of the tool.</li>
            <li> (although there is some assembly required, a little pressure here and there to get the charger set right) and a spot for all the attachments to keep things organized.</li>
            <li> main issues with the combs is their limited adjustability;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you set it higher, as soon as it meets any resistance, like when sliding on skin, it clicks down to the lowest</li>
            <li> battery is pretty small, judging for the weight, so it needs to live on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the last several months, output was weaker than when new, even when fully charged.(It never has been a powerhouse.)</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer 2 times coz the first time I ordered it it broke in less than 4 days</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The ear/nose trimmer hurt me (not a slight itch, I actually bled) twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly all I did was waste my money, like I said this Remington seemed like a real nice kit, but just doesn&#x27;t cut short enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon thinking it was the normal fair price I am used to, but I was shocked when I found the same kit for $24.99 at a brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li> The other attachments including the foil razor worked very well</li>
            <li> The old Remington body and clippers were all metal and built to last, this appears to be built for display purposes only.</li>
            <li> Like really buzz it SHORT, military buzz.</li>
            <li> I spent decent money on this</li>
            <li> Good item, works well, wish the base recesses were slightly deeper as the various parts fall off a bit too easily.  </li>
            <li> This thing would be the death of a lumberjack, considering how much of an annoyance it is to the average man.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I rate it as a buy, just barely because of the design flaws.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 days worth of stubble on my neck (usually have a trimmed beard or goatee on my face).  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s the best trademark for personal use).&lt;br /&gt;Because of the negative commentaries posted here, I was afraid of buying this one.</li>
            <li> Virtually every need you can imagine in personal grooming is included in this package whether it&#x27;s for beard trimming, hair cutting and trimming, nasal hair removal, those hard to reach hairs on the top and inside the ears and for those more personal areas that require some cleaning up as well.</li>
            <li> Also the main head that is on it in the picture right now behind</li>
            <li> The body hair comb is more of a gimmic, you can get by with a normal hair cutting attachment.</li>
            <li> Loses battery life quickly; I have to pre-charge it for awhile each time or else</li>
            <li> The plastic on the clippers is paper thin and it just literally fell apart, it felt like a strong cough directed towards the plastic would break it.</li>
            <li> this trimmer cannot hold a charge for more than 5 minutes, less if you have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> One of the items fell down when I opened the box and broke right away, they are not very sturdy at all.</li>
            <li> Whereas my old Wahl had an attachment with 7 different length options, this one had half of that and was almost completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> The cheap plastic container tray: doesn&#x27;t just fail to hold the pieces in place, so much as the pieces seem to actively jump out of the tray.</li>
            <li> There is no beard trimmer attachment for the large blade and the attachment for the small blade does not have settings for very short lengths.  </li>
            <li> It is not only small, but also does not shave very close like others he has used over the years.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to actually use.</li>
            <li> It do not cut it down far enough.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the charge does not last very long.</li>
            <li> is my first complaint</li>
            <li> The motor in this thing didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> The charging wont even last 5 minutes on this even after charging for a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery does not last long.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long stopped running</li>
            <li> only thing battery charge is not too long.</li>
            <li> After a year (not frequent use, only charging when fully drained) the battery has a charge for about 10 seconds before I have to charge it again for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> A few days later when I go to turn it on the battery will have drained completely w/o any use.  </li>
            <li> also known as dropped in the toilet while still turned on after our dog burst through the bathroom door and sent the trimmer flying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably return this unit and go back to the Wahl due to the fact it has a stronger and longer lasting lithium ion battery!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little louder than his old one.</li>
            <li> This is the most disappointing shaving kit I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> product itself is disappointing on many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long until the 17mm trimmer cracked the 17mm comb when inserted.</li>
            <li> The larger plastic comb fell apart with minimal pressure.</li>
            <li> But this thing doesn&#x27;t even get remotely close enough.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer shaves too long.  </li>
            <li> The length is too long for my preference, even on the closest setting.</li>
            <li> Cannot attest to long term though.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I switched heads to the detail trimmer and took off the last half, with the same results.  </li>
            <li> Secondly its not very powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The large clippers are vastly underpowered or poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Feels like the rpm is a bit low compared to my other trimmer.</li>
            <li> Compared to my other relatively low quality trimmer purchased 4 years ago, i feel this product is inferior.</li>
            <li> blades are sharp, arrived on time, slightly low standby battery, but</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers mentioned some of the numerous flaws</li>
            <li> , I hope it lasts long!</li>
            <li> This is probably due to the attachment which takes hairs off, which could be described as up close and personal.  </li>
            <li> Have used other products such as Conair</li>
            <li> I had an older model that was going dull.  </li>
            <li> Apparently either I received a defective model, or they didn&#x27;t put a ton of effort into this little kit.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got the dud of the batch, but it left a sour taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Three and a half months later, the body snapped when I was putting on an attachment.</li>
            <li> Although i like the array of accessories, especially the body hair trimmer, I feel this product did not adequately meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I mean, this thing was falling apart by the time I looked to get a new one.</li>
            <li> only have a few uses the housing on the shaver where you attach the attachments broke, so the attachments will not stay connected and come loose.</li>
            <li> I took it out and set everything up in the little tray and left it charging for a couple days.  </li>
            <li> This was a huge disappointment after having a Remington that lasted for 5 or 6 years.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> After the 3rd week however, the battery would not hold a charge and I could not get through my grooming without having to recharge the battery at least once in the middle of it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the various heads do not stay in the stand.  </li>
            <li> Only have had it for a few days but</li>
            <li> It works for that day and is dead the next morning!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> If your hair was standing straight up, which it seldom does, they would cut at approximately 1/8&amp;#34;, 1/4&amp;#34;, and 3/8&amp;#34; when held perpendicular to the skin.</li>
            <li> (although I did only use it for a few minutes a day).</li>
            <li> so I can shave the inside of the dog&#x27;s ears carefully to avoid poodle  ear infections from overgrown hair.</li>
            <li> Spent a year and all.</li>
            <li> Just be careful.  </li>
            <li> Pink  </li>
            <li> yes, its pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very hairy</li>
            <li> The smaller attachments seem to also have a very hard time cutting hair, and my hair is not thick or strong so I am not sure what the problem is.</li>
            <li> Not a strong cut; had to go over same area 3√ó to get results.</li>
            <li> I previously had a $10 Conair trimmer that ran on C batterys that outperformed this POS all day long.</li>
            <li> She went to the extreme to remedy the problem for me.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews are correct.  </li>
            <li> Buy any other trimmer but this one.</li>
            <li> What they did was add a tab on the bottom of the stand that holds the Mini RCA jack at the end of the charging unit in place, so you must hold the stand with your other hand and use sufficient force when removing/replacing the power handle.</li>
            <li> Have not had any issues like other reviews.  </li>
            <li> No matter what you buy it is still a sharp object you are using there.</li>
            <li> AND ALL OF THE OTHER MODELS THAT I HAVE SEEN ARE ALL RECHARGABLES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other attachments are also well suited for their purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Remington Head To Toe Chargeable Body Grooming Kit gets three stars due to the convenience of some of the tools.  </li>
            <li> A few spots of blood from nicked skin with the long attachment.  </li>
            <li> The facial trimmer is too small to be usable.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something with perhaps the vigorousness of my other electric face razor&#x27;s beart trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have mentioned, the battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> In other words, they don&#x27;t cut hair without a lot of work.</li>
            <li> This device cuts my hair, trims my mustache, grooms hair in other places - nose, ears,etc.  </li>
            <li> After having this for a few months the battery decided to stop holding a charge long term so now if I charge it for an hour or two the battery will run out within seconds when attempting to trim.</li>
            <li> This is my only complaint and it is minor, but between all the parts and a cheesy plastic stand, it really adds to sink clutter.</li>
            <li> The motor is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last long, I had to make several passes to remove the hair, to the point it was causing scratches on my skin.</li>
            <li> Powerful cutting.</li>
            <li> The vertical trimmer head has a guide with a convex curve to it, making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> His only complaint is the noise.</li>
            <li> Attachments are flimsy and not worth the money</li>
            <li> Alas, it came time to part with the old friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped my stars down to 1.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the insert and let it run completely down.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to put it down the day I got it.  </li>
            <li> Thank you!*I have to pay you only $ 30 and not more!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once a week or every other week for a little while now.</li>
            <li> The blade is too sharp to be holding to your privates!</li>
            <li> THE LITTLE TINY ARROWS ARE HARD TO SEE AN FIND.</li>
            <li> It might last a little longer if you only use the nose hair attachment but other than that it is useless for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> in less than one week after my review, I was contacted by Roseann Baerwolf with Remington offering to do what they could to improve my situation.  </li>
            <li> I paid over $100 for this and it became a paper weight in less than 4 months.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for less plastic</li>
            <li> I have since already replaced it with a kit that is also a Remington set, for half the price, and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> -- One can not use the trimmer with the power cord; once it&#x27;s turned on, it stops charging (see previous point).    </li>
            <li> This replaced my previous grooming kit</li>
            <li> All in less than a year&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had it less than a year</li>
            <li> The 17mm trimmer has an adjustable curved tip comb that extends out in front of the cutter blade by less than 1/32&amp;#34; at the #1 setting to about 1/4&amp;#34; at the #5 setting and is between 3/32&amp;#34; at  #1 and 3/16&amp;#34; at #5 below the cutter blades.</li>
            <li> Even fully charged the battery lasts less than a minute.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my son who is away at college when a previous grooming kit broke.  </li>
            <li> I got less than 2 years use out of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had 2 of the previous one (PG250) Both lasted 4 to 5 years until the battery died.</li>
            <li> The breaks occurred from just merely removing an attachment and placing an attachment on the main unit.  </li>
            <li> No good for me, sending it back to Remington.</li>
            <li> Its kinda small so be careful when opening the box.</li>
            <li> I was not using excessive force and was careful.  </li>
            <li> There seemed to be a lot of uneven trimming and on a few occasions I was forced to shave my beard off entirely because it looked too patchy.</li>
            <li> one again this whole thing sucked weak motored, head way too small, dull blades, doesn&#x27;t hold a charge and pulls face hair</li>
            <li> It feels cheaply made and now that I&#x27;ve used it for a little while I am extremely disappointed and do not think I&#x27;ll purchase anything else from Remington again.</li>
            <li> The little shaver attachment did nothing.  </li>
            <li> It would clip a little, then get stuck... pulling the hair in the process.  </li>
            <li> Has a little weight to it</li>
            <li> My husband loves this little grooming station.  </li>
            <li> Uneven cutting, multiple passes, and an easily clogged cutting guide.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I expected to last for years, Silly me...</li>
            <li> so every time it gets bumped, a few of the pieces fall out.</li>
            <li> After owning this item for maybe 2 weeks, I can honestly say this is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> so I will fill it up and use it for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> If I keep it plugged in, it will run for about 1 1/2 minutes before going dead.</li>
            <li> Battery lasted about a month and now unless it is plugged in all the time it will go dead just sitting there.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Charging base is on the cheap side and a bit of a pain to put together functional.</li>
            <li> it leaves behind hairs of wildly different lengths.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fall apart in my hands, but after a few months of use I was in the middle of cutting my hair when the trimmer suddenly stopped trimming.</li>
            <li> all attachments do not fit well - things fall out if you try to move the unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every time I reach for it the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> waste your time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that comes with a stand.</li>
            <li> Battery lost its ability to charge after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The only con is the base doesn&#x27;t hold the parts very well.</li>
            <li> no fine brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the less expensive option.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s impossible to get a consistent length on the area you are trimming, and it&#x27;s to small and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Today I tried to use it after the usual 2 hour charge and it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can‚Äôt send it back because I had to literally destroy the package</li>
            <li> At the beginning the battery lasted at least half an hour.</li>
            <li> This little guy runs circles around the ones they design for women!</li>
            <li> Other than that, there&#x27;s not much good about</li>
            <li> One of the plastic clippers broke after very little use (about a month of sporadic use).</li>
            <li> Mine broke after about a month, with very little use.</li>
            <li> Only very weak battery.</li>
            <li> Was tired of asking barbers for half price since I have half a head of hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it needs all the interchangeable heads</li>
            <li> and I was not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Having used the PG240 for the past years I purchased this one and found it lacks quality, they did away with the ergonomic hold</li>
            <li> Remington should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a useless device into the market.  </li>
            <li> you usually get what you pay for and I should&#x27;ve known that before I ordered</li>
            <li> Hopefully you don‚Äôt even have a small beard because this thing cannot trim it.</li>
            <li> I usually cut my hair with a Wahl trimmer with a 1 guard and then used to trim my beard with a Norelco that was the Equivalent of a 2 guard on the Wahl.  </li>
            <li> The attachment for private areas is so small it is useless.  </li>
            <li> With the horizontal head placement, some of the peaks and valleys in the male mid-section could make the terrain a bit difficult to tackle.</li>
            <li> Ultimately nothing wrong with the product... but a small gripe.</li>
            <li> The small trimmer attachment and guide can, but the way it&#x27;s designed</li>
            <li> this new Remington PG520B is disappointment to say the least.</li>
            <li> not a very good trimmer</li>
            <li> Remington needs to know that they have taken a major step in the wrong direction!</li>
            <li> Notice both of those are in the past tense.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works well, however, some of the attachments are flimsy and I had a hard time setting the adjustments and keeping them attached to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t click into the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position, I must push hard and hold the switch to make it work.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused on how to switch the blades.</li>
            <li> In trying to help with keeping the main base from breaking I placed a small amount of Vaseline to ease it together.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the base is a little flimsy but the old one was too, and its not a problem.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t pull your hair, but the battery life sucks.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago I had to plug the charger in for at least 2 hours to get a 10min trim before the battery died.</li>
            <li> Too bad I dropped it a few times and it finally broke.</li>
            <li> CHEAP CHINA CRAP!</li>
            <li> and sucks</li>
            <li> It also has poor cutting action even when it is charged.</li>
            <li> something else or at least get a corded (not battery operated) model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has become almost worthless unless I plan my trims very precisely.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> Since they were both nicad powered, I would use it until it got slow, then plug it in rather than keep it on the charger.</li>
            <li> I think it is mean to pluck the poodles&#x27;s hair from the ears</li>
            <li> When Remington says \\&quot;Head to Toe Body Grooming Kit\\&quot;, they mean it...</li>
            <li> try to put it back without holding the base down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious, as I was trimming my beard the plastic handle was falling apart.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the limited accessories that came with this grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Specifically, my old MB-900 had a solid (heavy) base which acted as a charging cradle (i.e.; the plug plugged into the base and not the trimmer).</li>
            <li> The supporting base is of very poor quality and when one of the attachments is seated on the main unit, part of seating base breaks off.  </li>
            <li> I even downloaded the user manual to confirm that the charging base acted as a cradle like my old one.</li>
            <li> Complete crap.</li>
            <li> Totally sucks!</li>
            <li> and it still sucks!</li>
            <li> TIRED OF BATTERIES, OR WEAK CHARGE.</li>
            <li> Poor material used in construction makes this a poor product.</li>
            <li> but it was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> You must put the standard DC charger prong through the bottom of the base and click the motor on to it.</li>
            <li> All of these items tucking neatly into this solid charging base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with product.</li>
            <li> Every time you bump the base the various heads fall all over the counter.  </li>
            <li> I have managed to keep using it, even with the base partially broken in different places.  </li>
            <li> Never held a charge for very long and now it holds no charge :-(</li>
            <li> then I expected and the parts don&#x27;t click in to the base</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst trimmer I have EVER seen.</li>
            <li> Using the stand as a charging base is not very convenient as it requires sufficient force to insertion/removal the mini RCA jack when removing or replacing the power handle.</li>
            <li> Also, each time you touch the base, to hold it down or for any other reason (don&#x27;t try to slide it over either) - all of the components (they don&#x27;t snap on to the base - they just sit) fall all over your counter, into the sink, onto the floor, etc.</li>
            <li> Try to pick it up without holding the base down.</li>
            <li> -- Its output is very weak.    </li>
            <li> It can not be used while plugged in, so it is useless.</li>
            <li> The height adjust on the combs is sort of difficult to move</li>
            <li> The shaver accessory is completely useless.  </li>
            <li> Product came unpacked and broken - not functional!</li>
            <li> and I failed again.</li>
            <li> or we did something wrong.</li>
            <li> Nose &amp; Ear trimmer doesn&#x27;t do the job and beard trimmer is worse!  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it didn&#x27;t compare when you looked at its product quality and design characteristics.</li>
            <li> It was still useable, but now the switch has failed.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I could keep going but the bottom line is is that this is a terrible trimmer, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> One day it just stopped working, considering I ordered and never used for two months then started using and item failed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I find this product useless.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of bells and whistles, but it completely fails to trim hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> comb clipper seems useless.</li>
            <li> This is very poor</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s is hard to get the power cord into the base of the stand for the shaver.</li>
            <li> The body trimmer attachment is basically useless cutting body hair.</li>
            <li> , then after the charging time it did not have the same power as my 240, also the charging plug that I believe is supposed to snap in the base to charge it is very badly designed if it&#x27;ll stay in place at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your time with this.</li>
            <li> Saw some bad reviews and was skeptical about purchasing</li>
            <li> Works alike a Swiss watch on a cold night in Switzerland.  </li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> and thus I was unable to turn it off or on anymore!</li>

            <li> The description of charging base is misleading.</li>
            <li> Then it sits in the base.</li>
            <li> It just was placed into the sturdy heavier base and the razor sat there while charging.</li>
            <li> I never had to hold the base.</li>
            <li> nose trimmers are worthless</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Shortly after I bought this plastic pieces began breaking off.  I really like the body clipper, and the nose hair trimmer.  Both worked fairly well for about 1 1/2 yr.  Now it won&#x27;t start at all.  It seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Nose hair attachment does not work.    in less than one week after my review, I was contacted by Roseann Baerwolf with Remington offering to do what they could to improve my situation.  I explained that I did not what them to do anything for me but I just wanted to let them know that the nose hair trimmer did not work well.  She went to the extreme to remedy the problem for me.  She mailed a REMINGTON NOSE, EAR, AND BROW TRIMMER to me.  I must say that I am very impressed with how well Remington worked to correct a relatively minor problem with an otherwise very good grooming kit.  Thanks Remington for renewing my faith in your company!   MAKE MY REVIEW OF REMINGTON 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> I was happy with my product until now! The charger isn&#x27;t working now! just work one year, why about the quality and warranty?</li>
            <li> I actually preferred the model of the same groomer before this one.  I am not sure it needs all the interchangeable heads but for the money it is a nice groomer.</li>
            <li> Other reviews are correct.  It does have some attachment for everyone and every part of the body.  It is Very nice!</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas in December. Three and a half months later, the body snapped when I was putting on an attachment. Now it won&#x27;t hold an attachment. Poor material used in construction makes this a poor product. I paid over $100 for this and it became a paper weight in less than 4 months. My last groomer cost me about $25 and lasted about four years. I&#x27;m going back to the less expensive option.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 90 yr. old father in law.  It has to many pieces but was the best thing we could find.  It is easy enough to put the other pieces away or give it to my husband who has the same thing.  My husband has had this one for quiet a while and it still works well so we picked it because we knew it would work well for dad too.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product it comes with a stand so dad can not simply lay it on the floor and have it break when he decides he doesn&#x27;t like it after a month of time.&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like about it it&#x27;s is hard to get the power cord into the base of the stand for the shaver. I wish they would have sold one just with the parts I needed which was two pieces so I wouldn&#x27;t have pieces that will probably never be used.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for less plastic</li>
            <li> This unit does not hold a charge for more than a few minutes.  It was like that right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Has to be on the charger all the time you are not using it.</li>
            <li> Within the first couple months of owning this kit, the battery would no longer hold a charge, or some of the attachments wouldn&#x27;t work at all even when the battery was fully charged. I have since already replaced it with a kit that is also a Remington set, for half the price, and it works like a dream. Maybe I got the dud of the batch, but it left a sour taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> A++++++++++++++++++ Amazoner. Amazing product close close shaver alone is worth the purchase. My facial bumps were everywhere with my old shaver and now my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> As far as functionality goes, this is definitely a great product.  However, after leaving it unplugged for several weeks, it stopped working and I had to buy another one.  I bought the same thing though, as testament to its usefulness.  I just wish it had a longer lifespan.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot;, but I have no interest in \\&quot;grooming\\&quot; my body... so I will not cover the \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; features.  I&#x27;ve had it about 4 months now, after I started growing out my beard about 7 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:  Lots of different attachments; I particularly like the \\&quot;wide\\&quot; and \\&quot;narrow\\&quot; trimmer heads.  (\\&quot;Narrow\\&quot; works pretty well around the mouth, for instance, but it would take too long on the rest of my full beard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:  Cordless/rechargeable, so there&#x27;s no cord to maneuver around in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  The blades on the trimmer attachments did pretty well at first (first 2-3 months?).  Now they seem dull - they don&#x27;t cut as well, and there&#x27;s a lot more pulling.  Occasionally it&#x27;ll pull out a hair entirely... if I wanted electrical tweezers, I&#x27;d have bought those instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  The battery doesn&#x27;t last very well.  Another reviewer mentioned 15 minutes; I haven&#x27;t timed it, but that sounds about right.  (I usually do a touch-up every couple days, with a more thorough mowing on Saturday morning.  It has to be fully charged to make it through the latter.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for:  Guys with lighter beards than mine, maybe?  Guys (or girls, apparently) who want to trim areas besides their face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up in a StuffMart because I wanted one fast and this sounded like the best/most flexible option.  It probably was, but I still regret buying it without doing the research to find a better model.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item 6 months ago for my husband and it does not hold a charge at all.  It can not be used while plugged in, so it is useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at this for a while now looking for a good price. I finally got it not from here but didn&#x27;t bid and got it. I was looking for something that would be able to handle my beard and cut my head. First this is smaller then I expected and the parts don&#x27;t click in to the base so when it tips everything goes everywhere. Secondly its not very powerful. I wasn&#x27;t able to cut my hair on my head with it and it seemed like my beard was to tough for it also. I had to pass multiple times to get it cut. Also the main head that is on it in the picture right now behind it is the thing you put on it to get it to the length you want. Its to big to cut short hair. There are many flaws with this and at least for me I&#x27;m going to have to use barber clipper again cause this isn&#x27;t going to cut it. If you really want to look good and want a precision length  or have a lot of time to play with this then you should get it but if you want something quick and easy its not worth the money and this is neither quick nor easy.</li>
            <li> I guess it is ok but it is not for men of color. It do not cut it down far enough. it did do a great line up for me but I need a close shave.</li>
            <li> Although i like the array of accessories, especially the body hair trimmer, I feel this product did not adequately meet my needs. Feels like the rpm is a bit low compared to my other trimmer. Also there is not a setting for the length I like my facial hair. Compared to my other relatively low quality trimmer purchased 4 years ago, i feel this product is inferior.</li>
            <li> This razor is a decent buy for the money.  It&#x27;s not particularly durable nor strong, and it&#x27;s construction feels \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, but the price is right and it does the job.  However, I would suggest spending a few more dollars and buying a better quality electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  2 years after purchase the product has stopped working.  Battery no longer holds a charge.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s bigger and more powerful then those small types and works well with the different attachments allover the body. Run time is fine,and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The one I bought is over a year old and it still works. The only con is the base doesn&#x27;t hold the parts very well. They always fall off.</li>
            <li> only have a few uses the housing on the shaver where you attach the attachments broke, so the attachments will not stay connected and come loose. I just returned it. The shave is all plasic and very light weight.</li>
            <li> Works great. Only problem is the charge does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Trims great and all the attachments make the job easy! Would def recommend and buy again. Only have had it for a few days but so far it seems like its a quality product and not cheep. Good trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li> one again this whole thing sucked weak motored, head way too small, dull blades, doesn&#x27;t hold a charge and pulls face hair</li>
            <li> hes going to love it.. got all the tips and so on..its for xmas so I hope so. any way</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon thinking it was the normal fair price I am used to, but I was shocked when I found the same kit for $24.99 at a brick and mortar store.  I used the product, it is only worth about $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmed the hair on my goatee, the fine trimmer didn&#x27;t work well and the electric razor part is not very good.  The best part of the kit is the long comb looking attachment.  It does a great job trimming overly long arm and leg hair to a normal length, I&#x27;d buy it if you want to manscape your gorilla back and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest irritant was paying nearly 2x for what you can get it for at Walmart or a beauty cosmetic store.</li>
            <li> The nose/ear trimmer will easily cut you. The foil shaver is very inefficient and takes multiple passes to produce marginal results. The body trimmer attachment is basically useless cutting body hair. It took me over 15 minutes to finish my chest and I was not satisfied with the results. Uneven cutting, multiple passes, and an easily clogged cutting guide. The depth combs are very shintzy and I see no chance in them not breaking shortly.     I&#x27;m returning this unit tomorrow. Save your time and avoid this one.</li>
            <li> Does not produce a blended or smooth trim. The guide is a little on the flimsy side, I use this trimmer to do my initial trimming and then use a different trimmer to actually make things look nice</li>
            <li> Both trimmer heads work nicely as do the adjustable comb attachments. The height adjust on the combs is sort of difficult to move but there are many increments.  The foil shaver works okay for tight areas but not to shave your entire face.  The battery lasts through several days of trimming on the road before a recharge is needed. The nose/ear trimmer is okay but I prefer the rotary type.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst trimmer I have EVER seen. I can&#x27;t even judge it on performace because the piece of junk broke in my hands as I was using it. I&#x27;m serious, as I was trimming my beard the plastic handle was falling apart. When I tried to change heads by twisting off and on even more plastic fell off. It was unbelieveable! Buy any other trimmer but this one. I replaced it with a wahl, much better.</li>
            <li> The unit operates really well. The only two complaints that I have are that the accessories don&#x27;t stay in the storage tray very well, so every time it gets bumped, a few of the pieces fall out. The second is that the blades don&#x27;t seem to come apart for cleaning. Other than than, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Wow what a great product for the price. Have bought other similar products and some by the same manufacturer, but this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I am comparing the PG520 to an old Remington MB40    -- Its output is very weak.    -- The battery does not last more than about 15 minutes.    -- One can not use the trimmer with the power cord; once it&#x27;s turned on, it stops charging (see previous point).    -- While there are several attachments, it does not offer proper incremental \\&quot;stuble\\&quot; lengths.    -- It feels cheap.    -- No proper clean out of the attachments or body; no fine brush.</li>
            <li> Having used the PG240 for the past years I purchased this one and found it lacks quality, they did away with the ergonomic hold is my first complaint, then after the charging time it did not have the same power as my 240, also the charging plug that I believe is supposed to snap in the base to charge it is very badly designed if it&#x27;ll stay in place at all. I had hoped the one I had was defective but found out differently so I returned this unit and will try Remington 350 / 360 per there advise.&lt;br /&gt;Also no small brush included to clean the unit. Bad biz Remington!</li>
            <li> The Remington Head to Toe Grooming Kit is alright the only problem is that it works for only 20 minutes then you have to recharge it again.Other wise it is a good trimmer does a good job.</li>
            <li> The blades on this thing will not trim any hair while using the length guards.  i thought i was getting a quality product....later found out it would be a better use of time to try to chew my own hair off first.</li>
            <li> Device has more than enough attachments to do it all and the unit holds a charge long enough to do so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great having an all in one but the main unit is a little weak and doesn&#x27;t have the remington buzz that numbs your arm when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> Remington is known for their trimmers and shaving technology.  Apparently either I received a defective model, or they didn&#x27;t put a ton of effort into this little kit.  The packaging was great.  The product looks fantastic.  I took it out and set everything up in the little tray and left it charging for a couple days.  It doesn&#x27;t have an indicator for when it&#x27;s done charging.  This is the first time I took it off its stand and tried to use it.  Issues:  The first thing I noticed was that it acted like it barely had a charge.  I played with the seating of the heads, because it seems to run fine without them on.  It&#x27;s hit or miss with an accessory on there and I had to reattach them various times before they would run.  The shaver accessory is completely useless.  I have 2 days worth of stubble on my neck (usually have a trimmed beard or goatee on my face).  The little shaver attachment did nothing.  It sounded like it was clipping hairs, but it sure didn&#x27;t change how my neck stubble looked.  The vertical groomer is a nice accessory... if it would work.  It died out after about 2 minutes.  Same deal with the precision trimmer.  It died out after a couple minutes as well.  Truth be told, I bought this to replace my Wahl trimmer that was 6 years old.  I should have kept it til it died.  I&#x27;ve placed the Remington back on its charging station.  Maybe tomorrow morning it will actually work.  But for now, it&#x27;s quite possibly the lousiest groomer I&#x27;ve ever purchased simply because it doesn&#x27;t work.  Aesthetics: 5 stars, easily.  Functionality: 2 stars, at best.  Edit...  After owning this item for maybe 2 weeks, I can honestly say this is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I&#x27;ve dropped my stars down to 1.  I followed the directions on the insert and let it run completely down.  Then plugged in and let it charge completely.  It lasted for maybe 6 mins.  I then charged it again.  And tonight I tried to trim off my goatee, since I need to be clean shaven for an appointment tomorrow morning.  It was literally painful.  What kind of clipper can&#x27;t cut through a standard bit of goatee on a man&#x27;s chin?  It would clip a little, then get stuck... pulling the hair in the process.  I switched heads to the detail trimmer and took off the last half, with the same results.  This thing is complete junk.  Remington should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a useless device into the market.  Honestly, what did they use in testing?  Babies?  This thing would be the death of a lumberjack, considering how much of an annoyance it is to the average man.  I&#x27;ll be sending a lovely letter of gratitude to Remington... and will be purchasing a Wahl trimmer again shortly.  Never should have strayed from Wahl.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for someone; so far he says it works great and I am actually going to purchase another for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected!!! Great!</li>
            <li> I certainly felt comfortable with my product selection from the visuals, the brand and of course the listed features but when it arrived I was very surprised at all the attachments that came with the trimmer. Virtually every need you can imagine in personal grooming is included in this package whether it&#x27;s for beard trimming, hair cutting and trimming, nasal hair removal, those hard to reach hairs on the top and inside the ears and for those more personal areas that require some cleaning up as well. As soon as the package arrived I charged it up and got a complete haircut from my neighbor who loved using the Remington and she couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to remove the heads to replace with other attachments. I love this product and hope it will last a long time. Michael M.</li>
            <li> Battery quite working or accepting a charge after 1 month.</li>
            <li> This replaced my previous grooming kit and I like this one the best of any I have had. I use a Norelco for daily shaving, but I can still get closer using the foil shaver after using my Norelco. The other attachments are also handy for doing touch ups when needed.</li>
            <li> I just got this Kit to replace a Norelco shaver that I was using, which was about 18 months old.  It was in good condition, but I kept having issues with razor burn.  I also had problems finding foil replacements.  This Remington shaver is quite nice, it&#x27;s quiet, and really gives me a close shave around my goatee.  I also like the additional features of the kit too.  The trimmers are great, and the additional slip on combs are good too.  It really helps keep a clean look.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Decent grooming kit, except for short beards.  There is no beard trimmer attachment for the large blade and the attachment for the small blade does not have settings for very short lengths.  Body hair trimmer is nice.  Recommended, unless you wear your beard at lengths less than a two weeks&#x27; worth of growth.</li>
            <li> This was a great present for my b/f and he uses it every day.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!?&lt;br /&gt;It will not hold a charge. After 1 year, and charging for 36 hours. It works for that day and is dead the next morning!&lt;br /&gt;Also, you cannot use the trimmer while it&#x27;s plugged in! This is the worst trimmer I have ever purchase!!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad; the main unit is a lot lighter than my previous trimmer, but I&#x27;ve learned to like that about it.</li>
            <li> HAS EVERY THING YOU NEED FOR GROOMING NEED DIRECTION ON GETTING HEAD OFF ALMOST BROKE IT BEFORE I GOT TO USE IT. YOU TWIST THE HEADS TO GET THEM OFF. THE LITTLE TINY ARROWS ARE HARD TO SEE AN FIND.</li>
            <li> This is a gift that I bought for my Dad, he hasn&#x27;t received it yet because I&#x27;m gonna visit him in December, but I know he&#x27;s gonna love it like I do.</li>
            <li> One of the items fell down when I opened the box and broke right away, they are not very sturdy at all. It is ok, not the best quality.</li>
            <li> I liked what I read. Felt a bit cheap when I got it. I use almost all attachments at some point, but mostly the comb attachments &amp; trimmer combo for my goatee.  Didn&#x27;t take long until the 17mm trimmer cracked the 17mm comb when inserted. So I tried the larger ones - same result. The larger plastic comb fell apart with minimal pressure. Now there are none. Everyone has plastic pieces, but if the attachments are meant to fit together, there should be no problem if handled properly.  Cheap is the word.</li>
            <li> I needed a beard trimmer today and found a local store that carried this kit.  The packaging states &amp;#34;Designed in USA, Made in PRC (China).&amp;#34;  Instead, I bought the Wahl Lithium-ion kit, because it&#x27;s actually made in USA.</li>
            <li> Everything you need is included</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works well, however, some of the attachments are flimsy and I had a hard time setting the adjustments and keeping them attached to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Husband was Happy, Happy, Happy to get this for Christmas and likes it very much. I like the smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my son and he has been very happy with it. The product arrived quickly and in good condition. Real happy with the whole thing.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased his set.  He is very picky about his groomers, but he loves this entire set.  It is all he needs!</li>
            <li> Men...you need this. Im not just recommending it, Im tellin you buy it lol. My fiance has had a older cheaper one for yeeaars and uses the fire out of it. This is SO much more nicer and better, minds blew.</li>
            <li> Very good piece of equipment, well spend money, I probably will buy another if i need a gift or if a damage this one</li>
            <li> The motor in this thing didn&#x27;t last long at all.  It seems to be a problem with the last couple of Remington electric shavers I&#x27;ve bought recently.  The motor starts to lose power and behave erratically depending on what angle you hold the shaver.  All in less than a year&#x27;s time.  Earlier versions of this shaver were great, you only had to replace the blades, not the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this as a birthday gift for my husband and it is better than I expected. There are more accessories than I thought. This covers everything you may need for your grooming. I have even confiscated it for my legs. The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a very long charge but it is perfect for my husband.</li>
            <li> The motor for the groomer died after one use and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge ever again.</li>
            <li> I bought this from onland store and thought it was great.&lt;br /&gt;But in practical use, for me, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I only used it for &#x27;personal grooming&#x27;, meaning on occassion. It otherwise sat on the sinktop taking up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the rare use meant it usually had no charge when I needed it, so I had to either wait or plan ahead for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;Then, after about 8 months of really low use - it just stopped taking a charge at all.&lt;br /&gt;NOT recommended.</li>
            <li> I had this trimmer for less than 4 months and used it lightly (1-2 times per week). The 17mm adjustable comb attachment broke recently and I see from Remington it costs $2.99 + $5.00 shipping to replace. That is almost 30% of the cost of the entire system to replace a cheap piece of plastic, one of five attachments. Given the volume of other negative reviews on this product, I feel I&#x27;m better off rolling that $8.00 into a better system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did use the trimmer, the results were so-so. There seemed to be a lot of uneven trimming and on a few occasions I was forced to shave my beard off entirely because it looked too patchy.</li>
            <li> I Love this shaver. For the money, this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ll never buy another kind.</li>
            <li> The attachments are great for trimming side burns / a mustache / goatee etc but I&#x27;ve had it less than a year and it will just barely hold a charge now.  I don&#x27;t believe in leaving things plugged in at all times constantly sucking juice so I will fill it up and use it for a few minutes.  A few days later when I go to turn it on the battery will have drained completely w/o any use.  Kind of a pain in the...</li>
            <li> Battery life is low. Cannot charge and use at the same time.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a nice compact design, with a decent little stand and appearance, but it does not cut short enough.  I&#x27;m a bald guy and wanted to use this for haircuts and general trimming - seemed like that was its purpose.  Not the case for me though, I normally like a #1 cut on the head and this trimmer does not have a setting that goes low enough.  Best it can do is maybe a #2 or #3, and that is with the small trimmer head on.  The larger attachment that seems fit for a haircut only cuts at a height of 1&amp;#34; or so.  No good for me, sending it back to Remington.</li>
            <li> Works AWESOME and has all the right attachments for longer facial hair to a closer shave. Totally recommend it!! Has a great charge life. Design is modern / nice.</li>
            <li> This arrived to me promptly and worked fairly well for a few weeks. After the 3rd week however, the battery would not hold a charge and I could not get through my grooming without having to recharge the battery at least once in the middle of it. Funny thing about that is I only use it for my goatee, eyebrows, back of my neck and armpits. This is not a lot of trimming that needs done. It feels cheaply made and now that I&#x27;ve used it for a little while I am extremely disappointed and do not think I&#x27;ll purchase anything else from Remington again.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these with a Christmas gift certificate.  when I first tried to use it, the battery lasted a full 20 seconds.  thought I just hadn&#x27;t given it enough time so I waited 24 hours and tried again.  Same result.  Week later, same result.  Because I tried to give it a chance, I passed the return date so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  takes 2 days of intermittent use....cut, stop, charge.  Cut, stop,charge.  If this is a faulty unit, I&#x27;d love an exchange to try a different one, but no, screwed.</li>
            <li> To the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The battery wont last for 35 minutes on a charge, the best you can get is maybe 15, and it is not even enough to get your beard right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The ear/nose trimmer hurt me (not a slight itch, I actually bled) twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The detail accesory also hurt me, with bleeding involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you try to groom your beard with this, on one hand you will get a one day beard at the best (so if its been one day since you last shaved, dont even bother) and, on the other hand, it will take you forever, because that accesory is not even one inch wide (the pictures are misleading) and you need to go through the same area several times (to get a one-day beard, thats as good as it gets..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you use it while plugged, it wont charge so, for what it matters, you can&#x27;t use use it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, the vertical body groomer is really comfortable and easy to use, but then again, your body hair will show even if you just groomed it, it does not cut it short enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased an old Remington 7 years ago and it finally broke (wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge). I was pleased with how well it worked and how long it lasted so I decided to go with another Remington. One of the plastic clippers broke after very little use (about a month of sporadic use). The plastic on the clippers is paper thin and it just literally fell apart, it felt like a strong cough directed towards the plastic would break it. The old Remington body and clippers were all metal and built to last, this appears to be built for display purposes only. Even when it worked, it didn&#x27;t work. The motor is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last long, I had to make several passes to remove the hair, to the point it was causing scratches on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t rest easily on the charging station, you have to apply some force to lock it in. I can&#x27;t think of anything good to say about this product. I highly regret this purchase and will be going with a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice system but the design of the combs could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The over all design of the power handle and cutter heads is very good. The quality is good and the attachment method is simple and secure. Fully charged running time seems to be as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is very compact, the accessory sockets however are not all the same shape so some heads only fit in specific sockets. Using the stand as a charging base is not very convenient as it requires sufficient force to insertion/removal the mini RCA jack when removing or replacing the power handle. What they did was add a tab on the bottom of the stand that holds the Mini RCA jack at the end of the charging unit in place, so you must hold the stand with your other hand and use sufficient force when removing/replacing the power handle. The stand also does not have a place for the included cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issues with the combs is their limited adjustability;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Vertical Trimmer works very well, but the comb slides on from the end and only has three slots. If your hair was standing straight up, which it seldom does, they would cut at approximately 1/8&amp;#34;, 1/4&amp;#34;, and 3/8&amp;#34; when held perpendicular to the skin. If you rotate the cutter away from perpendicular in either direction the length of the cut increases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The 17mm trimmer has an adjustable curved tip comb that extends out in front of the cutter blade by less than 1/32&amp;#34; at the #1 setting to about 1/4&amp;#34; at the #5 setting and is between 3/32&amp;#34; at  #1 and 3/16&amp;#34; at #5 below the cutter blades. So how you hold and position the trimmer will determine how close it trims, holding it perpendicular set on #1 result in about a 1/8&amp;#34; stubble, at #5 held perpendicular you&#x27;ll be closer to 1/4&amp;#34;. Works well for short beards and side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The 30mm comb is a mystery? It also is adjustable, with setting from #1 to #10, but unless your a barber I don&#x27;t see a practical use for it. At it&#x27;s closest setting, #1, the comb is 1/4&amp;#34; in front of and a full 1/2&amp;#34; below the cutter blades, at it&#x27;s longest setting, #10, the comb is 7/8&amp;#34; in front of and 7/8&amp;#34; below the cutter blades. Perhaps if you only trim your beard every six or eight weeks it may have a use, but you&#x27;ll need to use a hair comb with it to guide the hair up into the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DonS.&lt;br /&gt;01/13/14</li>
            <li> Awesome find so glad I purchased from you at a amazing price.  Works alike a Swiss watch on a cold night in Switzerland.  Thanks guys</li>
            <li> trims nicely and good enough battery life per charge. Removable plastic makes it easy to clean. Good price for the product.</li>
            <li> Product came unpacked and broken - not functional! After a while I was able to disassemble it and to make it working but it was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> Excellent body trimmer I haven&#x27;t really used all of the different heads that come with the trimmer but I don&#x27;t know of too many ways to shave excess body hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Yule Gift for our teenage son, Girls are now in the picture so he now takes a liking in making himself look nice. Now if we can just get him out in front of the mirror and to school on time, it&#x27;ll be great!</li>
            <li> Excellent item ,I&#x27;ve received excellent item for a low price I really recommend this Remington pg520 a b c d</li>
            <li> This is the worst body trimmer I have ever used. Blades work fine and they don&#x27;t pull your hair, but the battery life sucks. At the beginning the battery lasted at least half an hour. A couple of weeks ago I had to plug the charger in for at least 2 hours to get a 10min trim before the battery died. Today I tried to use it after the usual 2 hour charge and it&#x27;s dead. It doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Please consider buying a corded trimmer like the Wahl Peanut. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Like the feel in my hand.  Has a little weight to it, that&#x27;s nice. Though the top blades are of plastic, they fit snug and cut well.  The body outer shell is plastic and has a nice look and feel.  I have not dropped mine yet, so I do not know if the plastic can handle it.</li>
            <li> For the price, its a great tool. Just didn&#x27;t remember to look for a waterproof one but may be next time! Fast shipping. Many different attachments. If you do not have a large vanity or drawer to stow this on, it gets in the way.</li>
            <li> Last year we purchased two of these trimmers for $30 and we love them.  My husband uses his to trim his mustache and it does a nice job.  I use his to trim his sideburns and the back of his neck in between hair cuts.  Very user friendly!   I mainly use mine for the bikini area.  This little guy runs circles around the ones they design for women! üòÜ  It&#x27;s a shame they stopped making this one as the trimmer fits great on the base for recharging with all the extra attachments neatly stored beside it.  I understand the replacement doesn&#x27;t do this, you must manually plug in the trimmer when you want to charge it.  To us, they took a Huge Step Backwards by doing that!!  Debi B.</li>
            <li> really light and cheap...doesn&#x27;t cut anything...my fault....you usually get what you pay for and I should&#x27;ve known that before I ordered</li>
            <li> Very handy and enough power to do the job. More attachments than I will ever use. Hopefully it will last</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. I bought this trimmer 2 times coz the first time I ordered it it broke in less than 4 days and I thought to give it one more chance and I failed again. The charging wont even last 5 minutes on this even after charging for a long time. I am done with this product. It&#x27;s probably the worst product of remington, I bought a WAHL trimmer after frustrated with this and its charging is still there even after 5 use&#x27;s with one time charging.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been really happy with how compact it is and all the attachments. But one of the main reasons I bought it was to use it to buzz my hair, which I do about once a week. Like really buzz it SHORT, military buzz. But this thing doesn&#x27;t even get remotely close enough. Thought the headline \\&quot;18 trimming lengths\\&quot; was a bit misleading if it can&#x27;t do short! I&#x27;ve never seen a razor/trimmer that doesn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> I bought and older version of this, which I used mainly to trim my facial hair and, occasionally, problem areas in my hair. It&#x27;s did an amazing job and lasted for 7 years before the head cracked when I dropped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to be identically good. I brought it on a 2 week vacation and it didn&#x27;t need to be recharged at all (although I did only use it for a few minutes a day).</li>
            <li> I now received my bill , and I see that I committed the $36.98, I want to note that  this date I bought it at 4/1 $30 + $6,99 manicure kit , and I bought another kit manicure and pedicure At a value of $6.99 and and so I ask you please to return my money back to me about the return of the product 6,99 is also the most positive of another $ 7me at: 6.99 + 6.98 Invoice Billing Stock returned your product Thank you!*I have to pay you only $ 30 and not more!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every make and model of electric shaver on the market over the past 32 years and this is by far the most versatile, easy to use system out there. The blades are very precise and the ergonomically designed body makes for a comfortable fit in my large hands. I used this product for the first time with the full battery charge of approximately 60 minutes. I tried every attachment blade on various areas of my frame and was very surprised with the ease of changing and cleaning each under running water. The unique angle of the body shaving attachment compliments the contouring required when shaving below the belt. What took more than an hour before with wet shaving products is completed in less than ten minutes with a smooth closeness and no nicks or pulling. This is a product I will share with my beautiful spouse because her comfort is very important to me. Simply the BEST shaving system in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> I have to charge it and keep it plugged in to use. There is no battery life. Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. This product is great and I use it almost every day. Definitely worth the purchase I made for this.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the limited accessories that came with this grooming kit. I had expected more, such as trimmers in more sizes. However it works just fine. For the price, there ought to be more attachments though.</li>
            <li> The shaver is ergonomically pleasing, versatile and easy to change attachments, easy to use on various areas of the anatomy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once a week or every other week for a little while now. It&#x27;s easy to use. I was a little confused on how to switch the blades. But i figured it out. you&#x27;re supposed to twist instead of pull. It&#x27;s easy to clean and does what it&#x27;s supposed to without tugging on hairs.</li>
            <li> got this for my fianc√©e, he&#x27;s been saying he needs a new one for a while, perfect Christmas gift.  Amazon was easier, but maybe not cheaper, than just getting it at the store, but I was ok with having everything arrive at once.</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out this does not hold a charge. I bought this for my husband to trim his beard. The first time he used it, the charge did not last long at all. I thought maybe it had gotten unplugged or we did something wrong. Nope, it wasn&#x27;t us. I just finished trying to trim his beard and neaten up his haircut and the thing did not last more than 5 minutes. Useless!</li>
            <li> Within two months this Remington Head to Toe Rechargeable Body Grooming Kit quit working. I bought a cheaper one before this one and it lasted for years. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The set did not meet my expectations by quality, convenience, function and etc. The set is less than OK. I will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The description of charging base is misleading. It is just a plastic tray that the components sit in. You must put the standard DC charger prong through the bottom of the base and click the motor on to it. Then it sits in the base. Try to pick it up without holding the base down. try to put it back without holding the base down. Also, each time you touch the base, to hold it down or for any other reason (don&#x27;t try to slide it over either) - all of the components (they don&#x27;t snap on to the base - they just sit) fall all over your counter, into the sink, onto the floor, etc. I had a Conair and I wish I bought another. It just was placed into the sturdy heavier base and the razor sat there while charging. The components lightly clicked in. I never had to hold the base. Too bad I dropped it a few times and it finally broke. Prior to that, I had it 7 years. Just clean it and oil it every once in a while. Find it here. It&#x27;s about the same price too. Stupid me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [...]</li>
            <li> Junk, after about 10 charging cycles the battery will not hold a charge. If I keep it plugged in, it will run for about 1 1/2 minutes before going dead. I can not be used plugged in. This was a huge disappointment after having a Remington that lasted for 5 or 6 years. Don&#x27;t buy this!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well, good grooming tools. So far battery life hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  Overall a great and useful product.</li>
            <li> As described.  Works great.  Have not had any issues like other reviews.  If using for that paticular area always take care.  No matter what you buy it is still a sharp object you are using there.</li>
            <li> Meh, it&#x27;s ok... nothing special.... blades are sharp, arrived on time, slightly low standby battery, but handy....  will not buy again but I got my money worth so far....  *Update* Changed my star rating by -1 - Trimmer died about a month ago. Battery Issues, does not charge. Replaced with a trimmer made by Wahl, 9818 model, long standby life, plenty more attachments. Very Impressed.</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk! Nose &amp; Ear trimmer doesn&#x27;t do the job and beard trimmer is worse!  Going back to Phillips Norelco</li>
            <li> WHY DOES EVERY COMPANY ONLY MAKE RECHARGABLES?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M TIRED OF BATTERIES, OR WEAK CHARGE. I WANT A EAR/NOSE TRIMMER THAT JUST PLUGS INTO A WALL OUTLET!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMINGTON, AND ALL OF THE OTHER MODELS THAT I HAVE SEEN ARE ALL RECHARGABLES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIVE ME A MODEL THAT RUNS FROM A POWER CORD!</li>
            <li> Battery lasted about a month and now unless it is plugged in all the time it will go dead just sitting there.  Even fully charged the battery lasts less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I would recommended this product to all that has a need for a trimmer the can be used for every job</li>
            <li> Grooming kit does everything that it says it will do.  Good product at a low price. would reccomend it to all.</li>
            <li> Great product. I recommend this product to everyone that ask.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that was going dull.  This one is very similar and works great.  Was tired of asking barbers for half price since I have half a head of hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Husband for Christmas.  He likes it better than the last one he had you don&#x27;t even know this one is on.</li>
            <li> Excellent product would recommend to anyone and all.  If battery lasts this will be a great buy for anyone who trims beards.</li>
            <li> Very good razor kit, the best I have owned. Would have been nice if Remington would have put a bag that holds all components for travel etc.. Would highly recommend. Powerful cutting.</li>
            <li> Battery does not last longer than a couple minutes after charging. I bought a cheaper one from Wal Mart before I bought this and it worked much better. Hopefully you don‚Äôt even have a small beard because this thing cannot trim it. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for honey. Shaves and grooms where needed perfectly. Great for grooming sensitive areas and keenly your man&#x27;s hair trimmed.</li>
            <li> I think it is mean to pluck the poodles&#x27;s hair from the ears so I can shave the inside of the dog&#x27;s ears carefully to avoid poodle  ear infections from overgrown hair. The product works great to shave  small spaces! My vet actually told me to buy it. She used her husband&#x27;s Remington to shave her cat&#x27;s bottom. I personally do not advise sharing between humans and pets.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Works as anticipated and happy with this product I would buy another of these one&#x27;s. All the attachments work well.</li>
            <li> Remington needs to know that they have taken a major step in the wrong direction! Let me clarify, this&lt;br /&gt;is the second personal groomer that I have purchased from them in the last ten years. My first which I absolutely loved was model number MB-900 and with only one exception it was a well-designed and well-made groomer. Its only flaw was that it didn&#x27;t have a rubberized grip and it slipped out of my hand and damaged the switch and thus I was unable to turn it off or on anymore! I went back to Target where I purchased it a decade ago and there were no Remington&#x27;s to be found. Norelco and Wahl were the only two name brands that I looked at. Needing the trimmer ASAP and the manufacture offering a sixty day trial I purchased the Wahl. I purchased the Wahl because it was the closest thing to a match of my ten year old Remington. Sadly, it didn&#x27;t compare when you looked at its product quality and design characteristics. If you google my old model number you will see right away the differences. Specifically, my old MB-900 had a solid (heavy) base which acted as a charging cradle (i.e.; the plug plugged into the base and not the trimmer). It also had three barber shop quality trimmer heads. It also included a comb a pair of scissors a cleaning brush and oil for the blades. All of these items tucking neatly into this solid charging base. Adding to my frustration is the fact that once I got the Wahl out of the box and discovered how cheap it was I decided to return it. Wanting to give Remington one last chance to keep me as a customer I then did a search online. That&#x27;s when the PG520B model that I am now reviewing came to my attention. In the pictures on their website (Remington.com) I saw what I thought was going to be and even better product to replace my MB-900. I even downloaded the user manual to confirm that the charging base acted as a cradle like my old one. This is where the mislead comes into play. In the picture it appeared that this is what I was purchasing when in fact it was identical to the Wahl which has a cheap plastic base(no weight to it) and the cord plugs into the trimmer itself. Every time I try to pick up the trimmer on the new unit EVERYTHING falls out of it because it doesn&#x27;t have any weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...this new Remington PG520B is disappointment to say the least. In my opinion, all Remington is trying to do is emulate what Wahl is producing as opposed to continuing to set the standard of quality in the trimmer industry. Rather than continuing to make a well-designed product like the one they made in the discontinued MB-900 they have succumbed to their bottom line. CHEAP CHINA CRAP! America needs to wake up!!!!!!!! China is taking us for a ride!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ll probably return this unit and go back to the Wahl due to the fact it has a stronger and longer lasting lithium ion battery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these.  Cuts great !  However, after several months you will be lucky getting through a hair cut before the battery dies. I&#x27;m considering tearing into the machine and replacing the battery with a higher grade of battery.  Wish Remington would put a long lasting higher grade battery the first time out of the Chinese factory !  I surprised at how small and cheap looking the battery is...</li>
            <li> It works great and does everything that I need.</li>
            <li> The grooming kit exceeded all my expectations!  It&#x27;s versatility is superior to any similar product that I have ever seen.  One attachment makes the difference.  It&#x27;s the tall, cylindrical attachment that separate sit from it&#x27;s competition.  ALL the attachments are more than functional, but the one attachment is the difference maker.</li>
            <li> not a very good trimmer</li>
            <li> Clipper works ok. Attachments flimsy and didn&#x27;t last a month.</li>
            <li> This product out performs and surpasses my expectations&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;This is as good as any out there.</li>
            <li> Complete crap. Battery life is extremely short. Made of cheap plastic. Mine broke after about a month, with very little use. Steer clear of this product</li>
            <li> Works great on the face, but not so great on the hair. Tiny in diameter.</li>
            <li> A very interesting set. Only very weak battery. Spent a year and all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this set up.  The beard trimmer shaves too long.  I usually cut my hair with a Wahl trimmer with a 1 guard and then used to trim my beard with a Norelco that was the Equivalent of a 2 guard on the Wahl.  I can&#x27;t seem to find anything on this that works at that level.  I&#x27;m now using a 2 guard on the Wahl for my bear and the only thing this is good for is neck and beard lines.  The nose trimmer is a joke.  Most nose trimmers are round, this is a flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality does seem to be high and I like the feel of it but it just doesn&#x27;t meet my facial needs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re about to read a lot of these reviews trying to figure out whether this is any good or not. Let me save you some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this recommended in Men&#x27;s Health, so I thought I&#x27;d check it out. It&#x27;s not very expensive, so that&#x27;s a plus. Here are the key things you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;1. The battery does not last long. Don&#x27;t plan to do any head to toe grooming in one session unless it&#x27;s just a touch up. IMPORTANT: Shaving while it&#x27;s plugged in doesn&#x27;t avoid this problem. It only uses the battery for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2. Like with most electric shavers, you will be satisfied, but not impressed. This will cut your hair, but it won&#x27;t shave as close or as easily as you&#x27;re hoping. If you can&#x27;t accept this, stop looking at electric shavers. You&#x27;re looking for a holy grail that does not exist.&lt;br /&gt;3. The body trimmer broke on my 4th use. I&#x27;m still able to use it, but there&#x27;s an adjustable part that I have to hold in place now while I shave.&lt;br /&gt;4. With the right attachments, you can safely use this to shave ANYWHERE without any mishaps.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size of the attachments to the groomer.  The attachment for private areas is so small it is useless.  Also the attachment to use for chest hair does not allow for length.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long stopped running</li>
            <li> Have not yet had a lot of use experience but am happy with that Which I&#x27;ve had. Appears to be well built and the various attachments seem as though ithey will provide a great deal of versatility.</li>
            <li> I bought this groomer for bikini season. I have very sensitive skin and most razors either burn or cause ingrown hairs. This razor allowed me to trim down to the length I desired and create a nice design. I had an electric Lady Remington before, but it was no where near as effective as this razor! Two thumbs up!!    And YES it does have a cleaning brush! Its kinda small so be careful when opening the box.</li>
            <li> The item cuts my skin, I cannot use it directly to get a close enough shave or it grabs the skin or cuts it directly. If the hair is long enough it also feels like it pulls more then it does cut. The smaller attachments seem to also have a very hard time cutting hair, and my hair is not thick or strong so I am not sure what the problem is.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a head to toe trimmer. Not a strong cut; had to go over same area 3√ó to get results.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. I bought him a cheap one a few years back and it just didn&#x27;t trim his hair very well. My husband&#x27;s body isn&#x27;t very hairy so that aspect of the product isn&#x27;t really useful for him but he uses it for his facial hair. After using it his cheeks are baby soft.</li>
            <li> This product really did surprise me. Great price, great battery, great cut. And really does well ALL over the body. Serves the purpose I bought it for and couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> Purchased a month ago.  Works great, easy to switch attachments and works as I expected.  Only complaint is that the various heads do not stay in the stand.  Every time I pull out the trimmer the heads go flying out.</li>
            <li> I spent decent money on this and my boyfriend hates it.  It pulls the hair really bad he cannot use it.I do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Remington makes good men&#x27;s grooming products.  The only problem my husband has with this one is that the foil shaver is SO tiny that it is totally inadequate.  It is not only small, but also does not shave very close like others he has used over the years.  That is the only problem he has with this.  If he had not thrown the packaging away, he would have returned this.  The other tools work very well, and it certainly has an abundance of those.  If you don&#x27;t care much about the foil shaver I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The makers have tried their best to put out a quality product, the only thing is they overlooked one small part. The blade is too sharp to be holding to your privates! (and armpits, and anywhere else)</li>
            <li> everything works fine so far but the trimmer for the face only cuts in one direction or else it cuts tour face all up.</li>
            <li> No problem with shipment or time recieved&lt;br /&gt;Problem with the product .. does not work well at all&lt;br /&gt;Does not trim hair with attachments on.&lt;br /&gt;For sure not a head to toe groomer. Only works with no gaurds/attachments on it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lots of attachments and overall seems to be very good quality.  Motor is very powerful and hold a charge well.  Charging base is on the cheap side and a bit of a pain to put together functional.</li>
            <li> great product. works well. only thing battery charge is not too long. It has all the things you need for your entire body. recomnended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice trimmer/cutter, works well my only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t cut short enough. I keep my hair and facial hair pretty short and I had the attachments on 1 and it wasn&#x27;t even touching my hair. On my old Phillips Norelco trimmer I set my hair and facial hair at a 3 and was always happy. I had my Phillips Norelco for two years before the hair attachment broke and I decided to try something different this time. Sadly all I did was waste my money, like I said this Remington seemed like a real nice kit, but just doesn&#x27;t cut short enough. I&#x27;ll be going back to my Phillips Norelco kit, just wanted to post this for anyone else who likes short hair. Aside from that the kit came with everything listed and would have been a great kit if it just cut shorter.</li>
            <li> does what i want it to.</li>
            <li> nose trimmers are worthless</li>
            <li> Does not hold a charge, so ever time i want to use it I have to charge it over night. Beard trimmer is awful. Ear/ nose trimmer does not work. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer multiple times a week. It does a great job. I wish it had a longer battery life as it&#x27;s pretty short (around 1/2 hour). Additionally, the attachment for the beard trimmer can sometimes get caught, so keep that in mind. The body hair comb is more of a gimmic, you can get by with a normal hair cutting attachment.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my son who is away at college when a previous grooming kit broke.  No personal experience with it.  However, my son says it works good.  When he shaves (college kid), he seems well groomed  ;o)</li>
            <li> Great Razor / Trimmer ... My husband is well groomed everywhere now!!!!!!! ;)</li>
            <li> The battery is probably the worst quality I have ever seen. The razor itself isn&#x27;t even that great. Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Good item, works well, wish the base recesses were slightly deeper as the various parts fall off a bit too easily.  Remember to recharge!</li>
            <li> This is the worst grooming kit I have ever owned. The nose trimmer is not enclosed like most, difficult to use and I cringe in fear every time I have to use it. I have never cut myself with it but I have never had a good trim since using it either. As for the combs they are cheap plastic. Not like most heavy duty combs and as I was using the long one you see on the left in the picture, it came apart fell off the blade and made me look like I had mange. I would not recommend this set to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance for our anniversary and this is something that he was wanting.  He said this is the ultimate grooming kit.</li>
            <li> This grooming kit is so easy to use, easy to change heads, and it holds it charge for very long periods of time.  It also has a comfortable grip.  The different heads do not hurt when trimming.  The price was also a good value.  I highly recommend this grooming kit.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I purchased this kit trying to find a good grooming kit for trimming neck, ears, sideburns, face, etc. and I eventually settled on this one. Overall it has served me fairly well, however I do wish the trimmer cut a little finer around the neck areas.  Maybe I&#x27;ll just have to buy a wired one to really &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34;.  Overall, not a bad product with some good general use accessories.</li>
            <li> Was working amazing then broke within a month of purchase</li>
            <li> you must Clarify elctric volt is 110V or 220V&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> The shaver is great, quite, lightweight, and powerful, just until you get to what I believe is half battery it starts to not shave as good if not at all and sucks I can&#x27;t leave it hooked up and in use at the same time which would of been really handy</li>
            <li> I have never had so many cuts and scrapes from a trimmer. Returning this today. I really don&#x27;t see how on earth they would put this product out.</li>
            <li> The Remington PG520B is fine for grooming, but all the parts just flip/flop around in the holder.  There could be a better way to secure all the parts.  My previous groomer of many years had a cover over everything.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this thing. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to actually use. It also has poor cutting action even when it is charged.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty flimsy, but for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much... but I really like the range of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I recently cropped my hair short, and wanted to be able to maintain it, and the vertical attachment with the comb is perfect!  Just like brushing your hair to keep an even length without the awkwardness of using a traditional horizontal clipper, and without the comb, it&#x27;s great for gettting around the ears and back of the neck as wel as other parts of the body.  The other attachments are also well suited for their purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is pretty small, judging for the weight, so it needs to live on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever, but I&#x27;d buy another one, just for the vertical attachment!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.</li>
            <li> I got less than 2 years use out of this trimmer. For the last several months, output was weaker than when new, even when fully charged.(It never has been a powerhouse.) My last trimmer was AA battery powered, had more power, and lasted over 10 years. The body recently cracked near the shaver head attachment area. It was still useable, but now the switch has failed. It won&#x27;t click into the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position, I must push hard and hold the switch to make it work. Time to throw this one away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other dislikes: The hair clipper head doesn&#x27;t have enough adjustment. The length is too long for my preference, even on the closest setting. The vertical trimmer head has a guide with a convex curve to it, making it difficult to use. Best used without the guide, but be careful!</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned in a long time!</li>
            <li> Nice product, good power. Easy to control. Way too many attachments, no human could have this many hair requirements. The &#x27;Head-to-Toe&#x27; name is a tad ambitious (12-15 sq ft!).  This is my only complaint and it is minor, but between all the parts and a cheesy plastic stand, it really adds to sink clutter. Try to one-hand it out of the charger, and parts fly everywhere. I&#x27;m told it is great for ears and noses by someone far less attractive.</li>
            <li> Alright, so I had some cheap grooming kit that I absolutely ran into the ground. I mean, this thing was falling apart by the time I looked to get a new one. That&#x27;s how good it was, I even took the thing apart a couple times to repair it! Alas, it came time to part with the old friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this wonderful contraption is what I got in it&#x27;s place, and man o&#x27; man, I&#x27;m definitely grateful. The motor on this is strong and lasts for days! The blades on all the attachments are crisp and strong (they never tug). I&#x27;ve actually cut myself with the trimmer a couple times trying to shape (my fault entirely) but that&#x27;s how good the blades are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments all serve their purpose and they do it well. The beard and facial trimmers are amazing, the body trimmer is a godsend, the clippers are a must-have, and the foil razer is...well its a foil razer (I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m biased here, I hate foil razers) but it seems to be pretty good quality like the rest of the tool. The tools that need it also have guards with multiple length settings &#x3D; AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is a fantastic idea and the way the cord is integrated into it (although there is some assembly required, a little pressure here and there to get the charger set right) and a spot for all the attachments to keep things organized. Of course, there&#x27;s always: &amp;#34;we don&#x27;t need no stands&amp;#34;, so let it all hang out wherever. Whatever floats your boat. The point is, the option is there and it is very enticing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re thinking about it (you obviously are) get it! A top of the line product for a fraction of the price. Enjoy my friends!</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my husband after his last trimmer met a watery death...also known as dropped in the toilet while still turned on after our dog burst through the bathroom door and sent the trimmer flying. Oh good times. Anyway, so far he seems to really like it and works like a champ. Cannot attest to long term though.</li>
            <li> easy to use and travel with, a lot of accessories that I dont really use but come in handy every once in a while. I like the small size and great fit, would appreciate a little bit more of a battery life though.</li>
            <li> This does everything I need it for. I am not a Gorilla so I have no issues. Some body who is harrier might have some issues.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this kit.</li>
            <li> I like that it is rechargeable and that it has a variety of uses.  It really stays charge for a long while.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for years and this is the worst beard trimming device I have ever encountered. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt send it back because I had to literally destroy the package it came it to get it out of the packaging.  My advice is don‚Äôt buy it find something else!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace to replace my older Wahl trimmer thinking it would be an upgrade. I was wrong. This trimmer is terrible. Some of the other reviewers mentioned some of the numerous flaws but I&#x27;ll recap:&lt;br /&gt;- this trimmer cannot hold a charge for more than 5 minutes, less if you have a thick beard. The first couple times I used it it died halfway through so I had to get out my old trimmer. It might last a little longer if you only use the nose hair attachment but other than that it is useless for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;- the attachments are poorly designed and feel cheap. the beard trimming attachment only offered several, inconsistent lengths. Whereas my old Wahl had an attachment with 7 different length options, this one had half of that and was almost completely ineffective. it leaves behind hairs of wildly different lengths. The actual attachments felt like they might snap while putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could keep going but the bottom line is is that this is a terrible trimmer, especially for the price. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> I was optimistic at first buying a Remington Razor but after such great reviews of this product I gave in and bought it.  It was like a kid with a new toy I didn&#x27;t want to put it down the day I got it.  The body grooming attachment became my best friend within minutes.  The other attachments including the foil razor worked very well I was very impressed.  Overall this was a good bang for my buck, I hope it lasts long!</li>
            <li> All of the heads work and do their tasks well.  But they are very easily knocked out of the display cradle that can function as a charging stand.</li>
            <li> cool but battery life isnt that great.</li>
            <li> The Remington Head To Toe Chargeable Body Grooming Kit gets three stars due to the convenience of some of the tools.  The nose clipper is worthless.  The long clipper is very useful, but it does pinch the skin, in intimate areas.  One reviewer found it very helpful in genital areas. This is probably due to the attachment which takes hairs off, which could be described as up close and personal.  A few spots of blood from nicked skin with the long attachment.  But nothing major. Just a drop of blood here and there. Not a problem.  Just be careful.  From a ladies view point I would guess, they would say, get this one now!  What lady wants a bunch of hairs getting in the way?  So guys, for the cupid in you, go for IT! For a confirmation, ask your woman. Since I do not have a Vagina, I cannot say how it would work out, for women.  But the same would apply, it would seem, for male and female.  Just different stuff there.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the quality of the product.  The supporting base is of very poor quality and when one of the attachments is seated on the main unit, part of seating base breaks off.  I have managed to keep using it, even with the base partially broken in different places.  The breaks occurred from just merely removing an attachment and placing an attachment on the main unit.  I was not using excessive force and was careful.  In trying to help with keeping the main base from breaking I placed a small amount of Vaseline to ease it together.  Of note, this can be used for very close grooming as it has an attachment for that. Overall, I rate it as a buy, just barely because of the design flaws.  If it would be improved, then it would get a screaming 5, but NOT as it is.  There is NOT an eyebrow trimmer included.</li>
            <li> this product is cheaply made; the nose and ear trimmer is poorly designed; don&#x27;t spend the money on this product; get instead Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, Pink  yes, its pink but it is far superior to the remington product for less money</li>
            <li> Love the price and we have an more expensive one and this is the favorite. All the men in the family have one.</li>
            <li> The battery is no longer working. Only 5 months and is no longer working. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I picked up this item because my old Remington PG250 wasn&#x27;t holding a charge anymore. I had good luck with that one, so I decided to give Remington another shot with my trimmer.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised on my first use. The fine trimmer blade cuts extremely close and the larger trimmer is the perfect length for my goatee. But it was the \\&quot;body\\&quot;, or vertical trimmer that surprised me most of all. When Remington says \\&quot;Head to Toe Body Grooming Kit\\&quot;, they mean it... especially the part in the middle of those two things.  This is by far the best ball shaving attachment I have ever used. The vertical orientation of the trimming head makes the ergonomics of ball shaving much easier, not to mention how close the blade trims!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never was one for taking a blade and gel to my ol&#x27; man tackle, so I&#x27;ve always given it a good trim using a beard trimmer. With the horizontal head placement, some of the peaks and valleys in the male mid-section could make the terrain a bit difficult to tackle. That&#x27;s why this vertical blade is so amazing! You can wield this thing like a lightsaber for your testicles. it gets where you want it and it doesn&#x27;t pinch, pull, or tear at anything in the process. The finished product is as perfect as Don Johnson&#x27;s 5 o&#x27;clock shadow from the 80&#x27;s. Your lady friends will thank you!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fall apart in my hands, but after a few months of use I was in the middle of cutting my hair when the trimmer suddenly stopped trimming. It only pinched and pulled at my hair. I switched to one of the other alternative heads, and was able to continue trimming a few more times with each head, but they all suffered the same fate.</li>
            <li> A LOT OF ATTACHMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;I am not too happy with this product.  The primary trimmers are great.  The nose hair trimmer is lousy and the stand is terrible.  A more solid stand with a snugger fit for the attachments would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really like it.  It has a lot of good attachments and doesn&#x27;t take too much counter space.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older trimmer I had. I love this one! The only thing i would improve is to add more sizes.</li>
            <li> Good product, cuts well. I use it for facial and head.  No problems so far. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, does not work as it should, had to send it back. Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your time with this.</li>
            <li> This item worked fine when it worked.. One day it just stopped working, considering I ordered and never used for two months then started using and item failed. I&#x27;m not happy with product. I expected to last for years, Silly me...</li>
            <li> I like it, I had been using a corded clipper, but this is great. The different options are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased product to get a more diversified shaving system other than the standard electric razor.  Product has a lot of useful attachments, some of which I haven&#x27;t even used yet!</li>
            <li> It does not hold a charge. The design of the trimming attachment is horrible. The whole thing is unusable because of the battery.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. He absolutely loves the attachments, takes care of all of his needs. His only complaint is the noise. It&#x27;s a little louder than his old one.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a couple of times, but have no complaints so far. It does lose power fairly quick but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Plastic base construction - all attachments do not fit well - things fall out if you try to move the unit.&lt;br /&gt;It is ok - not outstanding.  Wish it felt more substantial and sturdier.</li>
            <li> Good for men and women as well. Good for legs. Gives a smooth shave. Easy to clean. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would be a great full body shaver.  A huge disappointment.  The guards do not stay in place so you cannot get a consistent shave.  The facial trimmer is too small to be usable.  It would take me an extra 10 minutes each morning to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the most disappointing shaving kit I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Every time I reach for it the battery is dead.  Every time you bump the base the various heads fall all over the counter.  I previously had a $10 Conair trimmer that ran on C batterys that outperformed this POS all day long.</li>
            <li> This hair grooming set is much better than the first Remington set.  It has five heads for various cuts and trims. It is a clever design and well made. It also has a screen shaver that works well for places you don&#x27;t want to use a blade shaver on.  It is well made and all heads work well.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Says head to toe, but it doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer level low enough to trim my beard. Also, the unit doesn&#x27;t hold a charge in standby, and does not detail trim.</li>
            <li> No problems yet, works as it should and has a pretty long battery life. I&#x27;ve got pretty coarse hair though so cleaning it thoroughly gets a bit tasking. I&#x27;ve used all the head types and they work well enough. Be sure to test somewhere that&#x27;s hairy that you don&#x27;t care about though, when using the adjustable length add-ons for the two heads.</li>
            <li> LOOKS GREAT HOPE IT WORKS AS WELL AS IT LOOKS I WILL KNOW AFTER CHRISTMAS. HOPE HUBBY LIKES IT. THANKS</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, if you&#x27;ve made it this far into the review, you might want to take a quick look inward. What could I possibly say more? Or, were you hope that I would elaborate? Is there something you not telling me? Maybe, I should just go...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he really likes it and so do I because he keeps himself clean cut and shaved. He is one who doesn&#x27;t like the barber. this product is excellent and works great!!! Battery life seems to be great! overall I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very powerful to begin with but the attachments are nice. Never held a charge for very long and now it holds no charge :-( I had it a couple year but never used it often.</li>
            <li> Great product!  This is a replacement of an earlier model bought in 2009.  It has worked great and well worth it if you can grow  facial hair!!!</li>
            <li> Very cheap. Does not hold a charge very long, Good for a few uses per charge.</li>
            <li> This trimmer I just had to replace, Keep it charged all the time. It is great to use for a body trimmer and a beard trimmer too</li>
            <li> This thing will cut hair ok, but I find most of the attachments don&#x27;t work particularly well, and are all flimsy and cheap. The biggest problem here is the battery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The battery goes through a charge FAST but takes a while to charge up. After a year (not frequent use, only charging when fully drained) the battery has a charge for about 10 seconds before I have to charge it again for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You can not plug in and run off a cord. They give you a nice long cord, suggesting this might be possible, but when you turn the razor on it stops charging and runs off the battery. This is very poor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I find this product useless. It has a lot of bells and whistles, but it completely fails to trim hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy something else or at least get a corded (not battery operated) model.</li>
            <li> works great and keep a charge for a long time, says my brother in law. This was a gift for him.</li>
            <li> Good for a man with a beard</li>
            <li> After reviewing many of the grooming units on Amazon I am exceedingly pleased that I chose this Remington PG520B.  It is a very well made unit and does all that I require with ease of operation.  The main unit and accessories are well made and stand up to frequent use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would ever purchase one of these but glad I got this one. It has more attachments than any I have seen. Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> this item was exactly what i needed and it works as advertised. I like the fact you can use it while it is plugged in recharging.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. I regret buying it. It doesn&#x27;t even work while plugged up when it does die. It doesn&#x27;t even last  five minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 8 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I love the trimmer itself. Works very well, the attachments are very useful and it gives a close trim, all over the body.&lt;br /&gt;Here I am, 8 months later and unless I use it immediately after a charge, the battery drains completely before I get a chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It has become almost worthless unless I plan my trims very precisely.&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame.</li>
            <li> Very complete with a good price. Works very well !</li>
            <li> Piece of junk, plastic handle cracked within 4 months, attachments will not stay in!</li>
            <li> Ultimately nothing wrong with the product... but a small gripe. The motor even when fully charged doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s got much &#x27;oomph&#x27; I&#x27;ve only been using it as a body hair trimmer with the side facing razor attachment. The batteries last as long as I need them to, and everything works as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s supposed to... I was expecting something with perhaps the vigorousness of my other electric face razor&#x27;s beart trimmer attachment. That thing almost seems like it&#x27;s going to buzz right off the handle!</li>
            <li> Battery barely holds a charge. Replaced it with a plug in style.</li>
            <li> the attachments pictured are not the same as what comes with the item</li>
            <li> This is a great grooming kit.  Easy to use and the manufacturer has easy to order replacement parts and accessories.</li>
            <li> Has lot Of bells and whistles but some of them are not that good. The body hair trimmer is not that strong it seems to lose strength quickly.the big beard trimmer is pretty good and does what you would expect. The close trimmer works great and gets as close as you need without a razor. The razor works good after using the fine trimmer. All in all it&#x27;s pretty good but a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> As others have reported, this trimmer only works marginally when new, and for me the battery life fell off rapidly and the unit would not hold a charge at all after just 6 months. Without a replaceable battery this is not a product.</li>
            <li> This product was fine at the outset. It was cheap (elaboration below) and it functioned. Notice both of those are in the past tense. When I bought this on Amazon earlier this year it was only $20. Not on sale. Not discounted. Just $20. I don&#x27;t know who in the world Remington thinks they are selling this cheapy, plastic set for $120.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under no circumstances should anybody buy this product at $120.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, it stopped working. As other reviews have mentioned, the battery stopped holding a charge. It should be noted that I have only used this razor maybe 5-8 times because I need it very often, and the battery still has already died. It now operates at full power for roughly 5 minutes before beginning to losing power and quickly dwindling down to a complete stop. It should be noted that even when the battery was &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; it didn&#x27;t hold a charge very well. On my first go I charged it up all the way, used it, then put it away. I later came back to it for another shave, expecting it to work just fine and half way through it lost power. At maximum capacity the charge only lasted about 30-40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now I would suggest that nobody buy this product, even if they do lower the price. The only reason this isn&#x27;t a 1 star review is that at one point in time it did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to contact the seller about a replacement. If I find customer service to be helpful and the replacement (should I get one) to be satisfactory, I will update this review to reflect that. Otherwise you can assume it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> I had 2 of the previous one (PG250) Both lasted 4 to 5 years until the battery died. Since they were both nicad powered, I would use it until it got slow, then plug it in rather than keep it on the charger. They were great. This is better, with improved cutter head designs. Yes, the base is a little flimsy but the old one was too, and its not a problem. For this price, I doubt there is a better grooming kit at twice the price.</li>
            <li> Good wouldn&#x27;t try to cut your hea?d hair but good for body hair</li>
            <li> Works okay the best at cutting or trimming.</li>
            <li> The recipient of this gift was very happy with it.  The packaging was very attractive and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived quickly and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is disappointing on many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large clippers are vastly underpowered or poorly designed. In other words, they don&#x27;t cut hair without a lot of work. Seems like the primary job of clippers is to cut hair. The adapter is way too tall to be useful for much of anything. The smaller clipper head has a much lower adapter, but only works on the lowest setting. If you set it higher, as soon as it meets any resistance, like when sliding on skin, it clicks down to the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers will cut you if you don&#x27;t use the adapters. Be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge light is always amber. It&#x27;s not a charge light, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;I&#x27;m plugged in&amp;#34; light. It does not change color or flash or anything to show you the battery is charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb clipper seems useless. With that adapter attached, it didn&#x27;t seem to cut hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this a 2 instead of a 1 is because it is cheap. The power switch is positive and it stays on and has a good solid click to it when turning it off. Other than that, there&#x27;s not much good about this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time. Try something different.</li>
            <li> Bought a couple years ago. Battery is starting to go but when charged it works great and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> My bf loved this for his birthday. He really enjoys it and it is good for a very close shave</li>
            <li> Have used other products such as Conair but they do not compare to this one.  This grooming kit does everything you could possibly think of and does it excellent.  It is well made and sturdy don&#x27;t think this one will fall apart the way the Conair one did twice.  Am glad I decided to go with the Remington because of the quality of it and everything it can do, they thought of everything, and head to toe as they claim.  This is so worth buying no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have went through tons of miniture grooming clippers and they all break so easily. Plus you don&#x27;t get all the fancy connectors/adapters that this Remington PG520B provides.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to discover the best trademark of eletronic shavers (I have already tried Phillips, Gillete, etc.), then I knew Remignton. I used to have another grooming of its and I loved. However it got older (more than 8 years), and the battery wasn&#x27;t recharging well.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to buy another body grooming kit and it had to be from Remington (it&#x27;s the best trademark for personal use).&lt;br /&gt;Because of the negative commentaries posted here, I was afraid of buying this one. However, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the product. On the contrary, it&#x27;s simply perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this.  I&#x27;ve had one that I bought 5 years ago.  It finally died.  This new Remington Body Grooming Kit is amazing!  I can trim from head to toe...  which I did!  Now I&#x27;m a new person!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement trimmer for a Norelco.  The large trimmer guide can not be adjusted low enough to use as a body/beard trimmer.  The small trimmer attachment and guide can, but the way it&#x27;s designed, it&#x27;s impossible to get a consistent length on the area you are trimming, and it&#x27;s to small and time consuming.  The vertical attachment guide is too bulky, can not get not close enough to the blade, and can not get the hair as short as desired.  On paper this one looked like a winner, especially with a name &amp;#34;head to toe&amp;#34;, however for me it&#x27;s a loser.  Back to Norelco for me, the $15 all in one works much better and has a lot more adjustments.</li>
            <li> Product does not function well. It does not give a close shave. Attachments are flimsy and not worth the money Ispent on this. Spend a little more to get a good device. Happy to return!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that comes with a stand. It keeps everything in it&#x27;s place and neat Worth it.</li>
            <li> I have less hair than I used to and now cut (buzz) my own.  This device cuts my hair, trims my mustache, grooms hair in other places - nose, ears,etc.  And does it all well.  The batter holds adequate charge and it is very easy to handle.  I love it.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment would be an accurate way to describe my feelings about this hair trimmer. It&#x27;s underpowered, the attachments aren&#x27;t useful, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The straight-line trimmer is sufficient for minor trimming but the ear/nose hair trimmer is not sharp enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for the whole family. There are so many attachments and ways to use the Remington Grooming Kit. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and lightweight. The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this little grooming station.  It holds it&#x27;s charge and has all the attachments he needs.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Pathetic. Battery lost its ability to charge after a few weeks of use. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> After having this for a few months the battery decided to stop holding a charge long term so now if I charge it for an hour or two the battery will run out within seconds when attempting to trim. Might have been bad luck but I might look into getting something else later.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- The basic trimmer gets the job done, and each of the accessory parts get the job done as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Loses battery life quickly; I have to pre-charge it for awhile each time or else it will die on me mid-shave&lt;br /&gt;- The cheap plastic container tray: doesn&#x27;t just fail to hold the pieces in place, so much as the pieces seem to actively jump out of the tray.</li>
            <li> El mejor regalo que he dado, lo usa para cortarse el cabello, arreglarse la barba, bigote y demas, es muy practico</li>
            <li> Totally sucks! Do not waste your money! I&#x27;m not very hairy and it still sucks!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf. I thought the shear would look a bit bigger, idk why.  He used it and said it works okay. He likes it. I&#x27;m just waiting for him to use all the attachments and see if it works well. But i like the little attachments, they are all useful to him. Saw some bad reviews and was skeptical about purchasing so i&#x27;ll await his trial a few more times and update my review.</li>
            <li> It works fine. Lots of useful accessories, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap but it should last as my last clipper worked for 7 years so this one should last just as long.</li>
            <li> If you need something to enhance your personal grooming, this is it! Very lightweight and easy to use - very reasonably priced and well-constructed!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, have tried others and they do not compare, would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
