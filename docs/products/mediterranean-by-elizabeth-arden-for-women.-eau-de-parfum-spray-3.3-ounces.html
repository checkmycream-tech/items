            <li>I have told many of my friends as well</li>
            <li>I really got a great deal on this one.</li>
            <li>I feel in love with the body lotion version of this one.</li>
            <li>, so i was thinking the perfume would be better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It does smell better after the dry-down.</li>
            <li>The bottle is really big, and the scent is wonderful!</li>
            <li>This is my daughters favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t overly love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok to me - wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>i love elizabeth arden products;  this is a nice fragrance; not too sweet; i bought the body lotion to go with it.</li>
            <li>Its a very beautiful and soft mix of florals with an underlying fresh sea scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy and surprised that I found this here...</li>
            <li>Now I am thrilled, it lasts all day and smells so fresh</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely mild fragrance that I recieve many compliments on.</li>
            <li>Mediterranean by Elizabeth Arden is a wonderful perfume with floral / woody notes, just perfect for those special summer occasions (cant bring myself to use it everyday, seems too exotic for daily wear to me).</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it and for an affordable price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, but it fades too quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very cheap for a perfume and its worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I bought this bottle and it was huge</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price for this perfume, as far as I have found so far.</li>
            <li>The bottle was huge, so I got a lot for my money.  </li>
            <li>We both liked it and were about to purchase straight from EA.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because I love fresh ocean-like scents.  </li>
            <li>I do still enjoy wearing it while it lasts.</li>
            <li>The perfume is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>That you carry it at a more reasonable price is even better.  </li>
            <li>Very nice choice smells terrific</li>
            <li>A very light and crisp yet noticeable scent...</li>
            <li>All I can think of when I wear it is a swimming pool at a cheap motel where they have chosen to add an overdose of chlorine to convince everyone how clean the pool is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light, smells clean, and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this at Marshall&#x27;s</li>
            <li>a normal fragance for women, i shav smell betters fragances but nice for the price</li>
            <li>But, this fragrance is lite and smells clean.</li>
            <li>got this for a decent price at Amazon, and it was shipped safely without any to-do.</li>
            <li>my wife hates overly bold perfumes</li>
            <li>The product also arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li>One of the most classic perfumes of Arden</li>
            <li>for a perfume, I have to use more than normal sort of like a toilette water.  </li>
            <li>Girlfriend loved it, she&#x27;s been looking for this perfume for a long time I found it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>really enjoy it dry, and I would wear it more often ... if it wasn&#x27;t for that plastic magnolia!</li>
            <li>I must say it was a great deal as it cost me about 35-40% less than what I got from Macy&#x27;s and others.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use and</li>
            <li>This smells divine, it&#x27;s the only kind I use.  </li>
            <li>Worth, TX</li>
            <li>I like the fresh outdoors</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this perfume for a long time and I finally found it at a super great price.</li>
            <li>I bought on a whim but hoped for and expected a much more clean and beachy scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, but only once it dries and the chemical smell wears off.</li>
            <li>Thanks for putting me in the doghouse!</li>
            <li>, I 100% suggest you buy it for someone ;)</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and have purchased it on several occasions at another store.  </li>
            <li>and I got it at a really affordable price!</li>
            <li>The younger groups like it the most.</li>
            <li>I love the package; it is reminiscent of the Mediterranean.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more from them.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m a big Elizabeth Arden fan I didn&#x27;t fall in love with this scent.</li>
            <li>I get endless  compliments own this scent.</li>
            <li>I first bought Mediterranean at a Macy&#x27;s store after being attracted to both the packaging and the unique scent (not flowery or overly heavy like many women&#x27;s perfumes).</li>
            <li>The smell of this perfume is amazing, it&#x27;s along the lines of Cool water, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long though.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable when compared to the normal retail locations.</li>
            <li>at first it seems like it&#x27;s very average fragrance item, but when you use it all the time it creates crisp, uplifting aura and sends refreshing waves around you every time you move....</li>
            <li>but cost was way too much.</li>
            <li>It is very diluted.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and what I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune</li>
            <li>shipping is fast too</li>
            <li>the price is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not so happy with it :-(.</li>
            <li>Good fragrance for serious style.</li>
            <li>It is none of these things to me, but rather one similar to nearly most of the recent &#x27;cheap&#x27; celebrity scents, all of no particular distinction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had at least 4 strangers tell me I smell nice (</li>
            <li>Also, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last long - so for those of you that like it, you will be going through it more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not great, on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is pretty big too.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The receipt told me the scent was exactly the same as all the others she had bought.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, classy, feminine, fragrance, which will never over power.  </li>
            <li>but she wanted Mediterranean Breeze not plain old Mediterranean.  </li>
            <li>I do Reapply if i am near it.</li>
            <li>THROW IT AWAY DIRECTLY TO THE GARBAGE CAN.</li>
            <li>I also loved Organza Indecence Eau de Parfum by Givenchy, but that was discontinued too and I can get it, but it&#x27;s really expensive.</li>
            <li>It is light and not strong, so you can smell it but not a mile away.</li>
            <li>which is a bit odd, if you really think about it!!)</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents, so I was extremely disappointed when the company discontinued it AND extremely excited when I found I could still get it on AMAZON !</li>
            <li>I sent the seller an email and they responded the next day and said they would ship a new one.</li>
            <li>and I paid $20.00 for a much smaller bottle and needless to say it didn&#x27;t last long since my daughter loves to smell good too...</li>
            <li>the bottle reminds me of summer days spent at the beach, with its vivid blue colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Mediterranean by Elizabeth Arden is a wonderful perfume with floral / woody notes, just perfect for those special summer occasions (cant bring myself to use it everyday, seems too exotic for daily wear to me).</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it and for an affordable price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, but it fades too quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very cheap for a perfume and its worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle and it was huge</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price for this perfume, as far as I have found so far.</li>
            <li> The bottle was huge, so I got a lot for my money.  </li>
            <li> We both liked it and were about to purchase straight from EA.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I love fresh ocean-like scents.  </li>
            <li> I do still enjoy wearing it while it lasts.</li>
            <li> The perfume is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> That you carry it at a more reasonable price is even better.  </li>
            <li> Very nice choice smells terrific</li>
            <li> A very light and crisp yet noticeable scent...</li>
            <li> All I can think of when I wear it is a swimming pool at a cheap motel where they have chosen to add an overdose of chlorine to convince everyone how clean the pool is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light, smells clean, and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at Marshall&#x27;s</li>
            <li> a normal fragance for women, i shav smell betters fragances but nice for the price</li>
            <li> But, this fragrance is lite and smells clean.</li>
            <li> got this for a decent price at Amazon, and it was shipped safely without any to-do.</li>
            <li> my wife hates overly bold perfumes</li>
            <li> The product also arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li> One of the most classic perfumes of Arden</li>
            <li> for a perfume, I have to use more than normal sort of like a toilette water.  </li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it, she&#x27;s been looking for this perfume for a long time I found it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> really enjoy it dry, and I would wear it more often ... if it wasn&#x27;t for that plastic magnolia!</li>
            <li> I must say it was a great deal as it cost me about 35-40% less than what I got from Macy&#x27;s and others.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and</li>
            <li> This smells divine, it&#x27;s the only kind I use.  </li>
            <li> Worth, TX</li>
            <li> I like the fresh outdoors</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a long time and I finally found it at a super great price.</li>
            <li> I bought on a whim but hoped for and expected a much more clean and beachy scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, but only once it dries and the chemical smell wears off.</li>
            <li> Thanks for putting me in the doghouse!</li>
            <li> , I 100% suggest you buy it for someone ;)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have purchased it on several occasions at another store.  </li>
            <li> and I got it at a really affordable price!</li>
            <li> The younger groups like it the most.</li>
            <li> I love the package; it is reminiscent of the Mediterranean.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more from them.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m a big Elizabeth Arden fan I didn&#x27;t fall in love with this scent.</li>
            <li> I get endless  compliments own this scent.</li>
            <li> I first bought Mediterranean at a Macy&#x27;s store after being attracted to both the packaging and the unique scent (not flowery or overly heavy like many women&#x27;s perfumes).</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is amazing, it&#x27;s along the lines of Cool water, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long though.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable when compared to the normal retail locations.</li>
            <li> at first it seems like it&#x27;s very average fragrance item, but when you use it all the time it creates crisp, uplifting aura and sends refreshing waves around you every time you move....</li>
            <li> but cost was way too much.</li>
            <li> It is very diluted.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and what I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune</li>
            <li> shipping is fast too</li>
            <li> the price is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not so happy with it :-(.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance for serious style.</li>
            <li> It is none of these things to me, but rather one similar to nearly most of the recent &#x27;cheap&#x27; celebrity scents, all of no particular distinction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 4 strangers tell me I smell nice (</li>
            <li> Also, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last long - so for those of you that like it, you will be going through it more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not great, on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in is pretty big too.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The receipt told me the scent was exactly the same as all the others she had bought.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, classy, feminine, fragrance, which will never over power.  </li>
            <li> but she wanted Mediterranean Breeze not plain old Mediterranean.  </li>
            <li> I do Reapply if i am near it.</li>
            <li> THROW IT AWAY DIRECTLY TO THE GARBAGE CAN.</li>
            <li> I also loved Organza Indecence Eau de Parfum by Givenchy, but that was discontinued too and I can get it, but it&#x27;s really expensive.</li>
            <li> It is light and not strong, so you can smell it but not a mile away.</li>
            <li> which is a bit odd, if you really think about it!!)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents, so I was extremely disappointed when the company discontinued it AND extremely excited when I found I could still get it on AMAZON !</li>
            <li> I sent the seller an email and they responded the next day and said they would ship a new one.</li>
            <li> and I paid $20.00 for a much smaller bottle and needless to say it didn&#x27;t last long since my daughter loves to smell good too...</li>
            <li> the bottle reminds me of summer days spent at the beach, with its vivid blue colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> subtle yet powerful and long lasting</li>
            <li> The bottle is hard to hold, although pretty, and there&#x27;s a lot for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume I&#x27;ve become a regular for, and I consider it my signature scent because of it - anyone who tries it will probably end up doing the same!</li>
            <li> I tried a sample at the store, but after using this a while, I realized it was a cross between fabric softener and a little old lady-ish-mothball-ish</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but it has been become difficult to find in the usual places for anywhere near what Amazon sells it for.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long...</li>
            <li> Not one of those tiny samples I have been tricked into buying from other sellers.  </li>
            <li> Hopeyou keep it in stock for a very long time.</li>
            <li> LOL Not in a Bad smell way but in a Weak purfume cent.</li>
            <li> but the smell seemed a little different.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few perfumes my DH actually has said anything about.</li>
            <li> My wife did not really like this perfume all that well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than expected</li>
            <li> The fragrance was not what I expected....</li>
            <li> I was expecting something fresher tenuous better than this,but it makes me sick</li>
            <li> its not a real strong scent...</li>
            <li> This parfum spray smells expensive but is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel a little unclean....  </li>
            <li> I use it as an everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for quite a few years now...</li>
            <li> No strong flower smell or sandlewood.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on in the morning before work then again at home on my lunch break</li>
            <li> It has become hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> I was afraid that were were out of luck, but low &amp; behold</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed but at least the responded to my email and re-sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> this is you scent of preference you will find it very hard to beat the price it is selling for on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and does not overwhelm you.</li>
            <li> sorry it has been discontnued</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a blind buy based on reviews I read.</li>
            <li> Had been unable to findit since it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> stale  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a casual smell that is versatile.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> I hate it!!!</li>
            <li> sorry Elizabeth Arden!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice choice smells terrific</li>
            <li> My wife had been using this perfume and ran out. We both liked it and were about to purchase straight from EA. They wanted 3 times what Amazon had it for. It smells great and they shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and will continue to purchase it through Amazon, great smell!!!</li>
            <li> I first bought Mediterranean at a Macy&#x27;s store after being attracted to both the packaging and the unique scent (not flowery or overly heavy like many women&#x27;s perfumes). I continue to buy it and love to use amazon to get the best deal. It&#x27;s the only perfume I&#x27;ve become a regular for, and I consider it my signature scent because of it - anyone who tries it will probably end up doing the same! I&#x27;ve had at least 4 strangers tell me I smell nice (which is a bit odd, if you really think about it!!) Love it!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing especially blue or Mediterranean about EA Mediterranean imo. It&#x27;s good, but not great, on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the opening, it has that magnolia note that is a bit plastic-like to me. After a short drydown, Mediterranean wears like a woody musk skin scent on me. It&#x27;s one of the few perfumes my DH actually has said anything about. After a nuzzle, he said, \\&quot;You smell good.\\&quot; Translation from male-speak: \\&quot;This is one of the best things you wear. Wear it again.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy it dry, and I would wear it more often ... if it wasn&#x27;t for that plastic magnolia!</li>
            <li> Mediterranean by Elizabeth Arden is a wonderful perfume with floral / woody notes, just perfect for those special summer occasions (cant bring myself to use it everyday, seems too exotic for daily wear to me). Have got lots of compliments whenever I have worn this fragrance. the bottle reminds me of summer days spent at the beach, with its vivid blue colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for a 100ml bottle, its still possible to tuck this inside your purse for an evening out, unlike all the tall cylindrical bottles you get out there! For me thats a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for a decent price at Amazon, and it was shipped safely without any to-do. Would definitely rate my shopping experience as \\&quot;satisfactory\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for the notes that were listed. Whomever wrote the description is a very good sales person. The scent is ok, but only once it dries and the chemical smell wears off. Also, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last long - so for those of you that like it, you will be going through it more.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I love fresh ocean-like scents.  Its a very beautiful and soft mix of florals with an underlying fresh sea scent.  I really love this scent!  I usually put it on in the morning before work then again at home on my lunch break I refresh it.</li>
            <li> I love Elizabeth Arden perfumes and when I saw this I just had to have it, it smells great. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m so happy and surprised that I found this here...Saved a lot of $.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Just as described.</li>
            <li> This has always been my go-to perfume. I feel naked without it. It&#x27;s great for any season!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at Marshall&#x27;s and I paid $20.00 for a much smaller bottle and needless to say it didn&#x27;t last long since my daughter loves to smell good too...LOL!  I bought this bottle and it was huge and I told my daughter she is banned from using it since I am buying her own smell good for her upcoming birthday!  Great bargain and has a clean refreshing scent reminds me of Clinique Happy!</li>
            <li> i am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I have been trying to buy this perfume for years, was captivated by the smell but hesitated on buying. Now I am thrilled, it lasts all day and smells so fresh</li>
            <li> i love elizabeth arden products;  this is a nice fragrance; not too sweet; i bought the body lotion to go with it. It doesnt have a lot of staying power, but maybe its just my chemistry.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite scent of mine for years. No strong flower smell or sandlewood. It&#x27;s a lovely mild fragrance that I recieve many compliments on.</li>
            <li> I was in Seattle for vacations and wanted to shop before going back. I checked this product in Macy&#x27;s and in premium outlets but cost was way too much. I, then, logged into Amazon and found this. I must say it was a great deal as it cost me about 35-40% less than what I got from Macy&#x27;s and others. Must buy!!</li>
            <li> This smells divine, it&#x27;s the only kind I use.  It has become hard to find. I love it.  Great price for the size.</li>
            <li> for a perfume, I have to use more than normal sort of like a toilette water.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this Purfume but i put it on and in 1 hour you can bearly Smell Me.  LOL Not in a Bad smell way but in a Weak purfume cent. I do Reapply if i am near it.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, very happy with the product... Strongly recommend it and for an affordable price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. Reyes&lt;br /&gt;Ft. Worth, TX</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent that gently lingers all day without being over powering. I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> A very light and crisp yet noticeable scent...my wife hates overly bold perfumes and I do as well on her...so this one is a keeper</li>
            <li> Excellent deal! Smells wonderful! I have worn this fragrance for years. This is a third of what I use to pay for Mediterranean.</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is amazing, it&#x27;s along the lines of Cool water, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long though.</li>
            <li> I did not receive my product by the date specified, so I went out and tried checking the tracking on it to see where it was. It wouldn&#x27;t let me even check the tracking and it errored out. I sent the seller an email and they responded the next day and said they would ship a new one. I did eventually receive my product but not by the day that I wanted it. I was really disappointed but at least the responded to my email and re-sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> Product did not smell as good as I thought it would.  My wife did not really like this perfume all that well.</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> item was delivered within the specified time. I bought this for a lady friend who said that she not only loves the fragrance but that she is So Madd About It.</li>
            <li> I like the notes as listed for this perfume. I like the idea of it. I like the ad. The packaging looks nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I do not like the perfume itself. It&#x27;s incredibly chemical-smelling to me. All I can think of when I wear it is a swimming pool at a cheap motel where they have chosen to add an overdose of chlorine to convince everyone how clean the pool is. I&#x27;m baffled.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but it has been become difficult to find in the usual places for anywhere near what Amazon sells it for. I have received many compliments when I wear this. Amazon has the best price for this perfume, as far as I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Very soft, classy, feminine, fragrance, which will never over power.  It smells more expensive than it is.  My guy likes clean-smelling fragrances, and this is one he&#x27;s complemented me on every time I&#x27;ve worn it.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the perfume at all. It is very diluted. I am very unhappy with this purchase. I do not suggest anyone to buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great value, I love the sixe bottle for the price it was outstanding compared to purchasing in a retail store</li>
            <li> Perfume is wonderful thanks for offering great service would buy from again</li>
            <li> sorry it has been discontnued</li>
            <li> Good fragrance for serious style.</li>
            <li> This perfume is my very favorite ... My customer wore this perfume so I decided to look for it... Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so I looked on Amazon... And What A GREAT PRICE!!! I just LOVE AMAZON !!!</li>
            <li> It has a very sweet scent and smells very good! I use it as an everyday perfume. It would not be a good perfume for special occasions, dates, or even nights out. Maybe that&#x27;s just me. It is very cheap for a perfume and its worth every cent. The bottle it comes in is pretty big too.</li>
            <li> Always loved this scent.  My favorite is Par Amour, but Clarins discontinued it.  I also loved Organza Indecence Eau de Parfum by Givenchy, but that was discontinued too and I can get it, but it&#x27;s really expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered what my girl friend wanted but she wanted Mediterranean Breeze not plain old Mediterranean.  Thanks for putting me in the doghouse!</li>
            <li> muy buen producto la mujer  encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas peque&amp;ntilde;o para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it, she&#x27;s been looking for this perfume for a long time I found it at Amazon.com. I ordered two bottles for her.  It smells great on her.&lt;br /&gt;Now girlfriend is gone. Oh Well ???? Gonna miss that perfume......</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I have ever found that I like.  The store I used to purchase it from quit carrying it and no one else had it.  That you carry it at a more reasonable price is even better.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my gf thinking it&#x27;d be great for her and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all! More than promised value for the money it&#x27;s priced at. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase, I 100% suggest you buy it for someone ;)</li>
            <li> not bad, not too good, a normal fragance for women, i shav smell betters fragances but nice for the price</li>
            <li> My spouse has been using this product for some time. It works well, not overpowering. Shipment was fast and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have purchased it on several occasions at another store.  When I saw it on Amazon I purchased it but the smell seemed a little different.  It also fades faster.  Don&#x27;t know why.  I do still enjoy wearing it while it lasts.</li>
            <li> Wow! I purchased this as a blind buy based on reviews I read. It&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s basically a sea salty floral. Very, very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from this website before and have been very pleased everytime. I have told many of my friends as well</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, but it fades too quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because of the reviews,but I don&#x27;t like it at all!!! I was expecting something fresher tenuous better than this,but it makes me sick I hate it!!! I&#x27;LL THROW IT AWAY DIRECTLY TO THE GARBAGE CAN.</li>
            <li> at first it seems like it&#x27;s very average fragrance item, but when you use it all the time it creates crisp, uplifting aura and sends refreshing waves around you every time you move....</li>
            <li> I really got a great deal on this one.The bottle was huge, so I got a lot for my money.  This is one of my favorite scents, so I was extremely disappointed when the company discontinued it AND extremely excited when I found I could still get it on AMAZON !</li>
            <li> I loved it.  Had been unable to findit since it has been discontinued.  Hopeyou keep it in stock for a very long time. Thanks</li>
            <li> beautiful scent. subtle yet powerful and long lasting</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for quite a few years now...it smells so good...its not a real strong scent...people compliment me all the time about this perfume...its very light and airy great for anytime of the year ....and what I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune</li>
            <li> My mom loved this fragrance as do I.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and I got it at a really affordable price! The product also arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li> Great Price!!!!!completely satified</li>
            <li> One of the most classic perfumes of Arden</li>
            <li> I feel in love with the body lotion version of this one. I got a lot of compliments everytime i use it, so i was thinking the perfume would be better. However, it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the lotion. It&#x27;s okay, but not so happy with it :-(.</li>
            <li> Product arrived unbroken, it is the original scent and a good value</li>
            <li> Love this product. The shipping was faster than expected and I&#x27;m very happy about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a long time and I finally found it at a super great price. I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;P.S shipping is fast too</li>
            <li> A beautiful scent in a GENEROUS size.  Not one of those tiny samples I have been tricked into buying from other sellers.  This is the real thing and has a beautiful fragrance and a lovely color.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s disclaimer about a scents and personal perception should be taken seriously.&lt;br /&gt;This scent has been described as &#x27;citrus,&#x27; &#x27;flowery,&#x27; &#x27;woody.&#x27; It is none of these things to me, but rather one similar to nearly most of the recent &#x27;cheap&#x27; celebrity scents, all of no particular distinction. It does smell better after the dry-down. The bottle is hard to hold, although pretty, and there&#x27;s a lot for the money. I have not received compliments and don&#x27;t expect any. Will probably give to a friend.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was not what I expected....I tried a sample at the store, but after using this a while, I realized it was a cross between fabric softener and a little old lady-ish-mothball-ish....  stale  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Makes me feel a little unclean....  sorry Elizabeth Arden!!!!  Your samples don&#x27;t match your product AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I am not a perfume user because I can not find anything that does overpower my senses or smells 2 blocks away. But, this fragrance is lite and smells clean. It is light and not strong, so you can smell it but not a mile away. I would buy this again...</li>
            <li> So good! nice size, you can&#x27;t complain, this perfume is so &amp;#34;sweet, good to wear it day &amp; night&amp;#34;. By Elizabeth Arden. Wonderful for a gift, or for your self, and the price was excellent! at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> The cologne or perfume smells good everybody loves it. I like it and I wear it often. The younger groups like it the most.</li>
            <li> Lovely cologne!  Hard to find</li>
            <li> This was a gift in our family Christmas exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who rec&#x27;d (and requested) this loved it. The price was very reasonable when compared to the normal retail locations. The product arrived quickly and in in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF this is you scent of preference you will find it very hard to beat the price it is selling for on Amazon. The receipt told me the scent was exactly the same as all the others she had bought.  Andshe told me that she wears it nealy every day. She rates it a 8.75 to 9.25. Therefore i can recommend this scent if it&#x27;s one you already like!</li>
            <li> The bottle is really big, and the scent is wonderful! I love the package; it is reminiscent of the Mediterranean. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite fragrance. We found it at a close out store several years ago, when she was running low I was afraid that were were out of luck, but low &amp; behold Amazon had it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, smells clean, and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  She wore it a couple of days ago and got several compliments at work.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I get endless  compliments own this scent. Bought for my sister and she is just as pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I nightly recommend it</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. This parfum spray smells expensive but is very affordable. It&#x27;s a casual smell that is versatile. Works well for work or going out.</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time and this made me very happy.  The perfume is fantastic.  It is very subtle and does not overwhelm you. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> One of my fav perfumes.  Smells great, it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long... but i still love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a nice mild pleasant fragrance.  Great for everyday use and the price is quite reasonable.  I like the fresh outdoors feel to this scent.</li>
            <li> Perfume was perfect. I love it. It smells fantastic and the price was great. I will definitely be buying more from them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t overly love it. Although I&#x27;m a big Elizabeth Arden fan I didn&#x27;t fall in love with this scent. I bought on a whim but hoped for and expected a much more clean and beachy scent. It&#x27;s just ok to me - wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
