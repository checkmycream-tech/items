            <li>Love Sigma brushes...</li>
            <li>Have had my brush for a week now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love more sigma brushes but they are pricey.</li>
            <li>This made me want to buy more sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>My favorite blush and countour brush at the moment.</li>
            <li>but i love using for my blush as well.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, I just don&#x27;t love the way this applies product</li>
            <li>Personally use it with Nars bronzers and get a wonderful effect!</li>
            <li>thought it was going to be more dense and thicker.</li>
            <li>The brush feels so soft and its a really good blush and bronzer brush!</li>
            <li>Excellent bargain, soft bristles, picks up pigment easily and shape allows pigment to be deposited accurately.</li>
            <li>I never have a problem paying a little more for a good brush (I keep my brushes forever and take very good care of them</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this brush!  </li>
            <li>I am determined to clean it weekly!</li>
            <li>their brushes are amazing, the color pick up and distribution is phenomenal , they are very affordable as well.</li>
            <li>It blends so well and cleans easy.</li>
            <li>the metal bends easily</li>
            <li>I have always bought MAC brushes and wondered why they shed so easily.  </li>
            <li>come out easily.</li>
            <li>I own several MAC brushes and I would have to say that this is just as good.</li>
            <li>Picks up just the right about of blush or bronzer and the shape makes it super easy to contour!!</li>
            <li>I received the large angled contour brush (F40) in the mail this AM and am already in love with it!</li>
            <li>Great angled brush and its super soft!</li>
            <li>I was in shock of the quality and it shipped so quickly!</li>
            <li>I think it is a good brush, the bristles are soft and it is easy to apply the bronzer or contouring powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, I think it is better than the MAC version, and I own many MAC brushes.&lt;br /&gt;PS-</li>
            <li>I am writing this review without any compensation from the company, I am not receiving anything for free.</li>
            <li>The handle fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>Cheaper to buy on Amazon for the free shipping.</li>
            <li>Not only is this a great contour brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size for covering the entirely of the cheek.</li>
            <li>This is one of the brush brands that you really splurge on for the luxurious properties and I will never compromise this kind of quality from a brush just to save some money.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and picks up powder blush really good.  </li>
            <li>Great for contouring the area that you want contoured, this product picks up the right amount of product with a soft dab into blush, contour powder or bronzer.  </li>
            <li>SUCH an amazing brush!</li>
            <li>Thanks! :)</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much that I have purchased two!</li>
            <li>But this one is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>plus to the Sigma brush is that after washing it will retain its original shape and softness.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>i understand the Price is cheaper than a M.A.C brush but the M.A.C is sooooooooo worth it!</li>
            <li>is worth it!</li>
            <li>Makes me motivated to keep it clean and washed.</li>
            <li>Nice and semi dense with a very soft feel.</li>
            <li>its sooo soft and im lookin forward to buy more sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>Love this brush so much.</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for a lovely product&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as efficient and great as any other brush.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation of the MAC blush Harmony is more noticeable with this brush than with my older one.</li>
            <li>Definitively recommended, high quality bristles, love it.</li>
            <li>blends very well and easily.</li>
            <li>This is a well made brush and very soft (and it has held up well after many cleanings), but I prefer the MAC brush.</li>
            <li>I love the way this brush works and its extremely soft!</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush and it was shipped to my house the very next morning, which was amazing.</li>
            <li>The brush shipped very quickly and was decently priced.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it is</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive to buy this brush because of the price, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Such a soft brush, great quality as always with Sigma.</li>
            <li>This is well worth it, and can be used for contour, highlight, blush, any face application.</li>
            <li>It puts the blush right where you want it to be and gets the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I found a brand that has quality brushes at such a low price.</li>
            <li>I was in dire need of an appropriate blush brush because I found my blush always looked different-</li>
            <li>However, I wanted to get a second one like the one I love, so after researching Sigma, I found out this is the one that&#x27;s like the one I have.</li>
            <li>Love my Sigma brushes, especially this.</li>
            <li>The angle really makes a world of difference ladies!</li>
            <li>It never shed once, not even on the first wash.</li>
            <li>i love every last one of them!</li>
            <li>soft, dense and secure bristles.</li>
            <li>Its super soft and gets the right amount of blush for my cheeks.</li>
            <li>The Brush is super soft and i love that its white.</li>
            <li>In all honesty, I would say save your money and buy Eco tools or Real Techniques because they&#x27;re very comparable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already washed it a couple times and it is still super soft</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>This is not the case with the Sigma Large Angled Contour</li>
            <li>Sigma really delivers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really pick up any product and doesn&#x27;t really show up on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It does its job really well.</li>
            <li>picks up and delivers powder very well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Im very Un-sastisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bristles are really flimsy.</li>
            <li>I mean, it has the softest hairs and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>The price is affordable much better than MAC, I&#x27;ll try some other type of Sigma.</li>
            <li>Blending is so easy you get such a professional look!</li>
            <li>easy to direct and apply to the desired area only.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and will be trying the other brushes as soon as I get my next paycheck!</li>
            <li>My dad got it for me for christmas, i was so excited to finally have a professional brush!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more Sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li>I love this brush, but my only issue is that I wish the brush was bigger.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous different contour brushes and so far I am pleased with the quality of Sigma&#x27;s Large Angled Contour brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, the shape and size is prefect for my cheek bones!</li>
            <li>I use it to highlight high point of cheeks and temples and hairline.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccomend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I had high expectations on Sigma, for the fact that ive read everyone reviews.</li>
            <li>Also, this is the only Sigma brush I own, so I could not tell you how it compares to their other brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and if feels very well made.</li>
            <li>I have a similar brush from Sigma travel set (not manufactured anymore) for a long time, and I love it.</li>
            <li>handle is also very pretty, though a bit too long for travel</li>
            <li>I have had MAC brushes for years and decided to find something new.  </li>
            <li>The brush feels much softer than my real sigma brush and the letters on the handle are holographic which again, is not the same.</li>
            <li>It is well made, does not shed, and is very soft.</li>
            <li>Very very soft brush.</li>
            <li>I like sigma brushes is soft  to use!  </li>
            <li>Not to mention I love the look of the black handle and white bristles.</li>
            <li>This one is noticeably bigger, and too large for my cheeks.</li>
            <li>This is way too soft for contouring, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Sturdy handle, and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>This Sigma brush is soft but continues to perform well and maintain its shape even after a couple of washes.   </li>
            <li>The brush is soft and well made</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel soft and smooth on your skin, and the coverage seems uneven when applying.</li>
            <li>They are a little spendy, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft yet firm enough to apply blush or contour cleanly.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be a bit more fluffy.</li>
            <li>I may have expected too much with all the hype on Sigma Brushes.</li>
            <li>I was getting tired of all mt MAC sheading, and glad made switch</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>

            <li> Great alternative to the MAC Contour Brush</li>
            <li> It is great to use for blush on the apples of my cheeks but also to contour the hollows of my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> Great angle too</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have discovered Sigma, as doing so has been a lot easier than buying MAC brushes on my pocket book.</li>
            <li> use this brush to apply my bronzer, but I think it would also work great for blush and</li>
            <li> Great quality, follows countour of face.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think is blends that great</li>

            <li> Have had my brush for a week now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love more sigma brushes but they are pricey.</li>
            <li> This made me want to buy more sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> My favorite blush and countour brush at the moment.</li>
            <li> but i love using for my blush as well.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, I just don&#x27;t love the way this applies product</li>
            <li> Personally use it with Nars bronzers and get a wonderful effect!</li>
            <li> thought it was going to be more dense and thicker.</li>
            <li> The brush feels so soft and its a really good blush and bronzer brush!</li>
            <li> Excellent bargain, soft bristles, picks up pigment easily and shape allows pigment to be deposited accurately.</li>
            <li> I never have a problem paying a little more for a good brush (I keep my brushes forever and take very good care of them</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this brush!  </li>
            <li> I am determined to clean it weekly!</li>
            <li> their brushes are amazing, the color pick up and distribution is phenomenal , they are very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> It blends so well and cleans easy.</li>
            <li> the metal bends easily</li>
            <li> I have always bought MAC brushes and wondered why they shed so easily.  </li>
            <li> come out easily.</li>
            <li> I own several MAC brushes and I would have to say that this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Picks up just the right about of blush or bronzer and the shape makes it super easy to contour!!</li>
            <li> I received the large angled contour brush (F40) in the mail this AM and am already in love with it!</li>
            <li> Great angled brush and its super soft!</li>
            <li> I was in shock of the quality and it shipped so quickly!</li>
            <li> I think it is a good brush, the bristles are soft and it is easy to apply the bronzer or contouring powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it is better than the MAC version, and I own many MAC brushes.&lt;br /&gt;PS-</li>
            <li> I am writing this review without any compensation from the company, I am not receiving anything for free.</li>
            <li> The handle fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> Cheaper to buy on Amazon for the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great contour brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size for covering the entirely of the cheek.</li>
            <li> This is one of the brush brands that you really splurge on for the luxurious properties and I will never compromise this kind of quality from a brush just to save some money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and picks up powder blush really good.  </li>
            <li> Great for contouring the area that you want contoured, this product picks up the right amount of product with a soft dab into blush, contour powder or bronzer.  </li>
            <li> SUCH an amazing brush!</li>
            <li> Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much that I have purchased two!</li>
            <li> But this one is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> plus to the Sigma brush is that after washing it will retain its original shape and softness.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> i understand the Price is cheaper than a M.A.C brush but the M.A.C is sooooooooo worth it!</li>
            <li> is worth it!</li>
            <li> Makes me motivated to keep it clean and washed.</li>
            <li> Nice and semi dense with a very soft feel.</li>
            <li> its sooo soft and im lookin forward to buy more sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for a lovely product&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just as efficient and great as any other brush.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation of the MAC blush Harmony is more noticeable with this brush than with my older one.</li>
            <li> Definitively recommended, high quality bristles, love it.</li>
            <li> blends very well and easily.</li>
            <li> This is a well made brush and very soft (and it has held up well after many cleanings), but I prefer the MAC brush.</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush works and its extremely soft!</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush and it was shipped to my house the very next morning, which was amazing.</li>
            <li> The brush shipped very quickly and was decently priced.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive to buy this brush because of the price, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Such a soft brush, great quality as always with Sigma.</li>
            <li> This is well worth it, and can be used for contour, highlight, blush, any face application.</li>
            <li> It puts the blush right where you want it to be and gets the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I found a brand that has quality brushes at such a low price.</li>
            <li> I was in dire need of an appropriate blush brush because I found my blush always looked different-</li>
            <li> However, I wanted to get a second one like the one I love, so after researching Sigma, I found out this is the one that&#x27;s like the one I have.</li>
            <li> Love my Sigma brushes, especially this.</li>
            <li> The angle really makes a world of difference ladies!</li>
            <li> It never shed once, not even on the first wash.</li>
            <li> i love every last one of them!</li>
            <li> soft, dense and secure bristles.</li>
            <li> Its super soft and gets the right amount of blush for my cheeks.</li>
            <li> The Brush is super soft and i love that its white.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I would say save your money and buy Eco tools or Real Techniques because they&#x27;re very comparable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already washed it a couple times and it is still super soft</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> This is not the case with the Sigma Large Angled Contour</li>
            <li> Sigma really delivers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really pick up any product and doesn&#x27;t really show up on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It does its job really well.</li>
            <li> picks up and delivers powder very well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Im very Un-sastisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bristles are really flimsy.</li>
            <li> I mean, it has the softest hairs and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> The price is affordable much better than MAC, I&#x27;ll try some other type of Sigma.</li>
            <li> Blending is so easy you get such a professional look!</li>
            <li> easy to direct and apply to the desired area only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied and will be trying the other brushes as soon as I get my next paycheck!</li>
            <li> My dad got it for me for christmas, i was so excited to finally have a professional brush!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more Sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, but my only issue is that I wish the brush was bigger.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous different contour brushes and so far I am pleased with the quality of Sigma&#x27;s Large Angled Contour brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, the shape and size is prefect for my cheek bones!</li>
            <li> I use it to highlight high point of cheeks and temples and hairline.</li>
            <li> Would highly reccomend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I had high expectations on Sigma, for the fact that ive read everyone reviews.</li>
            <li> Also, this is the only Sigma brush I own, so I could not tell you how it compares to their other brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and if feels very well made.</li>
            <li> I have a similar brush from Sigma travel set (not manufactured anymore) for a long time, and I love it.</li>
            <li> handle is also very pretty, though a bit too long for travel</li>
            <li> I have had MAC brushes for years and decided to find something new.  </li>
            <li> The brush feels much softer than my real sigma brush and the letters on the handle are holographic which again, is not the same.</li>
            <li> It is well made, does not shed, and is very soft.</li>
            <li> Very very soft brush.</li>
            <li> I like sigma brushes is soft  to use!  </li>
            <li> Not to mention I love the look of the black handle and white bristles.</li>
            <li> This one is noticeably bigger, and too large for my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is way too soft for contouring, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Sturdy handle, and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> This Sigma brush is soft but continues to perform well and maintain its shape even after a couple of washes.   </li>
            <li> The brush is soft and well made</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel soft and smooth on your skin, and the coverage seems uneven when applying.</li>
            <li> They are a little spendy, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft yet firm enough to apply blush or contour cleanly.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bit more fluffy.</li>
            <li> I may have expected too much with all the hype on Sigma Brushes.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of all mt MAC sheading, and glad made switch</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later it broke completely.</li>
            <li> It is similar to more expensive brushes that I have previously bought.</li>
            <li> The brush is also too soft and splays out with only a light touch...which is bad for precision.</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as nice as my real Sigma angled brush that I ordered from their website and it does not perform well at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and fluffy which allows blush to be applied evenly.  </li>
            <li> Prefer the mad version better.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t pick up my  dark contour powder enough when I contour !</li>
            <li> I use it every single day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush for several months, and I anticipate it will hold up for years with a little TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived in expected time.</li>
            <li> I spent about 18 on this product.</li>
            <li> The bristles are  a little too loose/ long for my preference.</li>
            <li> I have medium to dark skin</li>
            <li> After using this product for less than a month the metal part of the brush began to loosen from the handle.</li>
            <li> and I have little black hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have washed it and there was little to no shedding.  </li>
            <li> but the brush is a little bit too think for my liking when it comes to contouring.</li>
            <li> Contouring under my cheekbones with the bronzer and applying a little color to my cheeks with the blush.   </li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply product heavily</li>
            <li> I reach for it everyday to apply bronzed and highlighter.</li>
            <li> I used to have a cheaper contouring brush from sally beauty (Face Secret), but when I tried this, was totally different.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds very little.</li>
            <li> too small for blush use</li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed by how small the brush actually is.</li>
            <li> Once i tried the Sigma Large Angled Contour - F40 it SUCKS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have 3 MAC brushes, but I felt I must switch to a new brand to escape the often outrageous prices of their products!</li>
            <li> my last blush brush was horrific!</li>
            <li> i got a fake brush.</li>
            <li> its just a bad fake of this brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with my purchase</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> really disappointed.</li>
            <li> hate it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the worst brush I have ever used for blush.  </li>
            <li> i still use it but its a horrible quality.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m about 80% sure this brush is a fake. It is not nearly as nice as my real Sigma angled brush that I ordered from their website and it does not perform well at all. The brush feels much softer than my real sigma brush and the letters on the handle are holographic which again, is not the same. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with my purchase</li>
            <li> I was in dire need of an appropriate blush brush because I found my blush always looked different- sometimes lovely and something eek.  This brush is perfect!  It&#x27;s soft and fluffy which allows blush to be applied evenly.  After the initial wash I have not seen any shedding.  Love this brush!</li>
            <li> I have a similar brush from Sigma travel set (not manufactured anymore) for a long time, and I love it. However, I wanted to get a second one like the one I love, so after researching Sigma, I found out this is the one that&#x27;s like the one I have. I received it and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is way too soft for contouring, if you ask me. But great as a blush brush for me. Washes nicely, dries overnight, no fallout.</li>
            <li> The brush feels so soft and its a really good blush and bronzer brush!</li>
            <li> Estoy armando mis colecci&amp;oacute;n de brochas , y siempre conoc&amp;iacute;a las otras famosas que son buenas pero son muy caras y mas las brochas de la cara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buscando y viendo video de Youtube , escuche hablar de estas y decid&amp;iacute; probarlas ademas que son mas econ&amp;oacute;micas.</li>
            <li> This was a gift but I was told she really liked this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for countouring! My dad got it for me for christmas, i was so excited to finally have a professional brush! It makes all the difference! Make sure to clean the sigma brushes to keep up its amazing quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Sigma but have always heard good things about their brushes. So, in need of a contour brush I turned to Sigma. The brush shipped very quickly and was decently priced. I never have a problem paying a little more for a good brush (I keep my brushes forever and take very good care of them so I believe in investing in quality brushes). Well I must say THIS is a quality brush. Perfect size for contouring and very soft. Not to mention I love the look of the black handle and white bristles. I&#x27;m very satisfied and will be trying the other brushes as soon as I get my next paycheck!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for  contouring the face and blush.  The bristles are soft and if feels very well made. I&#x27;m happy with it and will purchase more Sigma brushes. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> too small for blush use</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday and have no complaints. It is well made, does not shed, and is very soft. It is great for contouring. Personally, I think it is better than the MAC version, and I own many MAC brushes.&lt;br /&gt;PS- I am writing this review without any compensation from the company, I am not receiving anything for free. Also, this is the only Sigma brush I own, so I could not tell you how it compares to their other brushes. Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much. It&#x27;s super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. I&#x27;ve already washed it a couple times and it is still super soft</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my F40 sigma brush and brushes.. For the ones that don&#x27;t like it because it is or is not a MAC dupe did some one see your face and say oh your makeup looks off today? I just saying some ppl need to stop. Thanks Sigma for keeping the world beautiful at this price...(\\&quot;&gt;</li>
            <li> Great for using as a contour brush with your bronzer or as blusher. Only lost a star because actual brush head looks bigger in the pictures</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, very pleased!</li>
            <li> I like sigma brushes is soft  to use!  This brush is really cheap compare to mac brushes!</li>
            <li> Life changing contouring blush brush!</li>
            <li> Great for contouring the area that you want contoured, this product picks up the right amount of product with a soft dab into blush, contour powder or bronzer.  Blending is so easy you get such a professional look!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this brush!  I have washed it and there was little to no shedding.  Application with this product is flawless.  I love the feel of the brush.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much that I have purchased two! The bristles are very soft, the shape and size is prefect for my cheek bones! The handle fits comfortably in your hand.  I love using it for blush and contouring! It is one of my all time favorite brushes and I defintely reccomend purchasing it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush and it was shipped to my house the very next morning, which was amazing. I love the way this brush works and its extremely soft! will be buying more</li>
            <li> At 1st i was scared to buy this product but so happy i did i love to apply it with blush also as the name says contour. its sooo soft and im lookin forward to buy more sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product by Sigma Beaty. Excellent quality! I was travelling in US and it just arrived on time at my friends house.</li>
            <li> I really love it !! It as good as my MAC brushes! The price is affordable much better than MAC, I&#x27;ll try some other type of Sigma.</li>
            <li> I had to give this brush 5 stars! I am completely in love with it! It&#x27;s really soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed. It&#x27;s softness doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin- my last blush brush was horrific! But this one is definitely worth every penny! Since it&#x27;s white I am determined to clean it weekly! I will definitely purchase more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> great brush for blush but doesn&#x27;t blend that well. Still very good quality. In all honesty, I would say save your money and buy Eco tools or Real Techniques because they&#x27;re very comparable!</li>
            <li> The brush is smaller than I imagined, but I&#x27;m glad because it really is a nice perfect size and I was wondering if it&#x27;d be too big. Sturdy handle, and soft bristles. Sigma really delivers. c:</li>
            <li> Love my Sigma brushes, especially this.</li>
            <li> The Brush is super soft and i love that its white. Makes me motivated to keep it clean and washed. Picks up just the right about of blush or bronzer and the shape makes it super easy to contour!!</li>
            <li> After using this product for less than a month the metal part of the brush began to loosen from the handle. A few weeks later it broke completely.</li>
            <li> Excellent bargain, soft bristles, picks up pigment easily and shape allows pigment to be deposited accurately. Will repurchase if needed.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much I recommended it to my girlfriends :) Great angled brush and its super soft!</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this product. Must have!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and useful brush, you can use it for blush, very easy to use for higlighting, you can even use it for contouring but I suggest for countouring to use F05</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush.  Perfect for contouring.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good blush brush. It doesn&#x27;t really pick up any product and doesn&#x27;t really show up on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Arrived in expected time.</li>
            <li> Sigma equals quality!  A must have make up tool!</li>
            <li> Great brush. It is similar to more expensive brushes that I have previously bought. It&#x27;s a great addition if you are looking to do some contouring.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for me ! I have medium to dark skin but it doesn&#x27;t pick up my  dark contour powder enough when I contour ! I was disappointed. Fair skin it will work perfect.</li>
            <li> It does its job really well. I mean, it has the softest hairs and feels good on your skin. The design of the product is also something very attractive about it. I used this brush for blush, not contouring. It puts the blush right where you want it to be and gets the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Prefer the mad version better. The bristles are  a little too loose/ long for my preference. Doesn&#x27;t keep the powder as concentrated as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Super soft. Fits perfectly onto my cheek bone area which is great for contouring. Cheaper to buy on Amazon for the free shipping. Comes with wash instructions as well</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use for contouring with powdered bronzer. The quality of the brush is great, it holds on to the product well but the brush is a little bit too think for my liking when it comes to contouring.</li>
            <li> I use the f40 to contour my cheeks and around my face and I love it!  Nice and semi dense with a very soft feel.</li>
            <li> good size, shape for contouring. picks up and delivers powder very well. handle is also very pretty, though a bit too long for travel</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for applying blush. I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality. I use it every single day! I&#x27;ve already cleaned it twice and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I will definitely buy more Sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> Very good brush at a very good price</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the MAC Contour Brush #168. I have 3 MAC brushes, but I felt I must switch to a new brand to escape the often outrageous prices of their products! I truly feel I have not sacrificed quality. This Sigma brush is soft but continues to perform well and maintain its shape even after a couple of washes.   I this brush with my Nars blush and bronzer duo. Contouring under my cheekbones with the bronzer and applying a little color to my cheeks with the blush.   The angle really makes a world of difference ladies!</li>
            <li> I really love this brush.  It is great to use for blush on the apples of my cheeks but also to contour the hollows of my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> This blush brush is great! I love how soft it is and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of these brushes to try out!</li>
            <li> This was my second sigma buy their brushes are amazing, the color pick up and distribution is phenomenal , they are very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> This is a well made brush and very soft (and it has held up well after many cleanings), but I prefer the MAC brush. This one is noticeably bigger, and too large for my cheeks. The brush is also too soft and splays out with only a light touch...which is bad for precision. The MAC brush has firmer and shorter bristles.</li>
            <li> Dear sigma&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you so much for a lovely product&lt;br /&gt;  I can do with it different look with it&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I call my luxury brush. It feels like applying blush on with sunshine and clouds.  Great angle too</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and the F35 after watching a review on a beauty blog.  I needed a brush that would be good for blush and mostly contouring and this angled brush is perfect for it.  Considering the price, this is a steal.  I&#x27;m happy that I found a brand that has quality brushes at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Love this contour brush. Bristles are soft and picks up powder blush really good.  It made contouring easy peasy! Love Sigma brushes...they always make great products and their brushes has never failed me.</li>
            <li> I have had MAC brushes for years and decided to find something new.  With reading all the reviews about Sigma brushes, I wanted to see what everyone was talking about.  Have had my brush for a week now and love it.  I was getting tired of all mt MAC sheading, and glad made switch th sigma.  I only have two sigma brushes, but plan to replace all MAC brushes with sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I received the large angled contour brush (F40) in the mail this AM and am already in love with it! It screams Sigma quality from head to toe - the bristles are oh-so-soft, the shape is perfect for contouring with bronzer, and the handle is the perfect length/weight. I am so happy to have discovered Sigma, as doing so has been a lot easier than buying MAC brushes on my pocket book. Sigma, you&#x27;ve done it again. Thank you for creating a perfect product cradled in A+ customer service!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It blends so well and cleans easy. I have tried numerous different contour brushes and so far I am pleased with the quality of Sigma&#x27;s Large Angled Contour brush. They are a little spendy, but worth every penny! Also I noticed some of their brushes are cheaper if you order through Amazon, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one and P84, I use it as contour tool. I use it to highlight high point of cheeks and temples and hairline. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> this brush is so great! I have had it for about a year now. I use it with my tarte bronzer and it makes an amazing contour line! TOTALLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive to buy this brush because of the price, but it is worth every penny. I have used a variety of brushes from MAC to drugstore brands, and I&#x27;m always finding that the bristles fall out and I have little black hairs all over my face. This is not the case with the Sigma Large Angled Contour Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush to apply my bronzer, but I think it would also work great for blush and blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus to the Sigma brush is that after washing it will retain its original shape and softness. I&#x27;ve had the brush for several months, and I anticipate it will hold up for years with a little TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are awesome!  I&#x27;ll never by MAC ones again!</li>
            <li> Very very soft brush. Contours nicely. Feels good on the skin because of the softness. I took one star off for the price. I&#x27;d love more sigma brushes but they are pricey.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! This made me want to buy more sigma brushes. It never shed once, not even on the first wash. It is so soft and has the perfect weight to it. It was sent to me nicely and with a FREE travel sized E05 eyeliner brush! I didn&#x27;t even spend $30. I spent about 18 on this product. I totally recommend this product! You will not be disappointed! Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> My favorite blush and countour brush at the moment. Would highly reccomend this product to everyone. Great quality, follows countour of face.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great contour brush but i love using for my blush as well. Its super soft and gets the right amount of blush for my cheeks. It doesn&#x27;t apply product heavily so it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> i bought this one for my wife and she definitely loves it. she is a make up artist and always been bragging with this brand. quality is really awesome! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Sigma always does brushes well. It&#x27;s a great size for covering the entirely of the cheek. It&#x27;s soft yet firm enough to apply blush or contour cleanly.</li>
            <li> i cannot rave about these sigma brushes enough! i love every last one of them!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I reach for it everyday to apply bronzed and highlighter. The brush is soft and well made</li>
            <li> I may have expected too much with all the hype on Sigma Brushes. I don&#x27;t know, I just don&#x27;t love the way this applies product and I don&#x27;t think is blends that great</li>
            <li> I love this contouring brush because it does wonder for your face! It gives you the perfect shading and power to bring dimension to your face without overdoing it. It&#x27;s also great for highlighting your cheekbones so it&#x27;s the ultimate contouring/highlighting brush! Highly recommend it (:</li>
            <li> I had high expectations on Sigma, for the fact that ive read everyone reviews. Once i tried the Sigma Large Angled Contour - F40 it SUCKS!!!!! Doesnt work might as well saved my money &amp; went to the dollar store &amp; bought me a brush. Im very Un-sastisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&amp; Ladies i understand the Price is cheaper than a M.A.C brush but the M.A.C is sooooooooo worth it! I also bought the Sigma Kabuki Face Set for $80 &amp; again i will never buy another SIGMA Brush Again!!!!!!!! im staying faithful to M.A.C is worth it!</li>
            <li> I used to have a cheaper contouring brush from sally beauty (Face Secret), but when I tried this, was totally different. The pigmentation of the MAC blush Harmony is more noticeable with this brush than with my older one. Definitively recommended, high quality bristles, love it.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use love it for contouring</li>
            <li> This is the worst brush I have ever used for blush.  It doesn&#x27;t feel soft and smooth on your skin, and the coverage seems uneven when applying.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good brush, the bristles are soft and it is easy to apply the bronzer or contouring powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creo que es un buen pincel, las cerdas son suaves y es muy facil aplicar correctamente el bornzer o polvo para contorno.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent quality , like every sigma brush I have purchased. I use it as  contour / blush brush</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!!  So soft and works great as the blush brush!  Sigma brushes are the best!!</li>
            <li> Such a soft brush, great quality as always with Sigma. This is one of the brush brands that you really splurge on for the luxurious properties and I will never compromise this kind of quality from a brush just to save some money. This is well worth it, and can be used for contour, highlight, blush, any face application. Fantastic brush. Personally use it with Nars bronzers and get a wonderful effect!</li>
            <li> thought it was going to be more dense and thicker. It says &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; but it is not that big. It&#x27;s alright though I&#x27;m still going to keep it.</li>
            <li> Great and worked as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product. The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed by how small the brush actually is. I expected it to be a bit more fluffy.</li>
            <li> Just as efficient and great as any other brush. I prefer Sigma over mac anyday!</li>
            <li> I have been collecting makeup brushes for quite some time now and this brush is one of the best brushes in my collection. I own several MAC brushes and I would have to say that this is just as good. Its soft, applies the perfect amount of product, and is the perfect size. I would definitely recommend this brush</li>
            <li> i got a fake brush. hate it. really disappointed. i still use it but its a horrible quality. the metal bends easily the bristles are really flimsy. its just a bad fake of this brush</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, you can tell it&#x27;s made with quality.  I have always bought MAC brushes and wondered why they shed so easily.  This brush sheds very little.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, but my only issue is that I wish the brush was bigger.</li>
            <li> SUCH an amazing brush! I was in shock of the quality and it shipped so quickly! Which is always a perk!!! Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I have tried using this brush a couple of different ways, but my final conclusion is the bristles are just too flexible for a proper contouring brush.</li>
            <li> soft, dense and secure bristles. blends very well and easily. applies blush and contour very nicely. easy to direct and apply to the desired area only. bristles do not fall/come out easily.</li>
