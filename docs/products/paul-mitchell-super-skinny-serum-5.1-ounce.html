            <li>When I put it in her hair after it has been shampoo &amp; conditioned, I am able to brush through it like I never have before.</li>
            <li>One satisfied customer.</li>

            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I have found  using more on my hair helps control the frizz and curl more.</li>
            <li>love this, and use it every morning.</li>
            <li>Then I take another pump of the serum, rub my hands together and smooth out any fly-away strands and done!</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product because it make my hair shine and the price is better than it the salon.</li>
            <li>Love the Skinny Serum.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product...</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair shiny, smooth and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my hair soft, not puffy, and smelling great.</li>
            <li>this is a very good product for fine white hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets tangled SO EASY &amp; can be a nightmare to comb through.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shine product, its not too light and not too heavy and leaves my hair shiny and smells great too!!</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair lively and looking good all day.</li>
            <li>Really love super skinny.  </li>
            <li>I love Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum.</li>
            <li>Goes great with Rusk deep shine.</li>
            <li>Make it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Whether or not the contents are genuine</li>
            <li>With using a bit more, about three to four pumps, it actually tames a good bit of the frizz</li>
            <li>I have use this oil for my hair for years now... and leave you hair soft and silky, good for using heat tools</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would just say to be sure not to us too much product as your hair will feel too heavy and greasy---you will have to experiment with the amount that works best for you.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product at the hair salon and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>It would have to be paired with the sculpting foam or the form cream for it to work with any kind of adequacy, although this might not be the case in lower humidity areas, but personally, sometimes I just like being able to put one product on my hair, brush, and be done with it and not have to worry.  </li>
            <li>If you like your hair to be straight, non static and smooth</li>
            <li>this keeps my do in place and feels clean, not sticky.  </li>
            <li>straight on top</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes your hair very manageable, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Good enough for the price</li>
            <li>This was the early 80s, before blow-outs were trendy.</li>
            <li>It looked good, but there&#x27;s no denying I was doing A LOT of damage with daily use of the iron!&lt;br</li>
            <li>A great solution to frizzy dry hair!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, makes my hair sooo soft, you put it in while ur hair is wet and then blow dry/straighten</li>
            <li>B0016663NU PAUL MITCHELL by Paul Mitchell: SUPER SKINNY SERUM SMOOTHES AND CONDITIONS UNRULY HAIR 8.5 OZ]]</li>
            <li>My stylist uses PM Super Skinny on my hair</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell updates packaging ever so often also so if your super skinny serum isn&#x27;t in a see thru bottle beware.</li>
            <li>received product quickly.  </li>
            <li>and she used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was kind of  sceptical because the price, this is big bottle and is the original, thank goodness.</li>
            <li>and it was like instant magic!</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be worth the money</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>It is okay when incorporated with other products, but on its own, it doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for my flat iron straightened curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The product was watery and did not smell right.</li>
            <li>This is a great product - use just a little and it gets rid of all frizziness!</li>
            <li>(I may be one of the few men who regularly use this stuff; I had borrowed a squirt of it from my wife&#x27;s bottle some years back, and upon application to my own hair, was duly impressed.)  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product since i have super coarse hair</li>
            <li>This is so good to use on your hair, does not weight it down or feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, easy to comb and shiny.</li>
            <li>not greasy yet puts a shine on the hair , which is very important for white hair.</li>
            <li>I found this on amazon and was so excited to see the huge size for the tiny price!!</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I didn&#x27;t want it to be oily as others have stated, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing deep conditioning treatments and trying to get my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>keeps my hair frizz free and soft...</li>
            <li>Never in my life have I been able to actually use a hair product and have it look the way it did at the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff really soaks into damp hair after the shower!</li>
            <li>Thanks PM!</li>
            <li>In some cases it is real but in others you are taking a risk and for some who don&#x27;t get proper results that could be why,  also more often than not you will get a better price at your local salon or school.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and silky when I flat iron it, and I got even more compliments on my hair than before!</li>
            <li>a large bottle lasts almost a whole year!</li>
            <li>Because of the good reviews I gave it a go, but I notice very little difference.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might be good for straightening, but even a small amount is like putting corn syrup in your hair.  </li>
            <li>Whether I air dry or style my hair, I always used this product for better looking hair.</li>
            <li>be sure to apply to your dry hair liberally</li>
            <li>Interestingly, scrutiny of the package reveals a disclaimer section of text urging the consumer to purchase the product ONLY from professional hairdressers to avoid this exact situation.</li>
            <li>This product works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone!  </li>
            <li>stuff is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone looking simplify their hair routine!</li>
            <li>I tried it--taking care not to use too much when I straightened my hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li>I am very fussy about how my hair feels and smells.</li>
            <li>Plus this price is so much cheaper on Amazon than in any salon.</li>
            <li>and I use 6 or 7 pumps, although the product does not require this much</li>
            <li>Smoothing serum is my hair miracle, and this stuff absolutely wrecked my hair.</li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I could get the same result as my stylist because she has so much more experience.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, my ends are really dry (roots oily...love it), and I do not get my long hair trimmed as much as I should.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very frizzy and it controls it better than any other product I have found.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other serums and oils and this is by far the BEST serum for flat ironing.</li>
            <li>The size is much bigger than my original one.  </li>
            <li>I will go \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; on most any other product to save money in order to get this.</li>
            <li>I use this serum, a Sedu flat iron (amazing flat iron), and follow up afterward with a bit of moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I stepped outside, it puffed right out!  </li>
            <li>I live for this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I cant live with out this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of products to help with the frizzy hair that comes with high humidity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend,</li>
            <li>Because of the high cost, I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li>I only use one pump, working it in my ends working up to my roots for less frizzy and more manageable hair!</li>
            <li>OK, so the packaging is in my view clearly not genuine -</li>
            <li>Since i have blonde and damaged hair it makes it look fresh and new.</li>
            <li>&amp; they all can&#x27;t live without it too now.</li>
            <li>I live in somewhat of a humid climate</li>
            <li>so I ordered a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have hair almost to my waist and live in Humid Town, USA.</li>
            <li>We cannot live w/o it; when the bottle gets to 3/4 gone, I buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for 3 years now, and only just finished my first 8-oz bottle.</li>
            <li>in 2007, I went to a new stylist when my old one moved away</li>
            <li>Because my shoulder length hair tangles easily in the shower, I apply a few drops of &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; after shampooing and rinsing.</li>
            <li>It only takes one good-sized drop to tame down all of my mane of hair, which is NOT an easy thing to do. :-)</li>
            <li>When I do style my hair, it takes less time and the end result is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>It leaves my crazy mop feeling soft, looking shiny and smelling great.</li>
            <li>plan on buying a big bottle very soon.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>They think it feels so soft and looks so shiny.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/fuzzy hair, I use this when blow drying</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the difference when I touched their hair before and after application.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the saga continued into my adult life and there wasn&#x27;t a product I didn&#x27;t try with my Chi Iron.</li>
            <li>- they said I probably received an old product because they hadn&#x27;t rotated their stock correctly.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and silky with a sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this serum calms the frizz and leaves it silky</li>
            <li>The few extra dollars would&#x27;ve been better than waiting 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I would say that there is a very slight improvement when using this product as compared to when I just use the cheap tresemme spray protection from heat.  </li>
            <li>Without washing the hair, I added a lot of this product again (thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough), but the same thing happened---as soon as I walked outside, my hair got frizzy and super poofy.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and have recently moved to the shore area and with the high humidity</li>
            <li>This product is helping to get it back to normal.</li>
            <li>This stuff does make my hair dry much faster, but it leaves a coat</li>
            <li>And no other brand comes close to the quality.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no other packaging by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick yet fine.</li>
            <li>When my hair is wet, I put a dime size amount in my hands, along with a dime size amount of the Super Skinny Relaxing Balm and blow dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, actually have converted several friends of mine into using this product as well</li>
            <li>It helps keep my hair really soft and definitely lessens drying time.  </li>
            <li>main goal is to help slim hair and dry faster</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can reapply when hair is dry and gets frizzy or out of control</li>
            <li>Out of the shower I dry it slightly, and then apply a teaspoon of Super Skinny Serum, starting with the ends.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had long, curly, super THICK, very dry and damaged hair my whole life.  </li>
            <li>(I only use one little squirt) on my hair without really improving the look.  </li>

            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> but I have found  using more on my hair helps control the frizz and curl more.</li>
            <li> love this, and use it every morning.</li>
            <li> Then I take another pump of the serum, rub my hands together and smooth out any fly-away strands and done!</li>

            <li> This product keeps my hair shiny, smooth and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my hair soft, not puffy, and smelling great.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product for fine white hair.  </li>
            <li> It gets tangled SO EASY &amp; can be a nightmare to comb through.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shine product, its not too light and not too heavy and leaves my hair shiny and smells great too!!</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair lively and looking good all day.</li>
            <li> Really love super skinny.  </li>
            <li> I love Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum.</li>
            <li> Goes great with Rusk deep shine.</li>
            <li> Make it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Whether or not the contents are genuine</li>
            <li> With using a bit more, about three to four pumps, it actually tames a good bit of the frizz</li>
            <li> I have use this oil for my hair for years now... and leave you hair soft and silky, good for using heat tools</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would just say to be sure not to us too much product as your hair will feel too heavy and greasy---you will have to experiment with the amount that works best for you.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at the hair salon and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> It would have to be paired with the sculpting foam or the form cream for it to work with any kind of adequacy, although this might not be the case in lower humidity areas, but personally, sometimes I just like being able to put one product on my hair, brush, and be done with it and not have to worry.  </li>
            <li> If you like your hair to be straight, non static and smooth</li>
            <li> this keeps my do in place and feels clean, not sticky.  </li>
            <li> straight on top</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes your hair very manageable, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Good enough for the price</li>
            <li> This was the early 80s, before blow-outs were trendy.</li>
            <li> It looked good, but there&#x27;s no denying I was doing A LOT of damage with daily use of the iron!&lt;br</li>
            <li> A great solution to frizzy dry hair!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes my hair sooo soft, you put it in while ur hair is wet and then blow dry/straighten</li>
            <li> B0016663NU PAUL MITCHELL by Paul Mitchell: SUPER SKINNY SERUM SMOOTHES AND CONDITIONS UNRULY HAIR 8.5 OZ]]</li>
            <li> My stylist uses PM Super Skinny on my hair</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell updates packaging ever so often also so if your super skinny serum isn&#x27;t in a see thru bottle beware.</li>
            <li> received product quickly.  </li>
            <li> and she used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was kind of  sceptical because the price, this is big bottle and is the original, thank goodness.</li>
            <li> and it was like instant magic!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be worth the money</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> It is okay when incorporated with other products, but on its own, it doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for my flat iron straightened curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The product was watery and did not smell right.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - use just a little and it gets rid of all frizziness!</li>
            <li> (I may be one of the few men who regularly use this stuff; I had borrowed a squirt of it from my wife&#x27;s bottle some years back, and upon application to my own hair, was duly impressed.)  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product since i have super coarse hair</li>
            <li> This is so good to use on your hair, does not weight it down or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, easy to comb and shiny.</li>
            <li> not greasy yet puts a shine on the hair , which is very important for white hair.</li>
            <li> I found this on amazon and was so excited to see the huge size for the tiny price!!</li>
            <li> Sure enough, I didn&#x27;t want it to be oily as others have stated, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing deep conditioning treatments and trying to get my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair frizz free and soft...</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I been able to actually use a hair product and have it look the way it did at the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff really soaks into damp hair after the shower!</li>
            <li> Thanks PM!</li>
            <li> In some cases it is real but in others you are taking a risk and for some who don&#x27;t get proper results that could be why,  also more often than not you will get a better price at your local salon or school.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and silky when I flat iron it, and I got even more compliments on my hair than before!</li>
            <li> a large bottle lasts almost a whole year!</li>
            <li> Because of the good reviews I gave it a go, but I notice very little difference.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be good for straightening, but even a small amount is like putting corn syrup in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Whether I air dry or style my hair, I always used this product for better looking hair.</li>
            <li> be sure to apply to your dry hair liberally</li>
            <li> Interestingly, scrutiny of the package reveals a disclaimer section of text urging the consumer to purchase the product ONLY from professional hairdressers to avoid this exact situation.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone!  </li>
            <li> stuff is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone looking simplify their hair routine!</li>
            <li> I tried it--taking care not to use too much when I straightened my hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li> I am very fussy about how my hair feels and smells.</li>
            <li> Plus this price is so much cheaper on Amazon than in any salon.</li>
            <li> and I use 6 or 7 pumps, although the product does not require this much</li>
            <li> Smoothing serum is my hair miracle, and this stuff absolutely wrecked my hair.</li>
            <li> thanks so much</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I could get the same result as my stylist because she has so much more experience.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, my ends are really dry (roots oily...love it), and I do not get my long hair trimmed as much as I should.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very frizzy and it controls it better than any other product I have found.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other serums and oils and this is by far the BEST serum for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> The size is much bigger than my original one.  </li>
            <li> I will go \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; on most any other product to save money in order to get this.</li>
            <li> I use this serum, a Sedu flat iron (amazing flat iron), and follow up afterward with a bit of moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I stepped outside, it puffed right out!  </li>
            <li> I live for this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I cant live with out this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products to help with the frizzy hair that comes with high humidity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> Because of the high cost, I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I only use one pump, working it in my ends working up to my roots for less frizzy and more manageable hair!</li>
            <li> OK, so the packaging is in my view clearly not genuine -</li>
            <li> Since i have blonde and damaged hair it makes it look fresh and new.</li>
            <li> &amp; they all can&#x27;t live without it too now.</li>
            <li> I live in somewhat of a humid climate</li>
            <li> so I ordered a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have hair almost to my waist and live in Humid Town, USA.</li>
            <li> We cannot live w/o it; when the bottle gets to 3/4 gone, I buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 3 years now, and only just finished my first 8-oz bottle.</li>
            <li> in 2007, I went to a new stylist when my old one moved away</li>
            <li> Because my shoulder length hair tangles easily in the shower, I apply a few drops of &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; after shampooing and rinsing.</li>
            <li> It only takes one good-sized drop to tame down all of my mane of hair, which is NOT an easy thing to do. :-)</li>
            <li> When I do style my hair, it takes less time and the end result is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> It leaves my crazy mop feeling soft, looking shiny and smelling great.</li>
            <li> plan on buying a big bottle very soon.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> They think it feels so soft and looks so shiny.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/fuzzy hair, I use this when blow drying</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the difference when I touched their hair before and after application.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the saga continued into my adult life and there wasn&#x27;t a product I didn&#x27;t try with my Chi Iron.</li>
            <li> - they said I probably received an old product because they hadn&#x27;t rotated their stock correctly.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and silky with a sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this serum calms the frizz and leaves it silky</li>
            <li> The few extra dollars would&#x27;ve been better than waiting 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I would say that there is a very slight improvement when using this product as compared to when I just use the cheap tresemme spray protection from heat.  </li>
            <li> Without washing the hair, I added a lot of this product again (thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough), but the same thing happened---as soon as I walked outside, my hair got frizzy and super poofy.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and have recently moved to the shore area and with the high humidity</li>
            <li> This product is helping to get it back to normal.</li>
            <li> This stuff does make my hair dry much faster, but it leaves a coat</li>
            <li> And no other brand comes close to the quality.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no other packaging by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick yet fine.</li>
            <li> When my hair is wet, I put a dime size amount in my hands, along with a dime size amount of the Super Skinny Relaxing Balm and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, actually have converted several friends of mine into using this product as well</li>
            <li> It helps keep my hair really soft and definitely lessens drying time.  </li>
            <li> main goal is to help slim hair and dry faster</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can reapply when hair is dry and gets frizzy or out of control</li>
            <li> Out of the shower I dry it slightly, and then apply a teaspoon of Super Skinny Serum, starting with the ends.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had long, curly, super THICK, very dry and damaged hair my whole life.  </li>
            <li> (I only use one little squirt) on my hair without really improving the look.  </li>
            <li> I have to flat iron everyday to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I then use a flat iron to give it extra shine and control.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that is to the middle of my back and one pump is all I need!</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and shiny without making it feel greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell is a professional line only sold in salons or schools to the public and when you buy outside of a salon you risk buying old product (I&#x27;ve seen as old as 2006 at some drugstores), tampered (with repulsively high levels of bacteria have been found) with or just plain fake.  </li>
            <li> This is new to me since I was an everyday washer before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, so typically, any product will only weigh it down and make it look oily and flat.</li>
            <li> thanks so much and sorry it took so long to reply just goy</li>
            <li> I put it on before i dry and flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> I use a couple of pumps of this throught out my hair when it is wet and then blow dry--it instantly tames my frizzies!  </li>
            <li> The only problem was that the bottle wasn&#x27;t protected very well so half of the bottle leaked out :/</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Double the size for the same price just a little bit of a wait to come in the mail, but definetly will order again.</li>
            <li> About a dime size amount, work into wet hair, blow dry and flat iron...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I used it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It looked all frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> and it dries faster, then apply to dry hair for shine and manageability.  </li>
            <li> Works well on damp or dry</li>
            <li> my hair has become over processed and my friend turned me on to this product and I no longer have dry frizzy hair and doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily and is a leave in conditioner 5 plus stars here</li>
            <li> and since you use such a little bit it goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> it does dry faster too!</li>
            <li> It should have been placed in a bag and sealed to avoid the big mess that was made.</li>
            <li> Smells terrific, and adds a little luster to your mane.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my wet hair as well.  </li>
            <li> Even with all the hair I have I only need a few pumps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ALL when I was in wet weather.  </li>
            <li> I put it on wet hair</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too weighted down.</li>
            <li> I use this nearly everyday, a little tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It came without a cap, which I thought was odd because I had purchased it elsewhere previously and there was definitely a cap.</li>
            <li> Just a little smooths my hair down especially in this humid weather in south Texas.  </li>
            <li> My hair takes less time to dry and is easier to brush through!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found to tame my hair!  </li>
            <li> does not easily lose shape and volume unless compressed (such as sleeping on a firm pillow).</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores &amp; MUCH more expensive when you do!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the large bottles</li>
            <li> got my hair done a few weeks ago, and the stylist told me that my hair is also very, very dry, so I could afford to use some product.</li>
            <li> stays protected for at least 24 hours, possibly longer,&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have weird hair--very long and naturally</li>
            <li> If you have thick, frizzy hair like mine, definitely give it a go!</li>
            <li> Just use a small little pump for even long hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, use sparingly, one pump or sometimes even less is all you need depending on your hair type, length, and thickness.  </li>

            <li> I can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use this product! I use this nearly everyday, a little tiny bit goes a long way. Makes my hair shiny, silky, smells amazing... I just love it! I highly recommend this product, actually have converted several friends of mine into using this product as well &amp; they all can&#x27;t live without it too now. It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely AWESOME!  Makes me a believer in Paul Mitchel again.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with my hair. My hair was very frizzy and it controls it better than any other product I have found.</li>
            <li> Best hair serum very light</li>
            <li> I live in somewhat of a humid climate and I found that this did nothing really to tame the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; out of my hair.  It is okay when incorporated with other products, but on its own, it doesn&#x27;t do much.  It would have to be paired with the sculpting foam or the form cream for it to work with any kind of adequacy, although this might not be the case in lower humidity areas, but personally, sometimes I just like being able to put one product on my hair, brush, and be done with it and not have to worry.  This isn&#x27;t the product for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 6-10-11**  I asked my hair dresser why this product wasn&#x27;t working as well as stated and she said that maybe I wasn&#x27;t using enough.  Sure enough, I didn&#x27;t want it to be oily as others have stated, so I hadn&#x27;t used enough for my hair.  With using a bit more, about three to four pumps, it actually tames a good bit of the frizz and I&#x27;ve been using it religiously ever since.</li>
            <li> Great Great product!  I have weird hair--very long and naturally straight on top but then goes to frizzy waves towards the longer parts of my hair.  This product is one of the best I have used (and I have tried soooo many).  I use a couple of pumps of this throught out my hair when it is wet and then blow dry--it instantly tames my frizzies!  I then use a flat iron to give it extra shine and control.  I highly recommend this product to everyone!  I would just say to be sure not to us too much product as your hair will feel too heavy and greasy---you will have to experiment with the amount that works best for you.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning after wetting my hair. It keeps my hair lively and looking good all day. A bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products to help with the frizzy hair that comes with high humidity. This one actually works!</li>
            <li> I just recently starting straightening my hair. I&#x27;m 38 and I&#x27;ve had long, curly, super THICK, very dry and damaged hair my whole life.  For the last 15 years my hair style consisted of wearing my hair in a sloppy bun.  I&#x27;ve been doing deep conditioning treatments and trying to get my hair healthy. It has helped. I&#x27;ve tried so many products to get it to shine and look healthy. I bought a sample of this at the hair salon over a month ago and never used it. I actually felt talked into it by the stylist and I caved.&lt;br /&gt;Today I used it on my dry hair. Just a small amount and it was like instant magic! I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my wet hair as well.  I have to flat iron everyday to get my hair straight. Although I only wash my hair every 5 days now. This is new to me since I was an everyday washer before.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. It made my hair shiny, soft and incredible! The little annoying fly-aways are gone too.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much at all. Even with all the hair I have I only need a few pumps.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying a big bottle very soon. It&#x27;s well worth the money. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> For some reason my hair did not respond well to my last color treatment.  It looked all frizzy and dry.  This product is helping to get it back to normal.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes my hair sooo soft, you put it in while ur hair is wet and then blow dry/straighten and it makes ur hair shiny and soft! :D</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too weighted down.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. It is difficult to find the large bottles locally.[[ASIN:B0016663NU PAUL MITCHELL by Paul Mitchell: SUPER SKINNY SERUM SMOOTHES AND CONDITIONS UNRULY HAIR 8.5 OZ]]</li>
            <li> I have the worst curly, frizzy, dry hair and this is the only thing that will tame it. I&#x27;ve tried so many products and THIS is what I always return to.</li>
            <li> Product froze and leaked.</li>
            <li> Really love super skinny.  Keep frizz under control and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or feel like plastic.  Will continue to use as my only styling product.</li>
            <li> I live for this stuff!  Its the best when it comes to de frizzing older hair.  this was a good buy</li>
            <li> Now this serum is wonderful. It will tame all those frizzy hairs down. This product is amazing and highly recommended. Use it all the time!!!</li>
            <li> A friend used this on my hair to show me how great it is and it is truly awesome.  Makes my hair so soft and shiny.  Totally sold me.  Great product.  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this product at all.  I thought it might be good for straightening, but even a small amount is like putting corn syrup in your hair.  Oily, greasy, wet-looking.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had some issues getting this product to my door, but it eventually worked out. It came without a cap, which I thought was odd because I had purchased it elsewhere previously and there was definitely a cap. The squeeze nozzle was just wrapped in tape, which of course means the product was all over the packaging and the bottle. Product is great I&#x27;ve used it before. Will be taking a different route in buying this in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for my flat iron straightened curly hair.  When I was younger, I wore my curly hair CURLY.  It was all bouncy ringlets.  After two kids my hair began the downward slide from curly, to wavy and now, just wavy frizzy.  Before I found this serum, I would straighten my hair, but if I was in any weather with a bit of mist or rain - out popped the frizz!  When I began using this stuff, I was amazed that my hair didn&#x27;t frizz AT ALL when I was in wet weather.  It&#x27;s been a staple of mine now for about 4 years.  I will not use anything else. I use this serum, a Sedu flat iron (amazing flat iron), and follow up afterward with a bit of moroccan oil.  Lovely, healthy looking hair!</li>
            <li> This product has revolutionized my hair. All my life I had very thick, somewhat kinky, wiry hair. No products ever seemed to help.  Combing my hair out after a shampoo was miserable. Two years ago I bought this Paul Mitchell product, and I LOVE it! It leaves my hair soft, easy to comb and shiny.</li>
            <li> one of the the best serum&#x27;s i know.&lt;br /&gt;smells good leave a lot of shine &amp; all you need it&#x27;s one drop.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Tames frizz.  Excellent product. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can reapply when hair is dry and gets frizzy or out of control</li>
            <li> I would hate to have to live without this product. I have fine, straight hair. I get it colored and cut at a salon which uses and sells Bumble and Bumble. As soon as I can, I wash that stuff out. It feels sticky in my hair and gives it no shine at all. If you want softness and incredible shininess, this is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must admit that I use it in combination with &#x27; it&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34;  miracle leave-in product. Because my shoulder length hair tangles easily in the shower, I apply a few drops of &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; after shampooing and rinsing. Then I comb it through, eliminating all the tangles. Out of the shower I dry it slightly, and then apply a teaspoon of Super Skinny Serum, starting with the ends. The result is hair which holds its shape very well and shines brilliantly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stuff years ago and I&#x27;m just getting to the end so I ordered a new bottle.  The size is much bigger than my original one.  Very pleased.  This stuff is not too oily and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I was kind of  sceptical because the price, this is big bottle and is the original, thank goodness. I have use this oil for my hair for years now... and leave you hair soft and silky, good for using heat tools</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and love it.  First of all it has a wonderful smell.  It helps keep my hair really soft and definitely lessens drying time.  When I use it I feel like I just came from the hair salon.  There are no downsides to this product.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Does what is advertised,&lt;br /&gt;Only a small amount is required per use,&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave hair hard(like with hair gel) or wet,&lt;br /&gt;Hair stays protected for at least 24 hours, possibly longer,&lt;br /&gt;Hair does not easily lose shape and volume unless compressed (such as sleeping on a firm pillow).</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found to tame my hair!  I have a lot of hair and have recently moved to the shore area and with the high humidity, this works.  I put it on wet hair and it dries faster, then apply to dry hair for shine and manageability.  Only a pump or two is needed. It lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Loved this stuff, use it every day. I can tell a difference in the condition and appearance of my hair. Will purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other serums and oils and this is by far the BEST serum for flat ironing. It is super light and smells great!</li>
            <li> The best silky smooth hair serum out there.  Just use a small little pump for even long hair.  Everytime I use this product and my straightener after, I get so many compliments on my hair.  They think it feels so soft and looks so shiny.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair frizz free and soft...my hairdresser started me on it and I found it to be worth the money</li>
            <li> I use this serum every time I wash my hair. I only use one pump, working it in my ends working up to my roots for less frizzy and more manageable hair! I have long hair that is to the middle of my back and one pump is all I need! Whether I air dry or style my hair, I always used this product for better looking hair. When I do style my hair, it takes less time and the end result is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money and since you use such a little bit it goes a long ways. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking simplify their hair routine! 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I use it daily after showering.  I have thick, wavy hair that otherwise begins to mat and tangle itself.  This product keeps my hair shiny, smooth and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is serum so it is definitely not for all hair types.  I would not recommend for someone with thin hair.  Also, use sparingly, one pump or sometimes even less is all you need depending on your hair type, length, and thickness.  I use a pump and a half for my hair but I have thick, long, and wavy hair.  (my hair is past my shoulders)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, love the way it makes my hair feel...</li>
            <li> I will tell everyone, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It makes my hair so silky and manageable. The only reason I give my review 4 stars is that I ordered this on 12/27 and am STILL waiting on 1/9. I ordered another Paul Mitchell product at the very same time and had it arrived on 12/30. I should have just driven up the street and picked this up from a salon. The few extra dollars would&#x27;ve been better than waiting 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses PM Super Skinny on my hair so I thought I would buy some for myself.  I was surprised that I could get the same result as my stylist because she has so much more experience.  I have naturally wavy/fuzzy hair, I use this when blow drying and I don&#x27;t need to use a straightener to get that sleek style.</li>
            <li> Double the size for the same price just a little bit of a wait to come in the mail, but definetly will order again.</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores &amp; MUCH more expensive when you do! it&#x27;s my favorite hair product of all time!</li>
            <li> this smells great and helps with frizz. i believe it&#x27;s main goal is to help slim hair and dry faster</li>
            <li> Best detangular product ever. My stylist told me about this one and I would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Boss Lady says buy it, so I buy it.  She loves this stuff and it seems to be hard to beat this price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 7 years. I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny. Goes great with Rusk deep shine.</li>
            <li> I am just simply happy with this. It soothes my hair, and even straighten my curly hair. I am particularly impressed with the straight function even though the description didn&#x27;t mention about it.</li>
            <li> If you like your hair to be straight, non static and smooth this is the one!  My hair is thick and very unevenly wavy and frizzy.  About a dime size amount, work into wet hair, blow dry and flat iron...this keeps my do in place and feels clean, not sticky.  This sellers price was accurate and I will  purchase again!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Smells terrific, and adds a little luster to your mane.  (I may be one of the few men who regularly use this stuff; I had borrowed a squirt of it from my wife&#x27;s bottle some years back, and upon application to my own hair, was duly impressed.)  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommendedery good choiI.think the essence of the best e&lt;br /&gt;Best of best&lt;br /&gt;I.think the essence of the best ^^</li>
            <li> I have thick afro hair...I thought this might be a miracle...I tried it--taking care not to use too much when I straightened my hair bone straight.  As soon as I stepped outside, it puffed right out!  Without washing the hair, I added a lot of this product again (thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough), but the same thing happened---as soon as I walked outside, my hair got frizzy and super poofy.  I&#x27;m thinking maybe I need a heavier serum??....I don&#x27;t know, but all I know is that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about how my hair feels and smells. That being said this product is the best! It leaves my crazy mop feeling soft, looking shiny and smelling great. Well worth the price a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My husbands daily fix.</li>
            <li> Love this Product !!!!</li>
            <li> Have thoroughly enjoyed this product!  My hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> Stop thinking about it and buy it! I have hair almost to my waist and live in Humid Town, USA. This stuff leaves my hair soft, not puffy, and smelling great. A little goes a long way! I use it before I straighten or curl my hair. Works well on damp or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No lo piense tanto y comprelo! Tengo el cabello casi hasta la cintura y vivo en una ciudad muy humeda. Este producto me deja el cabello suave, sin esponjado, y oliendo delicioso. Rinde muchisimo, con un poquito basta! Lo uso antes de alisarme o encresparme el cabello. Funciona en cabello humedo o seco.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick yet fine. It gets tangled SO EASY &amp; can be a nightmare to comb through. When I came across this product I felt like I was witnessing a miracle. This makes her hair feel like silk; it gives it a beautiful shine. When I put it in her hair after it has been shampoo &amp; conditioned, I am able to brush through it like I never have before. And it makes her hair smell SO GOOD!! We cannot live w/o it; when the bottle gets to 3/4 gone, I buy a new one. I will go \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; on most any other product to save money in order to get this. And no other brand comes close to the quality. I&#x27;ve tried &amp; there&#x27;s nothing out there. I would give this 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Love the product c: it rescued my hair! The shipping was great! It came the day after I ordered it. The only problem was that the bottle wasn&#x27;t protected very well so half of the bottle leaked out :/ it was very disappointing :/</li>
            <li> One satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I own for the price!  My hair was always frizzy even after conditioning.  Now that I use this daily after showering, my hair shines and never looks frizzy.  I plan to keep buying this for years to come.</li>
            <li> This is so good to use on your hair, does not weight it down or feel greasy. Plus this price is so much cheaper on Amazon than in any salon.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 3 years now, and only just finished my first 8-oz bottle. I have very thick, coarse hair and this makes me look, feel and smell like a superstar. :)</li>
            <li> product has not arrived as scheduled on 12.20.12.There is no tracking number either for my stuff.  Where is my stuff?</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s the only reason I have keep a short hair style.  This product keeps my hair in control.</li>
            <li> It only takes one good-sized drop to tame down all of my mane of hair, which is NOT an easy thing to do. :-) Paul Mitchell is always the best.</li>
            <li> if you have course curly hair this product is for you. it helps control the frizz and helps with drying time. My hair is shoulder lenght and I use 6 or 7 pumps, although the product does not require this much but I have found  using more on my hair helps control the frizz and curl more.</li>
            <li> While the packaging of this product was spot on, I am an experienced user and this is NOT Paul Mitchell&#x27;s product. Smoothing serum is my hair miracle, and this stuff absolutely wrecked my hair. Whether Beautogen or their provider is to blame for this will remain a mystery... Interestingly, scrutiny of the package reveals a disclaimer section of text urging the consumer to purchase the product ONLY from professional hairdressers to avoid this exact situation. I have learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes your hair very manageable, silky and shiny.  I&#x27;ve been a user of this for years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Just for your knowledge...  Paul Mitchell is a professional line only sold in salons or schools to the public and when you buy outside of a salon you risk buying old product (I&#x27;ve seen as old as 2006 at some drugstores), tampered (with repulsively high levels of bacteria have been found) with or just plain fake.  Do some research.  In some cases it is real but in others you are taking a risk and for some who don&#x27;t get proper results that could be why,  also more often than not you will get a better price at your local salon or school.  Paul Mitchell updates packaging ever so often also so if your super skinny serum isn&#x27;t in a see thru bottle beware.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, so typically, any product will only weigh it down and make it look oily and flat. This, unfortunately, also means I have LOTS of little frizzes and flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my hair done a few weeks ago, and the stylist told me that my hair is also very, very dry, so I could afford to use some product. She proceeded to use this in my hair, and it was amazing! Never in my life have I been able to actually use a hair product and have it look the way it did at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this, and use it every morning. It is the BEST.</li>
            <li> great product at a excellent price love it.</li>
            <li> BEST STUFF IN THE WORLD. Been using on curly wavy hair for years. So good. Make it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at the hair salon and fell in love.  When I use it my head doesn&#x27;t look like a pyramid.  Just a little smooths my hair down especially in this humid weather in south Texas.  Highly recommend, oh yeah it does dry faster too!</li>
            <li> received product quickly.  the serum is excellent on my frizzy hair.  be sure to apply to your dry hair liberally (dime size depending on your length of hair)</li>
            <li> I cant live with out this! I put it on before i dry and flat iron my hair it makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Bottle will last you forever!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday and swear by it. It makes my hair so soft and managable. Gets rid of frizz and smells great! a large bottle lasts almost a whole year!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shine product, its not too light and not too heavy and leaves my hair shiny and smells great too!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I&#x27;ve purchased it in salons before so I knew what I was getting.  However, the bottle was leaking when it arrived so some of the product was lost.</li>
            <li> Since I been dying my hair my hair has become over processed and my friend turned me on to this product and I no longer have dry frizzy hair and doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily and is a leave in conditioner 5 plus stars here</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and silky when I flat iron it, and I got even more compliments on my hair than before!</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price</li>
            <li> The product works for my sister and niece&#x27;s hair. They&#x27;ve done A LOT of damage to their hair and this serum makes seem not so dead. It makes it feel softer and smoother. I was surprised at the difference when I touched their hair before and after application. Overall, it works and the package arrived ahead of time.</li>
            <li> I love Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum. It&#x27;s great. This is second bottle I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &#x27;Deals on Demand&#x27; packed it wrong, so serum leaked a lot when it arrived.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - use just a little and it gets rid of all frizziness!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, frizzy, hair. So thick and frizzy that my mom paid her stylist to wash and blow-out my hair when I was a kid. This was the early 80s, before blow-outs were trendy. Anyway, the saga continued into my adult life and there wasn&#x27;t a product I didn&#x27;t try with my Chi Iron. It looked good, but there&#x27;s no denying I was doing A LOT of damage with daily use of the iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then in 2007, I went to a new stylist when my old one moved away and she used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum on my hair. Seven years later I&#x27;m still using it. When my hair is wet, I put a dime size amount in my hands, along with a dime size amount of the Super Skinny Relaxing Balm and blow dry. Then I take another pump of the serum, rub my hands together and smooth out any fly-away strands and done! Sometimes I still use my CHI, but usually just to touch up my hair on a day I don&#x27;t wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. If you have thick, frizzy hair like mine, definitely give it a go!</li>
            <li> This stuff really soaks into damp hair after the shower! My hair takes less time to dry and is easier to brush through! Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy and smells great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for years and usually purchase it at a salon. I found this on amazon and was so excited to see the huge size for the tiny price!! But -- too good to be true. The product was watery and did not smell right. I contacted the seller and they refunded my money but buyer beware - they said I probably received an old product because they hadn&#x27;t rotated their stock correctly.</li>
            <li> I have thin, long hair and a lot of it.  I typically straighten or use curlers so I definitely needed something to improve the smoothness and shine of my hair, and I read about this serum on makeupalley.com.  Because of the good reviews I gave it a go, but I notice very little difference.  To be fair, my ends are really dry (roots oily...love it), and I do not get my long hair trimmed as much as I should.  This stuff does make my hair dry much faster, but it leaves a coat (I only use one little squirt) on my hair without really improving the look.  I would say that there is a very slight improvement when using this product as compared to when I just use the cheap tresemme spray protection from heat.  Because of the high cost, I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> thanks so much and sorry it took so long to reply just goy my computer back from the shop&lt;br /&gt;so thanks so much</li>
            <li> Even though I haven&#x27;t received it yet (currently shipping) my hair stylist uses this on me every time i go along with It&#x27;s a 10. Great product and smells good. Since i have blonde and damaged hair it makes it look fresh and new. A great solution to frizzy dry hair!!</li>
            <li> I love the product because it make my hair shine and the price is better than it the salon.</li>
            <li> Love the Skinny Serum.  I usually buy it at CVS, but it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product and it is amazing. Leaves hair soft and silky with a sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is the packaging. The product comes as seen in image...there&#x27;s no other packaging by the manufacturer. Protection of the product is therefore left up to the shipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was just a piece of tape stuck on the lid and quarter of the product leaked into the box. It should have been placed in a bag and sealed to avoid the big mess that was made. The bottom of the box was soiled. Had it leaked into a bag, I could have considered using the serum that fell in the bag.....but leakage on a box - that&#x27;s a loss. A big one too.</li>
            <li> This works great in my hair and Amazons prices are great</li>
            <li> Have been using PM SSS for years!! I absolutely love this product since i have super coarse hair it allows me to comb through to manage my naps. And it also functions as a heat protector. It does not leave your hair oily. I am in love with this product... I never wash and comb my hair without it. Thanks PM! I definitely will keep buying and recommend</li>
            <li> great for frizzy hair</li>
            <li> OK, so the packaging is in my view clearly not genuine - it&#x27;s not the quality that you would expect from a Paul Mitchell product and it leaks.  Whether or not the contents are genuine I can&#x27;t say as I&#x27;ve not purchased this before, but I&#x27;m not confident.  Yes, the price is low, but I think it&#x27;s a false economy.  Avoid.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, and a great price</li>
            <li> this is a very good product for fine white hair.  not greasy yet puts a shine on the hair , which is very important for white hair.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use. It keeps my hair soft and shiny without making it feel greasy or weighing it down. Best hair serum ever!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly in great condition and the serum works great. I have naturally curly hair and this serum calms the frizz and leaves it silky</li>
