            <li>This is a very gently product that really works.</li>
            <li>Has worked wonderfully to clean my face and neck while not irritating my sensitive skim</li>
            <li>Aquanil was working absolutely fine, but it has SLS in it, and I am trying to remove as much as that from my life as possible.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>

            <li>To me it is a one in a million product, this product really took off all of my makeup at ONE time</li>
            <li>so it really lasts.</li>

            <li>it will take off all of your makeup, sunscreen and clean your face at the same time.</li>
            <li>Very mild cleanser for dry and problem skin.</li>
            <li>The first bottle lasted nearly 10 weeks.</li>
            <li>The second time, I ordered the larger bottle - gorgeous cobalt blue glass...</li>

            <li>When my skin gets very sensitive time to time,  I use this product.</li>
            <li>It smells rancid like it is very old</li>
            <li>And the product is so pure that you use a very small amount, consequently, they are easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are correct that just a small amount of cleanser is enough, as it lathers up very nicely.</li>

            <li>It lasts a long time - you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>After spending lots of money on drugstore face washes and products like Aveno that claim to be natural and for sensitive skin, I finally found something that works for me.</li>

            <li> stuff is just what i wanted - it keeps my face feeling fresh and clean all while not having all the bad chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> i have tried other natural cleansers like dr. bronners and others, but it they were too drying.</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times: the first two uses made my face feel a little tight and itchy, and the third use caused me to wake up this morning with raised, mottled, irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> In fact, I do believe it is making me break out even more! :(  </li>
            <li> I just bought several other of their products.</li>
            <li> I did find it tended to dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> , it removes my face oil and my makeup without making my skin dry and tight, and a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have yet to try other products, but am hoping I&#x27;ll get some as gifts</li>
            <li> I simply refill the small one for the shower and for traveling.</li>
            <li> I did not use this face wash with other products and used it for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would clear up my face not make it worse...</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and flaky after using it.</li>
            <li> Kissed camomile and lavender has been a total game changer in my skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s, oily/combo skin, prone to some blackheads, clogged, pores, run of the mill skin issues.</li>
            <li> This face wash dried my face out and it made my acne even worse.</li>
            <li> I seriously could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write negative reviews but I am totally disappointed with this face wash.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry I ever bought this.</li>
            <li> I am so sad!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really bad acne</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is a very mild and gentle cleanser. When my skin gets very sensitive time to time,  I use this product.</li>
            <li> This is seriously my ideal foaming cleanser. I&#x27;m not a fan of cream cleansers. It has to be foaming or nothing and I&#x27;ve tried just about every type out there. This is my favorite, by far.   It smells great (like clean and flowers and sunshine), it removes my face oil and my makeup without making my skin dry and tight, and a little bit goes a long way (you only need a tiny blob to clean your whole face and neck), and it&#x27;s all natural to boot. Great product!</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited about this facial cleanser after reading reviews. After using it for a couple weeks I have to report that my skin has not gotten any better. In fact, I do believe it is making me break out even more! :(  I am totally bummed with this product. (especially after spending twenty bucks on it!) I was hoping it would clear up my face not make it worse... I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I have VERY sensitive, acne prone skin and this cleanser works very well for me. I have reactions to almost everything, but this cleanser is very gentle yet effective. I smells great and does not dry my skin. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne and super sensitive skin for several years.. This product cleanses my skin without drying it. I use this along with my clarsonic mia and I am so very pleased with my skin ! The cleanser is so mild, but effective. It smells great. I am such a natural girl so I was looking for something that gentle, but cleanses and the ingredients come from nature. i have tried other natural cleansers like dr. bronners and others, but it they were too drying. I have finally found my staple!</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive, acne-prone skin.  I have been using epiduo for acne, with aquanil cleanser for over a year, because most other face soaps irritate the heck out of my face.  Aquanil was working absolutely fine, but it has SLS in it, and I am trying to remove as much as that from my life as possible.  I have been on the hunt for something similarly benign, and thought the Kissed soap might be the answer.  Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t. I have used it 3 times: the first two uses made my face feel a little tight and itchy, and the third use caused me to wake up this morning with raised, mottled, irritated skin.  I am so sad!  I plan to use it as body wash because it has a nice fragrance and suds, but if you are sensitive and use benzoyl peroxide/adapalene based medicines, it might not be the best choice.  If anyone knows of something similar to aquanil, but sls free, please let me know!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing, it does so many things when you use it for example it will take off all of your makeup, sunscreen and clean your face at the same time. To me it is a one in a million product, this product really took off all of my makeup at ONE time I didn&#x27;t have to come back and wipe my makeup off after using it. I also have been using sunscreen lately and NOTHING get sunscreen off my face better than this product. I feel as if i have a nice clean face with no left over grime after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night to clean all make-up off.  It does a terrific job!  Smells great, also.  Skin feels really clean.</li>
            <li> I love this gentle cleansing potion.  Not drying, not heavily scented.  Just natural and nice.  It lasts a long time - you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. Cleanses wonderfully, yet leaves my skin soft and supple. Love the scent. Love the packaging and the nice twist spout. I just bought several other of their products.</li>
            <li> I have oily. I WILL USE THIS PRODUCT ALWAYS! I seriously could not be happier!</li>
            <li> Love this get!  And love the smell!</li>
            <li> It works very well! Have ordered another because I like it so much! Works as advertised! I am totally pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Leaves a waxy residue on my face</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! No harsh chemicals, but still makes your face feel very clean. It also has a great smell!</li>
            <li> Very gentle. Leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I love this product !!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a lot more gentle for this price. The smell is pleasant but it is seriously nothing special like I imagined it would be. My skin feels tight and flaky after using it.</li>
            <li> This is a very gently product that really works. It has a very gentle smell and you only have to use a tiny amount so it really lasts.</li>
            <li> I have adult onset cystic acne. Sometimes it&#x27;s so bad I&#x27;m embarrased to go out of my house. I got the Kissed cleanser, Lavender &amp; Aloe toner, and the Light moisturizer three days ago, and my face is already clearing up. The redness is almost entirely gone! The other reviews are correct that just a small amount of cleanser is enough, as it lathers up very nicely. I will be using this product for the rest of my life!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Chose this product because I was recently diagnosed with an intolerance to SLS. Has worked wonderfully to clean my face and neck while not irritating my sensitive skim</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money on drugstore face washes and products like Aveno that claim to be natural and for sensitive skin, I finally found something that works for me. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s, oily/combo skin, prone to some blackheads, clogged, pores, run of the mill skin issues. I didn&#x27;t realize I had &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; until the products from drugstores began to cause me to have mild bouts of dermatitis. Now that I&#x27;m pregnant, my skin is more sensitive and everything was causing severe dermatitis. Kissed camomile and lavender has been a total game changer in my skin care regiment. I have yet to try other products, but am hoping I&#x27;ll get some as gifts :) The scent is light and very nice - but not perfumed at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count the products I&#x27;ve used; some successfully but sooner or later....I have finally been Kissed. Use a Hummingbird size amount. Very gently work up a lather and rise. The first bottle lasted nearly 10 weeks. The second time, I ordered the larger bottle - gorgeous cobalt blue glass...I simply refill the small one for the shower and for traveling. I use Luscious, the Exquisite moisturizer, the herb steam facial. At the risk of sounding like a nut case, these products have changed my life, certainly eased the stress of dealing with my persnickety, fair, aging, flare up at the drop of a hat, reactive face.  And the product is so pure that you use a very small amount, consequently, they are easy to travel with. Big Plus.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I keep a bottle in shower to use daily. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really bad acne but i like to keep my face clean and non oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is just what i wanted - it keeps my face feeling fresh and clean all while not having all the bad chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face so very good and along with other products being used at the same time for once my face seems to be clearing up</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and lather for a very clean feeling face after using. I appreciate that it contains mostly natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I thought purchasing an SLS-free face wash would help my skin by not drying it out and clearing up my acne. I was wrong. This face wash dried my face out and it made my acne even worse. I did not use this face wash with other products and used it for about two weeks. I tried to give it a fair chance, but I couldn&#x27;t stand my skin being covered in acne, so I stopped using it. Also, I did not like the smell and thought it was too strong. This could be a great cleanser, but it didn&#x27;t work for my combination/acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Very mild cleanser for dry and problem skin. Lovely fragrance too. However it isn&#x27;t worth the price when you can find comperable cleansers for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write negative reviews but I am totally disappointed with this face wash.  It smells rancid like it is very old and it&#x27;s supposed to be foaming yet I get no foam at all with it.  It wasn&#x27;t cheap either.  I&#x27;m going back to using derma e face wash.  Sorry I ever bought this.</li>
            <li> Great chemical-free lathering facewash! I will definitely be re-ordering. A little goes a long way and I also found that it didn’t sting my eyes if I had to open them during face-washing. Smells great and packaged in easy, travel-friendly bottle. Very much appreciated heartfelt sentiments from soap maker on label, which made me feel special.</li>
            <li> Nice, gentle cleaner.  A little goes a long way.  I did find it tended to dry my skin out.  I have completely abandoned regular cleansers and switched to an oil method which works best for my skin.</li>
