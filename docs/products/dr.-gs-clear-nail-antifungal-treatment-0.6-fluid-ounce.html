    <ol>
            <li>Great product- cleared up my nails nicely!</li>
            <li>Works great, just be consistent!</li>
            <li>Because this is working, the lady who introduced it to us told us also that if you apply the cream twice a day and then continue to do so after the fungus is gone for 10 more days</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re so glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>You have to put the cream under the top of nail and around it and then let it soak in for 15 minutes after which you put clean socks on to let it continue to work.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong effect...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll try it a little longer and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>I clean it well with vinegar or peroxide and lather Dr. G&#x27;s all over the thumb and under my fingernail about 4-5 times a day every day.</li>
            <li>I am very well pleased by the way Dr. G&#x27;s works.</li>
            <li>The delivery was right on time, too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, and not messy.</li>
            <li>The first time it worked, but then returned, so trying again.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Used the Dr. G&#x27;s first and it cleared up the infection.  </li>
            <li>The item was delivered extremely fast and product was exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this product is any good -</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend who believes my testimony and wants to try it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Price is reasonable .</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I did get better results with the old fashion tea tree oil that can be purchased from any health product store or the local Trader&#x27;s Joe</li>
            <li>I think I will use it for a little longer just to be sure</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clear the fungus</li>
            <li>Hoping this product will clear it up soon.</li>
            <li>It completely cleared up my nail fungus.</li>
            <li>After the nail grew out, the spot disappeared and my nail was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Just a slow process of turning nails from yellow to white and from brittle and weak to healthy and strong.</li>

            <li> Just a slow process of turning nails from yellow to white and from brittle and weak to healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> just a little yellow part oon</li>
            <li> product was just as expected and arrived on time</li>
            <li> the corner of my big toe and doesn&#x27;t even give signs that it will work like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past .</li>
            <li> Everything from the packaging and description indicates that it is to be used for nails - until you read the small print on the back which says it does not work for nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only on a small part of my nail</li>
            <li> Complete disappointment.  </li>
            <li> so usually use this.</li>
            <li> and I think it keeps the fungus from spreading, but after dealing with fungus on my thumb for about 7 months now, it&#x27;s hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Definitely takes discipline to apply once a day in the cold of winter and wait for it to sink in before putting on socks.</li>
            <li> all of her clients that used it according to instructions had no more nail crude (fungus).</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do anything bad either, so 3 stars.</li>

            <li> Great product- cleared up my nails nicely!</li>
            <li> I have been fighting fungal problems on my nails for two years. Now after thee weeks the problem is gone. I look at my nails and all I can do is smail. Thank you for a grate product.</li>
            <li> You have to put the cream under the top of nail and around it and then let it soak in for 15 minutes after which you put clean socks on to let it continue to work.  Because this is working, the lady who introduced it to us told us also that if you apply the cream twice a day and then continue to do so after the fungus is gone for 10 more days all of her clients that used it according to instructions had no more nail crude (fungus). We&#x27;re so glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m using the product. The first time it worked, but then returned, so trying again. Just a slow process of turning nails from yellow to white and from brittle and weak to healthy and strong. Definitely takes discipline to apply once a day in the cold of winter and wait for it to sink in before putting on socks. But it should work, like it did last time.</li>
            <li> product was just as expected and arrived on time</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is any good - but it didn&#x27;t do anything bad either, so 3 stars. I did get better results with the old fashion tea tree oil that can be purchased from any health product store or the local Trader&#x27;s Joe</li>
            <li> The item was delivered extremely fast and product was exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks now and has not done a thing for my nail been fighting funus for over 3yrs just a little yellow part oon the corner of my big toe and doesn&#x27;t even give signs that it will work like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past . Well see what happens but I doubt it will do anything</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month, ineffective.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clear the fungus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. It was recommended to me by my manicurist a year ago. It completely cleared up my nail fungus. I bought this for a friend who believes my testimony and wants to try it.</li>
            <li> Complete disappointment.  Everything from the packaging and description indicates that it is to be used for nails - until you read the small print on the back which says it does not work for nails.</li>
            <li> It works I only used it for about a week and the discoloration on my nails was gone! I think I will use it for a little longer just to be sure</li>
            <li> I really like it.  It helps with the fungus.  Price is reasonable . Thanks</li>
            <li> I had an infection in a nail and my nail tech suggested I use this.  I had a prescription from my podiatrist also.  Used the Dr. G&#x27;s first and it cleared up the infection.  After the nail grew out, the spot disappeared and my nail was back to normal.  Hopefully I will not get another infection, but if I did, I would not hesitate to use this product again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong effect... it turns colar ..so usually use this.</li>
            <li> I am very well pleased by the way Dr. G&#x27;s works. It is easy to apply, and not messy. The delivery was right on time, too.</li>
            <li> Still applying to see if works!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months now and I think it keeps the fungus from spreading, but after dealing with fungus on my thumb for about 7 months now, it&#x27;s hard to get rid of. I clean it well with vinegar or peroxide and lather Dr. G&#x27;s all over the thumb and under my fingernail about 4-5 times a day every day. I don&#x27;t know why I still have it. It&#x27;s only on a small part of my nail but it still won&#x27;t budge. Hoping this product will clear it up soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months now and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement .I know it takes time so I&#x27;ll try it a little longer and hope for the best.</li>
