            <li>I need to find the best pricing as possible, so I&#x27;m very motivated to purchase from an entity where I can get it at discounted pricing (the dermatologist&#x27;s pricing is fairly high).&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>But to be very honest, as far as any &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; goes, I think I had better results with the Obagi C then the Nu-Derm.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt that clean before!</li>
            <li>I appreciate that I can buy this on Amazon more cheaply than from my doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Received the order a lot sooner than expected - a wonderful surprise!</li>
            <li>But most importantly it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>

            <li>and so happy to have finally found Obaji foaming gel.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making Obagi available.</li>
            <li>Waited impatiently and was very happy when i received on time.</li>
            <li>which is important to me because I have allergies.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for years because of how gentle yet effective it is.</li>
            <li>The free shipping was a plus for me as was the sample product.</li>

            <li>I like this cleanser because it foams and leaves your skin free of make up.</li>
            <li>now my face is smooth  </li>
            <li>Two drips ( honest ) removes a whole face-full of make-up.  </li>
            <li>but it is more than worth it.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but does an excellent job of cleaning and removing make up; one drop cleans my entire face!</li>
            <li>However, I was surprised to find that I couldn&#x27;t find a cleanser I liked better -</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and almost wrinkle free except for laugh lines which I want!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for close to a year and very rarely to I get a blemish,</li>

            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>It works to my skins needs and totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally found out about this face wash from my doctor&#x27;s office where I was given a sample.</li>

            <li>I use toner after and the cotton wipe is always clean after toner application b/c this cleanser has done it job.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this cleanser and told me I would not need an eye make up remover anymore - I didn&#x27;t believe it until this cleanser wiped everything clean with just one wash</li>
            <li>Does not strip your skin of moisture but leaves it feeling clean.</li>

            <li>I have searched for a long time for a Cleanser that is good.  </li>
            <li>This cleaner will help your face looking great and keep the wrinkles down.</li>
            <li>but this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Great price, but not seeing or feeling results as previous Obagi products bought at my dermatologist office.</li>
            <li>I tend to use too much product at a time because it smells so good (such a clean fresh scent).</li>
            <li>My skin was so greasy, oily, and sticky and after a good wash and dry, my face felt clean and pretty matte.  </li>
            <li>Because really Good!&lt;br /&gt;I can see the Changes in My skin!!</li>
            <li>This is not my first purchase, I am using this products for 4 months and my skin improve a lot!</li>
            <li>Best facewash I&#x27;ve ever used- been using after shaving for 15 years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t dry my face out after the horrors of shaving.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, cleans but does not strip your skin, does not leave it feeling tight and stripped, nor oily and greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love all their products and over the past year have seen many great changes in my skin color, tone and overall appearance.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>This face-wash is great, as one little bottle lasts for ages.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited and HAPPY that I can order it online since it is so hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Great prduct for someone that has uneven and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon and it arrived in a few days and I am so Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Works amazing, can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing facial product.  </li>
            <li>use it every day and night, very cleansing and light feeling, no breakouts from it at all</li>
            <li>This wash is amazing, especially in combination with the mia2 face scrubber.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth using.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>but if you search the net you can find some good deals, especially if you buy more than one item at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I no longer have acne issues and my skin is healthy and and clear....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not unhappy with the price.  </li>
            <li>Before I bought this product, I was using a product that was fairly expensive and claimed to be great for my kind of skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>I am generally sensitive to most products</li>
            <li>Gentle, easy and almost completely odorless (clean, extremely light scent).</li>
            <li>and I believe it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>and It really deep cleans and leaves your face nice and</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>this rarely happened before I started using this.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite cleanser - you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>Not even worth a one star.</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh after washing with it.</li>
            <li>Any of the Obagi products are worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been using Obagi for years and it sure maintained my skin young looking.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this product from my dermatologist office, and later found it on Amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on your skin and your face feels fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Its soothing yet potent enough to clean off my makeup and excess dirt.</li>
            <li>So,I paid special attention and double checked to make sure it&#x27;s the correct item before i clicked the one click shipping.  </li>
            <li>Obagi cuts right through like Dawn</li>
            <li>its not the right one.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s right .</li>
            <li>Product was shipped right away.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a gentle cleanser doesn&#x27;t get the face clean</li>
            <li>I use this product to clean my face, decollitage and even gets my eye makeup off at night - so gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use many face wash, and this is the first one that actually takes off my make-up completely,  and I&#x27;m glad for that.</li>
            <li>I am, however, using the entire Obagi Nu-Derm line, so I&#x27;m not sure if the foaming gel works great by itself, but I do like the way it cleanses, and the toner after makes my skin feel clean, fresh and oil free.  </li>
            <li>The best product on the market by far, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time using this face wash, and so far my skin feels really good.</li>
            <li>skin feels clean &amp; smooth, not  dry at all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use very much of the product.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle so does not strip skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle to the skin as well.</li>
            <li>This product has certainly proved its worth and I will continue using this product.  </li>
            <li>It completely removes my makeup and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Skin is soft and smooth with matte finish.</li>
            <li>Now I am 42 and my skin is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write review for products, but this one is definitely worth a good review.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time and it never fails me.</li>
            <li>BE Aware of the SELLER</li>
            <li>I first wash my face with Foaming Gel.</li>
            <li>will consider ordering more in the future</li>

            <li>This takes a very small amt to clean your face and makes feel so good</li>
            <li>It is pleasant to use and is gentle on oily skin, unlike others that are too harsh.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many products and even when I use any other mild, daily regimen</li>
            <li>Always gives me a clear and clean complexion.</li>
            <li>Just needs a drop to clean my face completely and helps with keeping the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face so clean and not dried out,  </li>

            <li>My husband and I both use Obagi gel because it cleans and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I recommend the whole line of Nu Derm.</li>
            <li>It really takes off your makeup well even on your eyes without burning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated, you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li>I have the real items from my plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and this works really well.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and balanced.</li>
            <li>My skin is blemish free &amp; has been since starting use of this system.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this gel works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I really have not come across another cleanser that does the job as thoroughly without drying even when washing my face as enthusiastically as recommended (min.</li>
            <li>this is a gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to any one!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much results now</li>
            <li>I think the clarisonic just really clears the pores</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s Obagi that really cleared the skin and brightened my complexion.</li>
            <li>My skin looks young and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet thorough.</li>
            <li>Obagi does all of this gently.</li>
            <li>I have purchased before and really like it.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Obagi is part of my daily and nightly routine which keeps my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s very drying</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried Obagi, you really must give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have just got it, I have been used this product for 10 years, it works on me, if this is real obagi (since I have not try it on yet)</li>
            <li>Fast turn around.  </li>
            <li>This item was misrepresented as gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean and soft not a harsh cleaner.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup completely and leaves my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This deep-cleaning face wash has done more to shrink my pores than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My face is not tight afterwards and feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Mild , easy to use, long lasting.</li>
            <li>After I had my children, my skin became more sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li>Not sure what kind of shape the face cream will be in after being in transit in the Florida sun for one month</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and clean and very moist, ready for further treatment.</li>
            <li>I will never look for a new product again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a consistent cleanser that makes my skin feel very refresh and squeaky clean without feeling dry and drained from my faces&#x27; natural oils</li>
            <li>I started out using the entire Obaji system - then narrowed it down to Clear and Blender (along with Retin-A) as the products most important.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many cleansers from Clarins milk cleanser, to Origins Mimosa, Nuetrogena, a few organic milk cleansers from Wholefoods and many other products recommended by my dermatologist and those recommended by friends</li>
            <li>My pores look less noticeable and I have noticed I don&#x27;t have as many cyst or under skin pimples.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it too much.</li>
            <li>the whole is key to success</li>
            <li>it is a great cleanser for someone that wants to keep troubled skin away.  </li>
            <li>This regimen really works and is well worth the couple extra minutes every morning and night.  </li>
            <li>and I have super oily skin - like wash face at 8am and tiny beads of oil on my nose by 9am.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>: I bought this after it was highly recommended by my esthetician.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>, I would highly recommend this for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly concentrated</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ordering each item off Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a long time and it keeps my skin clean without over drying it.</li>
            <li>They are nice, but I can&#x27;t justify the price because they only moisturize my skin, as opposed to the other things they claim to do.</li>
            <li>i Love Obagi products and have been using them now for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is a good value--a little of the product goes a long way</li>
            <li>This cleanser is the ONLY cleanser that actually washes away the mineral makeup, my greasy oily face, and leaves my skin clean!</li>
            <li>am using the whole complete Obagi Nu-Derm system.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer said, it feels like they filled the bottle with pink shower gel.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and not overly dry.</li>
            <li>If this is not the real product, I would be quite surprised as I cannot tell the difference if it is.  </li>
            <li>It was gentle on my sensitive</li>
            <li>color is a light pink color and it has a slippery feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Helps to help restore normal PH</li>
            <li>everyday cleansing and i love all the kiel products and the obagi line</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin, lathers pretty well and have had zero irritations using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Combined with the toner it&#x27;s my new routine.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It was delivered in time and brand new as described</li>
            <li>and then I try something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products out there, expensive types or the over the counter items easily available.  </li>
            <li>I even tried Proactiv, which was good, but I dídn&#x27;t see nearly as dramatic a change as I did with the Obagi line.  </li>
            <li>I think maybe my skin is too sensitive and this product may be good for other people with less acne susceptible skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used for a week and my face is clear!</li>
            <li>I have used this cleanser for the past 10 years, and I really love the way it cleans my face.</li>
            <li>Getting impurities out skin first couple of days hoping to see big improvement in coming days</li>
            <li>&amp; i have oily skin - even at 51 yrs old!  </li>
            <li>The scent is exactly the same as the C line.</li>
            <li>Then lately, my skin started becoming really oily and I just happened to pick up using my mom&#x27;s face wash again.  </li>
            <li>My skin/complexion is SO clear and soft after using this!  </li>
            <li>and I have tons of almost filled face washes that left my face greasy, dry, broke out,</li>
            <li>sure if it helps my acne as I still have the same breakouts that I have been getting for years, but have been using less lotion since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hard to find authentic Obagi on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I also use Obagi Clear &amp; Exfoderm Forte, as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and sensitive skin that is prone to lots of acnes especially when I&#x27;m under stress.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the toner as well, but it&#x27;s this face wash that clearly makes the biggest difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also, keeps my face clear of acne.</li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin,and obagi is so gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Currently, I am using the Exuviance Acne-Oily Skincare line that I purchased at Ulta, after the saleswoman told me it had helped her adult acne and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it is not harsh.</li>
            <li>I continued using it after I completed the hardcore, face-melting, super-effective Nu-Derm regimen to treat my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product helps keep my skin looking young.</li>
            <li>The colors, fonts, and labeling on these bottles compared to the real items are vastly different.</li>
            <li>Amazon has completely returned my money and my products are off to a lab to test why I broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li>i am not buying from online vendors unless it is directly from the obagi company this product does not wash my face as it should.</li>
            <li>Buying this product from Amazon is certainly much cheaper than buying the product from my medical provider at their facility.  </li>
            <li>for you understanding and early reply.</li>
            <li>I am only using the face wash - not the whole system.</li>
            <li>WOW product.</li>
            <li>Used for years with complete satisfaction</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the value and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin that tends to be a bit oily.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and has evened the skin tone</li>
            <li>Still soft and supple.</li>
            <li>is the set 8 pcs the is complete</li>
            <li>A dermatologist recmnded this for reactive, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am using retin A</li>
            <li>Did the entire Obaji treatment under a doctor&#x27;s supervison about 6 years ago, and it worked very well</li>
            <li>but it cleans off my makeup well and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>, I am currently back on the whole Obagi regimine again.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even bother sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, it&#x27;s a big size</li>
            <li>I got the order, didnt need right away, finally opened it 40 days later...</li>
            <li>I try to always have it available but one large container lasts for a long time because little is required.</li>
            <li>small tube, and easy to transport.</li>
            <li>A lot of face washes are either too harsh (stripping all natural oils from your skin), or too greasy, leaving your face not feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser, a little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li>Have used for many years and tired of paying the high prices from my doctor.  </li>
            <li>Just a small amount of gel removes makeup and mascara and leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was alittle skeptical at first since I&#x27;ve tried so many brands</li>
            <li>This is the first facial cleanser that I&#x27;ve used that actually removes all traces of makeup.</li>
            <li>Because it works so well your skin will feel a little dry, so make sure you have some sort of moisturizer to apply after washing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially to those with oily skin like myself!!!</li>
            <li>About a year ago I purchased an Obagi blue peel through a Groupon deal and tried this new place.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed not dry or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I will buy no other cleansing product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands, but when you follow with a toner, the cotton pad always ends up looking like I never washed my face first.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but its worth it to get the results that I do.  </li>
            <li>the orignal product that i bought from my dermatologist worked great, unfortuantely, i must have gotten a bad batch with this online purchase.</li>
            <li>Use of the gel is generally followed by the toner (with intermittent use of Exfoderm Forte - 2 - 3 x/week).  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the Obagi Products in general.</li>
            <li>Barely a drop</li>
            <li>I am 74 years old and look about 60, people can&#x27;t believe I have grown adults in middle 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>BUY FROM A PROFESSIONAL ONLY!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 7 years now and have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I spent too much money on products that DON&#x27;T WORK,</li>
            <li>I plan to order this product from the vendor in the near future.</li>
            <li>People are surprised when I tell them what my age is as they say I look almost 15 years younger....</li>
            <li>I orginally started using Obagi Clenziderm system for my moderate adult acne.  </li>
            <li>It foams up quickly and I only need a little drop to create a lot of foam.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super foamy and difficult to rinse off of your face, and it doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>You only have to use a small amount to clean your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the clairsonic with other products though and it didn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li>I use it with the toner and really notice a difference in the way my skin feels using this product vs. other products.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you have to switch to a different product when such said product does not produce marked improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use it everyday when I shower to remove make up and dirt from my busy days and works very well.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your face, but it removes every bit of make-up.  </li>
            <li>This product removes all traces of make-up and never dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and it seemed they only made my breakouts worse.</li>
            <li>It helps balance my oily skin, but does not dry me out.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit to go a long way, and it leaves your face feeling clean without over-drying.</li>
            <li>All the products are brand new and the price is far less than what they charge at the spas.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that my skin produces less sebum, there is less need to clean it with additional scrubs etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>One small amount will leave your face so clean with minimal drying of the skin.</li>
            <li>I wear a heavy coverage makeup that is hard to remove with most washes.</li>

            <li> and so happy to have finally found Obaji foaming gel.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for making Obagi available.</li>
            <li> Waited impatiently and was very happy when i received on time.</li>
            <li> which is important to me because I have allergies.  </li>

            <li> now my face is smooth  </li>
            <li> Two drips ( honest ) removes a whole face-full of make-up.  </li>
            <li> but it is more than worth it.  </li>
            <li> Gentle but does an excellent job of cleaning and removing make up; one drop cleans my entire face!</li>

            <li> My skin is so smooth and almost wrinkle free except for laugh lines which I want!</li>

            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cleanser and told me I would not need an eye make up remover anymore - I didn&#x27;t believe it until this cleanser wiped everything clean with just one wash</li>
            <li> Does not strip your skin of moisture but leaves it feeling clean.</li>

            <li> I have searched for a long time for a Cleanser that is good.  </li>
            <li> This cleaner will help your face looking great and keep the wrinkles down.</li>
            <li> but this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Great price, but not seeing or feeling results as previous Obagi products bought at my dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> I tend to use too much product at a time because it smells so good (such a clean fresh scent).</li>
            <li> My skin was so greasy, oily, and sticky and after a good wash and dry, my face felt clean and pretty matte.  </li>
            <li> Because really Good!&lt;br /&gt;I can see the Changes in My skin!!</li>
            <li> This is not my first purchase, I am using this products for 4 months and my skin improve a lot!</li>
            <li> Best facewash I&#x27;ve ever used- been using after shaving for 15 years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t dry my face out after the horrors of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, cleans but does not strip your skin, does not leave it feeling tight and stripped, nor oily and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love all their products and over the past year have seen many great changes in my skin color, tone and overall appearance.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li> This face-wash is great, as one little bottle lasts for ages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited and HAPPY that I can order it online since it is so hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great prduct for someone that has uneven and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon and it arrived in a few days and I am so Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works amazing, can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing facial product.  </li>
            <li> use it every day and night, very cleansing and light feeling, no breakouts from it at all</li>
            <li> This wash is amazing, especially in combination with the mia2 face scrubber.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth using.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> but if you search the net you can find some good deals, especially if you buy more than one item at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer have acne issues and my skin is healthy and and clear....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not unhappy with the price.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I was using a product that was fairly expensive and claimed to be great for my kind of skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> I am generally sensitive to most products</li>
            <li> Gentle, easy and almost completely odorless (clean, extremely light scent).</li>
            <li> and I believe it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> and It really deep cleans and leaves your face nice and</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> this rarely happened before I started using this.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cleanser - you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> Not even worth a one star.</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh after washing with it.</li>
            <li> Any of the Obagi products are worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi for years and it sure maintained my skin young looking.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this product from my dermatologist office, and later found it on Amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on your skin and your face feels fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Its soothing yet potent enough to clean off my makeup and excess dirt.</li>
            <li> So,I paid special attention and double checked to make sure it&#x27;s the correct item before i clicked the one click shipping.  </li>
            <li> Obagi cuts right through like Dawn</li>
            <li> its not the right one.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s right .</li>
            <li> Product was shipped right away.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a gentle cleanser doesn&#x27;t get the face clean</li>
            <li> I use this product to clean my face, decollitage and even gets my eye makeup off at night - so gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use many face wash, and this is the first one that actually takes off my make-up completely,  and I&#x27;m glad for that.</li>
            <li> I am, however, using the entire Obagi Nu-Derm line, so I&#x27;m not sure if the foaming gel works great by itself, but I do like the way it cleanses, and the toner after makes my skin feel clean, fresh and oil free.  </li>
            <li> The best product on the market by far, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time using this face wash, and so far my skin feels really good.</li>
            <li> skin feels clean &amp; smooth, not  dry at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use very much of the product.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle so does not strip skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle to the skin as well.</li>
            <li> This product has certainly proved its worth and I will continue using this product.  </li>
            <li> It completely removes my makeup and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Skin is soft and smooth with matte finish.</li>
            <li> Now I am 42 and my skin is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write review for products, but this one is definitely worth a good review.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and it never fails me.</li>
            <li> BE Aware of the SELLER</li>
            <li> I first wash my face with Foaming Gel.</li>
            <li> will consider ordering more in the future</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much results now</li>
            <li> I think the clarisonic just really clears the pores</li>

            <li> Not sure what kind of shape the face cream will be in after being in transit in the Florida sun for one month</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft and clean and very moist, ready for further treatment.</li>
            <li> I will never look for a new product again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a consistent cleanser that makes my skin feel very refresh and squeaky clean without feeling dry and drained from my faces&#x27; natural oils</li>
            <li> I started out using the entire Obaji system - then narrowed it down to Clear and Blender (along with Retin-A) as the products most important.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many cleansers from Clarins milk cleanser, to Origins Mimosa, Nuetrogena, a few organic milk cleansers from Wholefoods and many other products recommended by my dermatologist and those recommended by friends</li>
            <li> My pores look less noticeable and I have noticed I don&#x27;t have as many cyst or under skin pimples.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it too much.</li>
            <li> the whole is key to success</li>
            <li> it is a great cleanser for someone that wants to keep troubled skin away.  </li>
            <li> This regimen really works and is well worth the couple extra minutes every morning and night.  </li>
            <li> and I have super oily skin - like wash face at 8am and tiny beads of oil on my nose by 9am.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> : I bought this after it was highly recommended by my esthetician.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> , I would highly recommend this for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly concentrated</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ordering each item off Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time and it keeps my skin clean without over drying it.</li>
            <li> They are nice, but I can&#x27;t justify the price because they only moisturize my skin, as opposed to the other things they claim to do.</li>
            <li> i Love Obagi products and have been using them now for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is a good value--a little of the product goes a long way</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the ONLY cleanser that actually washes away the mineral makeup, my greasy oily face, and leaves my skin clean!</li>
            <li> am using the whole complete Obagi Nu-Derm system.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, it feels like they filled the bottle with pink shower gel.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and not overly dry.</li>
            <li> If this is not the real product, I would be quite surprised as I cannot tell the difference if it is.  </li>
            <li> It was gentle on my sensitive</li>
            <li> color is a light pink color and it has a slippery feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Helps to help restore normal PH</li>
            <li> everyday cleansing and i love all the kiel products and the obagi line</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin, lathers pretty well and have had zero irritations using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Combined with the toner it&#x27;s my new routine.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It was delivered in time and brand new as described</li>
            <li> and then I try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products out there, expensive types or the over the counter items easily available.  </li>
            <li> I even tried Proactiv, which was good, but I dídn&#x27;t see nearly as dramatic a change as I did with the Obagi line.  </li>
            <li> I think maybe my skin is too sensitive and this product may be good for other people with less acne susceptible skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used for a week and my face is clear!</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for the past 10 years, and I really love the way it cleans my face.</li>
            <li> Getting impurities out skin first couple of days hoping to see big improvement in coming days</li>
            <li> &amp; i have oily skin - even at 51 yrs old!  </li>
            <li> The scent is exactly the same as the C line.</li>
            <li> Then lately, my skin started becoming really oily and I just happened to pick up using my mom&#x27;s face wash again.  </li>
            <li> My skin/complexion is SO clear and soft after using this!  </li>
            <li> and I have tons of almost filled face washes that left my face greasy, dry, broke out,</li>
            <li> sure if it helps my acne as I still have the same breakouts that I have been getting for years, but have been using less lotion since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hard to find authentic Obagi on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I also use Obagi Clear &amp; Exfoderm Forte, as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and sensitive skin that is prone to lots of acnes especially when I&#x27;m under stress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the toner as well, but it&#x27;s this face wash that clearly makes the biggest difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also, keeps my face clear of acne.</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin,and obagi is so gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently, I am using the Exuviance Acne-Oily Skincare line that I purchased at Ulta, after the saleswoman told me it had helped her adult acne and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it is not harsh.</li>
            <li> I continued using it after I completed the hardcore, face-melting, super-effective Nu-Derm regimen to treat my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep my skin looking young.</li>
            <li> The colors, fonts, and labeling on these bottles compared to the real items are vastly different.</li>
            <li> Amazon has completely returned my money and my products are off to a lab to test why I broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li> i am not buying from online vendors unless it is directly from the obagi company this product does not wash my face as it should.</li>
            <li> Buying this product from Amazon is certainly much cheaper than buying the product from my medical provider at their facility.  </li>
            <li> for you understanding and early reply.</li>
            <li> I am only using the face wash - not the whole system.</li>
            <li> WOW product.</li>
            <li> Used for years with complete satisfaction</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the value and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin that tends to be a bit oily.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and has evened the skin tone</li>
            <li> Still soft and supple.</li>
            <li> is the set 8 pcs the is complete</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recmnded this for reactive, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am using retin A</li>
            <li> Did the entire Obaji treatment under a doctor&#x27;s supervison about 6 years ago, and it worked very well</li>
            <li> but it cleans off my makeup well and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> , I am currently back on the whole Obagi regimine again.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even bother sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, it&#x27;s a big size</li>
            <li> I got the order, didnt need right away, finally opened it 40 days later...</li>
            <li> I try to always have it available but one large container lasts for a long time because little is required.</li>
            <li> small tube, and easy to transport.</li>
            <li> A lot of face washes are either too harsh (stripping all natural oils from your skin), or too greasy, leaving your face not feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, a little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years and tired of paying the high prices from my doctor.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount of gel removes makeup and mascara and leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was alittle skeptical at first since I&#x27;ve tried so many brands</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser that I&#x27;ve used that actually removes all traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> Because it works so well your skin will feel a little dry, so make sure you have some sort of moisturizer to apply after washing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially to those with oily skin like myself!!!</li>
            <li> About a year ago I purchased an Obagi blue peel through a Groupon deal and tried this new place.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed not dry or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I will buy no other cleansing product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but when you follow with a toner, the cotton pad always ends up looking like I never washed my face first.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but its worth it to get the results that I do.  </li>
            <li> the orignal product that i bought from my dermatologist worked great, unfortuantely, i must have gotten a bad batch with this online purchase.</li>
            <li> Use of the gel is generally followed by the toner (with intermittent use of Exfoderm Forte - 2 - 3 x/week).  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the Obagi Products in general.</li>
            <li> Barely a drop</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old and look about 60, people can&#x27;t believe I have grown adults in middle 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> BUY FROM A PROFESSIONAL ONLY!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 7 years now and have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I spent too much money on products that DON&#x27;T WORK,</li>
            <li> I plan to order this product from the vendor in the near future.</li>
            <li> People are surprised when I tell them what my age is as they say I look almost 15 years younger....</li>
            <li> I orginally started using Obagi Clenziderm system for my moderate adult acne.  </li>
            <li> It foams up quickly and I only need a little drop to create a lot of foam.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super foamy and difficult to rinse off of your face, and it doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount to clean your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the clairsonic with other products though and it didn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I use it with the toner and really notice a difference in the way my skin feels using this product vs. other products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to switch to a different product when such said product does not produce marked improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it everyday when I shower to remove make up and dirt from my busy days and works very well.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your face, but it removes every bit of make-up.  </li>
            <li> This product removes all traces of make-up and never dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and it seemed they only made my breakouts worse.</li>
            <li> It helps balance my oily skin, but does not dry me out.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit to go a long way, and it leaves your face feeling clean without over-drying.</li>
            <li> All the products are brand new and the price is far less than what they charge at the spas.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin produces less sebum, there is less need to clean it with additional scrubs etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One small amount will leave your face so clean with minimal drying of the skin.</li>
            <li> I wear a heavy coverage makeup that is hard to remove with most washes.</li>
            <li> Had a lot of hope for this, didn&#x27;t do a thing for dark spots or new acne.</li>
            <li> The prices are a little high</li>
            <li> Those that love it, really love it and those that don&#x27;t think this line is the worst for your skin since it does dry out skin.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed oily and dry skin, and i&#x27;ve tried several different types of face wash ranging from $5 to $80 and believe me I have yet to find one I have longer than 1 bottle, until I stumbled upon this gem.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out since I&#x27;ve used this wash, and it&#x27;s kept my pores clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s concentrated so a small dime size is enough for my whole face and neck  </li>
            <li> (I only use about a dime size) and the bottle seems that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It only takes a drop so will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This products LASTS a long time since it only takes a tiny bit to wash your face.  </li>
            <li> It really deep cleans my face but at the same time my face never feels dry or stripped.  </li>
            <li> I so badly wanted a more natural solution, but I am back to salicylic acid type products.</li>
            <li> It worked but not when I was under stress and it always left my face dry.</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount to absolutely remove all your make-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical in the sense that all you need is a very small drop, rub into your palms, put on wet face, wash and rinse.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about ordering on-line as far as getting a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li> I had a little bit of breakout near my lower jaw</li>
            <li> As long as I use this product daily - I have less break-outs and no dry patches.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned as the seal on the product was not tight and could slide off and on.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product as long as I get and maintain the results that I do.  </li>
            <li> It has a strange smell but</li>
            <li> Its a yellow liquid, and its supposed to be a pink.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts me for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> for many months and is actually less expensive than the previous product that I&lt;br /&gt;purchased from a major department store.</li>
            <li> I am so shocked how quickly I have seen real results from this system.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleared up my usually oily forehead and kept my usually dry cheeks normal.</li>
            <li> and so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> It is a definite must if you are using the other Obagi&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obagi has definitely brightened my skin and evened out the tone (just step 1, without any other products).</li>
            <li> so you use a tiny bit ... lasts a long time, deep cleans without being harsh.</li>
            <li> bottle goes a very long way with both of us using it.  </li>
            <li> The face soap did make my skin feel really dry</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want it dry after washing.</li>
            <li> and this face wash alone helps dry it out.</li>
            <li> slippery...or dry.</li>
            <li> It cleans your face without leaving it feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> Cleans your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and so it makes my skin dry.</li>
            <li> It has some dry patches in the winter but parts are oily.</li>
            <li> but I have not had a single breakout since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> this was at least 1/3rd the price, brand new in packaging.  </li>
            <li> only need a small amount of the product to cleanse you entire face.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the morning in the shower using only a dime sized or less in the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is a little pricy.</li>
            <li> I arrived in a timely fashion just the way I expected.</li>
            <li> Within the month of using this product, I&#x27;ve only had one acne that disappeared within a few days.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> it comes out pink and smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the gel for a few days</li>
            <li> This is not a real product.</li>
            <li> Since I got a couple things that day, they looked like the right bottle, but was wrong.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time as a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using the other steps when I&#x27;m done nursing.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product and all the other Obagi products for over 4 years now.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected and in time!</li>
            <li> I have extremely senstitive skin</li>
            <li> would like to try some other Obagi products, i.e. Chest &amp; Neck product.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for other products and just happened to come across this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this product with other Obagi products.</li>
            <li> I would have with this purchase, is that I ordered 3 items from the same shipper and they charged me $4 s/h for each item, when they all came in 1 small priority shipper box from USPS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had severe skin problems but my skin has always been uneven and has minor break outs.</li>
            <li> This a must have like the other Obagi products.</li>
            <li> and you only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> They truly compliment each other and yield maximum results.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered a cosmetic product online, and always concerned about the fake product.</li>
            <li> A little of all the products goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> A Very little of this product goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Also like to say that you need very little of this product so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time as it doesn&#x27;t take but a small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> The cost difference is at least one third cheaper!  </li>
            <li> I just wish it  had the hydroquinone in it, that helps lighten the dark spots from blemishes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used the entire line of this product and even though I do not use all of the products the way I should, this Foaming Gel Cleanser I use at least 2 times a day depending on my activity level.  </li>
            <li> I used to have dark spots on my face from pimples, and they are now gone as a result of using Obagi Nu-Derm.  </li>
            <li> She has delicate skin and her face turned beat red after using it!</li>
            <li> I also use Exfoderm and my skin is slowly transforming into younger, fresher skin.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out nor is it harsh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews of people saying this is not real OBAGI face wash...that is not true!</li>
            <li> I use the Clenziderm Cleanser in the morning and the Nu-Derm Cleanser typically at the end of the day to wash my face and remove any eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this product again from Amazon because it is so much less than the cost from my derm.</li>
            <li> My skin never feels stripped or tight...</li>
            <li> this product is thick and goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi Nu-Derm Foaming Gel for some time but thought I&#x27;d look and see if I could find it a little cheaper  on-line than what I pay for at the office.  </li>
            <li> and overnight the redness and little bumps were reduced.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a cheap product.  </li>
            <li> However, of all the systems I wasted my money on, this is the ONE.  </li>
            <li> NOT genuine Obagi product.</li>
            <li> THE TROUBLE I have to go through to get the correct item.  </li>
            <li> It took years for me to find something and thousands of dollars being paid to some of the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; dermatologists in Houston, TX wasted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because my skin is not oily.</li>
            <li> I had some trouble with the skin on my neck (pimples and stuff).</li>
            <li> my skin is not irritated, nor dried out after washing</li>
            <li> Counterfeit item with additional ingredients and missing ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t ask the neighbor to go to the trouble and return the goods on my behalf</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using some of the Obagi line for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Obagi face cleanser for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> Its a little pricy but a bottle lasts forever if you use small amounts.  </li>
            <li> For the past few nights, I have used the obagi and nothing else after washing my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure it says it on the bottle</li>
            <li> when I do it usually is caused by something I ate...</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product yet.  </li>
            <li> No more breakouts from allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li> Not authentic, used for a year and this one made me break out.. 😟</li>
            <li> Have used this on and off for the past seven years.....</li>
            <li> Disappointed so much.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews on this one and saw one reviewer complained about receiving the TONER instead of the Foam Gel.  </li>
            <li> and it has just arrived, one month late.  </li>
            <li> , at least it feels that way.  </li>
            <li> Lately I have been looking for paraben-free products, just to try to avoid any harmful side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use a few other brands and the wipe was still dirty after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I mean literally WATER.</li>
            <li> and since I heard that&#x27;s not good, I stopped using everything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi for approximately 6 years.</li>
            <li> If you have bad skin and scars from acne or dark spots, Obagi WORKS!</li>
            <li> I tried it about 4 years ago from a plastic surgeons office that sells Obagi products, I did not continue to use because I thought it was too expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is expensive face cleanser...</li>
            <li> /&gt;it looks and feels like a fake one.</li>
            <li> I was tired of this product and unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m skeptical if i have to use another cleanser.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too expensive for my budget.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing, seemed to work about as well as cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> mind that it is very expensive for any benefit.</li>
            <li> I have extremely bad acne</li>
            <li> So disappointed by the product.</li>
            <li> HATE</li>
            <li> I hate the chemicals in it</li>
            <li> This product is fake!!!!</li>
            <li> but whenever I stray to Image skincare for example my complexion changes for the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work for my skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> This Obagi line is supposedly really popular with a lot of people. Those that love it, really love it and those that don&#x27;t think this line is the worst for your skin since it does dry out skin.  A couple years ago, my mom tried to get me to use the facial wash and toner and I found the toner pretty ok at exfoliating my skin without drying it out (after all, it&#x27;s supposed to balance your skin pH out).  The face soap did make my skin feel really dry and since I heard that&#x27;s not good, I stopped using everything.  Then lately, my skin started becoming really oily and I just happened to pick up using my mom&#x27;s face wash again.  My skin was so greasy, oily, and sticky and after a good wash and dry, my face felt clean and pretty matte.  The one thing that bothered me is after lathering and I am trying to rinse the facial soap off, I feel like I cannot wash all the residue off.  The feeling is like an oily film on the face and I know I have tried by best rinsing all of the soap off.  Oh well, I don&#x27;t know what that was about but it&#x27;s worth using.  This is a popular line for spas and skin professionals so it&#x27;s not a cheap product.  The price seems pretty decent, here, on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Part of my facial routine recommended by my skin specialist.</li>
            <li> Same as what I buy at doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Love all obaji products. I am 54 and have been using obaji products for years. The results are amazing. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use it morning &amp; night.  Doctor said use 2 minutes w/fingers only, for my type skin.  It cleans my skin without drying it too much.  Will continue to order from Amazon - best price.</li>
            <li> Best facewash I&#x27;ve ever used- been using after shaving for 15 years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t dry my face out after the horrors of shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years and won&#x27;t trade even if the option is free. Improved my skin appearance</li>
            <li> Smells great! Skin is soft and smooth with matte finish. I also use Exfoderm and my skin is slowly transforming into younger, fresher skin. Using for 2 weeks from today&#x27;s date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products out there, expensive types or the over the counter items easily available.  However, of all the systems I wasted my money on, this is the ONE.  This cleanser is the ONLY cleanser that actually washes away the mineral makeup, my greasy oily face, and leaves my skin clean! It doesn&#x27;t irritate of overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am using the whole complete Obagi Nu-Derm system.  I am now on their Maintenance Program and my skin is smoother, brighter and supple! I&#x27;m glad I can purchase this wonderful cleanser from Amazon and not have to go into my Derm&#x27;s office to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Feb. 13, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I am not using the Obagi system anymore because after years of using this line, it was not doing anything for my skin anymore.  I believe because as time goes on our skin&#x27;s conditions change with the weather, our health, stress level, hormonal changes, etc.  Sometimes you have to switch to a different product when such said product does not produce marked improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I am using the Exuviance Acne-Oily Skincare line that I purchased at Ulta, after the saleswoman told me it had helped her adult acne and oily skin.  We&#x27;ll see, as only time will tell how this will work for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash. I wear a heavy coverage makeup that is hard to remove with most washes. Obagi cuts right through like Dawn soap liquid does to the oil on the birds.. I love this product.</li>
            <li> NOT genuine Obagi product. As another reviewer said, it feels like they filled the bottle with pink shower gel. It&#x27;s super foamy and difficult to rinse off of your face, and it doesn&#x27;t smell right. Stripped every bit of moisture off of my face. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, legit product.  Hard to find authentic Obagi on Amazon.  Perfect, will order again</li>
            <li> I have also used this product for years and have had great results. At the age of 60 people always tell me how great my skin looks and how I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles.  I think these products have helped me greatly.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, service, company etc. Very excited I found a company that sells this product at the quality and price being offered. Will buy again soon</li>
            <li> This product is misrepresented and counterfeit!!  I have the same product from my dermatologist and none of the ingredients are the same!! Burned me once and once only!!</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin. I use the Clenziderm Cleanser in the morning and the Nu-Derm Cleanser typically at the end of the day to wash my face and remove any eye makeup. You only need a little bit to go a long way, and it leaves your face feeling clean without over-drying. It also has a pleasant scent too.</li>
            <li> Barely a drop and you have plenty of luxurious fragrant gel wash for your face.  Ignored this for years, which was supplied by a plastic surgeon.&lt;br /&gt;So happy with this; as only need to use very little and easily rinses off.  Very happy to find this at Amazon, instead of the doctor&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> By far the greatest wash I have used and I have tons of almost filled face washes that left my face greasy, dry, broke out, Rashed up. This is all I have used for about 4 years</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser. The best I have found. It lasts forever and dies not irritate my skin. A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product from my dermatologist office, and later found it on Amazon for a better price. This is the best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves oily skin clean and smooth without over drying. I will never look for a new product again! I&#x27;m very pleased with Obagi products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update* I still use this wash and love it, but I&#x27;ve given up on the Obagi eye creams. They are nice, but I can&#x27;t justify the price because they only moisturize my skin, as opposed to the other things they claim to do. But this wash is the best -- time to order more!</li>
            <li> Best product for gently cleansing your face.  Just a small amount of gel removes makeup and mascara and leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many cleansers from Clarins milk cleanser, to Origins Mimosa, Nuetrogena, a few organic milk cleansers from Wholefoods and many other products recommended by my dermatologist and those recommended by friends and so happy to have finally found Obaji foaming gel. I have T zone issues as most people do so I like my face clean but I don&#x27;t want it dry after washing. My esthetician asked that I include Obaji in my daily regimen. I was alittle skeptical at first since I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and they worked just OK, until I tried it. It&#x27;s been a consistent cleanser that makes my skin feel very refresh and squeaky clean without feeling dry and drained from my faces&#x27; natural oils afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using the other steps when I&#x27;m done nursing.</li>
            <li> Have just started using the Obagi products and I love the foaming gel.  I don&#x27;t have to use very much of the product.  Only have to wash my face once with the foaming gel and it removes my makeup.  Then I use the toner, and absolutely love the way my face is beginning to feel.  Knock on wood, but......these products might actually do what they say they will!!!!!  What about that......</li>
            <li> Purchased via Amazon to save money.  Happy with cost of product for results I&#x27;m getting with using the Obagi system.</li>
            <li> A lot of face washes are either too harsh (stripping all natural oils from your skin), or too greasy, leaving your face not feeling clean.  This is a great product, cleans but does not strip your skin, does not leave it feeling tight and stripped, nor oily and greasy.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with oily skin and acne since I was twelve. 3 years ago after trying everything else out there I purchased the Obagi line for oily skin. Now I am 42 and my skin is clear and smooth. The foaming gel is clean and does not leave residue. It&#x27;s also gentle on my skin. I will never use anything else. Thank you Amazon for making Obagi available.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Don&#x27;t think I could do with it. Leaves skin feeling very skin and refresed. Great product!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write review for products, but this one is definitely worth a good review. I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 6 month now and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle. Just needs a drop to clean my face completely and helps with keeping the skin moisturized. I use it once every night and it keeps my skin fresh and acne free. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin soft and supple.  I always look for the best price on this product on Amazon Obagi had it this time.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi cleanser not drying on the skin!  I use this all the time and it never fails me. The best!</li>
            <li> Obagi Foaming Gel is the best cleanser. Gentle but does an excellent job of cleaning and removing make up; one drop cleans my entire face!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 10 yrs. and love it for my face. A Very little of this product goes a LONG way. It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have searched for a long time for a Cleanser that is good.  Read the reviews on this one and saw one reviewer complained about receiving the TONER instead of the Foam Gel.  So,I paid special attention and double checked to make sure it&#x27;s the correct item before i clicked the one click shipping.  Waited impatiently and was very happy when i received on time. BUT guess what?  I received the TONER!!! The seller definitely had a problem of sell pushing the TONER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE THE TROUBLE I have to go through to get the correct item.  BE Aware of the SELLER \\&quot;BEST OF BEAUTY\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Love it  My favorite face wash</li>
            <li> Got the items I was looking for at a good price.  The product works the best I have ever tried to remove my makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product and all the other Obagi products for over 4 years now.  My skin loves it.  The best product on the market by far, at least for me.  A little pricey, but its worth it to get the results that I do.  Give it a try, I know you will love it. Fast delivery and packaged well.  Will continue to use this product as long as I get and maintain the results that I do.  Happy customer!</li>
            <li> Been using this item for over 3 years, love it</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed not dry or heavy.  Great scent too which is important to me because I have allergies.  I love Obagi products and would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love the Obagi series. Does wonders for my acne-prone skin. I have been using it for a long time and it keeps my skin clean without over drying it. It removes all kinds of make up and daily pore clogging materials.</li>
            <li> What a great price for a great product!  I have used Obagi for eight years and really love the product.  It was wonderful to find it at this price point.  The product arrived as expected and in time!</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi products for about 7 years and will continue to do so in the future. The prices are a little high but if you search the net you can find some good deals, especially if you buy more than one item at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser really takes off all the makeup off your face. Because it works so well your skin will feel a little dry, so make sure you have some sort of moisturizer to apply after washing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi foaming gel cleanser for about 1 year now.  I tried it about 4 years ago from a plastic surgeons office that sells Obagi products, I did not continue to use because I thought it was too expensive.  About a year ago I purchased an Obagi blue peel through a Groupon deal and tried this new place.  I decided to start using the foaming gel cleanser again.  I love the product.  It leaves my face so clean and not dried out,  I then found it on Amazon for about 1/2 the price!  I am using it morning and night and I love the product.</li>
            <li> I use it as part of my obagi nu derm regimen &amp; I love it. It makes my skin feel squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it too much. I also use it when I&#x27;m off the regimen.</li>
            <li> This is very nice face cleanser.I have sensitive skin, and it is not harsh. It lathers up, to make a nice foam</li>
            <li> I simply LOVE Obagi and I am looking to buy more products. I have extremely bad acne and this face wash alone helps dry it out. I have been looking for a product that is efficient to handle this &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34; and this by far is the best. It took years for me to find something and thousands of dollars being paid to some of the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; dermatologists in Houston, TX wasted. I&#x27;m super excited and HAPPY that I can order it online since it is so hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The smell alone is enough to keep me buying this but it also works great. Lightly foamy and clean smelling product.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. My face is clean, not dry, not greasy and keeps the acne at bay...I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It only takes a very small amount to absolutely remove all your make-up. I want to thank my sister for recommending it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face wash ever!!! I had used many brands, many just leave your face with\\&quot;too much\\&quot;... slippery...or dry. My skin is combination, dry to normal, this is perfect for me. The smell is wonderful, nice. This product leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Love it and highly recommend it. The seller is one of the fastest on delivery service, received my product in matter of 2 or 3 days, on standard shipping!!! Got an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years and it is still the best facial cleanser I have ever used. I continued using it after I completed the hardcore, face-melting, super-effective Nu-Derm regimen to treat my adult acne. I have tried many, many products and even when I use any other mild, daily regimen I first wash my face with Foaming Gel.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended. Mild , easy to use, long lasting. Well priced. small tube, and easy to transport. Only reviewing so that you will continue to carry this product at this price.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin. This product cleanse my skin superbly and doesn&#x27;t irritate. Makes my skin shine and feel good.</li>
            <li> This cleanser lathers up great and feels nice on my skin. It&#x27;s very gentle, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Low cost Obagi, that  is genuine. I have tried alternatives and come back to Obagi. It is pleasant to use and is gentle on oily skin, unlike others that are too harsh.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a stranger because I was complimenting her skin so I decided to order it thru Amazon. I love this product. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It is all I use and I get so many compliments on my skin too!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Has helped my face remain clean and smooth without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time using this face wash, and so far my skin feels really good. I&#x27;ve use many face wash, and this is the first one that actually takes off my make-up completely,  and I&#x27;m glad for that. So far so good :-).</li>
            <li> When you wash, this makes your face feel clean, no soap residue, then continue with steps 2-4 and yor ready for the day</li>
            <li> i really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;its one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;shipped on time.&lt;br /&gt;this product really works. will consider ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good foaming cleanser for awhile. This one is my favorite. Very happy with this. I received it very quickly and am overall very glad I came to amazon to buy this product</li>
            <li> Obagi facial products are the Best! I&#x27;ve been using Obagi for approximately 6 years. I no longer have acne issues and my skin is healthy and and clear.... Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews of people saying this is not real OBAGI face wash...that is not true! I&#x27;ve almost used up the entire bottle and my skin is flawless. I used to purchase this from my dermatologist, but it was rather costly, so I thought I&#x27;d give Amazon a try. They did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Cleanser leaves your face feeling fresh, clean, and light. It has a great sudsy feeling so works perfect with a Clarisonic. Have been using it for years because of how gentle yet effective it is.</li>
            <li> I have extremely senstitive skin and I have been using this foaming gel for years. It works to my skins needs and totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This product was prescribed by my Dermatologist and it is outstanding!  My complexion has never been clearer...I also use Obagi Clear &amp; Exfoderm Forte, as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to try some other Obagi products, i.e. Chest &amp; Neck product.  I need to find the best pricing as possible, so I&#x27;m very motivated to purchase from an entity where I can get it at discounted pricing (the dermatologist&#x27;s pricing is fairly high).&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making these products available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth Sinnott</li>
            <li> This daily foaming gel is a great an gentle daily face cleaner. Over the years I have seen friends faces look wrinkled from using soap. This cleaner will help your face looking great and keep the wrinkles down.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my skin feel nice and clean without overly drying it. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because my skin is not oily. I alternate with a creamy cleanser. The packaging is a good value--a little of the product goes a long way (I only use about a dime size) and the bottle seems that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really works. I&#x60;m going to keep using it. I had some trouble with the skin on my neck (pimples and stuff). IT&#x60;s all gone!!! I&#x60;ve been using it for about a month. It also works great on my face, the skin is very clean and the fragrance is wonderful. I also noticed that my skin produces less sebum, there is less need to clean it with additional scrubs etc. Every evening Im looking forward to using my Obagi cleanser. Already ordered Obagi sunscreen. Highly recommendable!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using obagy foaming gel for 7 years now. I can&#x27;t replace it and I can&#x27;t stop treating my face without it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Have used for years</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel. I have used it for about two weeks and I have noticed a lot of my blackheads are coming to the surface. My pores look less noticeable and I have noticed I don&#x27;t have as many cyst or under skin pimples.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I started out using the entire Obaji system - then narrowed it down to Clear and Blender (along with Retin-A) as the products most important.  However, I was surprised to find that I couldn&#x27;t find a cleanser I liked better - and I&#x27;m not unhappy with the price.  I use it in the evening with my Clarisonic brush.  It foams well and takes all my makeup off (except eye makeup, of course).  Even if I switch my regime, I&#x27;ll keep using this cleanser.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Best acne solution and I have tried everything. Get the entire set and see the difference. Obagi nuderm is the way to go for flawless or near flawless skin.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Great for the skin. Dermatologist recommended. you will definitely notice the difference as the product is being used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over five years. I find it removes make up thoroughly. It leaves the skin soft and clean and very moist, ready for further treatment.It is very gentle so does not strip skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use Obagi gel because it cleans and is gentle on the skin. A 6.7 oz. bottle goes a very long way with both of us using it.  You only need a drop.</li>
            <li> Very good cleansing gel.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash, it removes makeup and leaves my (sometimes oily/ sometimes dry) skin very clean feeling! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love to wash my face with this product.  I have used all the Obagi Products for years &amp; can&#x27;t find anything better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi products for years. It&#x27;s the best on the market</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old and look about 60, people can&#x27;t believe I have grown adults in middle 50&#x27;s.I credit this to genes and this product. My skin is so smooth and almost wrinkle free except for laugh lines which I want! Who wants a crabby look and smooth skin!  I recommend the whole line of Nu Derm.</li>
            <li> I have used this face wash for a while now and I like how it cleans without drying.</li>
            <li> i like the way this gel soap cleans my face and all the make-up/mascara.  my skin is not irritated, nor dried out after washing</li>
            <li> I use this with my Clarisonic and it has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.  Just enough foam without leaving a residue.  Obagi makes some of the best skin are on the market. Also try the 15% vitamin C serum, elastiderm eye treatment and their sunscreen. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Started using this summer and have had great results. Leaves my face feeling clean and not overly dry. Ordered through Amazon and saved!</li>
            <li> Love this product for a thorough non-drying cleanse. Lasts a long time as it doesn&#x27;t take but a small amount to do the job. Prompt delivery from this company.</li>
            <li> As we grow older we find we need products that help us maintain healthy skin.  This product helps keep my skin looking young.</li>
            <li> Had a lot of hope for this, didn&#x27;t do a thing for dark spots or new acne. t&#x27;s been over a month. Still using it though.....</li>
            <li> Have used this for a while now and I still love it. Works well, smells great,maintains my skin!</li>
            <li> Been using for 6 years.im 58 my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years. Always gives me a clear and clean complexion.</li>
            <li> I will buy no other cleansing product.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It really takes off your makeup well even on your eyes without burning.  It&#x27;s gentle on your skin and your face feels fresh and clean.  I also use the Obagi exfoliating scrub and that&#x27;s a break product also.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! It&#x27;s very concentrated, you don&#x27;t need a lot and so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Still pricey but the product is great...the whole is key to success and I have nothing more to add at this time</li>
            <li> This is expensive face cleanser...but my daughter really likes it, so I keep buying it because it seems to work well. :)</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON. COUNTERFEIT ALERT . Counterfeit item with additional ingredients and missing ingredients. I have the real items from my plastic surgeon. The colors, fonts, and labeling on these bottles compared to the real items are vastly different. Amazon has completely returned my money and my products are off to a lab to test why I broke out in a rash. BUY FROM A PROFESSIONAL ONLY!</li>
            <li> Cleanses good and smells great. I recommend this highly and I didn&#x27;t have to go into the office to pick it up.  I arrived in a timely fashion just the way I expected.</li>
            <li> Obagi has worked wonders for my skin!! Overall, my skin has become more healthy.  I also enjoy the support which Obagi offers through emails and the information pertained throughout.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite facial cleanser.  My dermatologist recommended it.  It cleans your face without leaving it feeling dry.  I always order two so that I have a back up!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this facial cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle and cleans well! Makes her face feel clean and smooth. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foaming face wash. I have mixed oily and dry skin, and i&#x27;ve tried several different types of face wash ranging from $5 to $80 and believe me I have yet to find one I have longer than 1 bottle, until I stumbled upon this gem. It&#x27;s cleared up my usually oily forehead and kept my usually dry cheeks normal. I haven&#x27;t broken out since I&#x27;ve used this wash, and it&#x27;s kept my pores clean.</li>
            <li> i am not buying from online vendors unless it is directly from the obagi company this product does not wash my face as it should. the orignal product that i bought from my dermatologist worked great, unfortuantely, i must have gotten a bad batch with this online purchase.</li>
            <li> Really good cleanser. It will last (almost) for ever and it is non allergenic. As good as in store retailer.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever ysed. I can count on Obagi to have products of excellence. I try to always have it available but one large container lasts for a long time because little is required.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommenced this product after I had some laser surgery performed on my face.  This product has certainly proved its worth and I will continue using this product.  Buying this product from Amazon is certainly much cheaper than buying the product from my medical provider at their facility.  The cost difference is at least one third cheaper!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial wash!  You can feel it moisturize as well as cleanse.  It has a nice fragrance as well.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for the past 10 years, and I really love the way it cleans my face.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser.  Once you use it you won&#x27;t use anything else.  It&#x27;s my cleanser of choice.  Great product.  I&#x27;ll buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over six years.  I  like the fresh and clean feeling I get after I use this product.</li>
            <li> Dear Sirs,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I bought Obagi Nu-Derm Foaming Gel  Cleanser, now I have just received them&lt;br /&gt;and I regret to tell you that Shower Gel I ordered is of incredibly low quality and&lt;br /&gt;it looks and feels like a fake one. I can tell it most definitely as I have been using&lt;br /&gt;this model quite for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, when arrived the bottle was already opened, whereas the parcel was not&lt;br /&gt;and all the transportation seals were not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could you please tell me how can we solve this situation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope for you understanding and early reply.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and sensitive skin that is prone to lots of acnes especially when I&#x27;m under stress. Before I bought this product, I was using a product that was fairly expensive and claimed to be great for my kind of skin. It worked but not when I was under stress and it always left my face dry. It&#x27;s a 3 step product so I always had to toner and moisturize after cleansing and I was still having acnes. The lotion made my face even more oily and the toner stings my face. I was tired of this product and unhappy with the results. I was looking for other products and just happened to come across this product on Amazon. I ordered it because it was cheaper than my first product. It arrived quickly and I started using it right away. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it is an amazing product. I wish I found this product sooner. It has a strange smell but nothing I can&#x27;t tolerate. It foams up quickly and I only need a little drop to create a lot of foam. I still use a toner afterwards but it&#x27;s not a name brand toner....just a drug store toner and I use a drug store lotion that is great for my oily skin. Within the month of using this product, I&#x27;ve only had one acne that disappeared within a few days. I am truly a satisfied customer with this cleanser and will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash. It was recommended by a skin specialist and I have been using for about 7 years, will not be without it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foaming cleanser.  I first purchased this product from a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount of the product to cleanse you entire face.  The bottle&lt;br /&gt;lasts for many months and is actually less expensive than the previous product that I&lt;br /&gt;purchased from a major department store.</li>
            <li> Great foaming clenser. I have ussed it for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi for years - great product.</li>
            <li> I got the order, didnt need right away, finally opened it 40 days later...its not the right one.  Its a yellow liquid, and its supposed to be a pink.  It doesnt foam at all.  Says cleanser, not what I ordered.  Since I got a couple things that day, they looked like the right bottle, but was wrong.  Now I am stuck with something I dont use.  BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> great price on Amazon and it is a great cleanser for someone that wants to keep troubled skin away.  The line is a great prduct and I ahve been on this line for over 10 yrs. It is good to switch up so your skin does not plateau. Great prduct for someone that has uneven and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi Nu-Derm Foaming Gel for some time but thought I&#x27;d look and see if I could find it a little cheaper  on-line than what I pay for at the office.  I was a little concerned about ordering on-line as far as getting a counterfeit product.  My order arrived as promised and was packaged well so there was no damage in transit.  The free shipping was a plus for me as was the sample product. I was a little concerned as the seal on the product was not tight and could slide off and on.  If this is not the real product, I would be quite surprised as I cannot tell the difference if it is.  Great service and a company I would do business with again.</li>
            <li> Awesome for clear skin. Massage in with warm water, 30 minutes, see skin glow</li>
            <li> I loved it, just want I was looking for. I am very satisfied and very happy about this product, I received it on time. Thank You</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to arrive during my stay at my vacation home.  There was some issue with the delivery and it has just arrived, one month late.  I allowed for a 2 week window for the package to arrive and paid for 3 - 5 day service.  I am no longer on vacation so I had to get a neighbor to pick up the package.  Not sure what kind of shape the face cream will be in after being in transit in the Florida sun for one month but I can&#x27;t ask the neighbor to go to the trouble and return the goods on my behalf so I will probably dispose of it during my next visit.  Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this works really well. It leaves my face feeling soft and clean and I think I&#x27;ve had fewer break-outs since I started using it. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great stuff I guess my wife won&#x27;t use anything else. She has skin allergies to most cosmetics and and some soaps.</li>
            <li> I originally found out about this face wash from my doctor&#x27;s office where I was given a sample. I liked it a lot but wanted to see if I could find it cheaper online. I ordered it from Amazon and it arrived in a few days and I am so Happy with my purchase. I am only using the face wash - not the whole system. My skin is the clearest it has ever been in about 10 years! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> WOW product. Absolutely amazing face wash ever !. Leaves face fresh and super clean. Very gentle to the skin as well. Hihgly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi products on and off for years, I always come back to it. It is one of the nicest cleansers available. It is gentle and balanced. Helps to help restore normal PH</li>
            <li> It would scare a person to see their actual skin with the build up of what some cleansers leave.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is gentle yet highly effective. It is a definite must if you are using the other Obagi&lt;br /&gt;Nu Derm products and to me a must even if you weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Obagi is the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> Used for years with complete satisfaction</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  I love Obagi.... This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> My Mama recommended this to me and I love it. It cleans well and you only need a teeny dot- a little goes a long way. I use toner after and the cotton wipe is always clean after toner application b/c this cleanser has done it job. I&#x27;ve use a few other brands and the wipe was still dirty after washing my face.</li>
            <li> Pros: I bought this after it was highly recommended by my esthetician. It has an amazing scent and made my skin feel clean and fresh. It was gentle on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I am acne prone and this did nothing to help decrease my acne. I so badly wanted a more natural solution, but I am back to salicylic acid type products.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the value and speedy delivery. I love this cleanser. One small amount will leave your face so clean with minimal drying of the skin. Creamy cleansers never controlled my blemishes like this product.</li>
            <li> Cleans your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I have never tried Obagi products before, but on the advice the my dermatologist, I gave this cleanser a try.  I have mature skin that tends to be a bit oily.  This cleanser is perfect.  My face is not tight afterwards and feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Another product my dermotologist recommended.  I love this gel...it comes out pink and smells heavenly.  It goes on smoothly and is easy to wash off.  You will be extremely happy.  it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out nor is it harsh!</li>
            <li> I give 5 ***** Because really Good!&lt;br /&gt;I can see the Changes in My skin!! Just try it U going to see the changes in u skin ,I love it</li>
            <li> obagi is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I basically use the entire skin care line.  I&#x27;ve had moderate acne since I was a teenager and have tried everything under the sun to get my skin clearer.  I even tried Proactiv, which was good, but I dídn&#x27;t see nearly as dramatic a change as I did with the Obagi line.  I used Proactiv for a year and have only used Obagi for six months. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Getting impurities out skin first couple of days hoping to see big improvement in coming days</li>
            <li> Disappointing, seemed to work about as well as cetaphil.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cleanser and told me I would not need an eye make up remover anymore - I didn&#x27;t believe it until this cleanser wiped everything clean with just one wash, I love it and highly recommend it.  I have dry skin and it does not feel stripped after washing.</li>
            <li> This product cleanses my oily/combo skin thoroughly. Removes all oil and makeup while leaving skin soft and feeling clean. I will purchase this product again from Amazon because it is so much less than the cost from my derm. I use this product with other Obagi products. Also like to say that you need very little of this product so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! The best facial wash ever!!!</li>
            <li> Best facewash I&#x27;ve ever used. Washes off all makeup, eye makeup and leaves skin clean after one wash!!!</li>
            <li> Using the Obagi product line is like getting a face lift without the face lift.  Keeps my skin soft and has evened the skin tone and I no longer have any break outs.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this very rich cleanser. I can always trust Obagi to create the most effective and top of the line products. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works amazing, can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the Obagi Nu-Derm System! The cleanser is step one in this system. My skin is blemish free &amp; has been since starting use of this system. To be able to get it online from Amazon is fantastic for me &amp; has saved me from driving 35+ miles to purchase it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just wish it  had the hydroquinone in it, that helps lighten the dark spots from blemishes. A good product. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Loving this face wash!! Saw it mentioned on a blog last week so decided to order it and give it a try... and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I had been using Pur Minerals Simplicity but this is my new favorite. And I actually love the smell of this stuff too!</li>
            <li> Great product that costs twice as much at a dermatology office. Great to see it available online cutting out the doctor&#x27;s up-charge.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing facial product.  I had a noticeable improvement in just a couple weeks using this &amp; the number two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi Nu-Derm Foaming Gel for about 4 years. I have combination skin and this gel works very well for me. I use it twice daily. It completely removes my makeup and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for many years and I love it.  It is gentle, but works great and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great daily wash!! Love all the Obagi products.</li>
            <li> Love everything obagi. Best face wash for every skin type.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi Nu-Derm.  This regimen really works and is well worth the couple extra minutes every morning and night.  I really have not come across another cleanser that does the job as thoroughly without drying even when washing my face as enthusiastically as recommended (min. one minute of lathering morning and night).  Well worth the price and it lasts a long time as a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> like this face wash alot</li>
            <li> Very good product  use it every day and night, very cleansing and light feeling, no breakouts from it at all</li>
            <li> Best cleanser out there. Does not strip your skin of moisture but leaves it feeling clean. Not sure it says it on the bottle but I feel this might be hypoallergenic. I am generally sensitive to most products so I&#x27;m skeptical if i have to use another cleanser. I have been using this for 7 years now and have no regrets.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me for oily skin.  I am quite pleased with it. I am, however, using the entire Obagi Nu-Derm line, so I&#x27;m not sure if the foaming gel works great by itself, but I do like the way it cleanses, and the toner after makes my skin feel clean, fresh and oil free.  My only complaint I would have with this purchase, is that I ordered 3 items from the same shipper and they charged me $4 s/h for each item, when they all came in 1 small priority shipper box from USPS.  They should have cut me a break on the shipping, but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This deep-cleaning face wash has done more to shrink my pores than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  It would be good for oily skin types, though use with a good moisturizer will give you good results.</li>
            <li> If you have bad skin and scars from acne or dark spots, Obagi WORKS! I spent too much money on products that DON&#x27;T WORK, THIS DOES</li>
            <li> I love all their products and over the past year have seen many great changes in my skin color, tone and overall appearance.</li>
            <li> Two drops on the palm of my hand is all I need to wash my face morning or night.&lt;br /&gt;my skin feels clean &amp; smooth, not  dry at all.  One bottle lasts me for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Removes most if not all makeup and oil. Smells really nice . Leaves skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using some of the Obagi line for a few years now.  This foaming gel is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It takes off even the most stubborn eye makeup but it is gentle, very effective cleaning and leaves skin so soft with no residue or dryness.  It&#x27;s economical in the sense that all you need is a very small drop, rub into your palms, put on wet face, wash and rinse.  Bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two years.  I like this product and all Nu-Derm line from obagi . I recommend</li>
            <li> I got some Exfoderm that I think is a knock off but this product was good.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> this is a gentle cleanser &amp; i have oily skin - even at 51 yrs old!  the obagi system leaves my skin smoother and brighter</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cleanse my skin that I still need to use number 2 to totally clean my face and so it makes my skin dry. So it didn&#x27;t get rid of my blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cleanser to anyone. My skin looks and feels clean, refreshed, free of makeup and oils but not stripped. Still soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Came in as described, love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I love these products. I have tried many different product lines and this is the best is you want an even skin tone. I recommend this line for people with problem skin.</li>
            <li> I learned about Obaji from an esthetician and now use this product every day and my skin is so clean.  I highly recommend to any one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Obagi face cleanser for a few years.  It is not necessary to remove your eye make up, as it will safely take off the eye make up. I appreciate that I can buy this on Amazon more cheaply than from my doctor&#x27;s office.  I use it in the morning in the shower using only a dime sized or less in the palm of my hand.  Also I use it  at night before putting on my night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a light pink color and it has a slippery feel to it.  It is easy to remove with warm water.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.I feel as if I get my money out of this product.It leaves my face clean and soft not a harsh cleaner.</li>
            <li> Love Obagi fave soap.  Leaves my face so clean!!  Not to drying.  Just enough.  My face never feels oily after using this.</li>
            <li> This is the best in all products I have ever used. I wish though I could find something that worked for brown spots</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. It removes makeup completely and leaves my face soft and clean. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi foaming gel for years and is, by far, the best face cleanser on the market.  It does not dry out your face, but it removes every bit of make-up.  I have tried other brands, but when you follow with a toner, the cotton pad always ends up looking like I never washed my face first.  This product removes all traces of make-up and never dry out your skin.  As long as I use this product daily - I have less break-outs and no dry patches.</li>
            <li> Received the order a lot sooner than expected - a wonderful surprise! Everything was as expected. Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> good . exelent ,,I love is good for clean the face is the set 8 pcs the is complete is perfect</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser its so gentle on my skin. I had a little bit of breakout near my lower jaw and overnight the redness and little bumps were reduced. My face feels so smooth and silky. Did not irritate my skin. Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser!!!! Best I&#x27;ve ever had. My skin has never felt that clean before! Love it. Definitely suggest to try it.</li>
            <li> I love obagi products! But this is the best for anti aging when you combine it with the toner, clear, exfoderm, and tretinoin cream. My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect product! I have used for a week and my face is clear! I have tried so many products and it seemed they only made my breakouts worse. I will never buy anything else after using this. It only takes a drop so will last a long time. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  I used to use the MD Forte Glycolic Cleanser &amp;  it was good but after a while I didn&#x27;t see much results now I use the Obagi Foaming Cleanser and my face feels clean &amp; when incorporated with the Obagi Nu Derm System it is the best!</li>
            <li> Loved this soap for my face, got to haved it ever since I start using the Obagi products. this gel gives a clean feeling to my face and feel fresh. It goes along way because you don&#x27;t need alot to wash your face.</li>
            <li> Obgai Nu-Derm Foaming Gel is a great product for my skin. The order arrived from the vendor on time and was packaged nicely and professionally. I plan to order this product from the vendor in the near future.</li>
            <li> I really love this cleanser.  I use it with a washcloth and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, a little goes a long way too. I&#x27;ve been using for close to a year and very rarely to I get a blemish, when I do it usually is caused by something I ate...darn you Hershey&#x27;s Kisses!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered this face wash a couple times and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve never had severe skin problems but my skin has always been uneven and has minor break outs. Obagi has definitely brightened my skin and evened out the tone (just step 1, without any other products). I&#x27;ve bought the toner as well, but it&#x27;s this face wash that clearly makes the biggest difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice as well, not chemical smelling at all. I use this product with my Clarisonic, great pair up. I&#x27;ve used the clairsonic with other products though and it didn&#x27;t really make a difference. I think the clarisonic just really clears the pores but it&#x27;s Obagi that really cleared the skin and brightened my complexion. I think pairing this product with some kind of exfoliating device helps a lot but it&#x27;s a really great product regardless.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product yet.  It has been almost 3 months of use and I don&#x27;t see any difference.  I have noticed it has made me break out more, at least it feels that way.  I do like the smell and how it feels on my face right after I use it, it feels really clean.  I think maybe my skin is too sensitive and this product may be good for other people with less acne susceptible skin.  I will probably just go back to proactive so that I don&#x27;t break out anymore.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any blemishes improve and I have used it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I use the Nu Derm  forming gel and its great!! My skin looks young and fresh.</li>
            <li> This product is fake!!!! I love Obagi and this does not feel like the original one..</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recmnded this for reactive, sensitive skin. She&#x27;s right . It&#x27;s gentle yet thorough. Sometimes a gentle cleanser doesn&#x27;t get the face clean but this one does yet without \\&quot;stripping\\&quot; it. No burning or \\&quot;drawn\\&quot; skin. Just clean &amp; happy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s oil free if that&#x27;s important for you.</li>
            <li> This cleanser by Obagi is one of two facial washes I like to use on my skin.  It helps prevent breakouts, and seems to get my skin really clean.  very happy with this seller too.  Product was shipped right away.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi Nu-Derm for years and it has continued to be consistent in quality, effectiveness and value. Gentle, easy and almost completely odorless (clean, extremely light scent). In my opinion it is, by far, the best face wash on the market. I&#x27;d be lost without it! Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> i Love Obagi products and have been using them now for a little over a year.  My skin is great!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this cleanser. Suds up nicely, don&#x27;t have to use much, leave skin feeling clean but not stripped. Combined with the toner it&#x27;s my new routine.</li>
            <li> If there is a better way to remove make up, dirt, oil, etc. from the face, I haven&#x27;t found it.  Obagi does all of this gently.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, it has a very clean fragrance and cleans your skin without drying it out which is what I look for.</li>
            <li> My Dr. had me buy this at his office.... trust me this was at least 1/3rd the price, brand new in packaging.  Bought two at a time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi Nu Derm line for almost a year and my skin looks great.  I don&#x27;t have to wear any make-up except on my eyes.  This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve purchased the cleanser and I don&#x27;t plan on using anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in time and brand new as described</li>
            <li> This face wash works great for me compared to others. Does not dry out my skin, lathers pretty well and have had zero irritations using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it helps my acne as I still have the same breakouts that I have been getting for years, but have been using less lotion since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I will use. I have combination skin, but after using couple Obagi products, my skin has never looked better. Purchased Obagi products from this seller multiple times. It is way cheaper to buy Obagi products on Amazon than from an esthetician.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser for my face</li>
            <li> Great cleanser.  You only have to use a small amount to clean your face.  Been using for over 8 yrs. now and people are amazed with my skin.  I am 54 and people never believe it.  I love all of Obagi&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanse. Use it everyday when I shower to remove make up and dirt from my busy days and works very well. It leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean but not overly dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and you can see the difference  when applied.  My face is refreshed , bright  and feels very clean and soft .  Thanks I love it.</li>
            <li> Never dries and gets all my make up off. It also, keeps my face clear of acne.</li>
            <li> My face always feels very clean after using.  The scent is pleasant, and I like that it foams. It lasts a long time and I believe it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This wash is amazing, especially in combination with the mia2 face scrubber. It helps balance my oily skin, but does not dry me out. i use it twice a day and it has done wonders for my skin. My face feels so clean and fresh.  My face is oily on the nose, and chin, but dryer on the cheeks - this wash degreases the oil without drying but helps balance the dryer areas without making them more dry.  I LOVE IT! I bought this product after reading all of the others reviews and thought I would try it. This works better for me than Proactiv ever did!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had used this product several years ago.  I thought it was too expensive for my budget.  She had great results for herself as well as for her son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this on Amazon and always wanted to try it.  I am so happy I did.  It makes my face feel clean but not dried out.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and find it very good for my face</li>
            <li> I use this product to clean my face, decollitage and even gets my eye makeup off at night - so gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. It has something like a soft bubblegum scent that is very refreshing and It really deep cleans and leaves your face nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite cleanser and I have not found anything even similar to this.</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin,and obagi is so gentle to my skin. I use it twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dried out. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi Nu Derm Products for probably 7,8 years or so and will always...it&#x27;s the BEST there is in my opinion for my skin care needs.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am using retin A so this is about the only cleanser I can use without drying out&lt;br /&gt;my face.  I have purchased before and really like it.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years and tired of paying the high prices from my doctor.  It is of great quality and the expiration is more than satisfactory.  Very pleased with the seller and I&#x27;ll buy from them again.</li>
            <li> everyday cleansing and i love all the kiel products and the obagi line they are very high quality and do what they say they will do</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 10 years. Mild non-lingering scent. Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh without the burn or sting of many over the counter face washes. Now my husband swears by it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this foaming gel for years.  Did the entire Obaji treatment under a doctor&#x27;s supervison about 6 years ago, and it worked very well so I&#x27;ve continued using the foaming gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a while, probably went through 304 bottles. It works really well. Not crazy about the smell but it cleans off my makeup well and leaves my skin soft. Lately I have been looking for paraben-free products, just to try to avoid any harmful side effects. I have been using Purpose Liquid soap which works just as well, without parabens.</li>
            <li> My skin/complexion is SO clear and soft after using this!  It&#x27;s concentrated so a small dime size is enough for my whole face and neck  No more breakouts from allergic reactions.  I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product as it is the best of the best!!!  I have used the entire line of this product and even though I do not use all of the products the way I should, this Foaming Gel Cleanser I use at least 2 times a day depending on my activity level.  Never once have I had a problem with it drying out my face or has it caused a breakout.  People are surprised when I tell them what my age is as they say I look almost 15 years younger....this rarely happened before I started using this. My skin has never looked better!!!!  100 thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li> Obaji has been a well known skin care line for years. I like this cleanser because it foams and leaves your skin free of make up. I use compressed sponges too.</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser that I&#x27;ve used that actually removes all traces of makeup. I still use a toner after cleaning, but it always looks clean after use. So happy this with product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using this for years and my skin feels great and clean, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like others cleansers.</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser to clean my face. It is gentle and smells good. My face feels really clean after i use it. But most importantly it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Been using obagi products for almost 2 years now. I love of obagi, it really works!!! I used to get acne because of my oily skin now my face is smooth  I will definitely recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> Not authentic, used for a year and this one made me break out.. 😟</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product! I have used obagi foaming gel for several years. I purchased this on Dec 17. I have noticed my skin feeling greasy after I wash but assumed it was from my moisturizer. For the past few nights, I have used the obagi and nothing else after washing my face. I noticed a greasy , oily feeling on my forehead and cheeks. I looked at my bottle and compared the ingredients and the labels are not the same. This is totally bogas.  So sad to be doomed because I have purchased many of these product from Amazon and never had a problem till this one 😠</li>
            <li> Obagi skin care line is a life saver.  I have used it for over a year, and have really noticed a change for the better.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have been using it for about 6 months now.  I used to have breakouts often but I have not had a single breakout since I started using this product.  It makes your face feel so clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product arrive on time in perfect shape.  I was exactly as it was advertised and Obaji is a great product.</li>
            <li> Obagi Nu-Derm Foaming Gel is the best facial cleanser I have ever used. It is especially great for oily (even acne prone) skin. It lathers great, smells great, and feels great! It takes off your makeup without drying out your skin or leaving any film on your face. The only drawback is that it is a little pricy. I tend to use too much product at a time because it smells so good (such a clean fresh scent). I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After I had my children, my skin became more sensitive and dry. However, it still broke out!! This is the only cleanser that cleans my face and prevents pimples without drying it out. True love!</li>
            <li> Obagi products are absolutely excellent!  I would not risk washing my face with anything else.  It smells great, feels great, and makes my skin feel very soft and smooth. I have loved them ever since I started using them!</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely and was properly sealed.  The product didn&#x27;t have an expiration date listed which I am used to seeing on their products.  The wash looks and smells okay.  My face has been clean.  :)</li>
            <li> This takes a very small amt to clean your face and makes feel so good</li>
            <li> Part of my regiment family.  Obagi is part of my daily and nightly routine which keeps my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> Great price, but not seeing or feeling results as previous Obagi products bought at my dermatologist office. Most likely will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  If you&#x27;ve tried every brand on the shelf, look no further.  Its a little pricy but a bottle lasts forever if you use small amounts.  My face has never been so clear.  I&#x27;ve even tried Proactive and Obagi is so much better.</li>
            <li> love Obagi, you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> I had always just washed my face with soap and this was recommended to me so I tried it, and could not believe the difference! I use it now morning and night and it removes my makeup just fine and has put moisture back in my face without any breakouts. I never use clearasil anymore. It leaves your skin clean, smooth, and not oily at all. It has a pleasant smell and it only takes a small amount. I am very happy with it. My kids are always running off with it so I had to order more.</li>
            <li> This is not my first purchase, I am using this products for 4 months and my skin improve a lot!</li>
            <li> LOVE! By far my favorite cleanser - you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. Leaves face feeling fresh, clean and rejuvinated. Best thing I&#x27;ve done for my skin is retire ProActive and try Obaji products.</li>
            <li> Fast!  Love this product.  This was the first time ordering from this company.  I was very pleased and will use them again!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 10 yrs. When I stop using it I lose my glow. I hate the chemicals in it but whenever I stray to Image skincare for example my complexion changes for the worst. So I go back and forth, I am currently back on the whole Obagi regimine again. Getting the glow back!</li>
            <li> like this stuff it makes my face very clean with no residue. bought online for a great price. highly recommend</li>
            <li> This products LASTS a long time since it only takes a tiny bit to wash your face.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean even after having used cleansing cream to remove make up first.  Use of the gel is generally followed by the toner (with intermittent use of Exfoderm Forte - 2 - 3 x/week).  I love the Obagi regimen - my skin is smoother, pores smaller and flares ups have disappeared!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone sensitive skin and this face wash works great. I&#x27;ve used this for many years and never felt the need to try anything else. It&#x27;s gentle yet very effective. Skin feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using obagi for years, and love what it has done for my skin. I use the foaming gel three times a day. I also use obagi products.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin is combination. It has some dry patches in the winter but parts are oily. This product makes my skin feeling clean balances it out.</li>
            <li> Sulfates!  This product broke me out with cystic acne on my forehead, chin, and nose.  Also, it&#x27;s very drying and I have super oily skin - like wash face at 8am and tiny beads of oil on my nose by 9am.  So disappointed by the product.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser.  Gentle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> A staple in my beauty supplies!</li>
            <li> have used this for years.  good clean and doesn&#x27;t require a lot, so lasts about 9 months.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product!  I always receive complements on my skin and it&#x27;s tone.  I used to have dark spots on my face from pimples, and they are now gone as a result of using Obagi Nu-Derm.  Therefore, I will always use their product.  I&#x27;m very happy with them!</li>
            <li> This is a very very good cleanser. It also makes the skin look brighter and more refreshed. It lightens the skin a bit in a good way. Not a obvious way. This a must have like the other Obagi products. This with Obagi blender can give you GREAT skin.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Obagi, you really must give it a try.  Best products out there.  Doesn&#x27;t even bother sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is a really good cleanser and keeps my skin looking fresh and young.  I love it, my dermatologist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Best place to get Obagi products</li>
            <li> Have used this on and off for the past seven years.....really like it! Great cleanser for oily to combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the gel for a few days but I can already tell a big difference! I use the gel and by seem toner with my retin a and vitamin c serum.. Just in a couple days my skin is more hydrated and I can see everything evening out! It awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product and always use</li>
            <li> Since I started using Obagi product I get a lot of compliments about the skin  on my face. People actually say that my skin looks like porcelain.</li>
            <li> I have just got it, I have been used this product for 10 years, it works on me, if this is real obagi (since I have not try it on yet), I would highly recommend this for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser ever.  Have been using it for years.  Every now and then I try something new. WHY??? I am never as satisfied as I am with this cleanser and come back to it every time.  You&#x27;d think I would have learned by now.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and was very securely  packaged.  This face-wash is great, as one little bottle lasts for ages. Two drips ( honest ) removes a whole face-full of make-up.  One drop to remove mascara, and then another drop to wash the rest of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased overall with this product. Foams well so you don&#x27;t need a lot, making it last longer. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, it&#x27;s a big size</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because I wanted something to control oil face and didn&#x27;t see any change.&lt;br /&gt;I mind that it is very expensive for any benefit.</li>
            <li> I love this product cannot use anything else on my skin</li>
            <li> Obagi face wash is amazing! It&#x27;s so gentle on my face and it cleanses with harsh chemicals. I use it twice a day and my face stays fresh, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!!  Just a wee dab and it foams up beautifully.  Skin feels very nice, too.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my face so good and you only use a small amount. This is my four bottle. I been using it for about two years..</li>
            <li> Obagi is a great product.  I have noticed a remarkable notice in my skin since I purchased the entire kit, steps 1-5.</li>
            <li> Not even worth a one star.I received blue  water I mean literally WATER. No foam or gel in the bottle. Disappointed so much. This is not a real product.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of cleansers but I truly feel this one is the best!  It really deep cleans my face but at the same time my face never feels dry or stripped.  I have oily skin (no acne) and I was really amazed at how great this product worked for me.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially to those with oily skin like myself!!!</li>
            <li> Takes off all of my make-up with ease.  Very gentle, but effective.  Definitely a lot cheaper than buying it from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it cleans my skin and makes it feel so fresh! It doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or dryness. It has a good balance to the formula and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the Obagi Products in general. But this cleanser --it the best. Never drys, no residue. Perfect cleanser, now lets talk about the other products! There great</li>
            <li> First of let me say I love obagi products. The minute my skin experienced the products my skin changed for the better. Simply put the cleanser does just that... It cleanses. My skin never feels stripped or tight... Its soothing yet potent enough to clean off my makeup and excess dirt. I use this twice in one wash. Once to remove makeup and another to wash face.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Obagi skincare products. But to be very honest, as far as any &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; goes, I think I had better results with the Obagi C then the Nu-Derm. The scent is exactly the same as the C line. Very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cleanser I have had for my oil face. I feel so fresh after washing with it. And love the price I found on amazon for it !</li>
            <li> I have use this cleanser for years.  It is the only product that clease my skin without breaking it out or drying it out. Any of the Obagi products are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have used Obagi line for years and love it.  Cleanser is the best ever.  Highly concentrated so you use a tiny bit ... lasts a long time, deep cleans without being harsh.</li>
            <li> Always love obagi products. Great step in keeping my face cleansed and breakout free for the most part. thanks i love it</li>
            <li> i was worried that this product could be damage.. but it is perfect exactly how u find if in obagi clinics</li>
            <li> Fast turn around.  Part was as advertised.</li>
            <li> This item was misrepresented as gentle cleanser. My wife always keeps a back up supply of facial products so as not to run out but finally opened this product last night. She noticed the different color but tried it anyway. She has delicate skin and her face turned beat red after using it! Pissed that this came up in her search for the Obagi gentle cleanser instead of a note saying it was unavailable!</li>
            <li> I orginally started using Obagi Clenziderm system for my moderate adult acne.  It is a great system.  After my acne got under control I researched ways to treat my acne scars and hyperpigmentation and that lead me to Obagi Nu Derm system.  I am more than pleased with the Nu Derm.  After trial and error, I realized that the system does work best when you use ALL of the Nu Derm products together.  They truly compliment each other and yield maximum results.  Now my face is clearer and glowing.  I am so shocked how quickly I have seen real results from this system.  The entire Nu Derm system is a bit pricey but it is more than worth it.  A little of all the products goes a very long way.  I highly recommend ordering each item off Amazon.  I have had no problems with expiration dates or anything that one person mentioned.  All the products are brand new and the price is far less than what they charge at the spas.  If you are thinking about trying Obagi, I recommend you visit their website and decide which line is best for you.</li>
            <li> I use it with the circular brush and it makes my skin feel so clean. I use it with the toner and really notice a difference in the way my skin feels using this product vs. other products.</li>
            <li> I received the product on promised time. This is the first time I ordered a cosmetic product online, and always concerned about the fake product. I have used this foaming gel for years and am very happy that this online product is genuine with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I use the obagi system for years now.  This cleanser is the product of choice for me and works great</li>
            <li> this product is thick and goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi for years and it sure maintained my skin young looking.  I will not change using this.</li>
