            <li>A great product that keeps us guys looking good.</li>
            <li>Fifth, the design fits my hand perfectly and it is quite easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>He says it is easy to use -- just start on the longest setting and gradually move shorter until you find the length you like best, then keep it on that setting.  </li>

            <li>, in my opinion, one of the best deals available (wouldn&#x27;t have bought if I thought otherwise).  </li>
            <li>When I searched for a \\&quot;good beard trimmer\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model is light weight, very attractive, and works like a beauty.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to use, gives an even finish and does not pull your stubs!!</li>
            <li>If this lasts longer, I&#x27;ll be very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this product because he does!</li>
            <li>I often go on vacation for a week or more and do not bring the charger!</li>
            <li>It does a really nice job on his beard</li>
            <li>I also just replaced my Norelco shaver with a Remington that cost 1/3 as much and have been way more impressed.  </li>
            <li>Very impressive product so far!</li>
            <li>I must say though that this Remington Titanium MB 300 is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>No we don&#x27;t, and I am glad I took my own advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very nice beard trimmer that is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve trimmed with this a couple times and it hasn&#x27;t pinched my face yet and cuts very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean too!</li>
            <li>I love this way more than any Norelco I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad Remington has made for a better replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a number of features of this MB 300 that are particularly appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>Forth, I love the mini pop up trimmer.  </li>
            <li>For me, the more working parts a razor has, the more there is to breakdown.  </li>
            <li>Also, it should be noted that it is best to store this razor in a place where it is not constantly being surrounded by steam.  </li>
            <li>This razor has been able to handle each and every one of my moods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I simply have not been that impressed.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco I had seemed to provide a much more even shave PLUS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month and have observed that the battery charge appears to survive for many sessions before needing to be plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most convenient beard trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Remington because the last two Norelco trimmers I bought (also excellent out of the box) died after 12-14 months.  </li>
            <li>The best price I found was at my local Target for 24.99.    </li>
            <li>Also if somehow this unit could have a foil trimmer to get really close for when I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t want to break out the hand razor that would be great.</li>
            <li>If I had my perfect electric trimmer/shaver it would have a pop up or integrated detail trimmer (Reminton Only),</li>
            <li>lastly, the charge is excellent.</li>
            <li>Have always kept it well groomed and have gone Thur many trimmers.</li>
            <li>glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>So many units don&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li>This does all the functions and does them better.</li>
            <li>After reading through many many reviews, I came to two conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(my beard is now much more controlled than the picture..</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t get any easier and the product couldn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>my beard is clean and tidy now, after using it.</li>
            <li>I am able to shape my mustache and goatee&#x27; as well as cut them to the length I like easily.</li>
            <li>I save a fortune by skipping the barber now and love all the fantastic design features this</li>
            <li>It does not take much to take a goodly chunk out of your beard in a flash.  </li>
            <li>Seventh, the on and off switch is of the sliding kind and can be controlled with the index finger (I am right handed).  </li>
            <li>It even came with a full charged battery!</li>
            <li>and he says it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>They work well, are streamlined, lightweight, and easy to use, and they do what they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, sleek and easy to hold, cuts like a dream, easy to adjust, etc etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer 2x-week for six months without plugging in the charger and it&#x27;s going as strong as ever.</li>
            <li>Out of the box, this seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Like the MB-40, it works fine and clean up is easy.    </li>
            <li>Its comfortable, a great size/shape, its simple and</li>
            <li>razor is quite easy to clean and it looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am big on product design and this is a shining example of great work.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and comfortable to hold while trimming.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Also it has a foil shaver to get very close which might make a nice razor replacement in a pinch (no pun intended).</li>
            <li>However, neither of the features on these models is as important to me as the pop up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple design that works great.</li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>i enjoy this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am sure that in the right hands hair could be trimmed also.</li>
            <li>Thirdly, when the battery is charged it stays charged for a remarkable length of time.  </li>
            <li>Love everything about this trimmer (my first) from the price to the trim.  </li>
            <li>There is no need to run water to clean it, because it will harm it.</li>
            <li>All you have to do to clean is brush it, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>After three light uses it is still going strong on its first charge.    </li>
            <li>I am a true Remington fan now.  </li>
            <li>If I could take it in the shower that would be sweet.  </li>
            <li>I liked it a lot, had a quiet motor but strong.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a beard for very long, but I am pretty happy with my decision to purchase this Remington Brand Trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love the size variable wheel, love the little pop-up detail edging clipper, love the colors and design.</li>
            <li>Since that isn&#x27;t happening anytime soon, for me, this model is the best overall single trimmer I have found...</li>
            <li>Good power, easy controls and good cutting features.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little gadget.</li>
            <li>This shaver is worth 3 times the price.</li>
            <li>The battery is powerful.  </li>
            <li>It is too much fun not too.</li>
            <li>Beard comb (as useful as the trimmer)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything is built right into it.</li>
            <li>Remington got it right.</li>
            <li>I have had a large, full mustache for 45 years.</li>
            <li>Conclusion: MB-45 &amp; MB-300 are very good trimmers for an all in one solution especially if a small convenient detail trimmer is important to you.  </li>
            <li>Worked great out of the box, but have only used it a handful of times and now the battery won&#x27;t last (fully charged) through one trim session!  </li>
            <li>When I first got the razor, I immediately started using it without reading the instructions.  </li>
            <li>this product is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>(but I remember this one being a lot quieter and smoother when I first bought it...</li>
            <li>This was my first beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>While I like the Norelcos a little better this is a great product and less exspensive</li>
            <li>On the positive side:    a)</li>
            <li>when I open the head to clean out accumulated hair, it falls off completely, and it&#x27;s not that easy to reinstall.  </li>
            <li>It gives a clean professional looking trim and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace an older one that left too many stray hairs.</li>
            <li>as you can see I am completely sold, and after really fretting myself about if I bought the RIGHT razor to trim and really have a nice looking beard like I see on so many other men, I finally got it.</li>
            <li>I am completely sold, and after really fretting myself about if I bought the RIGHT razor to trim and really have a nice looking beard like I see on so many other men, I finally got it.</li>
            <li>The wahl trimmer worked well, cut closer than this trimmer without the plastic head, but it uses multiple replaceable plastic pieces that are a pain to change, and easily get lost.  </li>
            <li>They where all easy to break, especially when traveling.</li>
            <li>The MB-300 charger is much smaller, and that&#x27;s a good thing for space in the bathroom outlet, and for traveling (if going on long trips where you may need the charger).    </li>
            <li>Sure, this one is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Well I have the item all ready to return tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>so this is a real plus for me).  </li>
            <li>and I can say that it is a very well designed product.</li>
            <li>The fact that it has an adjustable head is a real plus ...</li>
            <li>Much smoother and quieter than this one</li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it if you enjoy rocking the facial hair.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>It holds it charge very well.</li>
            <li>(so what was the point?), and the adjustable hair guard didn&#x27;t lock into place very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>and it does it very well.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington MB-40 for a few years and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I actually like it better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>That is a LOT of hair left in the sink to clean up....    </li>
            <li>This small detail trimmer is great for touch-ups, especially the moustache and edges.</li>
            <li>and as I said in the beginning, it is far, far superior to the many others (some where quite expensive)</li>
            <li>A nice dry drawer works wonders and will lengthen the life of any appliance such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both the MB-45 &amp; the MB-300 have the same flimsy hinge mechanism for popping the main trimmer blade up to clean out the inside of hairs, on my MB-45</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to buy another one, but be careful about subjecting it to too much abuse.</li>
            <li>I despise razors with buttons or switches and this one avoids that particular dislike of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Based on the overall design, size, and placement of the light and controls, I suspect the working parts of this unit are identical to my old one.  </li>
            <li>They put a decent battery in this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some have vacuum features, which I don&#x27;t really think is useful</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer because of its high reviews.  </li>
            <li>So, I highly recommend this unit.  </li>
            <li>That I needed an industrial strength, high powered beard trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, when using the flip out feature for fine work; be quite careful when doing your mustache.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far, works very well.</li>
            <li>I have used mine several times now and think the trimmer works well and works as advertised (which is important to me) and is superior to another trimmer I did have that was about twice as expensive.    </li>
            <li>First, it actually cuts my beard and cuts it gently and evenly.</li>
            <li>- I was looking for double duty success.  </li>
            <li>First, this thing cuts fast so if you have a long beard and want to trim it just a bit, use a high setting.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves his new trimmer.</li>
            <li>It works well in all respects and holds a charge quite a bit longer than the Panasonic did, even when new.</li>
            <li>The Remington feels solid in your hands, is smooth running and relatively quiet.  </li>
            <li>The item seemed very solid except for the plasic adjuster on top as mentioned in previous reviews and mine was busted from the start.  </li>
            <li>This was key as I like to keep it at a certain level height.</li>
            <li>And that the Vacuum gimick used on some of the other models are not worth it, and sometimes can seem to replace good construction of the said</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>The Remington MB-300 was the closest thing I could find to my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>charger on this model is quite small and easy to pack and carry.  </li>
            <li>, I wear my beard either very full (like as down to my chest line, until my wife tells me that enough is enough)</li>
            <li>The built-in flip out trimmer will take the hair off right down to the skin.</li>
            <li>The new Philips Norelco T980 has a feature that was very tempting; the vacuum, to suck up all those loose hairs.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t come with 3000 little pieces like every other kit.</li>
            <li>Even comes with a little beard comb and brush to clean out the actual metallic buzzer.</li>
            <li>A good moustache trimmer has a SMALL blade for delicate work.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just finished reading reviews of the new products and ended up with the Remington Titanium MB-300, which by the way, is essentially the same as this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I will be more careful with the newer MB-300, but I suspect it will have the same problem due to this minor design flaw.</li>
            <li>From what I read in the other reviews the battery life is stellar, but the charger is compact enough that I wouldn&#x27;t mind using it plugged into the wall either.</li>
            <li>The other downside to both of the Philips Norelco units is that it they are 2x as much at 50.00 (each).    </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the handle is not as ergonomic and comfortable as the Panasonic -- takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>The real test will come down the road.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the adjustable length settings actually stay locked into place; no slipping and sliding here!  </li>
            <li>Again, this razor is sharp and it does take a rather steady hand.  </li>
            <li>For body grooming I am considering trying the Philips Norelco BG2030, since it is waterproof, and reportedly is very good at not pinching and cutting delicate areas.</li>

            <li> A very nice beard trimmer that is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trimmed with this a couple times and it hasn&#x27;t pinched my face yet and cuts very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> I love this way more than any Norelco I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad Remington has made for a better replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a number of features of this MB 300 that are particularly appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> Forth, I love the mini pop up trimmer.  </li>
            <li> For me, the more working parts a razor has, the more there is to breakdown.  </li>
            <li> Also, it should be noted that it is best to store this razor in a place where it is not constantly being surrounded by steam.  </li>
            <li> This razor has been able to handle each and every one of my moods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I simply have not been that impressed.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco I had seemed to provide a much more even shave PLUS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month and have observed that the battery charge appears to survive for many sessions before needing to be plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most convenient beard trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Remington because the last two Norelco trimmers I bought (also excellent out of the box) died after 12-14 months.  </li>
            <li> The best price I found was at my local Target for 24.99.    </li>
            <li> Also if somehow this unit could have a foil trimmer to get really close for when I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t want to break out the hand razor that would be great.</li>
            <li> If I had my perfect electric trimmer/shaver it would have a pop up or integrated detail trimmer (Reminton Only),</li>
            <li> lastly, the charge is excellent.</li>
            <li> Have always kept it well groomed and have gone Thur many trimmers.</li>
            <li> glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So many units don&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> This does all the functions and does them better.</li>
            <li> After reading through many many reviews, I came to two conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (my beard is now much more controlled than the picture..</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t get any easier and the product couldn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> my beard is clean and tidy now, after using it.</li>
            <li> I am able to shape my mustache and goatee&#x27; as well as cut them to the length I like easily.</li>
            <li> I save a fortune by skipping the barber now and love all the fantastic design features this</li>
            <li> It does not take much to take a goodly chunk out of your beard in a flash.  </li>
            <li> Seventh, the on and off switch is of the sliding kind and can be controlled with the index finger (I am right handed).  </li>
            <li> It even came with a full charged battery!</li>
            <li> and he says it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> They work well, are streamlined, lightweight, and easy to use, and they do what they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, sleek and easy to hold, cuts like a dream, easy to adjust, etc etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer 2x-week for six months without plugging in the charger and it&#x27;s going as strong as ever.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, this seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Like the MB-40, it works fine and clean up is easy.    </li>
            <li> Its comfortable, a great size/shape, its simple and</li>
            <li> razor is quite easy to clean and it looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am big on product design and this is a shining example of great work.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and comfortable to hold while trimming.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Also it has a foil shaver to get very close which might make a nice razor replacement in a pinch (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> However, neither of the features on these models is as important to me as the pop up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple design that works great.</li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> i enjoy this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am sure that in the right hands hair could be trimmed also.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, when the battery is charged it stays charged for a remarkable length of time.  </li>
            <li> Love everything about this trimmer (my first) from the price to the trim.  </li>
            <li> There is no need to run water to clean it, because it will harm it.</li>
            <li> All you have to do to clean is brush it, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> After three light uses it is still going strong on its first charge.    </li>
            <li> I am a true Remington fan now.  </li>
            <li> If I could take it in the shower that would be sweet.  </li>
            <li> I liked it a lot, had a quiet motor but strong.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a beard for very long, but I am pretty happy with my decision to purchase this Remington Brand Trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love the size variable wheel, love the little pop-up detail edging clipper, love the colors and design.</li>
            <li> Since that isn&#x27;t happening anytime soon, for me, this model is the best overall single trimmer I have found...</li>
            <li> Good power, easy controls and good cutting features.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget.</li>
            <li> This shaver is worth 3 times the price.</li>
            <li> The battery is powerful.  </li>
            <li> It is too much fun not too.</li>
            <li> Beard comb (as useful as the trimmer)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything is built right into it.</li>
            <li> Remington got it right.</li>
            <li> I have had a large, full mustache for 45 years.</li>
            <li> Conclusion: MB-45 &amp; MB-300 are very good trimmers for an all in one solution especially if a small convenient detail trimmer is important to you.  </li>
            <li> Worked great out of the box, but have only used it a handful of times and now the battery won&#x27;t last (fully charged) through one trim session!  </li>
            <li> When I first got the razor, I immediately started using it without reading the instructions.  </li>
            <li> this product is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> (but I remember this one being a lot quieter and smoother when I first bought it...</li>
            <li> This was my first beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> While I like the Norelcos a little better this is a great product and less exspensive</li>
            <li> On the positive side:    a)</li>
            <li> when I open the head to clean out accumulated hair, it falls off completely, and it&#x27;s not that easy to reinstall.  </li>
            <li> It gives a clean professional looking trim and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an older one that left too many stray hairs.</li>
            <li> as you can see I am completely sold, and after really fretting myself about if I bought the RIGHT razor to trim and really have a nice looking beard like I see on so many other men, I finally got it.</li>
            <li> I am completely sold, and after really fretting myself about if I bought the RIGHT razor to trim and really have a nice looking beard like I see on so many other men, I finally got it.</li>
            <li> The wahl trimmer worked well, cut closer than this trimmer without the plastic head, but it uses multiple replaceable plastic pieces that are a pain to change, and easily get lost.  </li>
            <li> They where all easy to break, especially when traveling.</li>
            <li> The MB-300 charger is much smaller, and that&#x27;s a good thing for space in the bathroom outlet, and for traveling (if going on long trips where you may need the charger).    </li>
            <li> Sure, this one is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well I have the item all ready to return tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> so this is a real plus for me).  </li>
            <li> and I can say that it is a very well designed product.</li>
            <li> The fact that it has an adjustable head is a real plus ...</li>
            <li> Much smoother and quieter than this one</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it if you enjoy rocking the facial hair.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> It holds it charge very well.</li>
            <li> (so what was the point?), and the adjustable hair guard didn&#x27;t lock into place very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and it does it very well.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington MB-40 for a few years and liked it.  </li>
            <li> I actually like it better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> That is a LOT of hair left in the sink to clean up....    </li>
            <li> This small detail trimmer is great for touch-ups, especially the moustache and edges.</li>
            <li> and as I said in the beginning, it is far, far superior to the many others (some where quite expensive)</li>
            <li> A nice dry drawer works wonders and will lengthen the life of any appliance such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both the MB-45 &amp; the MB-300 have the same flimsy hinge mechanism for popping the main trimmer blade up to clean out the inside of hairs, on my MB-45</li>
            <li> I liked it enough to buy another one, but be careful about subjecting it to too much abuse.</li>
            <li> I despise razors with buttons or switches and this one avoids that particular dislike of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on the overall design, size, and placement of the light and controls, I suspect the working parts of this unit are identical to my old one.  </li>
            <li> They put a decent battery in this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some have vacuum features, which I don&#x27;t really think is useful</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because of its high reviews.  </li>
            <li> So, I highly recommend this unit.  </li>
            <li> That I needed an industrial strength, high powered beard trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, when using the flip out feature for fine work; be quite careful when doing your mustache.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far, works very well.</li>
            <li> I have used mine several times now and think the trimmer works well and works as advertised (which is important to me) and is superior to another trimmer I did have that was about twice as expensive.    </li>
            <li> First, it actually cuts my beard and cuts it gently and evenly.</li>
            <li> - I was looking for double duty success.  </li>
            <li> First, this thing cuts fast so if you have a long beard and want to trim it just a bit, use a high setting.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves his new trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works well in all respects and holds a charge quite a bit longer than the Panasonic did, even when new.</li>
            <li> The Remington feels solid in your hands, is smooth running and relatively quiet.  </li>
            <li> The item seemed very solid except for the plasic adjuster on top as mentioned in previous reviews and mine was busted from the start.  </li>
            <li> This was key as I like to keep it at a certain level height.</li>
            <li> And that the Vacuum gimick used on some of the other models are not worth it, and sometimes can seem to replace good construction of the said</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB-300 was the closest thing I could find to my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> charger on this model is quite small and easy to pack and carry.  </li>
            <li> , I wear my beard either very full (like as down to my chest line, until my wife tells me that enough is enough)</li>
            <li> The built-in flip out trimmer will take the hair off right down to the skin.</li>
            <li> The new Philips Norelco T980 has a feature that was very tempting; the vacuum, to suck up all those loose hairs.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t come with 3000 little pieces like every other kit.</li>
            <li> Even comes with a little beard comb and brush to clean out the actual metallic buzzer.</li>
            <li> A good moustache trimmer has a SMALL blade for delicate work.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished reading reviews of the new products and ended up with the Remington Titanium MB-300, which by the way, is essentially the same as this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I will be more careful with the newer MB-300, but I suspect it will have the same problem due to this minor design flaw.</li>
            <li> From what I read in the other reviews the battery life is stellar, but the charger is compact enough that I wouldn&#x27;t mind using it plugged into the wall either.</li>
            <li> The other downside to both of the Philips Norelco units is that it they are 2x as much at 50.00 (each).    </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handle is not as ergonomic and comfortable as the Panasonic -- takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> The real test will come down the road.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the adjustable length settings actually stay locked into place; no slipping and sliding here!  </li>
            <li> Again, this razor is sharp and it does take a rather steady hand.  </li>
            <li> For body grooming I am considering trying the Philips Norelco BG2030, since it is waterproof, and reportedly is very good at not pinching and cutting delicate areas.</li>
            <li> I mean do we really need to believe in order to get a consistant trim we need a $100+ professional model?</li>
            <li> If you can do without the built in detail trimmer, or don&#x27;t mind the extra bulk that the vacuum adds, you may do well checking out the Philips Norelco products.</li>
            <li> And have a built in vacuum without being overly bulky (Philips &amp; Remington offer vacuum models, but both are big and bulky).</li>
            <li> It also needs to be noted that this unit does not have a vacuum.  </li>
            <li> Also it does not have a vacuum.</li>
            <li> As Norelco came out with its models that have turbo speed and vacuum hair catchers I moved on.</li>
            <li> : I had a Philips Norelco before this, and it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long, also it had no detail trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t last as long as this one.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of different settings based on how long your beard already is or how you want it.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time!</li>
            <li> (actually, closer to two years come to think of it as I got it Christmas before last) and have had absolutely no problems</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer that I had high hopes for is way too big for the delicate work of trimming the ends of my moustache.  </li>
            <li> If it takes more than a minute to trim, my hand becomes numb from the vibration.     </li>
            <li> (I am a bit forgetful about such matters</li>
            <li> Since it is getting on in age, getting noisy, and not holding a charge as long, I&#x27;ve decided to replace it with a newer model.</li>
            <li> The length adjustment didn&#x27;t work any more and, when I took it apart, I found a small plastic tab, about 1/2 the size of a grain of rice, had broken off.  </li>
            <li> previously purchased and tried using a vacuum-type shaver (the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer), but it didn&#x27;t vacuum all the hairs</li>
            <li> I do not have to plug the thing in each and every time I use it due to a low battery.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Remington MB-45, and also on it&#x27;s replacement the MB-300, and I will discuss my experiences with several other models including Philips Norelco, and Wahl.    </li>
            <li> One problem: the battery does not seem to hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> Use the plastic head, and pull things tight so there is no loose skin to get caught</li>
            <li> (so I can not attest to how well it works for long beards), and the small detail trimmer is necessary for getting the chin area (soul patch), and around the mustache neatly trimmed, it also cuts shorter/closer than the larger trimmer.  </li>
            <li> In addition these features would make the unit bulkier/heavier/less streamlined, and such is the case with the T980 (I looked at both in person before choosing) and in my opinion it is not worth the trade off.</li>
            <li> of course the single adjustable height plastic head (both philips &amp; remington, but not Wahl), Waterproof (Philips BG2030 only, or different Remington models without the detail trimmer) Ability to run on battery OR charger (Remington, not sure about others)</li>
            <li> no more fiddling to put on a different head to get a different cut.  </li>
            <li> and I have be SO careful to maneuver it.  </li>
            <li> It performs as expected.</li>
            <li> As some other viewers have noted, the plastic cover on the trimmer blades is flimsy and must be handled gently so as not to break it.    </li>
            <li> Sixth, the razor is relatively quiet and there is very little vibration.  </li>
            <li> I personally do the ground work with the razor and the finishing detail work with a small scissors.</li>
            <li> b) Can cut *extremely* close, if you&#x27;re looking for the &#x27;morning-after&#x27; look.    </li>
            <li> I use it to trim my beard and sideburns, and also for other body hair.  </li>
            <li> Other models I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Other than the vibration</li>
            <li> The plastic ridges that move the plastic head up and down are NOT as sturdy, and you can move the plastic head up or down a little depending on the pressure you are using.  </li>
            <li> The Remington MB-300 is simply another disappointment - I don&#x27;t recommend it for the following reasons:    </li>
            <li> I have used in the past.    </li>
            <li> Sad to see it become salvage over such a small part.    </li>
            <li> Also at that time (not sure if this has changed) the plastic head was spring loaded</li>
            <li> #5:&lt;br /&gt;Super small wall charger.</li>
            <li> The Remington website shows this produce out of stock, so I am not sure that means sold out temporarily or no longer in production, which would be a shame, as I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> There are hardly any instructions, because you don&#x27;t need any.</li>
            <li> After a few times being dropped 2-3 feet to the ground, a small plastic piece inside the head broke off, rendering the shaver useless.  </li>
            <li> The models that have vacuums are practically worthless, the vacuum gets in the way of trimming tight places like under your nose.</li>
            <li> Use caution when trimming &#x27;delicate&#x27; body parts!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know about #2, but #1 is false, because I can attest to that.</li>
            <li> but the problem with the Norelco is that it is useless for the moustache</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for approximately 2-3 years and it has been used a lot!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong buying this model.</li>
            <li> and I found that very difficult to use, and it did not yield as uniform results.  </li>
            <li> Something bad happened to Norelco products somewhere along the way</li>
            <li> Also, while trimming none of my insanely outrageous hair got caught, stuck, or tangled in the razors.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I first got the razor, I immediately started using it without reading the instructions.  It worked great, but I was getting some nicks and irritation.  After reading the instructions that stopped happening.  It gives a clean professional looking trim and is reasonably priced.  I definitely recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at my husband&#x27;s request. It does a really nice job on his beard and he says it is easy to use. The pop-out detail blade is an excellent feature. One problem: the battery does not seem to hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> this product is exactly what it says it is. A very nice beard trimmer that is well worth the money. A great product that keeps us guys looking good. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well I have the item all ready to return tomorrow.  Received the product today as a gift, opened and was trying to get the 9 level heights to adjust with the wheel.  It was not moving at all, then when I shook the trimmer I could hear something rattling inside.  The item seemed very solid except for the plasic adjuster on top as mentioned in previous reviews and mine was busted from the start.  This was key as I like to keep it at a certain level height.</li>
            <li> I love this way more than any Norelco I have ever used.  I am a true Remington fan now.  I also just replaced my Norelco shaver with a Remington that cost 1/3 as much and have been way more impressed.  Something bad happened to Norelco products somewhere along the way and I&#x27;m glad Remington has made for a better replacement.</li>
            <li> Having worn a beard for well over twenty years now I must admit to having gone through quite a number of these electric shavers; different models, brands, features, price ranges, etc.  I must say though that this Remington Titanium MB 300 is the best by far.  I have used it for well over one year now (actually, closer to two years come to think of it as I got it Christmas before last) and have had absolutely no problems what so ever.  It does everything I (actually it was my daughter that bought if for me) paid for it to do and does it quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of features of this MB 300 that are particularly appealing to me.  First, it actually cuts my beard and cuts it gently and evenly. There is no dragging, pulling or pinching.  Secondly, the adjustable length settings actually stay locked into place; no slipping and sliding here!  The length settings are done with a very handy switch maneuvered by the thumb and there is a distinctive click with each change of settings.  Thirdly, when the battery is charged it stays charged for a remarkable length of time.  I do not have to plug the thing in each and every time I use it due to a low battery. (I am a bit forgetful about such matters so this is a real plus for me).  Forth, I love the mini pop up trimmer.  This is a great feature and works like a charm.  I have never had any problems with it what so ever.  Fifth, the design fits my hand perfectly and it is quite easy to maneuver.  The hefty feel feels good in the hand.  Sixth, the razor is relatively quiet and there is very little vibration.  Seventh, the on and off switch is of the sliding kind and can be controlled with the index finger (I am right handed).  I despise razors with buttons or switches and this one avoids that particular dislike of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger on this model is quite small and easy to pack and carry.  As one reviewer has so well put it, you need not worry about the thing being turned on when packed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there are a couple of things to note:  First, this thing cuts fast so if you have a long beard and want to trim it just a bit, use a high setting.  It does not take much to take a goodly chunk out of your beard in a flash.  Also, when using the flip out feature for fine work; be quite careful when doing your mustache.  Again, this razor is sharp and it does take a rather steady hand.  I personally do the ground work with the razor and the finishing detail work with a small scissors. This seems to work the best for me.  Also keep in mind that this razor cannot be use in the shower.  This is not problem with me, but I do know some like to shave while in the shower...this will not do with this unit as it was not designed for use in water.  It also needs to be noted that this unit does not have a vacuum.  This was one of the features I looked for when I (she) purchased this razor.  For me, the more working parts a razor has, the more there is to breakdown.  I also do not like the extra bulk and weight involved...I suppose this is a personal preference thing though.  Also, it should be noted that it is best to store this razor in a place where it is not constantly being surrounded by steam.  This will wreck any shaver over time and I suspect that some of the problems some folks have had with this unit was caused by this.  A nice dry drawer works wonders and will lengthen the life of any appliance such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During various times of the year and during various moods I happen to be in at any given time, I wear my beard either very full (like as down to my chest line, until my wife tells me that enough is enough) all the way to as short as the stubble look.  This razor has been able to handle each and every one of my moods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is quite easy to clean and it looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I simply cannot find anything to complain about with this product.  It meets my needs perfectly and as I said in the beginning, it is far, far superior to the many others (some where quite expensive) I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if they could just add a feature that would cut and permanently remove the gray in my beard...no wait...if it did that I would have no beard.....never mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarksve) I have used in the past.    Now, if they could just add a feature that would cut and permanently remove the gray in my beard...no wait...if it did that I would have no beard.....never mind.     Don Blankenship  The Ozarks</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget. Just got it in the mail today and tried it out (I had been stranded for a week without a trimmer until this baby arrived!) and I can say that it is a very well designed product. I am big on product design and this is a shining example of great work. Its comfortable, a great size/shape, its simple and I love that it doesn&#x27;t come with 3000 little pieces like every other kit. Everything is built right into it. It even came with a full charged battery! From what I read in the other reviews the battery life is stellar, but the charger is compact enough that I wouldn&#x27;t mind using it plugged into the wall either. Love the size variable wheel, love the little pop-up detail edging clipper, love the colors and design. Very impressive product so far!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. It is everything I was searching for in a trimmer. I am able to shape my mustache and goatee&#x27; as well as cut them to the length I like easily. This shaver is worth 3 times the price.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I have had difficulty findiing a beard trimmer that worked the way I need it too.  The Remington MB-300 is simply another disappointment - I don&#x27;t recommend it for the following reasons:    1.  Moustache.  The pop-up trimmer that I had high hopes for is way too big for the delicate work of trimming the ends of my moustache.  It rips hunks out at a time and I have be SO careful to maneuver it.  A good moustache trimmer has a SMALL blade for delicate work.      2.  Beard.  I simply have not been that impressed.  The Norelco I had seemed to provide a much more even shave PLUS had the vacumn suction - which now, admittedly, I appreciate.  That is a LOT of hair left in the sink to clean up....    I will continue to work through these.... but the problem with the Norelco is that it is useless for the moustache - I was looking for double duty success.  Still need to try Wahl..., etc.</li>
            <li> Received trimmer in a timely manner from the vendor.  It is lightweight and comfortable to hold while trimming.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month and have observed that the battery charge appears to survive for many sessions before needing to be plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with any additional attachments, but this trimmer is a workhorse and gives me a great trim everytime!</li>
            <li> This is one of the most convenient beard trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.  The fact that it has an adjustable head is a real plus ... no more fiddling to put on a different head to get a different cut.  The Remington feels solid in your hands, is smooth running and relatively quiet.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost two months and would recommend it to anyone looking for this gizmo.    Only one flaw ... when I open the head to clean out accumulated hair, it falls off completely, and it&#x27;s not that easy to reinstall.  The plastic hinge mechanism needs to be reworked by Remington.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB-300 Titanium Bear and Mustache Trimmer is all it claims to be, and my husband LOVES it!  He says it is easy to use -- just start on the longest setting and gradually move shorter until you find the length you like best, then keep it on that setting.  He uses it about once a week, and it keeps his beard looking trimmed up and distinguished looking.  I love this product because he does!</li>
            <li> Out of the box, this seems to work fine.  Good power, easy controls and good cutting features.  The real test will come down the road.  I bought a Remington because the last two Norelco trimmers I bought (also excellent out of the box) died after 12-14 months.  If this lasts longer, I&#x27;ll be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer 2x-week for six months without plugging in the charger and it&#x27;s going as strong as ever. Easy to hold and adjust, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had in the 30+ years I&#x27;ve had a beard.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for manageability.  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.  My husband loves his new trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because of its high reviews.  With a couple of nit picks I rate it a buy:    a) It has a height adjustment along the back and on/off button to the side.  I always end-up hitting the height adjustment button when trying to turn it on/off.    b) As some other viewers have noted, the plastic cover on the trimmer blades is flimsy and must be handled gently so as not to break it.    On the positive side:    a) It gets the job done!    b) Can cut *extremely* close, if you&#x27;re looking for the &#x27;morning-after&#x27; look.    c) The battery is powerful.  After three light uses it is still going strong on its first charge.    A definite recommendation!</li>
            <li> Have had the trimmer for a month or so. No complaints so far, works very well. Sleek design, plenty of trimmer length options.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington MB-40 for a few years and liked it.  However, I dropped it a distance of about 2 feet onto a carpeted floor and it broke.  The length adjustment didn&#x27;t work any more and, when I took it apart, I found a small plastic tab, about 1/2 the size of a grain of rice, had broken off.  Sad to see it become salvage over such a small part.    I searched for a replacement here at Amazon.com.  Some have vacuum features, which I don&#x27;t really think is useful (I trim my beard on the back deck) but I do like the adjustable length feature.  Finally settled on the MB-300.  The MB-40 had ceramic blades and this one has titanium ones.  Otherwise it looks very similar.  Based on the overall design, size, and placement of the light and controls, I suspect the working parts of this unit are identical to my old one.  Like the MB-40, it works fine and clean up is easy.    So, I highly recommend this unit.  Just don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a Panasonic with dying NiCad battery. I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for about 3 months. It works well in all respects and holds a charge quite a bit longer than the Panasonic did, even when new. I use it for beard and hair and it works well for both.     My only complaint is that the handle is not as ergonomic and comfortable as the Panasonic -- takes some getting used to. But I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> An excellent beard and moustache trimmer. Lightweight, easy to use, gives an even finish and does not pull your stubs!! I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Remington MB-45, and also on it&#x27;s replacement the MB-300, and I will discuss my experiences with several other models including Philips Norelco, and Wahl.    I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for approximately 2-3 years and it has been used a lot! I use it to trim my beard and sideburns, and also for other body hair.  Since it is getting on in age, getting noisy, and not holding a charge as long, I&#x27;ve decided to replace it with a newer model. I&#x27;ve just finished reading reviews of the new products and ended up with the Remington Titanium MB-300, which by the way, is essentially the same as this trimmer.  The best price I found was at my local Target for 24.99.    What I like: The pop up trimmer! This is a must for me as I often groom my beard very short (so I can not attest to how well it works for long beards), and the small detail trimmer is necessary for getting the chin area (soul patch), and around the mustache neatly trimmed, it also cuts shorter/closer than the larger trimmer.  The batteries last a long time! I often go on vacation for a week or more and do not bring the charger! You can use the unit with or without the charger (great when you run out of batteries mid-shave. Works well for body grooming as well...just use caution (see below)    What I don&#x27;t like: Not waterproof! If I could take it in the shower that would be sweet.  Now, Remington does make waterproof trimmers and shavers, but they do not have the pop up trimmer.  Also if somehow this unit could have a foil trimmer to get really close for when I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t want to break out the hand razor that would be great. Also it does not have a vacuum. The charger is bulky compared to the newer MB-300. Both the MB-45 &amp; the MB-300 have the same flimsy hinge mechanism for popping the main trimmer blade up to clean out the inside of hairs, on my MB-45 this broke so it would fall off when I removed it, but if I popped it back in, it would stay in place while in use.  I will be more careful with the newer MB-300, but I suspect it will have the same problem due to this minor design flaw. Use caution when trimming &#x27;delicate&#x27; body parts! Do not try to go to the skin, or you will get pinched, and bleed.  Use the plastic head, and pull things tight so there is no loose skin to get caught and you&#x27;ll have good results.      Other models I&#x27;ve used: I had a Philips Norelco before this, and it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long, also it had no detail trimmer.  Also at that time (not sure if this has changed) the plastic head was spring loaded and I found that very difficult to use, and it did not yield as uniform results.  The wahl trimmer worked well, cut closer than this trimmer without the plastic head, but it uses multiple replaceable plastic pieces that are a pain to change, and easily get lost.  It also didn&#x27;t last as long as this one.  The new Philips Norelco T980 has a feature that was very tempting; the vacuum, to suck up all those loose hairs. For body grooming I am considering trying the Philips Norelco BG2030, since it is waterproof, and reportedly is very good at not pinching and cutting delicate areas. Also it has a foil shaver to get very close which might make a nice razor replacement in a pinch (no pun intended). However, neither of the features on these models is as important to me as the pop up detail trimmer (the Philips Norelco T980 has a separate detail trimmer that you must install/remove whenever you use it, which for me is another thing to lose/break/take time to swap).  In addition these features would make the unit bulkier/heavier/less streamlined, and such is the case with the T980 (I looked at both in person before choosing) and in my opinion it is not worth the trade off. The other downside to both of the Philips Norelco units is that it they are 2x as much at 50.00 (each).    The replacement: Norelco MB-300. ALMOST the same.  Looks very similar, except very slightly different contour, different (reversed) color scheme, and the additionof some grooves on the handle for grip.  Much smoother and quieter than this one (but I remember this one being a lot quieter and smoother when I first bought it...hence the replacement) The plastic ridges that move the plastic head up and down are NOT as sturdy, and you can move the plastic head up or down a little depending on the pressure you are using.  We will see if this becomes and issue over time.  The MB-300 charger is much smaller, and that&#x27;s a good thing for space in the bathroom outlet, and for traveling (if going on long trips where you may need the charger).    Conclusion: MB-45 &amp; MB-300 are very good trimmers for an all in one solution especially if a small convenient detail trimmer is important to you.  They work well, are streamlined, lightweight, and easy to use, and they do what they are supposed to.  Time will tell if the MB-300 has the same longevity as it&#x27;s predecessor.  If you can do without the built in detail trimmer, or don&#x27;t mind the extra bulk that the vacuum adds, you may do well checking out the Philips Norelco products. If you want the trimmer that gets the closest to the skin but don&#x27;t mind multiple accessories to swap out, check out the Wahl offerings.  I may pick up the Philips Norelco Bodygroom BG2030 for trimming and shaving in the shower and will write a review on that, if I do.  The downside would be it&#x27;s another thing to keep in the bathroom and/or take with you on trips.  If I had my perfect electric trimmer/shaver it would have a pop up or integrated detail trimmer (Reminton Only), of course the single adjustable height plastic head (both philips &amp; remington, but not Wahl), Waterproof (Philips BG2030 only, or different Remington models without the detail trimmer) Ability to run on battery OR charger (Remington, not sure about others) And have a built in vacuum without being overly bulky (Philips &amp; Remington offer vacuum models, but both are big and bulky). Since that isn&#x27;t happening anytime soon, for me, this model is the best overall single trimmer I have found...so far. Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> Love everything about this trimmer (my first) from the price to the trim.  Worked great out of the box, but have only used it a handful of times and now the battery won&#x27;t last (fully charged) through one trim session!  I can still use it if I have it plugged in, but one of the reasons I bought this one was for its cord-free portability.  I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t buy it cause it&#x27;s really, in my opinion, one of the best deals available (wouldn&#x27;t have bought if I thought otherwise).  Just beware the battery issue!</li>
            <li> After my old Norelco trimmer died, I tried a few newer Norelco trimmers, but none of their newer models compared to my trusty 10 year old trimmer. The models that have vacuums are practically worthless, the vacuum gets in the way of trimming tight places like under your nose. Norelco has also stopped including a pop-up detail trimmer for precision trimming.    The Remington MB-300 was the closest thing I could find to my old trimmer. It&#x27;s a simple design that works great. It has the pop-up trimmer too. Remington got it right. I actually like it better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> First, Ive been using the MB-10 for the past 5 years. That is a testament to the quality of these buzzers. Second, I use this product to shave everywhere- face, arms, chest, etc. It cuts smoothly and effortlessly. The adjustable clip is ideal for any part of the body. lastly, the charge is excellent. Ive had it over 2 weeks now and only charged it once out of the box.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a beard for very long, but I am pretty happy with my decision to purchase this Remington Brand Trimmer. There are a lot of different settings based on how long your beard already is or how you want it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone with a Rip Van Winkle beard but your standard beard is A-OK. Even comes with a little beard comb and brush to clean out the actual metallic buzzer. You won&#x27;t regret it if you enjoy rocking the facial hair.</li>
            <li> i enjoy this trimmer. my beard is clean and tidy now, after using it. thank you.</li>
            <li> I have had a large, full mustache for 45 years. Have always kept it well groomed and have gone Thur many trimmers. All had several different size combs for length that snapped on. They where all easy to break, especially when traveling. This trimmer is great. One removable comb that adjusts on the trimmer for whatever length you want. Slide it off and you can get as close as you want for shaping. The built-in flip out trimmer will take the hair off right down to the skin. I will buy another one when this one gives up. If you have trimming needs you will like this one. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an older one that left too many stray hairs. This works very well. It should, it feels like its running at 10 horsepower. If it takes more than a minute to trim, my hand becomes numb from the vibration.     Other than the vibration this trimmer is great. It holds it charge very well. It performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the MB-300 for about 3 months now.&lt;br /&gt;I previously purchased and tried using a vacuum-type shaver (the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer), but it didn&#x27;t vacuum all the hairs (so what was the point?), and the adjustable hair guard didn&#x27;t lock into place very well (slipped from setting 5 to 1), plus it didn&#x27;t have a built-in pop-up detail trimmer (it had a separate one to install/remove whenever you need to use it - who has time for that?), so I took the plunge and bought the MB-300.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;This model is the best!&lt;br /&gt;You really do get what you pay for. Sure, this one is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. I save a fortune by skipping the barber now and love all the fantastic design features this has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic Design Feature #1:&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;lockable\\&quot; length settings actually lock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic Design Feature #2:&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer! This small detail trimmer is great for touch-ups, especially the moustache and edges. It pops out solidly. It stays in place. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic Design Feature #3:&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch is a slidable switch and not a button - so if you pack it into a suitcase, nothing pushing up against it will accidentally turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;You also won&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while shaving, since it&#x27;s a switch and not a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic Design Feature #4:&lt;br /&gt;The charge actually lasts. So many units don&#x27;t hold a charge. They put a decent battery in this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic Design Feature #5:&lt;br /&gt;Super small wall charger. Great for traveling light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do and it does it very well. You won&#x27;t go wrong buying this model.</li>
            <li> I researched trimmers for about two weeks before I decided on this one. It gives me what I want, Which is the stubble look, On the 1 Setting it gives you about a 3-5 day stubble look where as if you take off the protective plastic trimmer head, you can get about a 1-2 day stubble look. I&#x27;ve trimmed with this a couple times and it hasn&#x27;t pinched my face yet and cuts very smoothly. The battery has held up great and i&#x27;ve yet to recharge it despite having it for about two weeks now I trim about every 2 days. Very easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> I have and have had several trimmers recently to perform different functions for my goatee, etc. This does all the functions and does them better. Trim, stubble, different lengths, etc.</li>
            <li> After a few times being dropped 2-3 feet to the ground, a small plastic piece inside the head broke off, rendering the shaver useless.  I liked it enough to buy another one, but be careful about subjecting it to too much abuse.</li>
            <li> When I searched for a \\&quot;good beard trimmer\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t believe the hundreds of models that popped up, it was mind boggling. I chose this model because of the pop-up trimmer and it works either corded or not. It&#x27;s well made, sleek and easy to hold, cuts like a dream, easy to adjust, etc etc. The cutter rests on the shelf, there is no stand. I have had NO battery issues. I am sure that in the right hands hair could be trimmed also. If you are just looking for something to trim your face with than look no further.....this is it.</li>
            <li> After reading through many many reviews, I came to two conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. That I needed an industrial strength, high powered beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;2. And that the Vacuum gimick used on some of the other models are not worth it, and sometimes can seem to replace good construction of the said product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know about #2, but #1 is false, because I can attest to that. I mean do we really need to believe in order to get a consistant trim we need a $100+ professional model? No we don&#x27;t, and I am glad I took my own advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is light weight, very attractive, and works like a beauty. I have never used a beard trimmer before, and for that matter I have never had or maintained a beard. Well I wanted to give it a try, because if you are a man, you HAVE to try a beard once. It is too much fun not too. Well, I let my beard grow out for 4-5 weeks. It was gangly, gnarly, scratchy, and chaotic. It was like steel wool on my face, literally. My beard actually CUT my face. So as you can see I have the nastiest of beards, you can also see on my profile page (my beard is now much more controlled than the picture..that picture was taken when I was growing it out in order to mold it ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4 things:&lt;br /&gt;1. Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;2. Charge&lt;br /&gt;3. Beard comb (as useful as the trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;4. Brush for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is as simple as you can get. There is no need to run water to clean it, because it will harm it. All you have to do to clean is brush it, that&#x27;s it. There are hardly any instructions, because you don&#x27;t need any. You set one of the nine settings, with one being the shortest trim, and you mold to your liking. It couldn&#x27;t get any easier and the product couldn&#x27;t work any better. I am now the proud owner of a very nice looking trim beard. Also, while trimming none of my insanely outrageous hair got caught, stuck, or tangled in the razors. Oh yea, did I forget to mention it is rechargeable and can be portable without wires? Yea...it&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as you can see I am completely sold, and after really fretting myself about if I bought the RIGHT razor to trim and really have a nice looking beard like I see on so many other men, I finally got it. I am now a lifetime customer. Thank you Remington.see I am completely sold, and after really fretting myself about if I bought the RIGHT razor to trim and really have a nice looking beard like I see on so many other men, I finally got it. I am now a lifetime customer. Thank you Remington.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome. it&#x27;s rechargeable and comes with 9 different lengths. it works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the trimmers, one for myself and one for a son.    I have used mine several times now and think the trimmer works well and works as advertised (which is important to me) and is superior to another trimmer I did have that was about twice as expensive.    The Remington website shows this produce out of stock, so I am not sure that means sold out temporarily or no longer in production, which would be a shame, as I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was my first beard trimmer. I liked it a lot, had a quiet motor but strong. As Norelco came out with its models that have turbo speed and vacuum hair catchers I moved on. While I like the Norelcos a little better this is a great product and less exspensive</li>
