    <ol>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for under eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for medium coverage.</li>
            <li>but that does NOT stop me fm using it 2 heal &amp; conceal :)!!</li>
            <li>Thank God for whoever made this amazing product!</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a blemish cover that is also part of the solution!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t match my fair skin</li>
            <li>Good concealer for the money you spend.</li>
            <li>(I have an ivory skin tone and bought Fair).</li>
            <li>Just looked clumpy on my skin ...very noticable and the fair color didnt match my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>whenever he breaks out he comes and asks for some of it because it works that good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use on blemishes because it has salicylic</li>
            <li>Nice concealer as a brightener</li>
            <li>This is the best healing blemish concealer I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>product is good if you want a light concealer and already use Neutrogena foundation.</li>
            <li>It has so many pore clogging ingredients and parabens.</li>
            <li>No coincidence my face looked better upon discontinued use.</li>
            <li>I have normal/combo skin mostly</li>
            <li>I felt better using it over blemishes since it didn&#x27;t seem to be too pore clogging.</li>
            <li>It works best when paired with the foundation, and I only have to blot it once toward the end of my day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for years, mostly because I also use a Neutrogena foundation.</li>
            <li>It covers blemishes OKAY - which is fine for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this product on general - great spot coverage</li>
            <li>I bought this in fair and it blends into my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>This product covers and blends easily with no cakyness.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it, as I loved that it promised to fight acne as it concealed the blemishes.</li>
            <li>As for coverage, the color I purchased was way too light</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s not as good on bare skin,</li>
            <li>It covered fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth it.</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for full coverage, this won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>but I have other skincare products for that, so I&#x27;m happy with the item.</li>
            <li>It dries QUICK</li>
            <li>there and they&#x27;re super distracting...</li>
            <li>but I was hoping that since it was neutrogena that it would be worth while.</li>
            <li>other thing you should know is that this is a fairly &amp;#34;light coverage&amp;#34; type of concealer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a better general concealer.</li>
            <li>The concealer I bought before this was an Origins concealer, which you&#x27;d expect to be pretty pricey, right?</li>
            <li>First off, DO NOT BUY THIS FOR $20.</li>
            <li>I have the most acne prone skin of anyone I know, and trust me, after reading every ingredient of every makeup line, this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t worsen it.</li>
            <li>Also, for better coverage and to make it last even longer, use a concealer brush.</li>
            <li>Plus I got two when it really says one!</li>
            <li>I will totally by this again if needed. :)</li>
            <li>when I first used it it didn&#x27;t cover like a concealer</li>
            <li>I also feel a lot better about putting this on my breakouts compared to regular foundation.</li>
            <li>Hides blemishes very well - when you get the right color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for smaller red marks and partially-faded marks.</li>
            <li>This concealer is pretty inexpensive so you can&#x27;t expect too much</li>
            <li>This concealer works pretty well on existing breakouts, however, it does not seem to do much for reducing/clearing blemishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering returning to my origins concealer just because it&#x27;s more economical, which is not something I ever expected to happen!</li>
            <li>:) I have pretty unclear skin and all other concealers plug the pores.</li>
            <li>really well&lt;</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that this helps speed up the healing process of a blemish</li>
            <li>what they&#x27;re thinking trying to sell it for so much on here.</li>
            <li>works very well with the skinclearing liquid foundation</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care for the applicator so much.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li>Works well and quite fast to remove blemishes</li>
            <li>Does not spread as smoothly as I thought it would, and even after spreading it evenly it makes my face seem extremely dry...</li>
            <li>I figured that it would be easiest/best to use two products from the same company because the shades would be more likely to match (I use the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade of concealer and &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; foundation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You twist the bottom and a little bit of concealer comes out on the sponge part at the top.</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone, it helps my zits not be so zitty, and it&#x27;s cheaper here than where I normally buy it.  </li>
            <li>, this definitely blends well with the Neutrogena foundation, to the point of being undetectable, which is pretty much what you&#x27;re going for with a concealer.</li>
            <li>this stuff takes the red out and gets it on the right track towards healing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different concealers, including many expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available in stores for half that price, I have no idea</li>
            <li>However, it was not easy to apply - too much runs out of the applicator too quickly.</li>
            <li>I complained to Amazon and they were honest enough to refund me.</li>
            <li>Could not have a complete makeup kit without this, would highly recommend for skin that occasionally breaks out.</li>
            <li>$10 doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot for a concealer, especially compared to department store brands, but be aware that this tube only contains 0.05 oz of product.</li>
            <li>then this will work just fine, otherwise if you can afford to spend a little extra</li>
            <li>so when you put that sucker on make sure it&#x27;s blended out before you move onto the next spot.</li>
            <li>Not a healing miracle, obviously, the medicine content isn&#x27;t high enough.</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;m not entirely sold on the clear complexion aspect.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason the complete formula (comparatively low proportion of salicylic acid) works for me as compared to neutrogena acne cream</li>
            <li>When you first open the package, you have to twist and twist and twist, and then usually you end up with too much concealer on the sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick and feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li>The sulfur works quite well to dry out the zits and clear them up.</li>

            <li> But if you are having a major breakout or are trying to get rid of dark circles under your eyes, you&#x27;ll probably want a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed no major healing effects with this concealer, so no miracle product</li>
            <li> It conceals acne (not completely though)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so runny and messy that it barely stays on your face.</li>
            <li> Remember, makeup &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; is only half the story, the application tells the rest.</li>
            <li> (so don&#x27;t use this product to cover up dark circles under the eyes because it will dry up the area).</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and you can also use it for other places on your body with acne.</li>
            <li> but makes them MUCH less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena products in general, but this one seemed to make my acne worse.</li>
            <li> well no matter how little I dab on</li>
            <li> and I like that it has a little bit of acne medication in it.</li>
            <li> I do notice my blemishes disappearing a little faster when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is getting harder to find in regular stores, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably 3.5 stars for me, so I&#x27;ll round up.</li>
            <li> You have to continually twist the bottom and very little comes out.</li>
            <li> Not much more you could ask for.</li>
            <li> I usually just dispense the minimum amount, dot it on my face, and blend with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really hate that you have to click within a click of your life until the first dose of this stuff comes out.  </li>
            <li> Maybe there is at least a placebo effect.</li>
            <li> And I unfortunately cannot find a work around with other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s medicated unlike the other concealer brand that&#x27;s just smearing oil and contaminants into my already angry zits.</li>
            <li> but it at least doesn&#x27;t make my spots any worse</li>
            <li> My skin got worse after using it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I didn&#x27;t want to cover up something that was unsightly with something that would make it worse.</li>
            <li> I use this to cover up those annoying red pimples that seem to show up overnight.. and it works.</li>
            <li> Winner winner, chicken dinner.</li>
            <li> Sadly I was very disappointed with Neutrogena&#x27;s Skin Clearing Blemish Concealer.</li>
            <li> and it broke my face out really bad !!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the worst makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made !!!</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best healing blemish concealer I&#x27;ve found so far.  And trust me I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands.  It doesn&#x27;t match my fair skin well no matter how little I dab on but that does NOT stop me fm using it 2 heal &amp; conceal :)!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It has so many pore clogging ingredients and parabens. My skin got worse after using it. No coincidence my face looked better upon discontinued use.</li>
            <li> Again results will be varied based on the skin type.&lt;br /&gt;For me this works really well&lt;br /&gt;1. It conceals acne (not completely though)&lt;br /&gt;2. Reduce redness, swelling in case of breakout&lt;br /&gt;3. For whatever reason the complete formula (comparatively low proportion of salicylic acid) works for me as compared to neutrogena acne cream&lt;br /&gt;4. Hides blemishes very well - when you get the right color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been liking this concealer, I like the idea that it does help the pimple instead of just covering it up. It dries QUICK so when you put that sucker on make sure it&#x27;s blended out before you move onto the next spot. Good concealer for the money you spend.</li>
            <li> This concealer is pretty inexpensive so you can&#x27;t expect too much but I was hoping that since it was neutrogena that it would be worth while. It covers blemishes OKAY - which is fine for the price. My problem with this is that it says \\&quot;skin clearing\\&quot; and it definitely is not that. I have normal/combo skin mostly its just the \\&quot;monthly\\&quot; breakout thing and this definitely doesn&#x27;t irritate the blemishes/zits but it doesn&#x27;t go away any sooner than if I wore nothing at all.     I&#x27;d say if its an emergency and/or you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive then this will work just fine, otherwise if you can afford to spend a little extra I would go with something that actually \\&quot;clears your skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I got this because I didn&#x27;t want to cover up something that was unsightly with something that would make it worse. I have noticed no major healing effects with this concealer, so no miracle product but it at least doesn&#x27;t make my spots any worse and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This concealer works pretty well on existing breakouts, however, it does not seem to do much for reducing/clearing blemishes. I felt better using it over blemishes since it didn&#x27;t seem to be too pore clogging. I&#x27;m still looking for a better general concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different concealers, including many expensive ones.  I bought this in fair and it blends into my skin very well.  I really don&#x27;t think that this helps speed up the healing process of a blemish but I have other skincare products for that, so I&#x27;m happy with the item.</li>
            <li> First off, DO NOT BUY THIS FOR $20. It&#x27;s available in stores for half that price, I have no idea what they&#x27;re thinking trying to sell it for so much on here. I didn&#x27;t purchase this item online, I just saw it here and thought I&#x27;d review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this concealer, it works as well as any I&#x27;ve tried and I like that it has a little bit of acne medication in it. I do notice my blemishes disappearing a little faster when I use it.Overall I think it&#x27;s a recommendable product for acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even for the regular price of around $10, it&#x27;s overpriced. $10 doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot for a concealer, especially compared to department store brands, but be aware that this tube only contains 0.05 oz of product. The concealer I bought before this was an Origins concealer, which you&#x27;d expect to be pretty pricey, right? Well, that concealer was $20 for 0.17 oz- over three times the quantity of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this Neutrogena concealer is actually MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE by quantity than a fancy department store brand that sells $60 moisturizers. Keep that in mind before you purchase it. I&#x27;m considering returning to my origins concealer just because it&#x27;s more economical, which is not something I ever expected to happen!</li>
            <li> This is getting harder to find in regular stores, unfortunately. It&#x27;s a great product. My daughter and I both swear by it for covering acne will it treats it.</li>
            <li> I love this product on general - great spot coverage though I&#x27;m not entirely sold on the clear complexion aspect. Maybe there is at least a placebo effect. I gave two stars however, because the picture shows two tubes and they send only one. Nowhere in the description does it say this and the price is that of two. I complained to Amazon and they were honest enough to refund me. Beware of this seller!!!</li>
            <li> Sadly I was very disappointed with Neutrogena&#x27;s Skin Clearing Blemish Concealer. I had high hopes for it, as I loved that it promised to fight acne as it concealed the blemishes. However, it was not easy to apply - too much runs out of the applicator too quickly. Also, it gets caked in my pores. As for coverage, the color I purchased was way too light (I have an ivory skin tone and bought Fair).</li>
            <li> Nice concealer as a brightener but if you are looking for full coverage, this won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I have the most acne prone skin of anyone I know, and trust me, after reading every ingredient of every makeup line, this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t worsen it. Not a healing miracle, obviously, the medicine content isn&#x27;t high enough. It works best when paired with the foundation, and I only have to blot it once toward the end of my day. Also, for better coverage and to make it last even longer, use a concealer brush. Even designer makeup lines don&#x27;t cut it. Remember, makeup &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; is only half the story, the application tells the rest.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a blemish cover that is also part of the solution! This product covers and blends easily with no cakyness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say about this concealer.  It matches my skin tone, it helps my zits not be so zitty, and it&#x27;s cheaper here than where I normally buy it.  Winner winner, chicken dinner.</li>
            <li> I use this to cover up those annoying red pimples that seem to show up overnight.. and it works. Not 100% (by itself), but makes them MUCH less noticeable. Then again, I am a guy - so I don&#x27;t use makeup. The sulfur works quite well to dry out the zits and clear them up. Plus I got two when it really says one! Not much more you could ask for.</li>
            <li> It works great! Thank God for whoever made this amazing product! I will totally by this again if needed. :)</li>
            <li> when I first used it it didn&#x27;t cover like a concealer should and it broke my face out really bad !! it&#x27;s the worst makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made !!!</li>
            <li> works very well with the skinclearing liquid foundation</li>
            <li> Meh. Does not spread as smoothly as I thought it would, and even after spreading it evenly it makes my face seem extremely dry... And I unfortunately cannot find a work around with other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for years, mostly because I also use a Neutrogena foundation. I figured that it would be easiest/best to use two products from the same company because the shades would be more likely to match (I use the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade of concealer and &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; foundation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, this definitely blends well with the Neutrogena foundation, to the point of being undetectable, which is pretty much what you&#x27;re going for with a concealer. (It&#x27;s not as good on bare skin, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the applicator so much. You twist the bottom and a little bit of concealer comes out on the sponge part at the top. When you first open the package, you have to twist and twist and twist, and then usually you end up with too much concealer on the sponge. I usually just dispense the minimum amount, dot it on my face, and blend with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing you should know is that this is a fairly &amp;#34;light coverage&amp;#34; type of concealer. It&#x27;s good for smaller red marks and partially-faded marks. But if you are having a major breakout or are trying to get rid of dark circles under your eyes, you&#x27;ll probably want a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good if you want a light concealer and already use Neutrogena foundation. It&#x27;s probably 3.5 stars for me, so I&#x27;ll round up.</li>
            <li> Awful! You have to continually twist the bottom and very little comes out. It&#x27;s so runny and messy that it barely stays on your face. It did absolutely nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> Works well and quite fast to remove blemishes :) I have pretty unclear skin and all other concealers plug the pores. This conceals, but also heals underneath (or so it seems)</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena products in general, but this one seemed to make my acne worse. It covered fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Just looked clumpy on my skin ...very noticable and the fair color didnt match my fair skin tone. I dont use it.</li>
            <li> I really hate that you have to click within a click of your life until the first dose of this stuff comes out.  Marketing strategy - it seems fuller until you click through and realize there&#x27;s only about 2/3 the makeup in there.  It works well, however, and I like the application tip.  Great for under eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I get breakouts here and there and they&#x27;re super distracting... this stuff takes the red out and gets it on the right track towards healing. I also feel a lot better about putting this on my breakouts compared to regular foundation. It&#x27;s medicated unlike the other concealer brand that&#x27;s just smearing oil and contaminants into my already angry zits. Even got my boyfriend using it- whenever he breaks out he comes and asks for some of it because it works that good. Oh yeah, and you can also use it for other places on your body with acne. Saves you the agony of having to deal with those pesky heat bumps. Could not have a complete makeup kit without this, would highly recommend for skin that occasionally breaks out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for medium coverage. It&#x27;s not too thick and feels light on my skin. It&#x27;s good to use on blemishes because it has salicylic acid- (so don&#x27;t use this product to cover up dark circles under the eyes because it will dry up the area).</li>
