            <li>I love it !..</li>
            <li>glad I bought five of them!</li>
            <li>This stamper does require priming before use but is amazing once primed.</li>
            <li>Nice stamper.</li>
            <li>Nice shape and size.</li>

            <li>very easily.</li>
            <li>it stamps pretty good!</li>
            <li>Primed with Mr Clean magic eraser they work great.</li>
            <li>The design that I did this morning I got them to work the best so far, the image was still blotchy and the color was faded but for once I could tell what it was.</li>
            <li>They were primed with a magic eraser pad and it picked up the images nicely.</li>
            <li>Good thing it was really cheap</li>
            <li>By far still the best and softest rectangle stamper out there!  </li>
            <li>So soft and squishy and works beautifully after priming!</li>
            <li>this product is great for someone who is interested in nail art-</li>
            <li>Just very lightly roll it on and the design will be picked up.</li>
            <li>It is a very squishy, marshmallow stamper :) Very pleased!</li>
            <li>sure you prime your stamper!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really love this one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better.  </li>
            <li>Just much better,...</li>
            <li>and i just love it</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to break it in more.</li>
            <li>it came before the estimated time Will be ordering more from this supplier.</li>
            <li>I love doing my nails</li>
            <li>so much more</li>
            <li>I even filed the top a bit.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it, it picks up the images beautifuly and the image is transferi to the fingernail with zero problems.  </li>
            <li>but works way better ..would have never bought this if I knew how crappy it was</li>
            <li>the flaws you see are user error, not stamp error... 0:)</li>
            <li>I love my stamper  </li>
            <li>I received the marshmallow sticky version of this stamper and am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love all of the VAGA stampers in every shape.  </li>
            <li>Love stamping with this product.</li>
            <li>Picks up the image nice and clean and it&#x27;s perfect for the bigger images on your plate</li>
            <li>Clean with acetone and stamp away!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best $2.50 spent.</li>
            <li>it wont pick up no paint off the templet and it falls apart so easy</li>
            <li>I had contacted the seller before I figured it out and got a very quick response.</li>
            <li>I am sure once I get it roughed up enough it will be great</li>
            <li>I then gave it a couple of swipes with the Mr. Clean magic eraser and it did the trick.</li>
            <li>It cones out of the holder really easily.</li>
            <li>then the one I was using definitely makes my nails beautiful</li>
            <li>and it  picked up all the designs just fine.</li>
            <li>Super squishy!</li>
            <li>It broke the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made and going in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I love how squishy it is though, fun to play with.</li>
            <li>was cheap</li>
            <li>great  especially on my toes</li>
            <li>Available in 3 sizes ...short, tall and squared.</li>
            <li>but if that is what you are looking for the this product is for you arrived a week early loved it.</li>
            <li>This stamper was recommended to me and when I got it I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Before buying you most know that you may or may not get a squishy sticky stamper or a squishy firm(which is not sticky) I was hopping for a squishy sticky (marshmallow) and that&#x27;s exactly what I got</li>
            <li>It feels like those sticky reusable lint rollers that you have to clean with water.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky and more like a gel than a rubber.</li>
            <li>and I still get full coverage.</li>
            <li>Teenage daughter loved it and uses it every time she would decorate her nails.</li>
            <li>She would always show me her finished product and they actually look good and professionally-done.</li>
            <li>most marsh&#x27;s they are very sticky and attract dust, hair, etc.</li>
            <li>love this Stamper very squishy didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pick up the full design.</li>
            <li>It tears easily upon first time use.</li>
            <li>yes I do have stamping polish that works great with my other stamper..</li>
            <li>As some have said,  super glue it inside...  </li>
            <li>Super sticky didn&#x27;t transfer well</li>
            <li>It was like a really latexy kind of rubber, very shiny not Matt like the rest it didn&#x27;t pick up no designs</li>
            <li>This rubber stamp is SUPER sticky and squishy.</li>
            <li>When it does work it doesn&#x27;t transfer the image cleanly or with the right color.</li>
            <li>I love my new stamper.</li>
            <li>Very squishy made stretching images effortless!!</li>
            <li>Had fun using.</li>
            <li>Package come with delay but defanatly worth the wait..</li>
            <li>Though it was easy to clean off, and the stamp is squishy and soft.</li>
            <li>it kind of smelled like petroleum and the plastic of the actual stamper</li>
            <li>when I first received the stamper it was smaller than I expected but it was the perfect size.</li>
            <li>For the wait you expect it to be right.</li>
            <li>I am very very displeased with this.</li>
            <li>It is a nice large size for those of you with long nails.  </li>
            <li>Works well, large enough - falls out of the holder once in a while, but easy to clean.</li>
            <li>After many different attempts at transferring images I finally was able to use it.</li>
            <li>I know exactly how to use it, but it wouldn&#x27;t pick up any of the stamps.</li>
            <li>Everything stuck to it and the white top fell out when I went to use it.</li>
            <li>it first.</li>
            <li>IDK how it works, really, but she seems to be having so much fun.</li>
            <li>First of all  shipping took FOREVER</li>
            <li>First of all it was drenched in some king of oil</li>
            <li>Upon using it the first time it didn&#x27;t pick up the image from the nail plate.</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t pick up anything, then I cleaned it and it picked up something once....</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love this stamp thing good for small to big nails</li>
            <li>It took some time trying to figure out how to clean it and get the images off the plates, but now that I have it down, I love it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>The perfect feel, shape, weight, but it&#x27;s difficult to clean and constantly separates from the handle.</li>
            <li>The stamper that arrived was very marshmallow-y.</li>
            <li>It keeps falling out and is real sticky.</li>
            <li>it also didn&#x27;t work very well but then after doing some research I learned that I had to prime it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very flimsy...</li>
            <li>I really like this stamper.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Vaga Shop..</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sticky to the point that it collects lint.</li>
            <li>I do not prefer marshmallow stampers since they are overly soft and tend to easily distort the images stamped onto your nails if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making these soft stampers!!  </li>
            <li>I do not use nail polish remover / acetone on it anymore thanks to tips from some of the reviews, but instead use a new sticky sheet from a lint roller.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to center your designs</li>
            <li>I like this particular rectangular stamper.  </li>
            <li>The only problem was that the white gel part had a dent in it and it makes some stamping more tricky.</li>
            <li>it is actually silicon and sticky had to super glue it into the handle</li>
            <li>It makes doing my nails a bit easier, but the rubber side holds small dust and hair very easily and pops out of the plastic on a whim, as though there was never anything holding it in place.</li>
            <li>It is so soft, and everything but the nail polish sticks to it!!</li>
            <li>The only nail stamp worth buying, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>If you like squishy-firm, and don&#x27;t have extra long nails, then this is for you :)</li>
            <li>Most stampers gives me trouble picking up and transferring images, however this  .  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that when I order it I was not to sure about it since I already had a round stamper, if you are new to art nail stamping or not this is a must item to add to your art nail inventory.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that it takes over three weeks to get to the U.S. from China, so do not expect to buy it and receive it right away.</li>
            <li>it does not fall out of the holder I have super long nails</li>
            <li>If and when this wears out, I will immediately order a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at stamping, so</li>
            <li>Super soft, can slightly distort image but also great for making a small image fill a larger surface</li>
            <li>and has a very soft, rubbery feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not firm.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having trouble you need to lightly touch the stamper on the image.</li>
            <li>But this thing fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>Works but the stamp it too soft</li>
            <li>I am still trying to find a nail file that will buff the shininess off so it will pick up the image completely.  </li>
            <li>Arrived  early.</li>
            <li>The nail stamper is silicon rubber and not the sought after soft and sticky marshmallow stamper heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much, much too soft, so not only does it not pick up polish from a stamping plate; it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto the nail, either, even if you paint directly onto the stamper.</li>
            <li>although this was received this item one month early, I can truly say save your money.</li>
            <li>Please, do not buy this and waste your money, because even though it&#x27;s cheap, the shipping took about 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I like it, is to soft.</li>
            <li>I like this better then the smaller, round one.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this tool because the precision of a square vs. round stamper seems like a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>Silicone is way to small to fit inside the stamper</li>
            <li>keep in mind that it&#x27;s the stamp alone and order the other products for full potential!</li>
            <li>it just pops right out, leaving a mess of polish EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>so its kind of squishy or gooey, needless to say it does not pick up polish.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t shop from this vendor again, because on top of the shoddy product, it took a very long time to arrive, was after the projected dates, and the vendor was terse in its reply to my &amp;#34;where&#x27;s my stuff?&amp;#34; inquiry.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the other round stamper didn&#x27;t fit all the way around my nail..</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s the best $2.50 spent.</li>
            <li> it wont pick up no paint off the templet and it falls apart so easy</li>
            <li> I had contacted the seller before I figured it out and got a very quick response.</li>
            <li> I am sure once I get it roughed up enough it will be great</li>
            <li> I then gave it a couple of swipes with the Mr. Clean magic eraser and it did the trick.</li>
            <li> It cones out of the holder really easily.</li>
            <li> then the one I was using definitely makes my nails beautiful</li>
            <li> and it  picked up all the designs just fine.</li>
            <li> Super squishy!</li>
            <li> It broke the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made and going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I love how squishy it is though, fun to play with.</li>
            <li> was cheap</li>
            <li> great  especially on my toes</li>
            <li> Available in 3 sizes ...short, tall and squared.</li>
            <li> but if that is what you are looking for the this product is for you arrived a week early loved it.</li>
            <li> This stamper was recommended to me and when I got it I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Before buying you most know that you may or may not get a squishy sticky stamper or a squishy firm(which is not sticky) I was hopping for a squishy sticky (marshmallow) and that&#x27;s exactly what I got</li>
            <li> It feels like those sticky reusable lint rollers that you have to clean with water.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky and more like a gel than a rubber.</li>
            <li> and I still get full coverage.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter loved it and uses it every time she would decorate her nails.</li>
            <li> She would always show me her finished product and they actually look good and professionally-done.</li>
            <li> most marsh&#x27;s they are very sticky and attract dust, hair, etc.</li>
            <li> love this Stamper very squishy didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up the full design.</li>
            <li> It tears easily upon first time use.</li>
            <li> yes I do have stamping polish that works great with my other stamper..</li>
            <li> As some have said,  super glue it inside...  </li>
            <li> Super sticky didn&#x27;t transfer well</li>
            <li> It was like a really latexy kind of rubber, very shiny not Matt like the rest it didn&#x27;t pick up no designs</li>
            <li> This rubber stamp is SUPER sticky and squishy.</li>
            <li> When it does work it doesn&#x27;t transfer the image cleanly or with the right color.</li>
            <li> I love my new stamper.</li>
            <li> Very squishy made stretching images effortless!!</li>
            <li> Had fun using.</li>
            <li> Package come with delay but defanatly worth the wait..</li>
            <li> Though it was easy to clean off, and the stamp is squishy and soft.</li>
            <li> it kind of smelled like petroleum and the plastic of the actual stamper</li>
            <li> when I first received the stamper it was smaller than I expected but it was the perfect size.</li>
            <li> For the wait you expect it to be right.</li>
            <li> I am very very displeased with this.</li>
            <li> It is a nice large size for those of you with long nails.  </li>
            <li> Works well, large enough - falls out of the holder once in a while, but easy to clean.</li>
            <li> After many different attempts at transferring images I finally was able to use it.</li>
            <li> I know exactly how to use it, but it wouldn&#x27;t pick up any of the stamps.</li>
            <li> Everything stuck to it and the white top fell out when I went to use it.</li>
            <li> it first.</li>
            <li> IDK how it works, really, but she seems to be having so much fun.</li>
            <li> First of all  shipping took FOREVER</li>
            <li> First of all it was drenched in some king of oil</li>
            <li> Upon using it the first time it didn&#x27;t pick up the image from the nail plate.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t pick up anything, then I cleaned it and it picked up something once....</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love this stamp thing good for small to big nails</li>
            <li> It took some time trying to figure out how to clean it and get the images off the plates, but now that I have it down, I love it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The perfect feel, shape, weight, but it&#x27;s difficult to clean and constantly separates from the handle.</li>
            <li> The stamper that arrived was very marshmallow-y.</li>
            <li> It keeps falling out and is real sticky.</li>
            <li> it also didn&#x27;t work very well but then after doing some research I learned that I had to prime it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very flimsy...</li>
            <li> I really like this stamper.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Vaga Shop..</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sticky to the point that it collects lint.</li>
            <li> I do not prefer marshmallow stampers since they are overly soft and tend to easily distort the images stamped onto your nails if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making these soft stampers!!  </li>
            <li> I do not use nail polish remover / acetone on it anymore thanks to tips from some of the reviews, but instead use a new sticky sheet from a lint roller.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to center your designs</li>
            <li> I like this particular rectangular stamper.  </li>
            <li> The only problem was that the white gel part had a dent in it and it makes some stamping more tricky.</li>
            <li> it is actually silicon and sticky had to super glue it into the handle</li>
            <li> It makes doing my nails a bit easier, but the rubber side holds small dust and hair very easily and pops out of the plastic on a whim, as though there was never anything holding it in place.</li>
            <li> It is so soft, and everything but the nail polish sticks to it!!</li>
            <li> The only nail stamp worth buying, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you like squishy-firm, and don&#x27;t have extra long nails, then this is for you :)</li>
            <li> Most stampers gives me trouble picking up and transferring images, however this  .  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that when I order it I was not to sure about it since I already had a round stamper, if you are new to art nail stamping or not this is a must item to add to your art nail inventory.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it takes over three weeks to get to the U.S. from China, so do not expect to buy it and receive it right away.</li>
            <li> it does not fall out of the holder I have super long nails</li>
            <li> If and when this wears out, I will immediately order a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at stamping, so</li>
            <li> Super soft, can slightly distort image but also great for making a small image fill a larger surface</li>
            <li> and has a very soft, rubbery feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not firm.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble you need to lightly touch the stamper on the image.</li>
            <li> But this thing fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> Works but the stamp it too soft</li>
            <li> I am still trying to find a nail file that will buff the shininess off so it will pick up the image completely.  </li>
            <li> Arrived  early.</li>
            <li> The nail stamper is silicon rubber and not the sought after soft and sticky marshmallow stamper heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much, much too soft, so not only does it not pick up polish from a stamping plate; it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto the nail, either, even if you paint directly onto the stamper.</li>
            <li> although this was received this item one month early, I can truly say save your money.</li>
            <li> Please, do not buy this and waste your money, because even though it&#x27;s cheap, the shipping took about 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like it, is to soft.</li>
            <li> I like this better then the smaller, round one.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this tool because the precision of a square vs. round stamper seems like a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> Silicone is way to small to fit inside the stamper</li>
            <li> keep in mind that it&#x27;s the stamp alone and order the other products for full potential!</li>
            <li> it just pops right out, leaving a mess of polish EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> so its kind of squishy or gooey, needless to say it does not pick up polish.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t shop from this vendor again, because on top of the shoddy product, it took a very long time to arrive, was after the projected dates, and the vendor was terse in its reply to my &amp;#34;where&#x27;s my stuff?&amp;#34; inquiry.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the other round stamper didn&#x27;t fit all the way around my nail..</li>
            <li> I would not call these marshmallow stampers but one can be described as a squishy medium-soft and the other can be described as a squishy soft.</li>
            <li> Not happy right now!</li>
            <li> I will never buy a different stamp again, as long as this one is being made and is available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s medium soft (non-sticky) with a flat bed and picks up designs quite well with a little priming*.</li>
            <li> No matter how deep you cram the white sticky head into the black handle the second that you stamp something</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected,</li>
            <li> Works well after conditioning, but it&#x27;s got some indents that I&#x27;m concerned with, it&#x27;s not a really smooth surface, but so far it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems.</li>
            <li> Apparently from the reviews you can receive your stamper squishy or firm.</li>
            <li> I was super excited for this, but was very disappointed when it came!</li>
            <li> It is to squishy and not sticky or firm enough.</li>
            <li> I also was expecting a firm stamper only to get a marshmallow type one.</li>
            <li> I received the item way faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful though as with</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The white pad kept falling out, will have to glue it in, did not work in transferring the pattern over as well as the round pad.  </li>
            <li> I had difficulty transferring images from several plates onto the stamper and the rubber part did fall out a few times.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this only for beginners; for those looking for a serious multiple uses, buy from another company.</li>
            <li> the squishy part keeps popping out though other than that</li>
            <li> I have found that the stamper is extremely temperamental.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use this in the future.</li>
            <li> this is crap, feels very cheap ....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pick up nail polish, like half the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> In comparison to the XL nail stamper&#x27;s wider circumference, the dimensions of this stamper is relatively small and perhaps not conducive for really long nails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> By that I mean that it only works every so often.</li>
            <li> The rubber part wAs out of the black piece and covered in a sticky glue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super squishy like a marshmallow stamper, but it&#x27;s darned close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too sticky...and the rubber falls  out .</li>
            <li> I would rather my designs be a little off than having it take about an hour to get the polish to go on the stamper and do all my nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having so much trouble trying to use this product ......</li>
            <li> Waste of my money...</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> and  both were squishy firm.  </li>
            <li> Not very squishy, not long enough, :( Does, however seem to stay in the holder.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the material they used isn&#x27;t firm enough - it feels like the sticky hands you&#x27;d get out of a gumball machine as a kid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money!!</li>
            <li> very disappointed glad is</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The approximate size of the rubber head is 1.8cm x 2.8cm and the black holder is approximately 4cm long.</li>
            <li> also hard to transfer the polish onto it</li>
            <li> cheap crap!!!!</li>
            <li> at least I tried it</li>
            <li> and it sucks.</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks</li>
            <li> Please continue to make this squishy and sticky stampers as they have become very hard to find.</li>
            <li> My stamper arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Item took approximately 3 weeks for delivery and came from China (which is not indicated).</li>
            <li> Was broken..</li>
            <li> This nail stamp is completely useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic when my stamper was delivered one month than the estimated date, but when I went to test it, all I got was disappointment.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> She was so disappointed and had to wait over a month for it.</li>
            <li> Hairy nails for all!! :(</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> is probably the worst 3$ I&#x27;ve ever spent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and disgusting.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!  </li>
            <li> the customer service is horrible they wanted all kinds of pictures</li>
            <li> very bad quality!!!!!!</li>

            <li> it was everything that i was looking for. The perfect feel, shape, weight, but it&#x27;s difficult to clean and constantly separates from the handle.</li>
            <li> this product is great for someone who is interested in nail art- keep in mind that it&#x27;s the stamp alone and order the other products for full potential!</li>
            <li> I am very very displeased with this. The nail polish won&#x27;t even stick to the stamper. It is to squishy and not sticky or firm enough.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to center your designs</li>
            <li> Works and stamped with no filing to prep.</li>
            <li> My stamper arrived broken. The rubber part wAs out of the black piece and covered in a sticky glue. I also was expecting a firm stamper only to get a marshmallow type one.</li>
            <li> I do like the texture, size and shape of this versus the standard Konad stamper but it kept coming off of the handle so I had to glue it.</li>
            <li> The stamper that arrived was very marshmallow-y. I tested it on a decal wheel but it didn&#x27;t work. After looking up &amp;#34;nails stamper priming&amp;#34; videos I followed those instructions and the stamper worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you prime your stamper!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the product measurements.</li>
            <li> It is a very squishy, marshmallow stamper :) Very pleased! Works well after conditioning, but it&#x27;s got some indents that I&#x27;m concerned with, it&#x27;s not a really smooth surface, but so far it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having so much trouble trying to use this product ......</li>
            <li> It tears easily upon first time use. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all. If I could give it zero stars, I would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not firm. It like the sticker hands you get off the 25cent machines. It&#x27;s rubbery and sticky like so. If you want to disorrt the design this tool does it for you no problem.</li>
            <li> Really love this one it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> Does not pick up design</li>
            <li> Primed it several times. Still do not pick up image.</li>
            <li> I love my new stamper. Squishy and like a marshmallow lol</li>
            <li> If you have a stamp that comes in a kit...  Replace it with this.  It&#x27;s so much better.  As some have said,  super glue it inside...  It&#x27;s good and squishy.  Just much better,...</li>
            <li> After dulling the stamper with acetone to remove the shine it worked! the squishy part keeps popping out though other than that it stamps pretty good!</li>
            <li> It keeps falling out and is real sticky. I&#x27;m going to glue it in the inside.</li>
            <li> Squishy silicone is perfect for getting a better transfer for rounded nail beds like mine.</li>
            <li> Nice stamper. Picks up images well.</li>
            <li> I like this particular rectangular stamper.  It&#x27;s not super squishy like a marshmallow stamper, but it&#x27;s darned close.</li>
            <li> When it got here, I thought it would be cool, but it doesnt work at all !!! Horrible.</li>
            <li> I waited 6 week for this piece of junk. It&#x27;s cheaply made and going in the garbage. 6 weeks!!</li>
            <li> really good , it&#x27;s a squishy stamper and i just love it</li>
            <li> pad comes off the handle often</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t even work, I followed the direction and I doesn&#x27;t pick up polish</li>
            <li> Does not pick up any nail polish. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and I have tried to use it about 6 times. I have found that the stamper is extremely temperamental. By that I mean that it only works every so often. When it does work it doesn&#x27;t transfer the image cleanly or with the right color. The design that I did this morning I got them to work the best so far, the image was still blotchy and the color was faded but for once I could tell what it was. Maybe I just need to break it in more. I love how squishy it is though, fun to play with.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that the white gel part had a dent in it and it makes some stamping more tricky. I would recommend this only for beginners; for those looking for a serious multiple uses, buy from another company.</li>
            <li> Super sticky didn&#x27;t transfer well</li>
            <li> cheap crap!!!! I would like my money back!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it!! It&#x27;s not worth the money!!</li>
            <li> i have problems using this. i follow YouTube video but still not working</li>
            <li> Super soft, can slightly distort image but also great for making a small image fill a larger surface</li>
            <li> this is crap, feels very cheap ....it wont pick up no paint off the templet and it falls apart so easy</li>
            <li> I received the item way faster than expected. It is very sticky and more like a gel than a rubber. After many different attempts at transferring images I finally was able to use it. If you&#x27;re having trouble you need to lightly touch the stamper on the image. Do not press at all or it won&#x27;t stick. Just very lightly roll it on and the design will be picked up. I had contacted the seller before I figured it out and got a very quick response. It works well once you figure it out!</li>
            <li> Had fun using. Makes putting on designs very easy.</li>
            <li> This stamper works great  it does not fall out of the holder I have super long nails so this stamper is perfect for me, it picks up the image great.  Delivery was good  it came before the estimated time Will be ordering more from this supplier.</li>
            <li> This stamper came to me with a jelly like texture, as if it had not yet shed the silicon lining. I can&#x27;t use it for stamping, it does not pick up my design. Maybe it was just my order...I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m going to try and buy a different stamper to see if it has the same silicon texture like the one I have.</li>
            <li> Amazing stamper! Super squishy! Make sure you prep before use tho!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get anything to stick to it. I&#x27;ve tried different brands of polishes and different brands of plates and nothing sticks.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! I bought a stamper kit which the thing to transfer the design from the plate to the nail sucked.  But this thing fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> This does not have a rubber head - it is silicone and it is garbage. Designs do not transfer at all. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> s***tiest thing ever... it doesnt work at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pick up nail polish, like half the other reviews said. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> This stamper was recommended to me and when I got it I was so excited to use it. I know exactly how to use it, but it wouldn&#x27;t pick up any of the stamps. I don&#x27;t know if it was because its too squishy, but it wasn&#x27;t working at all for me.</li>
            <li> I was super excited for this, but was very disappointed when it came! Not only does it not transfer the image onto the nail, this stamper doesn&#x27;t even pick up any polish. Waste of my money... If you know of anyways to fix this, please let me know!</li>
            <li> This rubber nail art designs atamping  not work at all.</li>
            <li> stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up images as well as I had hoped. Even after priming.</li>
            <li> Discription says rubber stamp it is actually silicon and sticky had to super glue it into the handle very disappointed glad is was cheap at least I tried it</li>
            <li> when I first received the stamper it was smaller than I expected but it was the perfect size. it also didn&#x27;t work very well but then after doing some research I learned that I had to prime it and it ended up working perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works but the stamp it too soft</li>
            <li> It was not what I wanted! Everything stuck to it and the white top fell out when I went to use it. I love doing my nails and this was one thing I wanted until I got it and it sucks. I wish I could give it 0 stars cause that&#x27;s what is deserves.</li>
            <li> Read what it says ! RUBBER ! It was like a really latexy kind of rubber, very shiny not Matt like the rest it didn&#x27;t pick up no designs and it&#x27;s very flimsy...</li>
            <li> Bought this and I loved it. I roughed it up with a 120 grit file and it works like a dream. I like this better then the smaller, round one. I may end up buying another one just to have on hand. It took forever to arrive but it&#x27;s the best $2.50 spent.</li>
            <li> I cannot get this to stamp.  I am still trying to find a nail file that will buff the shininess off so it will pick up the image completely.  It is a nice large size for those of you with long nails.  I am sure once I get it roughed up enough it will be great</li>
            <li> I like this stamper so much more then the one I was using definitely makes my nails beautiful</li>
            <li> Works great. Nice shape and size. I used a nail file to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; it first. Check you tube for videos on priming a stamper</li>
            <li> I really like this stamper. Works great and I still get full coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this stamp thing good for small to big nails</li>
            <li> Very nice squishy  stamper. Works great.  Arrived  early.</li>
            <li> love the spongy feel!!! cant wait to use it.. i bought it but haven&#x27;t had a chance to actually try it out..</li>
            <li> This is the best stamping I had ever had. Picks up the image nice and clean and it&#x27;s perfect for the bigger images on your plate</li>
            <li> Not sure why I can&#x27;t get consistent images on the stamper.  I even filed the top a bit.</li>
            <li> Works well, large enough - falls out of the holder once in a while, but easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter loved it and uses it every time she would decorate her nails. IDK how it works, really, but she seems to be having so much fun. She would always show me her finished product and they actually look good and professionally-done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too sticky...and the rubber falls  out .</li>
            <li> I love it !.. Package come with delay but defanatly worth the wait..Thank you so much Vaga Shop.. Very good quality!</li>
            <li> We bought this stamper for our daughter. The stamper did not pick up the nail polish at all. She was so disappointed and had to wait over a month for it.</li>
            <li> Not to happy with product</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for marshmallow stampers these are it! Be careful though as with most marsh&#x27;s they are very sticky and attract dust, hair, etc. very easily.</li>
            <li> Great for making decals...glad I bought five of them!</li>
            <li> First of all  shipping took FOREVER and it doesnt even work! Doesn&#x27;t pick up the polish what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the worst 3$ I&#x27;ve ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointing.</li>
            <li> The nail polish want stick! Wth! Sucks. No use for it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stamp nor stay In its place dnt buy</li>
            <li> Great stampers!  I bought two of them and they had slightly different consistencies.  I would not call these marshmallow stampers but one can be described as a squishy medium-soft and the other can be described as a squishy soft. They were primed with a magic eraser pad and it picked up the images nicely. I do not prefer marshmallow stampers since they are overly soft and tend to easily distort the images stamped onto your nails if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I got this stamper and I absolutely love it, it picks up the images beautifuly and the image is transferi to the fingernail with zero problems.  I have to admit that when I order it I was not to sure about it since I already had a round stamper, if you are new to art nail stamping or not this is a must item to add to your art nail inventory.</li>
            <li> nice to have for a backup!</li>
            <li> love this Stamper very squishy didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it it&#x27;s the best I want to order a bunch of them and stock up!!</li>
            <li> it came in pieces! Yes, the white part WILL NOT stay in the stamper.  It&#x27;s sticky and disgusting. It feels like those sticky reusable lint rollers that you have to clean with water. I tried &#x27;de-stickefying&#x27; it with acetone, nada, it stays sticky no matter what you do. No matter how deep you cram the white sticky head into the black handle the second that you stamp something it just pops right out, leaving a mess of polish EVERYWHERE. Never. Again.</li>
            <li> Crap...only gave it one star because I had no choice... Silicone is way to small to fit inside the stamper keeps coming out...also hard to transfer the polish onto it I have to keep on rubbing it to get it to transfer..yes I do have stamping polish that works great with my other stamper..I bought this because the other round stamper didn&#x27;t fit all the way around my nail..but works way better ..would have never bought this if I knew how crappy it was I would rather my designs be a little off than having it take about an hour to get the polish to go on the stamper and do all my nails</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get the nail polish!</li>
            <li> The only nail stamp worth buying, in my opinion. If and when this wears out, I will immediately order a new one. This produces the crispest, clearest pick-up of polish from all of my plates (Konad, Winstonia, Uberchic, etc.) and has a very soft, rubbery feel. I do not use nail polish remover / acetone on it anymore thanks to tips from some of the reviews, but instead use a new sticky sheet from a lint roller. I will never buy a different stamp again, as long as this one is being made and is available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - attached a picture... I&#x27;m new at stamping, so the flaws you see are user error, not stamp error... 0:)</li>
            <li> White stamper falls out.</li>
            <li> The nail stamper is silicon rubber and not the sought after soft and sticky marshmallow stamper heads. It&#x27;s medium soft (non-sticky) with a flat bed and picks up designs quite well with a little priming*. [*Priming - buffing off the shine from the white rubber surface]&lt;br /&gt;The approximate size of the rubber head is 1.8cm x 2.8cm and the black holder is approximately 4cm long. In comparison to the XL nail stamper&#x27;s wider circumference, the dimensions of this stamper is relatively small and perhaps not conducive for really long nails. Item took approximately 3 weeks for delivery and came from China (which is not indicated).</li>
            <li> Love this stamper!!! Very squishy made stretching images effortless!!</li>
            <li> Was broken..not sure why but yes. For the wait you expect it to be right.</li>
            <li> I love my stamper  it works  great  especially on my toes thanks</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this tool because the precision of a square vs. round stamper seems like a no-brainer. Unfortunately the material they used isn&#x27;t firm enough - it feels like the sticky hands you&#x27;d get out of a gumball machine as a kid. It&#x27;s much, much too soft, so not only does it not pick up polish from a stamping plate; it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto the nail, either, even if you paint directly onto the stamper. I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with the brands I know from now on.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and i tried everything!!!</li>
            <li> I received the marshmallow sticky version of this stamper and am quite pleased with it. This stamper does require priming before use but is amazing once primed.</li>
            <li> would not pick up at all guess I got what I paid for...</li>
            <li> Waste of money! It broke the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li> although this was received this item one month early, I can truly say save your money. I was ecstatic when my stamper was delivered one month than the estimated date, but when I went to test it, all I got was disappointment. The white stamping part is squish and sticky and when I went to pick up the design from the plate it did not pick up anything. please do not make the same mistake I did and save your money, this product deserves ZERO stars. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I this earlier then it said it would deliver. When I got it the package looked liked it was open and the marshmallow stamp was dirty. Though it was easy to clean off, and the stamp is squishy and soft.</li>
            <li> This nail stamp is completely useless. The stamp pad falls out and it is too shinny/slippery to actually pick up the polish off the plate. Waste of money</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!  I bought it and the squishy part is like a rubbery material and it doesn&#x27;t pick up the polish AT ALL!  I even just plopped it in a big blob of nail polish to see if it would pick any of that up, didn&#x27;t pick up a drop!  Please, do not buy this and waste your money, because even though it&#x27;s cheap, the shipping took about 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> OMG! These are marshmallow squishy stampers. Available in 3 sizes ...short, tall and squared. Primed with Mr Clean magic eraser they work great. Seller needs to add an XL stamper to their collection. 2 weeks delivery.  Great product!</li>
            <li> do not buy this it is sticky and the cushion falls out the customer service is horrible they wanted all kinds of pictures I just threw it out it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I do not like this one at all! It is so soft, and everything but the nail polish sticks to it!! Hairy nails for all!! :( Good thing it was really cheap and I had a GC.</li>
            <li> very bad quality!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these stampers!!!!  They&#x27;re all good!  Still the softest rectangle stamper out there no matter what range of squshiness you get!  By far still the best and softest rectangle stamper out there!  I love all of the VAGA stampers in every shape.  Thank you so much for making these soft stampers!!  They&#x27;re the best!</li>
            <li> Not very squishy, not long enough, :( Does, however seem to stay in the holder. If you like squishy-firm, and don&#x27;t have extra long nails, then this is for you :) It doesn&#x27;t work for me, though.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!!! I wish I could give it all of the stars!!!! So soft and squishy and works beautifully after priming! What a great deal!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money. First of all it was drenched in some king of oil it kind of smelled like petroleum and the plastic of the actual stamper is king of like silicone not rubber so its kind of squishy or gooey, needless to say it does not pick up polish. What a disappointment. Would give it zero stars if i could.</li>
            <li> Most stampers gives me trouble picking up and transferring images, however this  .  one is a life saver. Just awesome. Clean with acetone and stamp away!</li>
            <li> I like it ...works great.</li>
            <li> Stamper doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would</li>
            <li> The product is only passable. It makes doing my nails a bit easier, but the rubber side holds small dust and hair very easily and pops out of the plastic on a whim, as though there was never anything holding it in place. I won&#x27;t shop from this vendor again, because on top of the shoddy product, it took a very long time to arrive, was after the projected dates, and the vendor was terse in its reply to my &amp;#34;where&#x27;s my stuff?&amp;#34; inquiry.</li>
            <li> This rubber stamp is SUPER sticky and squishy. It took some time trying to figure out how to clean it and get the images off the plates, but now that I have it down, I love it and would highly recommend it to others. The only issue is that it takes over three weeks to get to the U.S. from China, so do not expect to buy it and receive it right away.</li>
            <li> The pad keeps falling out while I&#x27;m using it. It does do a good job of picking up the nail polish!</li>
            <li> I waited almost 2 months for this stamper and this is how it came to me today! Not happy right now! Zero stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Before buying you most know that you may or may not get a squishy sticky stamper or a squishy firm(which is not sticky) I was hopping for a squishy sticky (marshmallow) and that&#x27;s exactly what I got so I&#x27;m very happy.  Please continue to make this squishy and sticky stampers as they have become very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Apparently from the reviews you can receive your stamper squishy or firm. I received the squishy/sticky stamper. Upon using it the first time it didn&#x27;t pick up the image from the nail plate. I then gave it a couple of swipes with the Mr. Clean magic eraser and it did the trick. It works PERFECTLY!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and  both were squishy firm.  :( Wish they would of been sticky/squishy.  They do stamp great though.</li>
            <li> The white pad kept falling out, will have to glue it in, did not work in transferring the pattern over as well as the round pad.  I was hoping this would work well for easier placement for patterns.</li>
            <li> Received this product in a timely manner. Works well and I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these stampers, one for myself and one for my daughter. Neither one of us can get them to work. They won&#x27;t pick up any polish from the plate. We&#x27;ve tried different pressures and &amp;#34;seasoning&amp;#34; the surface with remover. Nothing works.</li>
            <li> The texture of the stamper&#x27;s surface is somewhat sticky. I had difficulty transferring images from several plates onto the stamper and the rubber part did fall out a few times. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use this in the future.</li>
            <li> To gummy for me but if that is what you are looking for the this product is for you arrived a week early loved it.</li>
            <li> Love stamping with this product.</li>
            <li> I do not like this stamper at all. It doesn&#x27;t pick up the full design. It&#x27;s really sticky to the point that it collects lint. It cones out of the holder really easily.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t pick up anything, then I cleaned it and it picked up something once.... Now it won&#x27;t pick up anything at all. This thing sucks</li>
            <li> I like it, is to soft.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Tested it  using Kleancolor nail polish and it  picked up all the designs just fine. Only problem is the stamper tends to slip out but I just glued it. Been wanting to try out a squishy stamper and not spend a lot so this was a good deal.</li>
