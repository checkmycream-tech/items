            <li>Best Shampoo out there!</li>
            <li>Found to be best for my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without question, one of the best products I have tried, and it matters not if you are 16 or 86 --</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, works great.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>It smeels great.</li>
            <li>Works good and smells good!</li>
            <li>I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another good beer shampoo.</li>
            <li>Good if you have greasy hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even a huge beer drinker, but the scent of this stuff is just incredible.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, and I use it about twice a week.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has to be the best shampoo I have ever purchased, cleans hair extremely well, and has a great orange smell.</li>
            <li>shampoo is probably the best on the market now, if you use a lot of product, and want a clean, fresh feel.</li>
            <li>which isnt easy!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>Needs to lather up more.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Couldnt ask for a better shampoo</li>
            <li>just wish it had more</li>
            <li>I think this is mostly just a gimmick.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair feel thicker, and I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>i am glad i spotted this product on here</li>
            <li>Love the citrus smell and leaves my hair shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I always love Redken products.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>but i think there are better shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>Love this product for me, a woman, as well as my husband.</li>
            <li>Love the orange zest fragrance - not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Excellent smell, does an excellent job of removing hair gel ( such as spiker ) which it had the Hair conditioner fused as it does leave the hair a bit on the dry side.</li>
            <li>but after you repeat the hair feels nice and clean.</li>
            <li>he thinks it is pretty good..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though created for the guy&#x27;s, the scent is NOT over powering, and could easily be used by gal&#x27;s as well.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite shampoo, and is certainly my fianc&amp;eacute;s favorite shampoo for me.  </li>
            <li>For YEARS studios have used a beer rinse to enhance the quality and SHINE of hair, when you are on-camera ( and I STILL think a beer rinse ((get the cheap stuff)) ) should be used before a photo-op.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has nice scent and it really cleans your hair</li>
            <li>would like it much better if it smelled better, or at all really.  </li>
            <li>Light, and really does a great job of making my scalp feel clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>This stuff gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li>It gets hair squeaky clean</li>
            <li>Not very beery but smells great and creates lots of lather</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it is a good biweekly deep cleaner</li>
            <li>Sensational product back then.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Has a few too many ingredients to get 5 stars, but still better than most mainstream products.</li>
            <li>Small bottle but great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 months now (had the larger bottle and needed more) Will continue to use.</li>
            <li>My teenage son has oily hair and it is challenging to find a shampoo that he likes and takes the oil out as well.  </li>
            <li>The first time around it doesn&#x27;t seem to work</li>
            <li>Hope to get more in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is similar, but better.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!  </li>
            <li>I bought a couple of these beer shampoos and they are all pretty decent.</li>
            <li>This one gives a pretty deep clean.</li>
            <li>My husband has very oily hair and this shampoo is really helping his hair.</li>
            <li>The shipping time was fast.</li>
            <li>Cleans hair very well, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it cleans your hair, but the bottle is pretty small and doesn&#x27;t seem any better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells decent</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if u have oily hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It smells so clean and fresh, lathers well with small amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those around in the 1970&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s -- you might remember a product called \\&quot;Body On Tap\\&quot; that was a highly promoted beer shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I tend to notice a bit of flaking during the winter when the weather is harder on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This might be a terrific ( and trendy) gift for any senior on your special list -  thinning hair, or hair loss can be a depressing issue for some- why not help a bit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reasons I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars are that it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the quantity, and it tends to dry out your scalp if you&#x27;re a frequent bather (i.e., you find yourself shower more than once a day due to working out or something).  </li>
            <li>Gets a hard working man&#x27;s hair clean and shiny...  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My husband has very oily hair and this shampoo is really helping his hair. The shipping time was fast.</li>
            <li> Cleaning: strips everything off your hair&lt;br /&gt;Suds: not that much&lt;br /&gt;Smell: virtually non-existent&lt;br /&gt;Size: small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like it much better if it smelled better, or at all really.  Needs to lather up more.  I have greasy hair, and it does leave it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prefer MOP Basil Mint or Bedhead for Men.</li>
            <li> Works good and smells good!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, but that&#x27;s it. Its like water in a bottle and my hair felt dry after washing.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Couldnt ask for a better shampoo just wish it had more</li>

            <li> I bought a couple of these beer shampoos and they are all pretty decent. This one gives a pretty deep clean. Hair almost requires use of a conditioner after using this. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it is a good biweekly deep cleaner</li>
            <li> Like the smell of the shampoo</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations. I went back to using regular REdken One for men. Waste of money. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Smells awesome.  Cleans hair very well, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  Want to buy lots of this, but need to use up all of my other Redken stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair I&#x27;m not a wash, rinse, repeat kinda guy but with this shampoo you have to be.  The first time around it doesn&#x27;t seem to work but after you repeat the hair feels nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo out there!</li>
            <li> bought this for my son...he thinks it is pretty good..</li>
            <li> Gets a hard working man&#x27;s hair clean and shiny...  which isnt easy!</li>
            <li> I think this is mostly just a gimmick. Sure, it cleans your hair, but the bottle is pretty small and doesn&#x27;t seem any better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> works with the Redken Dandruff Control Shampoo, 10.1 Ounce to fully treat my problem flaky dandruff</li>
            <li> Found to be best for my hair. Hard to find. Glad I found it here. Hope to get more in the future.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair feel thicker, and I love the way it smells.  Wish I didn&#x27;t need it, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a KEEPER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those around in the 1970&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s -- you might remember a product called \\&quot;Body On Tap\\&quot; that was a highly promoted beer shampoo.  Sensational product back then. I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is similar, but better.  For YEARS studios have used a beer rinse to enhance the quality and SHINE of hair, when you are on-camera ( and I STILL think a beer rinse ((get the cheap stuff)) ) should be used before a photo-op.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is probably the best on the market now, if you use a lot of product, and want a clean, fresh feel. If you have thinning hair, you will see an immediate result - thicker hair, with a shine or &#x27;gloss&#x27; that improves your look. Use it once, and you will see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though created for the guy&#x27;s, the scent is NOT over powering, and could easily be used by gal&#x27;s as well. This might be a terrific ( and trendy) gift for any senior on your special list -  thinning hair, or hair loss can be a depressing issue for some- why not help a bit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without question, one of the best products I have tried, and it matters not if you are 16 or 86 -- it works!</li>
            <li> Another good beer shampoo. Has a few too many ingredients to get 5 stars, but still better than most mainstream products.</li>
            <li> has nice scent and it really cleans your hair i am glad i spotted this product on here thank you</li>
            <li> This shampoo has to be the best shampoo I have ever purchased, cleans hair extremely well, and has a great orange smell. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Light, and really does a great job of making my scalp feel clean and clear.  It has a nice scent, and I use it about twice a week.</li>
            <li> I wish this were easier to find. It smells great. I&#x27;d drink it so my breath would smell like the brew all the time, but no one else seems to have tried this, so I&#x27;ll let someone else play guinea pig. Shipped quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the citrus smell and leaves my hair shiny and manageable.  Fast shipping too!  I always love Redken products.  Would prefer shampoo and then separate conditioner though.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets your hair clean. It smeels great.I follow it up with finish up conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Shipped fast and in great condition.  Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not very beery but smells great and creates lots of lather</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite shampoo, and is certainly my fianc&amp;eacute;s favorite shampoo for me.  I&#x27;m not even a huge beer drinker, but the scent of this stuff is just incredible.  It just smells...like man.  The only reasons I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars are that it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the quantity, and it tends to dry out your scalp if you&#x27;re a frequent bather (i.e., you find yourself shower more than once a day due to working out or something).  It&#x27;s not bad, but I tend to notice a bit of flaking during the winter when the weather is harder on your skin.  I imagine if you&#x27;re a swimmer you might have issues with it causing dryness as well.  For me it hasn&#x27;t been anything bad enough to call a &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;, but something worth noting.</li>
            <li> Good if you have greasy hair otherwise dries your hair a bit. Smells decent but i think there are better shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> Love this product for me, a woman, as well as my husband. It smells so clean and fresh, lathers well with small amount. Love the orange zest fragrance - not overbearing.  If you need extra conditioning I would not recommend. It gets hair squeaky clean but I don&#x27;t think it has any conditioning pruduct in it. I have gray hair and coarse hair. Works for me.</li>
