            <li>This is the best electric  razor  </li>
            <li>I decided to try the Panasonic Arc5 electric shaver because I wanted the best of both worlds - the closeness of a safety razor with the ease of and electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>The LA63 - without a doubt - provided the best shave I had ever had.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think even with the best of Norelco&#x27;s I have owned</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li>BUT, after researching, this is one of the best electric shavers on the market in terms of affordability and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel Panasonic shavers are the best available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I began considering this purchase I thought with that price it must be an awesome shaver.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric razor I have ever used without a shred of doubt.</li>
            <li>This is the best substitute I could ever get.</li>
            <li>Incredible!  </li>
            <li>Incredible!  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic 5 blade electric razor is the best I have ever tried, and in that group I include the Norelco 3D  and the Braun 7.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it is working perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>got a Panasonic ARC4 with 4-Blades; and,it was the best of all.</li>
            <li>Just got it and used it twice and best shave ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Panasonic wet/dry for over thirty years and they&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li>Best shaver ever.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver.  </li>
            <li>These Panasonic razors are the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>The best part is the charge lasts a lot longer then</li>
            <li>Still the best close shave I have ever gotten with an electric wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Best electric on the market.</li>
            <li>Its one of the best electric Shavers I have ever had.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor i have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the best shavers I ever have had.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic has always been an excellent razor!</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
            <li>The best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Best shave of any product ever used period -  any blade, any electric.</li>
            <li>(Panasonic&#x27;s customer service was very good</li>
            <li>The shave itself is very good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Material quality: Very good +1</li>
            <li>Very good shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a very good shopping experience.</li>
            <li>very good.</li>
            <li>The look and feel of the razor is very good.  </li>
            <li>it gives a very good shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Braun Series 7 for years and it is still a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the lack of a charging dock, I like the Panasonic ES-LV61-A Shaver for the incredibly close shave it provides and for the ease with which it can be cleaned.</li>
            <li>Holds its charge brilliantly.</li>
            <li>My post dry-shave session was incredible, didn&#x27;t even feel like I had just shaved.  </li>
            <li>But it still didn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the 5 blade, with its faster vibrations is incredible.</li>
            <li>Panasonic gives an incredibly close shave that sets it apart from any shaver I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s incredibly time</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s incredibly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Electric Razor, the best i have ever had.  </li>
            <li>is awesome and am quite happy with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND GOOD PRICE!</li>
            <li>good!</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
            <li>color&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li>Flawless when shaving &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, and almost as good when shaving &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>All in all, I have no problems noting that this is a darn good shaver that gives a very good shave.</li>
            <li>I have always been happy with my rotary shavers</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic still has issues with the problem areas on the face I experienced with the Norelco.</li>
            <li>Based on your beard this razor may still be a great buy.  </li>
            <li>The pivoting head and five blades make a great difference.</li>
            <li>Though mine still works great, it feels cheaper in quality from grip to aesthetics.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great the way it is.</li>
            <li>It is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>After two years of use, it wanted to fly like r kelly and broke as it flew off a counter.  </li>
            <li>It is a great feeling to know that after 1 or 2 swipes, your face is all gucci to go.  </li>
            <li>It is a great build.</li>
            <li>It does a great job on outer ear hair.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is waterproof is great, but I never shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summing up, the ES-LV61 is a great step forward for Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li>think you would be happy with a cheaper model Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It gives the closest and fastest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Great shaver and shave for the price.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>It worked great for well over a year, but then I noticed a)</li>
            <li>But, believe me, it works great.</li>
            <li>It performs incredible and as good as a blade without the cuts.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>It is great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Save some money, and still have a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>For some one that always uses electrics this is a great razor.</li>
            <li>If price doesn&#x27;t matter, I think you will be happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Since then, it has been great.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic ES-LA63-S Nanotech 4-Blade -  Great for face shaving, the 30 degree \\&quot;Arc\\</li>
            <li>5/06 2013 ( a problem with the shaver but great</li>
            <li>I was thinking about going with the newer Braun model, but I saw the great reviews on this one and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>Arc5 is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver and for the price it should excel in that department.</li>
            <li>Great shaver, but sometimes caused irritation.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, I think this one is great</li>
            <li>Great razor, bought it for my Dad and he loves it.  </li>
            <li>That make me happy every time he uses it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great job with longer hair.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>I can purchase a Braun 790cc at a lower cost and still get a great shave, why not?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Great razor.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, battery life and ease of cleaning and use.</li>
            <li>(induction).&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that it does a great job at shaving</li>
            <li>happy with the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right out of the box, I think the shaver is great.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is great too.</li>
            <li>I used this model for over a year and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a great Shaver.</li>
            <li>and it works great on both.</li>
            <li>This is a great upgrade to the Arc 4.</li>
            <li>Still conditioning my face  to this great Panasonic Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Two cutters with 5 piece foil.</li>
            <li>the power button lock is a great thought for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Great Razor.  </li>
            <li>have been looking for a shaver and have been using Remington for years at the $60 range which has been working great...</li>
            <li>This is a very nice electric and simplifies shaving.</li>
            <li>looks nice, works perfect for me used with shaving cream in shower great shave, battery holds charge good.</li>
            <li>The battery indicator is helpful, the pivoting head is very smooth and awesome.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>The shave, while not as good as a blade razor, was close-no five o&#x27;clock shadow and it was great for under the chin.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I can successfully shave these patches by rinsing my face, drying and going over it again.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor about six months ago and absolutely love it – it gives a wonderful shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never given a gift like this before Christmas and all, but my honey hates shaving and let&#x27;s face it although my guy is handsome shaved or not even he must look his best and Adam loves it!</li>
            <li>BTW, the case is very nice too, seems to be good quality leather.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easily the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is an attractive razor and on astand would look amazing.  </li>
            <li>Pop-Up Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer does as good a job as a dedicated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Good Ergonomics&lt;</li>
            <li>but it still should provide a good shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>and it was so good</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>I loved this machine and compared to the norelco I bought that one is rubbish</li>
            <li>and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>If you think of the fact that you spend about $5 for a razor every 2-4 weeks - which adds up to $100 per year - this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Panasonic has done a good job of improving their men&#x27;s shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li>(And I loved the ES LA-63.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the razor.</li>
            <li>That was a good shaver, and I thought it was the bar set for others.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver because i read the good reviews.</li>
            <li>ergonomics of this shaver are also good.  </li>
            <li>but now I can dump my bladed razor for good.</li>
            <li>Braun 790cc is also good but it does not give as close shave as es-lv61-a.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that good if you shave after 4 or so days</li>
            <li>Good feel in hand.</li>
            <li>I bought this item partly because of the good reviews and it has performed as advertised.</li>
            <li>I figure they (the companies) have already done the research and that is their way to let the buyer know which models they consider to be superior.</li>
            <li>Over the course of my life I found that rotary shavers worked best for my admittedly light growth.</li>
            <li>The swivel head, which can be locked, does a good job going over the chin to the neck.</li>
            <li>Overrated... Not as good as the one I was trying to replace, the Panasonic ES8243 WET/DRY.&lt;br /&gt;TOO</li>
            <li>There is a lock function which is good when you travel as it prevents the shaver from switching on inadvertently.</li>
            <li>You also get a shaver that shaves well, but not twice as good as the Norelco.</li>
            <li>and I am still delighted.</li>
            <li>Good on the face, fair on the neck and as for head shaving</li>
            <li>The razor is gorgeous, the cleaning station a technological marvel.</li>
            <li>a lighter note, the ES-LV61  has a gorgeous aesthetic.</li>
            <li>a lighter note, the ES-LV61  has a gorgeous aesthetic.</li>
            <li>It also has aloe and tea tree oil which are supposed to be good at reducing irritation and preventing the formation of shaving bumps.</li>
            <li>But the ES-LV61-A is definitely a superior over that model.</li>
            <li>It did a fair job on the neck but could not handle the jaw line.</li>
            <li>it.the price is good.</li>
            <li>The battery power is also good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>So I decided to bite the bullet a pay a ton of money for a really good electric razor.</li>
            <li>so I have the three blade Panasonic which I reviewed on Amazon and loved.  </li>
            <li>Some have been good and others not.</li>
            <li>Use a scented soap, it smells good for a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed with how good of a job it did</li>
            <li>good job guys.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, for 5 blades but my 8243 - 4 blade shaves just as good</li>
            <li>so i returned the Braun and they are refunding me the monies, good customer support with Braun and have to give them a heads up for that! :)</li>
            <li>All the wonderful reviews are true to their word.</li>
            <li>So remarkable I told a friend who used mine once and ordered his own that day.</li>
            <li>Awesome shaver, better than Norelco, better than Braun.</li>
            <li>I rate the shave 5 stars and the shaver exceptional in just about every category including comfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion - The shave is exceptionally close, with the Braun Pulsonic</li>
            <li>Meets all expectations for a quick and great shave!</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES-LV61-A Wet/Dry Shaver provides an incredibly close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Most noticeable is the reduced time and number of strokes it takes to get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>but excellent results make the price worth it.</li>
            <li>I reviewed many razors and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>if there was a 1/2 star rating but the fact that it does a great job is what matters most.  </li>
            <li>So I have an expireince using this product and very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor and worth the price point.  </li>
            <li>Shaving results have always been great, and I have no need any more for a backup shaver.</li>
            <li>Shaver feels good in your hand with its nice finish and grip&lt;</li>
            <li>But frankly, right out of the box it is a very impressive shaver.  </li>
            <li>Very clean shave and a great deal faster than my $200 rotary electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny of the cost of this great great machine......</li>
            <li>a lot!&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is I get a closer shave now, it looks as good as a shave straight out of the shower with a razor!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Charges quickly, very easy to use, does a good job of shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a month now, and I love it!</li>
            <li>This is in a shaver that you are supposed to be able to use in the shower or bath!  </li>
            <li>If I could rate this shaver greater than 5 stars I would!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I decided to give it a try!  </li>
            <li>I love this one!  </li>
            <li>Considering this is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver, this is probably one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made when it comes to grooming needs!</li>
            <li>this is probably the best electric razor you can get if you&#x27;re willing to spend the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the noise is an excellent razor, it feels good in my hand and is easy to to keep clean.</li>
            <li>No way, I had an almost perfect shave on the first try.</li>
            <li>I spend about a minute to create a good lather with Classic Shaving Cream (unscented) and a Rooney best quality badger brush.</li>
            <li>This is a remarkable razor, it shaves close, it shaves as good as a blade, it feels good in my hand, it is very fast, and the trimmer works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just rather amazing...</li>
            <li>Really amazing product.</li>
            <li>Its a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great razor, works like a manual shaver and looks great, the battery give me about ten days.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing shaver.</li>
            <li>AMAZING RAZOR.  </li>
            <li>Now that I own it</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a sure sign for me that a shave is doing a good gob.</li>
            <li>I am also the proud owner of the Panasonic Arc 4, the top Norelco and Braun models, but the Arc 5 is the best so far.</li>
            <li>so nice and safety</li>
            <li>The cleaning unit will not do better, indeed, it is not as good as manual cleaning..</li>
            <li>But the results are spectacular.</li>
            <li>Nice surprise!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life isn&#x27;t spectacular...</li>
            <li>Honestly?</li>
            <li>Honestly?</li>
            <li>Everything pops apart nicely and easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a nice razor.</li>
            <li>much  more  good  </li>
            <li>The results were truly astounding.  </li>
            <li>As a guy, I like a nicely built device, and this is nicely built.  </li>
            <li>+ for another one now, which tells you that at one point in time I really liked this razor.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Braun and was considering just getting another Braun rather than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>It seems&lt;br /&gt;like a nice instrument.  </li>
            <li>own two, because I shave with two--</li>
            <li>both braun and panasonic  would make for an ideal shave kit, but the price wasnt worth it for me</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with the performance of this razor.  </li>
            <li>(probably) don&#x27;t own one yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A cleaning brush and a counter stand would also have been nice.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re on the fence about this razor and still suffering through this review, let me assure you this is one spectacular machine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended.me, cleaning systems come with their own set of problems and added</li>
            <li>Another nice change is in cleaning.</li>
            <li>I had not realized that a good quality shver could be so much better than mid-range</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice shaver</li>
            <li>Handy when one is in a rush.</li>
            <li>Wet/Dry shaver is the absolute best shaver on the market!  </li>
            <li>To my surprise it is also effective on those tangly neck hairs.  </li>
            <li>from purchase, get to return on my own to manufacturer (for $10 mailing charge) and take my chances.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After charging the shaver, I let it sit for a day since I just had oral surgery and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about running this thing over my tender jaw.  </li>
            <li>Trims nice and close without roughing up your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a good Razor and it does better than my Norelco</li>
            <li>and it felt even better (to be fair</li>
            <li>The pivoting head and built in trimmer is a nice added benefit as well.</li>
            <li>This puppy shaves EVERYTHING nice and close.</li>
            <li>So I put 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t really work for me but for someone else this could be a real good product.</li>
            <li>I liked the shave I got from the this shaver.</li>
            <li>and I really liked my Braun.</li>
            <li>in all...a great electric shaver with a unique and efficient sonic cleaning mode.20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>in all...a great electric shaver with a unique and efficient sonic cleaning mode.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great product for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t look that perfect from very close look as if you shaved with good disposable razor so you may need just check-shave with razor very quickly and no foam needs to be applied.</li>
            <li>I figured that this was the best that an electric could do because Braun gets high marks on reviews.</li>
            <li>Fit and finish is excellent, good ergonomics and modern aesthetics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this new unit and will highly recommend it to anyone wanting a top-notch wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>This new model is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This one is new and the BEST!  </li>
            <li>I have mostly used Norelco as my primary shaver, but the ones I&#x27;ve had never gave me great close shave, so I&#x27;ve had to resort to razors when I needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought this about 2 months ago here at Naval Station Great Lakes, and I have to say that this is the most comfortable and reliable shaving device I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>but the reviews were incredible and I had great results with my prior razor.  </li>
            <li>All i can say he was super happy that i got him it .</li>
            <li>The flexible heads make it very easy to shave around the neck.  </li>
            <li>Amazon shipped promptly, and made my shopping experience very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the shaver is very easy.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is very easy with the 20-second cleaning</li>
            <li>The shaver is pretty good!</li>
            <li>So the Panasonic has many great features (good battery life, charges quickly, cleans easily, etc.), but the closeness of the shave is unlike any shaver I have used and is what truly sets the Panasonic apart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it, because I&#x27;m one of those who has to have the latest and greatest, but I really think the Arc4 shavers are a better value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is, by far, the best razor Panasonic has ever made.</li>
            <li>Used the four head Panasonic&#x27;s before, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I also tried the Panasonic with a wet-shave, and was able to achieve an amazingly close shave.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase of the Panasonic so far, as I look for build quality and durability in a product.</li>
            <li>IMHO offers the best electric shaver value on the market.</li>
            <li>I liked much more.</li>
            <li>Just go ahead and splurge and buy this razor instead of a Braun Series 7 or a Norelco with those heads stuck out in space, I have one of each of them plus a Remington and this Panasonic is by far the best of bunch.</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer is an important step to keep the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>However as Consumer Reports was impressed with complete overhaul of the SensoTouch line</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rapid fire fast and incredibly</li>
            <li>After near a month use, I would said this is best electric shavers I ever have!</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic electric shavers for some time and this is by far the best; making it the #1 wet/dry shaver on the market.  </li>
            <li>I have used Panasonic shaver for about 20 years, but this is by far the best Panasonic electric shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, well built and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It still is a good buy from the original $500 price.  </li>
            <li>I had been a Braun user for many years and really liked their razors (better than Remmington or Norelco).</li>
            <li>Great razor and easy to clean</li>
            <li>I have used many electrics and this by far is the best one ever.</li>
            <li>After 30 years of mostly electric shavers this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use and works perfectly in the shower.  </li>
            <li>looks good, feels right in your hands and nice battery life.</li>
            <li>The rotation was more than suitable for my shaving needs.  </li>
            <li>A full charge is good for 5 or 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li>the 8243 and is very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>The result is a very smooth shave with almost no stubble.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving experience was very smooth with no pull.</li>
            <li>Since it delivers very smooth shave</li>
            <li>For the shaving: this shaver is very fast and picks up most of the beard in great style.</li>
            <li>When used with shaving cream the shave felt very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>That thing is absolutely incredible and still runs like brand new.</li>
            <li>It does the job quickly and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>The handle is exactly the right size for my hand, it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>That said, this is a great travel shaver because it&#x27;s light, comes with a carrying case and gives you a lot of shaves on one quick charge.</li>
            <li>the travel case is a bit cheap considering the cost of the razor – they could have thrown in a sturdier, more form fitting plushier case – it&#x27;s not bad but it isn&#x27;t great and for someone who travels a lot, a well cushioned case is a must&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I really love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic Arc 4 is much better.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped in on the tile floor in the bathroom and the top and cover came off.  </li>
            <li>I have been an electric shaver user for many years.</li>
            <li>We are talking many decades.  </li>
            <li>Except for using this to extract more money from us</li>
            <li>I purchased a Feather AS-D2 and learned to love shaving again.  </li>
            <li>my triple head was better</li>
            <li>remain in areas no matter how many times and directions</li>
            <li>Price of replacement foil and blade is more than 50% of what the razor cost to buy (comparing sale prices of both razor and foil/blade).  </li>
            <li>As with most razors the beard trimmer has dulled.  </li>
            <li>give you more burn compared to rotary blades.   </li>
            <li>Even when I shave with a blade I sometimes go over areas more than once.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic Arc 4 was my favorite before getting the Arc 5 as my birthday gift to me.</li>
            <li>This is my second Panasonic shaver and I am very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>Gives a good close shave and is easy to clean</li>
            <li>there are better products for your money.</li>
            <li>I like knowing how many more shaves I have</li>
            <li>But for the price I would expect more than a year&#x27;s use out of it.  </li>
            <li>many razors and shaving cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went with the Arc5.</li>
            <li>The LV61 cuts my beard closer and smoother but the ES8243 has a better sideburn trimmer and thumb handle placement than the LV61.</li>
            <li>I had been using a Norelco Arcitec and was pleased with it until it died.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaver!</li>
            <li>The shave seems to be ok on the cheek and neck areas.</li>
            <li>I did not think the ES-LV61-A Arc 5 shaver would be better than the Arc 4, but it is, and noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I really love this one.</li>
            <li>Handles much better than</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for more than a month.</li>
            <li>This shaved is ok, it shaved close.  </li>
            <li>excellent results and quieter than my last shaver</li>
            <li>Does an ok job.</li>
            <li>The arc5 razor provided a close shave but also caused more irritation.</li>
            <li>There are $50 razors with better packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no need to pack the charger for a one week trip (well unless you are shaving a lot more than just your face).</li>
            <li>love the razor</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>There is no need to pack the charger for a one week trip (well unless you are shaving a lot more than just your face).</li>
            <li>love the razor</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>Another good feature is that it is easy to clean</li>
            <li>I find that the hairs stand up more this way, and are easier to cut.</li>
            <li>I have never paid more than $75 to $100 for a shaver</li>
            <li>I will gladly deal with charging the razor more often (for me about every 5 days) and the trimmer still gets the job</li>
            <li>It does okay</li>
            <li>Panasonic is so much better than Norelco (razor burn) or Braun.  </li>
            <li>I love having more blades.</li>
            <li>It feels dainty compared to my old electrics.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic electric shaver has many improved features.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over my neck area, this does not get all the hairs and it looks stubbly when I am done.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll get a better shave.</li>
            <li>Even more interesting is that you cannot operate it while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.useless in my opinion.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
            <li>I have used Panasonic shavers for many years beginning with the Arc3, and they keep getting better.</li>
            <li>However, the shaver works better in the shower or after I have washed my face.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally pleased by this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all latest electric razers like norelco sensotouch 3D,Braun 790cc, panasonic ES-LA63-S and ES-LV61-A.</li>
            <li>The second best is sensotouch 3D if you have no history of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>need I say more?</li>
            <li>and they still work after more than a decade of use)</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>already didnt think it could get any better.</li>
            <li>But I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>With some practice you can get a better shave than a blade.  </li>
            <li>Instead I get used to use to shave with groomer and sure it never was a zero shaving</li>
            <li>LA63 delivers a shave I would rate at 4.5 stars but misses the mark in ergonomics, quality of feel and, most of all, maneuverability.</li>
            <li>nonsense close shave with reasonable comfort and easily wins my vote for best Panasonic 4-blade.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s currently selling on Amazon for an incredible $110!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not inclined to spend the extra $100 or more for the LV61-A (which for me is still the best of all shavers), you will likely be very happy with this model.</li>
            <li>Love the locking feature for travel.</li>
            <li>I have compared them to the top of the line braun and</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>I have owned every one of Braun and Panasonic&#x27;s better shavers for thirty or so years.  </li>
            <li>The razor smells better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a better shave, which is the bottom</li>
            <li>leads to even more skin irritation.</li>
            <li>If you decide to purchase this electric shaver then I sincerely hope that your shaving experience is better than mine was.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is always at the top of the list when it comes to Men&#x27;s Shaver and Panasonic ES-LV61-A</li>
            <li>I guess that the speed in which the blades spin makes it more efficient than their competition.</li>
            <li>For someone that drives a Toyota Camry and sees a Lexus LS 460 pass by there is always that nagging feeling that, yes, the Lexus is the better vehicle.</li>
            <li>This review might be more for those who are contemplating going from a 4 blade to a 5 blade razor</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES8243A for the last 4 years and have been very happy with the shave.</li>
            <li>It is a noticeably better shave.</li>
            <li>Will write more review after a month.</li>
            <li>Shave feels closer and smoother, was a worthwhile upgrade.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mostly for the wet-shave capability and mostly use the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I stated, I mostly use the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>For me, it gives a better shave than Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have owned this Panasonic shaver for almost two years and have been able to compare it with Braun&#x27;s Series 7-790 Pulsonic shaver, which I have used for about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is decided more by our beard type, shaving habits (frequency, etc.), face shape, and skin type.</li>
            <li>Very happy overall.</li>
            <li>so many fewer minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also seems to hold its charge better than the Arc4.</li>
            <li>This shaver is significantly more, but it&#x27;s also significantly better.</li>
            <li>Bottom line - this is a great shaver, but the price is VERY steep.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is a lot better than the one on the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Which is what makes it all the more</li>
            <li>But my suitcase was stolen (shaver included) and I opted for Panasonic&#x27;s latest top of the line 5 blade model.</li>
            <li>Now after three months, the shaver performs much better after adjusting to my skin.  </li>
            <li>If I wait, the razor starts to smell more than I would like.</li>
            <li>best Christmas present</li>
            <li>The one hour charge lasts more than a week, and cleanup convenient...</li>
            <li>I tried shaving in the shower with soap, and the results were outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It works as well or better,</li>
            <li>go - it should get even better in time.</li>
            <li>make sure you register on line or mail in the registration card</li>
            <li>Cleaining is a snap and re-confirms how glad I am to have passed on the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using King Of Shaves gel and the results have been outstanding.</li>
            <li>The best prices for either are big surprise, on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>go - it should get even better in time.</li>
            <li>make sure you register on line or mail in the registration card</li>
            <li>Cleaining is a snap and re-confirms how glad I am to have passed on the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using King Of Shaves gel and the results have been outstanding.</li>
            <li>The best prices for either are big surprise, on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fully charged Philips gave me more than 10.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Panasonic Wet/Dry Shavers over the years as I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the ability to shave in the shower with their shavers.</li>
            <li>:- )I then turn on the shaver&#x27;s 20-second ultrasonic cleaning mode.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Even better than my ES-LA63-S $129.00.</li>
            <li>I believe Panasonic wishes to keep people safe regardless of circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could have gone for a much cheaper device, but this device got tons of great reviews, so I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>a much better jobin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but</li>
            <li>If I had to purchase again I would definately look for a better charging set up</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think there is a need for so many blades.</li>
            <li>However for an electric shaver with a $500 MSRP many customers would expect a leather case and a cleaning brush to be included...if they were included I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 months and am glad I got it</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I will ever buy another shaving device because of how much I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can trust anyone, you can surely trust a Sailor about this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it could survive a fall off the counter top</li>
            <li>The Norelco was slightly better.</li>
            <li>The shaver still does an OK job but needs to be recharged every 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li>Think twice about spending more than $100 on a shaver these days.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shave!</li>
            <li>Might make him shave more than 1 or twice a week.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I am hapy to pay more for the quality shave I get.</li>
            <li>Product better than advertised.</li>
            <li>Works better then</li>
            <li>Better than than my Braun 9595.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>But not with this one!&lt;br /&gt;First I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the shaver ever as it still gave me some of red skin.</li>
            <li>And it works like magic for more then 2 years now!&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li>i sure it saves my time.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer said that the LV61 gave him a better shave than the 790cc.  </li>
            <li>Since the day I started shaving with this, I&#x27;ve been waiting to get a better experience.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Phillips rotary</li>
            <li>I now others paid more and I probably would as well.</li>
            <li>Shave is the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and notably better than the Brauns (Series 5)</li>
            <li>I reviewed shavers on the web, and this was the top rated, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>This shaving system is one of those things for sure.</li>
            <li>25% better than Braun 7 Series.</li>
            <li>Great product, shaves very close, takes me about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Like having a Japanese Rolls Royce and you will have it for years so why not buy the best</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for most times</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m well satisfied with this model and expect to have if for some time.  </li>
            <li>write this review having just shaved for the first time with the LV61 and let me tell you it is the smoothest shave I have ever had in my life (Including razor) !!!</li>
            <li>At first, the foil head seemed huge but with the pivoting feature, it feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>Well first of all I have to admit that I ordered this nice, nice razor for my husband.  </li>
            <li>I get a nice clean shave in faster time then</li>
            <li>I can easily compare it to a fresh good razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This razor performs smoothly around the curves of the face, gives a nice close shave, cleans easily, and holds its charge.  </li>
            <li>Best dry shave with an electric I have had... even better than my ES-LA63 which is my &amp;#34;shower shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Very clean shave</li>
            <li>Felt very smooth and easy to shave my beard.</li>
            <li>You pay more for it and the extras aren&#x27;t all that impressive, but when it comes down to shaving your face – this easily beats out what I own from Braun, Norelco, and Wahl.</li>
            <li>Unless this brakes within the next year, this shaver is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever had, superior to Braun or Philips.</li>
            <li>My Braun still didn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as I used to get with a razor, but it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to say that I made the right choice with this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any shaving cream or oil, and the shaver does an excellent job both in the shower and dry.</li>
            <li>Add in the fact that it&#x27;s the most COMFORTABLE shave I&#x27;ve ever had by a mile, and I&#x27;m OK with the cost.</li>
            <li>I get a nice, smooth, irritation free shave with this combination of shaver and shave cream.  </li>
            <li>Shaves nice and close with no irritation, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally I will use the &amp;#34;Williams Lectic Shave&amp;#34; I purchased at the sametime - excellent product paring, a smooth as silk combination.</li>
            <li>The quality has been great and digital display is nice feature to tell the amount of charge remaining.  </li>
            <li>This is very easy to clean by just holding it under running water while running for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>The LV61 is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean</li>
            <li>It gives me as close a shave as the blade razors use to and is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>This unit is very easy to clean, rinse it out about once a week, and use soap once a month.</li>
            <li>Very light feel and close smooth shave..</li>
            <li>this time I went ahead knowing that this was the top of the line in panasonic and that both braun and panasonic are fine products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a fine razor</li>
            <li>I just lay it in a safe place and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The result is a trimmer of perfect length and better than the other two models discussed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice stretching the skin to get the best shave, but overall, excellent shaver.  </li>
            <li>I shave wet using shaving cream which the people at Panasonic said provides the best shave.  </li>
            <li>, most comfortable razor you could hope for.  </li>
            <li>Why is hygene all the more important in an electric shaver ?  </li>
            <li>I am confident that after a 2-3 minute shave my face is smooth as can be.  </li>
            <li>And many hours after I have shaved, my skin remains smooth.  </li>
            <li>make sure you look for the electronic coupon when adding this product to your cart if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been great.</li>
            <li>Compared to the rotary shaver, the Panasonic produces some more noise, but it is not annoying.</li>
            <li>This method kept most of the irritation and razor bumps away, but I could never achieve that smooth, close shave I desired.</li>
            <li>every 2-3 weeks anyways, what good does sterilizing it that one time really offer?  </li>
            <li>very close shave and good procuct.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Both are excellent instruments; the ES8243 is a better value, but the 5-cutter ESLV61 does cut just slightly closer+faster than the ES8243.  </li>
            <li>Rotary shavers have never been able to offer me the kind of close shave that I have been able to get through this particular foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is great for travel, battery lasts a few days on the road, and I can clean up the 5 o’clock shadow on the fly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a shaver that cuts close and quick, the Panasonic is easily the best in that area – only a razor blade will get you a closer shave</li>
            <li>I liked the idea that you clean it with soap with special cleaning program.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is easily the very best.  </li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;cleaning is easy and cost saving</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t purchase Panasonic&#x27;s either and am extremely pleased with the way it stays clean.</li>
            <li>When shaving, it&#x27;s easy to place your thumb on the on/off switch and accidentally turn it off.</li>
            <li>Press the on/off button for 2 seconds or more and it goes into \\&quot;clean mode\\&quot; and starts cleaning itself.</li>
            <li>This shaver which has five blade systems is an easy go over once system which gets to the root of the beard very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It might provide more comfort to have that feature, but it wasn&#x27;t worth how much more it was, to me.</li>
            <li>The head also mounts an integrated trimmer which is easily locked into place by a selector mounted below.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning was easy.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Shaves as close as a blade very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is well balanced and charges very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It cost more but if it lasts a couple years it will be more than worth it.  </li>
            <li>It advertises that cleanup is easy and it is, just rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>It did eventually provide a smooth shave, but not as smooth as it used to, and with more irritation of the skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely easily and once that occurs</li>
            <li>This is easy to avoid if you don&#x27;t add pressure.</li>
            <li>easy use, easy to charge.</li>
            <li>Also, the beard lube cleaned off easily under running water.</li>
            <li>The charging time is very quick also.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is by far the best I have ever used, (rotary or straight).</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easily done.  </li>
            <li>My Braun Complete 360 shaver isn&#x27;t good for travel because of the elaborate cleaning system.</li>
            <li>In that sense, I would rate it four stars for head shaving because it really does a good job; my head is cue-ball smooth when I am done.</li>
            <li>I got it at a good price and so far I am really satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>By far the most superior electric foil razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver for a superior shave.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is selling a good shaver as a luxury high end</li>
            <li>I still expect this to be something special, the electrical connector should work better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a very solid choice in a razor, and if you can swallow the large up front cost it should provide you many years of a great shaving experience!</li>
            <li>I liked the Braun Series 3, it provided a pretty close shave</li>
            <li>My beard is a challenge for anything I&#x27;ve tried (short of a sharpened rock), but this shaver does a beautiful job without breaking a sweat.</li>
            <li>Whilst this is the first time I have used a foil shaver, I am amazed at how effective this shaver is.</li>
            <li>The overall construction of the shaver is quite good and sturdy (accidentally dropped it once in the sink) though overall i&#x27;m just not that impressed.</li>
            <li>and I must say that everything I read about this shaver is true and I am really enjoying the close</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth; no pulls, and while I have to run over a patch of bristle more than once, my razor shave with hot foam or gel did not do the job as well.</li>
            <li>Also the most comfortable and easiest to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Braun 790cc - Hands down was the best electric razor I ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still hands down the best electric I have ever used</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still hands down the best electric I have ever used</li>
            <li>The LV61 is, hands down, the best of the Panasonics I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>After each shave I clean the razor by taking the head off and using an air can to clean out all of the shavings, it has worked pretty good for me this way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many electric razors over the years (most recently Braun&#x27;s), and this razor is BY FAR the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I had a new replacement screen and blade set for my Arc 3, I installed them to make the comparison fair.  </li>
            <li>However all was fine.  </li>
            <li>Awesome shaver, shaves close, quickly, no cuts or burns.</li>
            <li>But, typically, if I have an appointment or engagement that requires me to look my best, I will go with the razor.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m not a serial reviewer or anything, but I as a sufferer of shaving for most of my life I had to say this is the Grand Father Lord of all electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>and it works fine and continues to shave</li>
            <li>and it works fine and continues to shave</li>
            <li>Fine hair issue gone.</li>
            <li>The shaver does just fine in those areas.  </li>
            <li>shaver is light and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic replaced the unit under warranty, and the foil has been fine for the six months since then.  </li>
            <li>This may work fine on peach fuzz or if you have fine frog hair and you shave every morning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but this is one fine shaver.</li>
            <li>Excellent product was previously using a Braun &amp; Philips Arcitec shaver.</li>
            <li>the Arc 4 ES-LA-63 and 93 and shaves more quickly.</li>
            <li>I would urge you to never buy a can of edge, or for that matter most any shave cream that&#x27;s sold in super markets and drug stores.</li>
            <li>I would urge you to never buy a can of edge, or for that matter most any shave cream that&#x27;s sold in super markets and drug stores.</li>
            <li>Another thing worth mentioning is that head gets kind of hot, which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>So far he is impressed with his new shaver.</li>
            <li>Maybe, if you have to have the latest and greatest, but it seems to give the same results as my ES8243A did when it had new blades, and it&#x27;s about twice the price.</li>
            <li>The best thing about the new 5-blade Panasonic is that it indeed provides a better shave than my prior Panasonic!!!</li>
            <li>Yes, but it certainly lives up to its claims and provides an amazing shave.  </li>
            <li>The battery is also a huge improvement, with the four head getting just over 4 shaves compared to the five blades 7+...</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this shaver does!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ve tried almost every shaver from the Braun 7 series to the old 4 blade panasonic to the philips norelco 3d.</li>
            <li>The LED light on this newer model is brighter, so I can see it clearly even in a brightly lit room.</li>
            <li>It is a huge improvement over the ES8066.  </li>
            <li>Nothing too huge</li>
            <li>I was blown away by how fabulous this razor is.  </li>
            <li>It trims so well and leaves my legs so smooth.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- Close and Comfortable Shave</li>
            <li>shaver is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>did they cut as smooth as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Not that great doesn&#x27;t shave that well have to go over an over the same spot</li>
            <li>-- Another important thing is to dual voltage operability if you travel to Asia/Europe and this shaver can work with dual voltages  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Fantastic electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>always feels smooth.    </li>
            <li>Light, and battery lasts for weeks on a charge.</li>
            <li>The shave with Panasonic is extremely smooth and close</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower using Nivea shaving cream and it is a smooth as silk shave.</li>
            <li>Panasonic has reached the level of the blade with protection of one&#x27;s skin thus achieving a close and comfortable shave.   </li>
            <li>My face comes out baby smooth.</li>
            <li>When I spend this kind of money, I absolutely expect to be in awe over the presentation.</li>
            <li>It delivers a close smooth shave all over my face.</li>
            <li>On the one hand it works for places like sideburns and light mustache trimming.</li>
            <li>If you buy something you&#x27;re going to use everyday, why not get the best?</li>
            <li>on a blood thinner, it is important that I do not cut myself shaving.</li>
            <li>but still need a blade to make it really smooth.</li>
            <li>Before using the Panasonic LV61 electric shaver, I never thought that an electric shaver can give a smooth and close shave as a razor.</li>
            <li>The body is finished in a 3/4 slip-resistant &amp; fingerprint resistant material, which is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>The body is also contoured for a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li>I feel as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s posterior.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and purchase those cheap $4 razors....</li>
            <li>By far the best after a Braun 7505 (former favorite) and a Braun 8000 series flagship that dropped and cracked the head.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Arc 5 electric shaver provides a close, irritation free shaving experience, and has an efficient and convenient sonic cleaning mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but I still have difficulty in attaining a smooth shave in one area of stubborn growth.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the quicker description; however (again, in my case), my Arc 3 was never as smooth or as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>woulnt fit the Panasonic charger</li>
            <li>Enjoy using this shaver.....</li>
            <li>skin is smooth to the touch with no stubble at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;important is TOO free because it&#x60;s not well damped.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>after about a week my face is as smooth as a babys bottom.  </li>
            <li>smooth, close shave</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a smooth finish at all.</li>
            <li>but my chin is as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>smooth operation - no snagging or pulling</li>
            <li>overall, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>the question is would I have paid for this if it didn&#x27;t come to me for free as part of the Vine programs, knowing what I know now?</li>
            <li>The shaver felt almost too light when I started using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a great fan of Panasonic razors and have been one for several years.  </li>
            <li>The shaves are always smooth and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as easy to clean the razor itself.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had purchased the shaver on Amazon and still had the purchase acknowledgment in my email files.  </li>
            <li>Every place is baby smooth after shave.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen is available here on Amazon ([[ASIN:B003NGN3A2</li>
            <li>I bought this one after 3.5 years of great service from the earlier gen LA93 Arc4.</li>
            <li>B00B6A8JQA Aveeno Men&#x27;s Shave Gel, Fragrance Free, 7 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li>Ditch the cheap shavers, ditch the razors, get the Arc V.</li>
            <li>With tis shaver you get a cheap plug that goes into the bottom.</li>
            <li>ES-LV61 seems to cut the stubble below the skin level and the result is a baby skin smooth shave which still feels smooth by lunch.  </li>
            <li>Washing is easy and they recommend a bit of liquid hand soap to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, does not require a cleaning station.</li>
            <li>Smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>the cheap ones that you get from Walmart</li>
            <li>Have been using the LV61 for several weeks and the results have been great.  </li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and had no tugging or scraping.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that today&#x27;s generation has Li-Ion batteries to keep up with current technology!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and to take care of.</li>
            <li>It sound like my neighbor is using his chainsaw.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a shave on a cheap budget you  will probably be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Cheap soap costs too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>-&lt;br /&gt;-Fast, smooth, and comfortable</li>
            <li>life isn&#x27;t very impressive, I find myself charging it every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It glides comfortably and is not too noisy.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I took out a Square Trade warranty when I purchased the shaver, and they are reimbursing me for the cost of the item without any hassle at all.</li>
            <li>The skin felt smooth afterwards and was not irritated.</li>
            <li>Smooth and close with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I have a light beard.  </li>
            <li>thay gave me a good close shave and have always lasted 5 or more years with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>many, many years ago when they first came out and indeed that is a great shaver with a really long battery life.  </li>
            <li>Amazing tool!!!!!!! Feel like the guy who&#x27;s had his head in the sand and finally caught up to modern day technology.</li>
            <li>It shaved almost as close as a blade with no irritation, way superior to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition and 2 days early.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Those are better at touching up hair around the ears and curly whiskers close to sideburns where the whole head can&#x27;t pass over them.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, this shaver is great for head shaving too, and the larger head actually makes the shaver ideal for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Pour in some liquid hand soap right in the top and it gives itself a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I just need some more usage to get the right hold.</li>
            <li>The LED display is very bright, and easy to read, even in a pitch black room.  </li>
            <li>- the lock is actually very useful during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Panasonic should have taken a page from so many other luxury product makers and created a beautiful box worthy of this price.</li>
            <li>Clean, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This really gives you a nice clean close shave.</li>
            <li>I have had other Panasonic models before but this one is just incredible, it is almost as close as a razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely THRILLED with my new ARC 5 shaver!</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver, very smooth and still adjusting to reaching all areas on my face.</li>
            <li>There are some great features - it is wet/dry so you can use it wherever, the LCD screen gives you detailed info about how charged it is, how long you&#x27;ve used it, etc.  </li>
            <li>The shave is quick and easy, and the result is even smoother than after a blade shave.</li>
            <li>Nice follow up to the older model.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy shaving.</li>
            <li>The cleaning procedure was easy, and much better than getting the large bulky canisters with the alcohol soak.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>but it certainly does an awesome job dry.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the very best shaving experience I have have had shavers from Philips and Braun, but this takes my shaving experience to  a new level.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and shaving with this shaver is quick and leaves you clean</li>
            <li>have always received great shaves from the ES-LT41 and the ES-RT51, but the shaves I am now get from this ES-LV61 are significantly better and take less time.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how they keep improving this product but very happy with it.</li>
            <li>got it for same price of top Arc4 with cleaning station, but thought 5 cutters are better plus the better balance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Original post:</li>
            <li>######## I originally put this as a comment, but pasting it here since it&#x27;s applicable ########3  Replacement Foil and Blades report:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  </li>
            <li>I emailed them a copy of my original receipt from Amazon and my serial #&#x27;s &amp; case #&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>When the Braun system is $200 and generally does a good job, the Panasonic seems overpriced.</li>
            <li>When the Braun system is $200 and generally does a good job, the Panasonic seems overpriced.</li>
            <li>Nothing revolutionary in my mind, but it is effective, and most likely the closest electric shave available.  </li>
            <li>How rare is that!?</li>
            <li>I got a remarkably closer shave everywhere on my face but especially so under my chin and jaw.  </li>
            <li>Strong, powerful, quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And powerful, as well!</li>
            <li>I never seen him this excited he said it worked like knife on butter.</li>
            <li>I still needed another pass with a small foil Wahl, as the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t function at its best when used sideways-</li>
            <li>This one is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever used which is a LOT better.  </li>
            <li>The first time I took of the top off to rinse it out, I accidentally popped out one of the foils out of the head.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaver about which I can safely say: yes, it DOES shave as close or closer than a Gillette.</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed, this razor is like driving a luxury automobile.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the LV61 so far.</li>
            <li>It provides a quick, fast, comfortable shave and is very easy to clean even without the optional cleaning accessory.  </li>
            <li>It was also easy to maintain with the easy cleaning method using hand soap and hot water from your faucet.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic is light weight, gives a much closer shave than the Braun 799 and a much much more friendly experience than the Norelco 9300 (see their reviews).</li>
            <li>It also helps to keep the shaver in like new condition and smelling quite nice.</li>
            <li>I thought the large head on the LV-61 would be a problem, but the shaver is light, is very comfortable to hold and the head size actually feels good against my head, face and neck.</li>
            <li>This is my third Panasonic linear shaver and it is by far the best.</li>
            <li>To Clean&lt;br /&gt;You can easily clean the shaver by rinsing it under tap water while it is running.</li>
            <li>Plus, you can clean it with liquid soap and water and also shave with water and shaving cream if you prefer.</li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic I own and love them.  </li>
            <li>It does cut cleanly and to the skin but does not cut neck hair that well at all.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this would have the facility to clean and charge as well,it did not</li>
            <li>There is an illuminated LCD display on the front that lets you know battery status, the length of your shave, when to clean the shaver heads, when to replace the shaver heads, and when the sonic cleaning mode is activated.  </li>
            <li>I would just buy the razor and clean it with water after each use, or once a week.</li>
            <li>and it is way easier to clean</li>
            <li>I guess you have to clean it with water as the instructions say.</li>
            <li>That said, it works like a charm and amazon is directly responsible for the tremendous joy of enjoying it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>to clean with liquid soap under running water&lt;br /&gt;-Ultra</li>
            <li>You use liquid soap and the \\&quot;clean mode\\&quot; to buzz it clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through several and this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s soap based and unlike the alcohol based Braun Clean &amp; renew it causes buildup and doesn&#x27;t strip the blades clean.</li>
            <li>All you need is a drop, press for sonic clean (keep the foil on) rinse and viola</li>
            <li>All you need is a drop, press for sonic clean (keep the foil on) rinse and viola</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>This one has a five blade system thus giving a very close shave and also much quieter noise and vibration wise.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;- Bright blue LED light, stays on while charging –</li>
            <li>Also, I found that I could clean the razor just as well myself by applying some liquid soap and running it under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was replacing my old Panasonic shaver ES8003, which I had for ten years and was excellent.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t do a clean job if you want to trim around your beard or sideburns.</li>
            <li>It just trims it but do NOT perform a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>If you wanted to clean something, would you keep a cup of hairy soapy water to rinse it with for a month?</li>
            <li>a winner,easy clean and a close shave.....</li>
            <li>I need to use razor to clean that area.</li>
            <li>Looks fantastic, runs fantastic, charges quick, 1 hour battery, on-button lock, trimmer, multi-adjustable head, super close shave...</li>
            <li>I switched to blades for a few years and loved the nice close shave feeling...until my wife figured out</li>
            <li>Good quality , clean shave , easy to clean and long</li>
            <li>Plus for while not being the ultimate machine it pretty much beats the competition in what it does best.</li>
            <li>I keep believing that half points pinpoint products more accurately than whole points for as I was saying earlier a Toyota Camry very much so would deserve a 4 Stars if it is every bit as good as the slogan that it is the best selling vehicle in its class</li>
            <li>You can be just as luxurious in the Mercedes and be perfectly content, but when you want fine-attention to detail, slight improvements here and there, elegance, a nice solid feel, you splurge, sometimes twice the price of a Mercedes, so that you can roll around in style - the Rolls-Royce!    </li>
            <li>Like a fine luxury car, it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use - nice comfortable hold &amp; quiet in running.</li>
            <li>Specially if you have a rough/hard beard.  </li>
            <li>The razor fits fine, but good luck with the power cord if you&#x27;re going on a long trip.  </li>
            <li>under my jaw and neck could have been a bit better (Still very smooth), and would be, had I spent more time shaving those areas...</li>
            <li>In fact, it does as great job as my razors -- and the mild irritation that such close shave typically brings: that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li>This is the best model I&#x27;ve owned so far and easily beats out shavers I&#x27;ve tried from other manufacturers.</li>
            <li>I was quite sceptical at first since all my life I used good old blades.</li>
            <li>Works great with a wet beard also.</li>
            <li>The shave is great, not much better than the Arc 4, but better.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, better than the Braun 760</li>
            <li>Still, it was good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>and I got a good one on this 170$ including international shipping.</li>
            <li>It also has a feature where you can charge it for 10 minutes and then get in a full shave.</li>
            <li>It has always been my experience that shavers, no matter how good, can never quite give you the same shave as a razor.</li>
            <li>Trying to remember my chin-stubble test for when my LA63 was brand-new, I think both are very close and still better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>The price on the LV61 (about $150 recently) was too good to pass-up.  </li>
            <li>and it holds a charge for almost a full week.  </li>
            <li>Is it really THAT much better than the four head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid, good looking razor.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Control wise the shaver is very simple.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve had several but none have been as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>Really close shave, much better than the rotary style shavers.  </li>
            <li>And I wasn&#x27;t sure if it made sense to spend as much as the Panasonic</li>
            <li>I have not used my razor for a full month</li>
            <li>This shaver reminds me a whole lot to their top of the line that come with the cleaning system as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;-Well-balanced, solid feel - good ergonomics&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-1 hr to full charge</li>
            <li>If I had to pay full price now, I would do it.  </li>
            <li>In the interests of full disclosure, I received this item through Amazon Vine.</li>
            <li>for I think this is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.   </li>
            <li>Norelco&#x27;s 45 day grace period is more reasonable.</li>
            <li>I am a true Braun user since the Eltron days.  </li>
            <li>The regular tap-water rinse is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s true that it takes between 3 and 4 weeks for your skin to get used to the razor, and</li>
            <li>The box comes with the razor of course, a manual, charger, nice quality soft carrying case and a plastic head protector.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s true that it takes between 3 and 4 weeks for your skin to get used to the razor, and</li>
            <li>The box comes with the razor of course, a manual, charger, nice quality soft carrying case and a plastic head protector.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery showed a full charge but the motor would not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, instead, they were going to send me a full refund of my purchase price.  </li>
            <li>The display is really helpful as it gives you the percent of battery life remaining as well as how many minutes and seconds</li>
            <li>like I said for this much money they should have a better system.</li>
            <li>my last Panasonic was good</li>
            <li>The Panasonic gives the absolute closest shave I have ever had in my life, the shave process feels more like</li>
            <li>Much closer and better then</li>
            <li>then tried the 4 blade Panasonic, liked the shave, tried it in the shower, didn&#x27;t help more, so I used it dry.</li>
            <li>is what I do and what works the best for me: only shave in shower, put some liquid soap on your face and then shave with slow moves touching your skin very lightly.</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to use and has a lot of motion.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high but it is definitely worth every buck and most importantly...</li>
            <li>I think that the nano sharp blades that move at the faster speed have combined to make this a great product.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is great and since 2010 I&#x27;m not using any other type of razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many shavers over the years, a majority of them by Remington, most recently Braun.  </li>
            <li>very well designed, solid and fits great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit</li>
            <li>Many have come close and are more than sufficient for my daily shaving needs.</li>
            <li>On the plus side:  It charges quickly.</li>
            <li>: very close shave and fast, nice trimmer that works well</li>
            <li>Panasonic has decent warranty service, but it is still a hassle and will probably take a month or more.  </li>
            <li>I read some concerns about the sound being loud but shaving in the shower negates most of it.</li>
            <li>Excellent electric razor - love the larger screen area than my previous razor had</li>
            <li>Super quality construction in all areas.</li>
            <li>As I said the shave with this is quick</li>
            <li>Well at the time 1-2 years ago he bought the best and most expensive Braun shaver that could find in the store.</li>
            <li>am getting the best shave ever above my upper lip...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve primarily been a manual shaver man most of my life, bouncing from the early Mach 3s, to Remingtons, and then my trusty Fusion.  </li>
            <li>A quick 5-10 minute charge will get you maybe 1-2 shaves.  </li>
            <li>It does, however, seem to charge relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>shaver has a rubber back and a nicely shaped handle that makes shaving comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It trims my sideburns quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Close, fast shave Easy to clean  Cons:</li>
            <li>So much better than my older Braun.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied but could be better.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different electric razors in many price ranges.  </li>
            <li>This one is not the top selection on the distinguished Panasonic line up but seems to share the same components of their more costly siblings.</li>
            <li>The battery charges reasonably quickly, about one hour and lasts for 20 shaves or so.  </li>
            <li>The great feature of this of course is that this supports wet shave, which is particularly useful for this shaver.</li>
            <li>&gt;* 5 minute quick charge&lt;br</li>
            <li>I particularly like being able to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and you run out of power – luckily it quick-charges in emergencies</li>
            <li>The way this shaver adjusts to facial contours is great and the shave is so gentle.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the mornings when I am in a hurry and need a quick shave</li>
            <li>I had - smooth shave, fast and comfortable</li>
            <li>and how quickly it did.</li>
            <li>shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be cleaned quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Pivoting head and built in trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>At the end we find the shaver perfect for my sensitive skin , no hard work , not very noisy and very light .&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>it is so close and very easy on sensitive skin wih ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I did read reviews (like this one), and found it received a high number of reviews like mine, so went ahead and bought it, and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Myself I am not yet sure if I will continue to use this or return to my high end rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>far as electric razors go this is a decent unit but can&#x27;t rate it higher since there are flaws, and it just isn&#x27;t that great of a shave when compared to a razor blade.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied overall with this shaver.</li>
            <li>would recommend staying with a normal shaver :)</li>
            <li>With the Panasonic, come 5:00, my skin is still pretty smooth with almost no stubble.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded from my Arc4 when it finally stopped working and am very pleased with the Arc5.</li>
            <li>It was comfortable on my face from the first day of use.</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d buy an electric razor that would be better than a normal disposable safety razor.</li>
            <li>The fact that I no longer have to worry about slicing a sweet two-inch layer of skin off my scalp any given morning (which is what prompted my purchase to begin with) makes using electric shavers worth the aggravation.</li>
            <li>The stubble that remained was almost equivalent to a full day&#x27;s worth of growth.</li>
            <li>Quick easy and fast ....</li>
            <li>highly recommend Aveeno Men&#x27;s Shave Gel, Fragrance Free, 7 oz available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>One other thing I liked was that the shaver was easy to clean.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re almost better off buying a new, cheaper shaver every year.</li>
            <li>Also a set of blades cost more than a brand new Norelco shaver</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and use and charges fast.</li>
            <li>a cool, comfortable straight razor, Barber shop quality</li>
            <li>It is easy on my skin, with a dab of lotion my skin looks good – same old face!  </li>
            <li>While I ordinarily never pass up any gadget, I get a better result with the hand soap.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a reason for the hot towels, the shaving brush and the rich dense creams.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a reason for the hot towels, the shaving brush and the rich dense creams.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed, most of my cons are also problems with other razors – it&#x27;s a bit nit-picky, but considering the higher cost I hold it to a higher standard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be short... Could not be better!</li>
            <li>Really nice, I had a previous model with 3 cutters, but this is much better.</li>
            <li>I tried a Braun foil.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning method as described in so many of the comments for this shaver is as everyone says: very simple, very quick:</li>
            <li>But if I shaved after a 2-3 period, this shaver did a very good job at nailing down the growth to a smooth shave with minimal burn, better than the norelco.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to dry off afterwards and theunreachable dries easily sitting on the shelf in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I like how fast I can get a quick shave – not the smoothest – but good enough for work.</li>
            <li>but I reckon if it does the job well for which it was designed that should be the primary yardstick and this one certainly measures</li>
            <li>+ minutes to get a decent shave with my old shaver, depending on how long it had been since I&#x27;d cleaned it, this one gives me a superb shave in 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>An investment in a good electric shaver really pays over time - no price is small to wake up each day in the morning, get a clean shave in a minute or two and walk out confidently.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately with the sale, I was able to get one at just a little more than a 4 blade cost.</li>
            <li>that will save money and time on cleaining and keep it in good shape for future.&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed at all, this beast took me less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li>For the year it works, the shave is fantastic- bought it based on recommendations on here- handled my problem shaving areas very well.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, smooth skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>Performance definitely a step up from my old Braun, smooth comfortable and close shave with no tugging experienced so far.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades shave very closely, and the freely pivoting head help keep them in close contact with your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Only issue that you will feel its huge to use under the neck, but at last I can go to work fully shaved :)</li>
            <li>The thing that kept me from giving it up was that the areas it did cut, were very close and smooth.  </li>
            <li>free, non-irritating, absolutely closest shave you will ever experience in your life.</li>
            <li>This shaver works great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and fast.  </li>
            <li>The shave is worth 5 stars, but the price compared to the Arc4 shavers led me to give it a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li>Plus, a couple reviewers said it was worth the upgrade.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>, I feel it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have primarily used Norelco (Philips) and Braun products, but recently was able to use one of the Panasonic shavers (the ES-LA63-S).</li>
            <li>Reading those comments from others made me laugh before I received the razor.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li>One nice improvement is that there&#x27;s a \\&quot;lock-ring\\&quot; for the power button such that it prevents the shaver from accidentally turning on if you shove it in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>get so far around a weeks worth of shave or more before I recharge.</li>
            <li>, I love it so far (2 days).</li>
            <li>This model is a clear improvement and a clear step towards the best possible shave!</li>
            <li>but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>But is it really worth $500?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The value equation, is it really worth $500?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The value equation, is it really worth $500?</li>
            <li>razor may career a hefty price tag, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>Remember the old adage that an electric shaver will never be able to replicate the results of a manual blade or razor?  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works no differently, and I was able to get a smooth trim on my sideburns.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps more troubling is its face shaving capability (or lack thereof), which when you think about it, makes no sense because it was designed for the face rather than the scalp as far as I know.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with a Panasonic ES8228 shaver that was 4 years old and 2 blade shaver did a better job on my neck..</li>
            <li>well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good, but not what I expected for the price I pay.</li>
            <li>He loved it so much that I bought a second one for my husband.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the price?  </li>
            <li>The head is not too big and it fits nice in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money invested.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>most in a shaver is a head that pivots from front to back as I find that necessary to do a good job on my neck and jawline.</li>
            <li>I sometimes cannot tell the difference in shave closeness between this and the LV61-A, although the latter is definitely more comfortable in terms of smoothness.</li>
            <li>This is good for anyone in the military.</li>
            <li>I can only report my own findings, based on my application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to clean, but needs frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li>The three heads of the Norelco cover more area than the rectangular head of the Panasonic, but this isn&#x27;t really an advantage in real life.</li>
            <li>And it will put a smile on your face.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>My biggest issue that I still have with the shaver is that it requires a lot of cleaning, much more frequently then the sensor states.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pending that, I can say this purchase was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the difference in price is worth having this one versus the 4 blade since I have not used that one.  </li>
            <li>Rather than gliding across my skin and taking the stubble off all in one pass, it dragged and skipped across my skin, pulling on but not cutting the stubble.  </li>
            <li>Much like a straight blade or safety razor, let the weight do most of the work.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the extra $100 bucks - not for me, cleaning systems come with their own set of problems and added</li>
            <li>it was worth a shot</li>
            <li>it was worth a shot</li>
            <li>As mentioned in my initial review, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if the replacement shaver is also covered by a fresh 2 year warranty?</li>
            <li>This last one was good but it just caused way too much irritation.</li>
            <li>Three more are driven by two clips that are attached directly to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the close shave.</li>
            <li>LED screen is useful, keeping track of shave time and battery life</li>
            <li>The Braun was good but not perfect and was as good as I thought I could get UNTIL this Panasonic came along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Its pricy but worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost of either shaver is well worth the price and the investment.  </li>
            <li>and I had 2 day&#x27;s worth of stubble to deal with.  </li>
            <li>but you get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Maybe worth $20-25.&lt;br /&gt;  2.</li>
            <li>, as surprised as I am to admit it, if you upgrade from an Arc 4 you are going to love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have actually completely stopped using my manual razor now which is great because the entire shaving process before took almost 10 minutes when using a manual razor.</li>
            <li>Got it on sale for $150--and worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the faster the foil vibrates, the more efficient it is in giving a clean shave on the very first run and this is currently the fastest in the market  Comparison to Braun  :</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;ve used Braun dry shavers for many years and was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to not put your hand or finger on that button while using the razor (when the on / off switch is pressed for too long, the razor goes into clean mode).</li>
            <li>Other Good features  :</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>About once per year is the right time frame.</li>
            <li>About once per year is the right time frame.</li>
            <li>older four head model did the same in nearly seven minutes, and I thought that was good!</li>
            <li>I bought this razor about a year ago, mainly because I liked that you can clean it regularly with some soap and water.</li>
            <li>Note: I MUST clean it daily, it is quick and easy, but every day.</li>
            <li>Clean up with soap and water is a real advantage.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I cannot get a clean face shave no matter how much time I spend.</li>
            <li>An upgrade from KOS would be the British - Taylors Of Old Bond Street, one of the densist creams there are, the formula hasn&#x27;t changed in hundreds of years - it&#x27;s a remarkable product.</li>
            <li>An upgrade from KOS would be the British - Taylors Of Old Bond Street, one of the densist creams there are, the formula hasn&#x27;t changed in hundreds of years - it&#x27;s a remarkable product.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very expensive, but I wanted the best and I love Panasonic equipment</li>
            <li>If you want to stop this movement, however, you can engage the head lock button and get full concentration on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The flip side of this missing feature, happily, is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re thinking of plunking down $500 for a shaver, you may think that you&#x27;ll get something that plays music and provides a back massage in addition to an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>I really like the new design because it helps to get more stubble on the \\&quot;up\\&quot; stroke than my 4-blade Panasonic ES-LA63-S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above, I think that Panasonic delivers some seriously good shavers and sometimes when brand new, their prices seem to attest to that fact.</li>
            <li>The shaver head is very large and almost seems like overkill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for three months but am not concerned about the longevity since my previous Panasonic performed flawlessly for a couple years.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Shaving both wet and dry is excellent.</li>
            <li>I had been using Philips SensoTouch 3D 1260X for about 2 years before, and was more or less satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>The handle feels solid, strong and comfortable.</li>
            <li>You wonder if it&#x27;s worth the higher price tag?</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to experiment on what works for you, but generally I&#x27;ve found that the simpler the better.  </li>
            <li>Another great plus is that there are no more cleaner cartridges to buy.</li>
            <li>Wet shaving is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I normally use blades (Mach 3), which are comfortable and shave close.  </li>
            <li>Shaves barely any better than my ES8259.</li>
            <li>Mostly because I&#x27;ve always had to use a regular razor to tidy up the neck, since there was always hair and stubble left there.  </li>
            <li>great item, use it everyday, in our household!</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, this model is worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are not RAZOR SHARP and does not perform as good as a razor but the results are really consistent and even...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t sit on the fence with this one, it&#x27;s the best electric, wet dry shaver you can get at any price, just buy it!</li>
            <li>I began looking for a new razor and was worried at first as I had used a rotary style unit my entire life but the Panasonic foil units got some really good reviews.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a quick and easy to use system that in the long run will save you money.  </li>
            <li>The new Panasonic with five blades is easier to shave with than the Braun, but not by a huge margin.</li>
            <li>the Panasonic does the right job and does it consistently...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 10 times better dry shave than the Braun and the wet shave is the best I have ever had outside of a barber shop.</li>
            <li>A wide array of five blades makes it challenging to smoothly shave under the nose or under the ear at the jaw line.</li>
            <li>That shaver had its own quality issues, but I am reminded that it actually provides a much closer shave for me than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>upper level units are far superior.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver overall, it is a bit spendy but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>This model has a huge head that pivots freely from front to back and side to side.</li>
            <li>The next time I used the shaver I noticed it did a good job of of sucking up the shaving gel which clogs up the foil which I expect is finer than my old shaver.</li>
            <li>Super fast charge.</li>
            <li>Then I spray USkincare Damask Rose Hydrosol Regenerating Toner on my face and neck, tap my face with my fingertips to spread the toner, and let it dry for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>He just started using it and says it gives him a nice close shave, even using dry.</li>
            <li>these areas, but this shaver required repeated passes to do a complete job, one which was handled easily by the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I never thought that increasing my pay out for a shaving device would actually help, but it really, really did.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver at a good time, my old one was starting to nick and show signs of wear.</li>
            <li>you have a light to average beard or are simply satisfied with a good but not spectacular shave at a reasonable cost, IMHO you don&#x27;t need more than the 8103S.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the overall battery life as I&#x27;m able to get about an hours worth of shaving time out of one charge and the recharge time is pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>The LV61 is the first electric shaver that I can honestly say shaves difficult areas as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li>The first shave I did with this was dry, and it was fairly amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;very very very close shaving&lt;</li>
            <li>and therefore you aren&#x27;t using very much electricity hence the longer charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not completely annoying, but if you shave in the same room that the wife/girlfriend is sleeping in, they will most likely get woken up by the sound.  </li>
            <li>Fast, easy to clean under the faucet, gives a close, comfortable shave and rivals a blade razor when used wet with a shaving gel which is my preferred way to shave</li>
            <li>in 30s both the outside and the inside are clean like new - that is easier even than cleaning my dry/wet Norelco as the sonic motion and liquid soap made it simpler.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend! :)</li>
            <li>My three year old Panasonic electric shaver finally gave up and I started a new search for a great wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>Dry, the shave was not any better than my more than 6 year old Braun with worn cutter.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products from safety razors, cheap electric razors and of course the pro glide, mach 3 etc</li>
            <li>For example, with the Norelco it would take about 12 minutes to get a full, decent shave.  </li>
            <li>It was also good to be able to use wet or dry.</li>
            <li>This gets just as close and is easy on the skin and such a quick shave</li>
            <li>The rotary was always king of getting those hardy little buggers, but this one&#x27;s pretty good, too.</li>
            <li>(I prefer ELTRON to Remington&#x27;s version which leaves residue) on a heavy beard with some bristle that doesn&#x27;t grow perpendicular to my skin (IE: some grow flat atop the skin surface), now with a growing number of the tougher gray whiskers, and a close-cropped van-dyke (what most folks call a goatee).&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s maiden shearing was a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>The shaving head is huge and as a result I couldn&#x27;t get the hairs directly under my nose.</li>
            <li>My first Arc5 died during the warranty period</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver with shaving cream, and I&#x27;m amazed at the improvement.</li>
            <li>I have owned many and when the last one broke</li>
            <li>All problems have been while travelling where razor is not in the exact position</li>
            <li>I think shavers have passed their logical limit in number of blades.</li>
            <li>First shaver ever that has cut the hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>Judging myself as having a lighter stubble/beard growth pattern than most, you will likely want to replace your blades every 8-12 months for optimal shaving results.]    </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get so hot</li>
            <li>Also, as I own the cleaning unit version of the Arc 4 (ES LA-93) as well,  I can say with confidence,the Panasonic shavers come cleaner when you simply rinse them with hand soap and do the normal sonic cleaning routine.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay for the shipping and repair, but soon found out that the ES-RT51 (purchased from Amazon) was still under the two year warranty.</li>
            <li>I have been a big fan of Panasonic shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>This is the first high-end electric shaver that I bought.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver, worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought the top of the line to shave my husband, who needs personal care.</li>
            <li>It shaves consistently well.  </li>
            <li>the ESLV-61 was simply that much better.  </li>
            <li>First, some background.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t matter whether I shave in the shower or just splash some hot water on my face before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The front to back pivot is much better damped</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver because of its higher speed and additional blades.</li>
            <li>This is the first to deliver a close shave that allows me to toss my traditional razor which in he past I have kept for occasions where I&#x27;ve needed to look my best.</li>
            <li>It is my first experience&lt;</li>
            <li>Very pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I love everything about being Italian except  one thing -- that  never ending 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>skin is noticeably softer after my first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>I do not know exactly why</li>
            <li>too many to choose from, total baloney I say</li>
            <li>I took advantage of an Amazon sale last week and was able to get this LV61 for $150 even though my ES8243A was still working mechanically</li>
            <li>Had several razors over the years including top of the line Braun and most recently a Norelco Senso Touch 3D.  </li>
            <li>My first Panasonic.</li>
            <li>much are 70 hours worth to you?  </li>
            <li>Panasonic tells you to shave with a back and forth motion, rather than the rotary motion most electric shavers tell you to use.</li>
            <li>On pg.3 of the manual there is precaution about cleaning the shaver with hot water.</li>
            <li>Then I heat some water to 180º F while my shaving brush is soaking in hot water in the sink.</li>
            <li>But my skin seemed to adjust and after the first week</li>
            <li>Seeing my last attempts were rotary, I decided to give foil a chance to see if the results were any better.  </li>
            <li>This razor provides a close shave with no irritation, which for me is a first.  </li>
            <li>Shaving was much easier, and my skin was much smoother afterward, and stayed smooth for much longer into the day.  </li>
            <li>Panasonics may be a bit pricey, but the warranty support more than enough makes up for it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same spot (not as many times anyway)</li>
            <li>Pop off the cover, and just rinse everything with hot water.</li>
            <li>you most recently used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice rubbery grip, though I haven&#x27;t used it for wet shaving</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is my first Panasonic electric shaver</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver was an Arc 4 from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>all of the stellar reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as for the shaving performance, It&#x27;s been 4 days since my last shave and my face is literally baby-butt smooth!</li>
            <li>First Panasonic shaver purchased after Philips and Braun.</li>
            <li>You may want to tray a signal razor first as well and save some money.</li>
            <li>Price is higher</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it only takes 1 hour to recharge.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that the ES-LV61-A is the exact shame shaver as the ES-LV81-K.  </li>
            <li>Actualy, I use LV61 model for more than two years and this one i bought as a present for my father.</li>
            <li>I actually spend more time jamming this electric into my skin over and over to get the remaining whiskers than I would with the ritual</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ve been using different electric shavers for about 20 years (braun mostly), I gave it the time manual says.</li>
            <li>you have chance, try it first.</li>
            <li>Yes, the results will improve in time but first shaves will give an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expensive, but a great shave!</li>
            <li>The first hundred being the cost.</li>
            <li>Dual voltage, wet/dry, easy to clean, built-in display to tell you how much of a charge is left.</li>
            <li>If not for left over hair that it couldn&#x27;t get no matter how many passes I made I would go with this product.</li>
            <li>Finally fed up with the challenge of cleaning top of the line Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever posted.</li>
            <li>However, the foil ripped within a month of first purchasing it, and Panasonic refused to replace it under warranty, after first telling me they would.</li>
            <li>During the last years, I realized that the shave was not satisfactory any more, even though I replaced the rotary blades as recommended.</li>
            <li>As you know if you have used electric shavers before, this may be a first.  </li>
            <li>Again, maybe a first.  </li>
            <li>My prior favorite was the Panasonic Vortex ES 8109 and its nondocking relatives.</li>
            <li>This razor takes far fewer passes to leave a smooth face.</li>
            <li>The head on this model feels like it pivots better than the models with fewer blades: maybe it is the larger surface.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Really good everyday electric shaver, but</li>
            <li>Saving 10 solid minutes (maybe more) of shaving every single day for a better result, is indeed worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Excellent results, very smooth with no irritation, and does it every other day in three minutes or a bit less, although not as close under the chin  initially as a Norelco rotary.  </li>
            <li>new one feels better in the hands than my old one.  </li>
            <li>shave closr then previous rotary shaver and happy so far.</li>
            <li>Other reviews of less than perfect shaves may not have figured out the shaver needed more rinses during the shave to keep the foil open.</li>
            <li>The shave is pretty smooth for an electric razor, The brush and safety razor is a little closer and smoother, but I am satisfied with this Panasonic Electric Razor, I use a pre electric shave lotion, so my face is not irritated.</li>
            <li>Not with a $20 shaver or even the most expensive rotary shaver will you get this kind of a feeling - I can tell you from my own personal experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros: Easy to clean, holds charge for long time, charges fast, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I pretty much keep my beard most of the year and just shave under the neck daily.  </li>
            <li>Check out the other reviews and make up your own mind.  </li>
            <li>However, rather than being the shaver itself, it&#x27;s because I am, like I mentioned previously, skinny AND bony, but other than that, it&#x27;s and awesome shaver and</li>
            <li>I have not tried a wet shave yet, but it does clean up easy under the faucet.</li>
            <li>Lastly, a display screen with bright blue LED digits showsbattery life</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough for wet shaving with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>have owned a Braun 3 series for 5 years and never really felt the shaving performance was that great, especially when compared to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shaves extremly clean and clear.</li>
            <li>Comes with a Sonic vibrate cleaner which create a pulsating action when you hold it under water - it will clean the micro follicles in the shaver.  </li>
            <li>This panasonic is easily the most expensive,  but it does more than the job.  </li>
            <li>Dry feature is nice if you like to shave in the shower, but I do my shaving before I get in the shower, so I can&#x27;t really comment too much on that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it looks like it needs it, clean the razor under running water using an old toothbrush for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>today offer a charge to last for a couple of days, which is good enough.    </li>
            <li>The good news, the Panasonic website sells them and they are in the $15 arena (the foils are much more expensive, $60).</li>
            <li>The good news, the Panasonic website sells them and they are in the $15 arena (the foils are much more expensive, $60).</li>
            <li>The first feature you&#x27;ll notice about the Panasonic is the particularly strikingly large head, comprising 5-blades.  </li>
            <li>As I (and apparently others) have had less than an excellent experience with various electric razor washers, and as the Panasonic with the washer is $100 more (!)</li>
            <li>Thought it just might shave a little closer, but really all up I am very satisfied with my first Amazon purchase.  </li>
            <li>I agree with all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have read all the positive comments and I respect your opinions.</li>
            <li>[Small Update 10-8-2011: When you charge the 4-blade LA63 overnight, when it is done, it will brightly glow and blink \\&quot;100%\\&quot;</li>
            <li>my stubble is pretty reasonable.  </li>
            <li>but this is pretty much the elite of shavers.</li>
            <li>I am a blade and badger brush guy, and so I really debated shelling out the money to buy my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Basically, this thing shaves extremely well and is a real pleasure to own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s faster than all my other shavers, yet smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to spend this much money on an electric razor, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>The wet shave on the Braun is just as close as the Panasonic, and the much more compact head cuts closer to features like the nose and ears, and works better in the concave area under the back corners of the jaw.    </li>
            <li>After my first shave with this I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I was done shaving.</li>
            <li>If you can buy it as a lightning deal like I did then buying  this razor is pretty much a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li>I had it for 8 years this one cuts better, the battery charge not as long</li>
            <li>first electric razor and Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>And my wife confirmed the quality of the shave too!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be better to have a stand, but if I only need to charge for 1hr every 10days or so, it might be actually simpler to keep the cords in the drawer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not a bad idea to use the clear plastic cover for the foil and the travel case when the razor goes into carry on luggage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not a bad idea to use the clear plastic cover for the foil and the travel case when the razor goes into carry on luggage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is no better at providing a good say</li>
            <li>It just was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like times have changed and I am thrilled with this razor.  </li>
            <li>Even hours later, I can tell this razor was far superior compared to the old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On each side of the slit foil are the main shaver blocks which are&lt;br /&gt;fitted in traditional fashion to the top of the shaver inside.</li>
            <li>It does have issues with certain spots, like around the neck and adams apple, like pretty much all electric razors do.  </li>
            <li>I looked at Braun and Norelco, but finally realized I was pretty darn happy with my previous Panasonic, so why change?&lt;br</li>
            <li>of the four other electric razors I own, this one is pretty loud and it has a different tone to the buzz that I find more noticeable...</li>
            <li>This higher end model gives a very smooth shave, is not as rough on your skin, and is much faster.  </li>
            <li>For one, the five blade head is HUGE, and the body supporting it is also a bit larger than it&#x27;s four bladed counterpart.</li>
            <li>The case is actually a nice black leather soft-case with a plastic cap for the shaver head.  </li>
            <li>And, it is easily cleaned by simply running it under water with some liquid soap.</li>
            <li>The blades are encased in a head, which has an easily removable outer casing, which exposes the inner blades for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I was able to dry shave WITHOUT SKIN IRRITATION.  </li>
            <li>it is easy, and I prefer manually cleaning it than having to deal with those big bulky charger/</li>
            <li>For me, dry gives better results.</li>
            <li>I use it only with shaving cream and hot water, does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li>This thing does an outstanding job dry shaving and it feels as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>My last shaver was good but this one is quieter, faster,cleaner and holds a charge twice as long as it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li>* Hands down the most powerful motor there is at a whopping 14,000 CPM&lt;br</li>
            <li>The head, while large, doesn&#x60;t feel out of proportion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly the quietest.  </li>
            <li>This decision was purely driven by cost.</li>
            <li>Great Shaver, a bit weak on neck hairs..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, effective and considerate and worth the long term investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, effective and considerate and worth the long term investment.</li>
            <li>The ES-LV61 provides a great shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Not only is it incredibly easy to handle but the shave is very close.  </li>
            <li>a brief history, I used philips (series8) electric shaver for almost 3 years and it was fine</li>
            <li>Although the earlier models shaved pretty close, they always caused significant irritation and missed some spots on the neck area.  </li>
            <li>It has a easy clean  clean up just running under water and no necessary cleaning solutions required like other razors.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t dared try to see if the older one would work, not at these prices!    </li>
            <li>I guess I wish the razor came with a brush to help with cleaning, but luckily I had one from my previous razor that makes cleanup super quick.  </li>
            <li>even though it picks up most of your stubble, and shaves it baby smooth, there are still areas where it doesn&#x27;t quite get right down to your skin in certain areas, and you have to make several passes.</li>
            <li>prefer the braun which did not have a very smooth shave, but had options to adjust for sensitive skin and could be used daily with no skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes cleaning A LOT easier as opposed to prev model where it was not a flat surface and instead filled with nooks and crannies for stuff to accummulate.</li>
            <li>The rest of the shaver worked just fine, but I could no longer tell how much charge was left in the shaver.</li>
            <li>The wide large head is most noticeable when shaving under my nose or up to the edges of my sideburns, where I cannot get as close in either case.  </li>
            <li>Coming from a Braun shaver for the last 10 years, and a norelco before that, I will say this is a great little razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend saving yourself $100 and sticking with this LV61, because the integrated sonic vibration mode is more than sufficient to clean the shaver, unless, you&#x27;re really that lazy.  </li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, I&#x27;ve had many other shavers in the past but never really give too much thought with foil shaver</li>
            <li>My last shaver was the Norelco 8894 XL Spectra, also known as the James Bond Shaver, the last hefty, durable device made by Norelco (or anyone else), so I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to find another shaver anything like it ( I own two</li>
            <li>I ever bought myself…I highly recommend it to anyone willing to pay this much for a razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a fast and very close shave!</li>
            <li>I wondered if the large head would make shaving more difficult, but I find it helps smooth out the face to get a closer more complete shave.</li>
            <li>The digital displays provides you with an accurate reading of how much of a charge remains.  </li>
            <li>The shavers have constantly improved over the years in terms of battery life and closer, comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li>I have never found a product capable of getting all the hair</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit leery about spending that much on a razor, but seeing it&#x27;s something I use every day</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>, the Panasonic will shave as close as a blade shave and as fast as an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was fast, shaved close, and pain-free.</li>
            <li>Expecting much longer shaving time I didn&#x27;t want to go to a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave on my face.</li>
            <li>If you are graduating from a Gilette to this one - you will find that this is much easier to adapt to than a rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>You see the blades are so much close to your skin</li>
            <li>I have to say that Panasonic has really improved the concept of this line of shaver.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>I think that this Panasonic shaves much closer than what I was used to.  </li>
            <li>However, the Panasonic Men&#x27;s 5-Blade Shaving System comes as close to a razor as one can reasonably expect.  </li>
            <li>The LV61 gives a much closer shave with no irritation whatsoever and much fewer strokes.  </li>
            <li>, it is very top-heavy.  </li>
            <li>I did the same thing with the LV61 and it will balance on my finger near the midpoint of the shaver, meaning it is very balanced and that explains why it just feels better in your hand.]    </li>
            <li>The button to turn on the shaver feels like real metal.  </li>
            <li>much time do you spend shaving with a razor?&lt;br /&gt;Are</li>
            <li>Since there wasn&#x27;t much price difference between the Arc4 and the Arc5</li>
            <li>It runs so much quieter than the Arc4.</li>
            <li>tried one of the newer rotary norelco&#x27;s for awhile, but after a month or two the results weren&#x27;t much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the one hand it covers ground really fast on my face.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Gives much closer shave than the Panasonics I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li>and it had the whole cleaning kit, which by the way is a pain in the butt because you keep having to buy the cleaning kits.</li>
            <li>it irritates my whole face</li>
            <li>It shaves very close too.</li>
            <li>it really is.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the ES8429S which gave a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>very thoroughly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing I really don&#x27;t like is that you cannot use the shaver while it is plugged</li>
            <li>very thoroughly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing I really don&#x27;t like is that you cannot use the shaver while it is plugged</li>
            <li>This one shaves me very close and no irritation.</li>
            <li>It will be ready by the time you need it again.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Well it is not 500$ for nothing, it is pretty small but handy, I bought for my dad and he is very picky about his shavers so this one seems to hit the spot.</li>
            <li>read the reviews - lots of them and on lots of razors because I really wanted one to work.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in the face.</li>
            <li>It is VERY comparable to Braun, but I say it has a smoother shave</li>
            <li>However, when the coupon came around for the ES-LV61, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, and thought I&#x27;d see how much (if any) technology has progressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I expect to much ??  </li>
            <li>Really, much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and gives my a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>After reading whole bunch of reviews i ordered this machine for birthday.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>Very close to &amp;#34;Gillette shave&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>very nice,comfortable,and I&#x27;ll buy panasonic shaver again.</li>
            <li>The LV61 shaves much closer than the ES8243A and the shave is much faster.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>MUCH HYPE OVER THE SIZE OF THE FOILS</li>
            <li>The ultra fast motor is quieter than Philips/Norelco (rotary) and Wahl (foil).</li>
            <li>I find it provides a very close shave when used with a shave gel in the shower.</li>
            <li>The shave is closer and you can finish shaving much fast.</li>
            <li>it is very balanced to hold.</li>
            <li>Therefore, this wet+dry option is absolutely great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is definitely very well made.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s very intuitive to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a detailed description of how I get such close results: Before going to bed, I wash my face and neck with a couple drops of USkincare Awaken Foam Cleanser and USkincare Bamboo Polish (which is an exfoliating scrub).</li>
            <li>Next I shave, detach the foil head, lightly rinse out the cutters, and lather my face again.</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re hypoallergenic, the shave is very close, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel any irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li>The cutters and foil head on my stolen Panasonic were almost ready for replacement after two years</li>
            <li>Much faster shave.  </li>
            <li>so head shaving  is not only comfortable as all the foils float -</li>
            <li>Just as German Engineering is most always top shelf, Japanese knives and blades are second to none.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfectly balanced and surprisingly light and quiet - it&#x27;s form meets function.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfectly balanced and surprisingly light and quiet - it&#x27;s form meets function.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had to go over the same spots a couple of times to get it smooth.</li>
            <li>Needed to replace a shaver tried this one and it works really well.</li>
            <li>, the ES-LV61-A really does have 5 Blades.</li>
            <li>One is always charged and ready to go when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Be careful when touching the foils when they are detached from the shaver and are not supported by the underlying blades.</li>
            <li>Even the slightest crease or dent in a foil can adversely affect the performance of the whole foil \ blade assembly.lying blades.</li>
            <li>Even the slightest crease or dent in a foil can adversely affect the performance of the whole foil \ blade assembly.</li>
            <li>I then purchased a sensotouch 2D,and was very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from the Nerelco Sensotouch 2D to a Nerelco sensotouch 3D, again, very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>I have had it for a while now and really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>So even when shaving for 5 days in a row, it still gives me a very close shave with practically no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I had a Braun series 7 and this one is much faster, smoother, and cuts deeper all kinds of hair since day 1.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a very dense beard.</li>
            <li>is very portable and does its job..</li>
            <li>and you are ready for the closest shave you have ever had in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>found the Panasonic smoother, quicker and a much better wet shaver then the Norelco.</li>
            <li>The trimming tool is much narrower compared to the Arc 4.</li>
            <li>But I get much smoother results on my face than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>In real world, Arc5 leaves about %20-30 of the beard.</li>
            <li>was very convenient for my husband to use.</li>
            <li>I hesitated to spend as much as I did ($250.00) on this</li>
            <li>As one would expect it is not as close as a blade,  but it is very close.  </li>
            <li>Decided to try the newest Panasonic and it gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>This provides a very close shave in five minutes.  </li>
            <li>Shaves close and fast, I like it.</li>
            <li>In fact, in that respect, I think a red LED light on the outside would actually be more useful than a digital readout because you don’t see the readout until you turn on the shaver</li>
            <li>and I find that I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times to get the kind of shave</li>
            <li>I am loving it everyday.</li>
            <li>As warm weather approaches, I will take the entire beard off for a while and post back.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t built to last, mostly for profit and early replacement.  </li>
            <li>Battery life isn&#x27;t so hot in comparison to my old braun, but admittedly it&#x27;s running at a MUCH higher RPM, and I use the cleaning mode every shave.  </li>
            <li>I usually shave dry, and it does a very good job with that.  </li>
            <li>In spite of an oversized head that doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any benefit; ineffective in capturing fine, flat hairs resulting in skin irritation.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!!!  </li>
            <li>The vibration itself is not a big deal, but the noise is very distinct.</li>
            <li>First off, let me start off by saying I am new to electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 4-5 days of not shaving, the new razor arrived and I charged it up for first use.  </li>
            <li>When I got the new Panasonic ES-LV61-A, I conducted a first test and used it after the rotary shave</li>
            <li>Clean, close, smooth shave with little skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I have tried it dry, wet, in the shower, with “Electric shave” gels and liquids, and  dry works the best for me.</li>
            <li>Compared to several other electric razors I have used, the Panasonic feels good in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I heard this was a good shaver because razor blades irritate my face, but I need to be clean shaven, so I guess I have to go with irritation over random face stubble.</li>
            <li>in all, this product is worth the monies i paid for it and am &amp;#34;VERY&amp;#34; happy with this and would recommend this shaver for all those with difficult thick hair and hard to shave areas like under the chin where the hairs also go in different directions like mine, this shaver does a great job! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Is a little louder, but cleans up very easy.  </li>
            <li>This one is a better model than the other one I had (which I passed along to one of my sons).  </li>
            <li>so sharp blades are a necessity and can&#x27;t be used more than twice.  </li>
            <li>I guess the other three blades actually do more than you might think.</li>
            <li>The shave was extremely patchy, and took more time per shave than using a disposable.  </li>
            <li>I have used other electric shavers for many years, but I never got a close shave.</li>
            <li>I did replace with an OEM battery, but it just didn&#x27;t hold charge like the original, so I finally had to retire it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other electric shavers does a better job.</li>
            <li>Better than 4 of other brands I tried.</li>
            <li>The way this one shaves is more comfortable and it gets me to a fairly clean shave faster than my previous - about 90 seconds typical.  </li>
            <li>i had in my mind to buy a eletric shaver for a long time and for a very good reasons but my delicate skin didn&#x27;t agree with me .</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to crack it open to clean</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, it simply does not give me a clean shave on my cheeks, and shaving my neck is a nightmare.</li>
            <li>About the only place I can get a clean shave is along my jawline.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum then, I would give this shaver four stars for its head shaving capability but only two stars for its face shaving ability given that I cannot get a clean shave no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>Also, the Braun shaver is easier to clean using only liquid soap and water.</li>
            <li>Dry shave is easy and fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no ridiculous sanitizing stand, cleaning is simple and straightforward</li>
            <li>, this one seems to be a high quality item, and works really well.</li>
            <li>The foil cutters really don&#x27;t work very well on the southern most areas, they have a tendency to cut a bit further than you&#x27;d like (read bleeding).</li>
            <li>At least the replacement blades are supposed to be reasonably priced ($50 for an entire set of replacement foils and blades) and I&#x27;m glad that shaving is a better experience.  </li>
            <li>It does give a better shave than most other models but the potential buyer will obviously need to factor price against the benefit of a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>That said, it requires several passes and a lot of patience to achieve that clean look and feel (about four minutes, which doesn’t sound like a long time, but believe me, it is longer than you realize).</li>
            <li>I would like to return it, but I already spent a month with it because panasonic says that your face needs a month with the new shave method, but it didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing in the three years, I probably would have spent close to that much money on disposable blades and shaving cream - so the deal isn&#x27;t that bad.unreachable dries easily sitting on the shelf in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and cuts shaving time in half for me.  </li>
            <li>The next day I noticed a lot of fine white (old guy) hairs around the front of the neck that I thought was clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely convinced more is better, but it has a few other minor improvements that make it nice.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use either wet or dry with easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic wet-dry shavers ever since they first came out in the early 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I put it on the charger (for only about the 5th full charge cycle).  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic only needs 1 hour charging time, before full operation.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Frankly, when I first noticed this, I was completely taken aback.</li>
            <li>Not to say that one does not work or lasts, only that top of line is that top of the line and at least on shavers one could aspire for the leader of the pack (vroom, vroom).</li>
            <li>And something like a neoprene travel case would be a nice touch rather than an ordinary vinyl case, given this</li>
            <li>On a full charge, I get maybe 4-5 shaves only.</li>
            <li>you need a trimmer to finish off some tiny hairs that it will just not cut.&lt;br /&gt;the motor is very quiet and the glide over the skin is very smooth  .</li>
            <li>I loved the closeness of a blade shave, but daily shaving with a razor took a little too much time and, more importantly, was irritating</li>
            <li>Elegant, efficient and powerful - this is the first electric I&#x27;ve used over the past 30 some odd years that does indeed deliver a comfortable, blade quality close</li>
            <li>Elegant, efficient and powerful - this is the first electric I&#x27;ve used over the past 30 some odd years that does indeed deliver a comfortable, blade quality close</li>
            <li>Philips has taken the brand down a notch and you&#x27;ll need to spend more than I did for this shaver to get something comparable and it takes longer to shave with the rotary.  </li>
            <li>I have used the new shaver for a month and recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>The main complaint is that the head is too large to effectively reach under the nose.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is awesome, although it has some few weak points, like noise (it&#x27;s really noisy!)</li>
            <li>Worth the money and Panasonic makes quality products and not just relying on the name brand like the other famous Japanese company that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Everything &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; makes is junk with overpricing and betting people will buy based on branding.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>high end electrics have their pros and cons and of course what works well for one has poor results for another - hence gentlemen, the seemingly endless search for a great, comfortable and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver cuts well, shaves, oh, so comfortably, cleans easily, and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>It simply feels more elegant, solid and less plastic-y.  </li>
            <li>The feel of this one is noticeably better than my previous.  </li>
            <li>It took a week to figure out that I should just go with and against the grain, and I&#x27;m able to shave in less than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>But previous Panasonic&#x27;s have shaved better on my neck.  </li>
            <li>The biggest downside of the Panasonic is that it requires replacement of the blades every 1-2 years, though I expect those who are less hirsute can observe a more lax replacement system.  </li>
            <li>It takes half an hour or more each time.</li>
            <li>Unlike the previous one I was using, which was also from Panasonic btw, this razor cannot stand on the counter top</li>
            <li>I clean the shaver after each use (just blow and brush the bits out, then rinse with water) and it takes me less time to shave with and clean this shaver than it used to take me just to shave with my old one.</li>
            <li>Shaving dry, I thought both sides were similarly smooth.</li>
            <li>It also does not \\&quot;gumup\\&quot;/clog the shaver like most of the previously mentioned products, does not rinse</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fraction of the price of many of the previously mentioned products.</li>
            <li>just hoped for a bit more based on previous products.</li>
            <li>For daily cleaning, simply lift the top and blow.  </li>
            <li>On the shaver are 2 main blades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the main point: How does it shave?</li>
            <li>My last 2 were Braun models, and I found that the earlier model worked better than the newer one.</li>
            <li>Should I buy this LV61 or the more expensive ($100 more MSRP)</li>
            <li>This is a noticeable improvement over older models.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The LV 61 looks unwieldy but actually handles better than the LA 63 despite the much larger head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It runs out of charge fairly quickly and that would be the only knock I would have on this.  </li>
            <li>I went with the Arc 5 and was expecting to get something more over my Arc 3 because this razor is a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>This razor surprised me being better than I expected -  </li>
            <li>I looked for the cleaning system for this particular model but could not find one, so</li>
            <li>It happened to me couple times with the older one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It will never make you a decent cup of tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main difference is in the closeness of the shave and zero irritation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find myself accidentally pushing the power switch and the power lock is a clever feature for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had with some of the older models I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it but the $50 replacement that looks the same are for the cheaper model although there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>The build is solid, better than the Norelco; same level as the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Disregarding that detail, I was very pleasantly surprised at how fast it took to get a very close shave, comparable</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, there are 2 main cutter blades.</li>
            <li>Having used various electric shavers, I&#x27;ve only been 90% satisfied.</li>
            <li>my older Braun</li>
            <li>Much closer shave, the only thing is you have little worning when it&#x27;s going to run out of power, still very pleased with it , glade</li>
            <li>Very good trimmer albeit hard to see due to the size of the head -</li>
            <li>I told him that online now a days vs. buying in a store &amp;#34;brick and mortar&amp;#34; you can buy the most expensive shaver which normally in store would cost a bunch more.</li>
            <li>The lock seems to provide more precision for the tight spaces.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>The Vine program gave me the opportunity to try a product at the high, high end of pricing, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li>I chose it based on the high ratings it received here, at Consumer Reports, and at Hammacher Schlemmer.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>I believe he said it was high</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see where Panasonic invested the additional money to justify this high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you are weighing between a 4 blade or 5 blade wet/dry, I would highly recommend the 5 blade.</li>
            <li>If the price is still too high for you, then get the LF51 four head instead.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shaver and purchased the 1250 with cleaning station.</li>
            <li>Price is high.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend the Panasonic ES-LV61-A or the ES-LV81-K.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I switched to Pansonic years ago  because of the high speed.</li>
            <li>High quality in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>One thing to note is that this model is a little older, and it was when I bought it Dec. 2014, there are newer models for more money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I dive into the Panasonic ES-LV61 here for whatever it&#x27;s worth is a quick run down on my electrics:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly it seems a bit more water drains from the body of the razor after shaving in the shower than when new (may be related to plug issues).</li>
            <li>The device is easy to clean,  can be used wet or dry, and has a motor that operates at a faster speed than everything else.  </li>
            <li>but this one surprised me because it shave so much closer and better than all my previous shaver.  </li>
            <li>of my adult life I&#x27;ve just had to accept that I would look scraggly after a certain point in the day.  </li>
            <li>It just seems balanced a little to the top end if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Because the &#x27;LV61 cuts closer, you might feel a little more irritation; I do, on the underlip area.  </li>
            <li>Because my beard is thicker than most, it always takes me a little longer to shave.  </li>
            <li>i just plug directly in to the shaver and clean it with a brush when necessary.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;multi-flex active pivoting head\\&quot; is really nice and allows you to shave with relative ease.  </li>
            <li>Pro: high-frequency seems to do a good job cutting whiskers without pulling: consistently clean, close shave&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver takes 1 hour to charge, has a 45-minute run time, and a 5-minute quick charge if you need to get a quick shave in and the shaver&#x27;s battery is dead.  </li>

            <li>To give you a better idea of how this blade configuration may work on your face, I find that on my upper lip only one main cutter and the lift-tech foil are doing the work because only two blades will fit, and on the area below my lower lip and above my chin, it&#x60;s one main foil and the finishing foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many articulation points on the shaver head and the foils independently move as well, despite how oversized the head of the shaver is – I can still maneuver in on all of the tough problem areas like the chin, top lip under the nose, and jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This shaver did an excellent job on the sideburns but irritate the face under the eyes badly.</li>
            <li>and the LA63 will not balance even with my finger near the very end</li>
            <li>But the real improvement here is that it&#x27;s much quieter doing the same job as the much noisier four head.</li>
            <li>Skin feel was much smoother than my old Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It is so much faster (about 2 minutes per shave) than my old Braun 8900 series</li>
            <li>For wet, I&#x27;ll use a brush and shaving cream - this is a ridiculously comfortable shave, and it&#x27;s as close (or closer) than a razor &amp; shaving cream…no pinching, pulling, burning, etc.</li>
            <li>Great shaver, lousy accessories.</li>
            <li>This thing was so much smoother and quieter compared to my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I wonder though if the extra blades where worth it</li>
            <li>Success at last!</li>
            <li>As someone with a coarse beard and face adapted to electrics, getting a close shave has never been a fun exercise.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s pretty much nothing left not to like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, it is a piece of plastic and won&#x27;t last as long as the Norelco</li>
            <li>now if it only would cut all the hairs it would be worth the cost .but</li>
            <li>If you are willing to spend this much on a shaver, go the extra mile and get the LV61.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopeful that I can pretty much abandon the razor &amp; shave cream routine entirely with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I normally time about 3:15 to do a shave in the morning.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I believe it is definitely worth the price if you can afford it, but it is definitely on the pricey end.</li>
            <li>Then I remove the foil head and briefly rinse the cutters and foil, reattach the foil head, squirt on a couple pumps of diluted Dr. Bronners liquid soap on the foil, run the shaver at the automatic 20 second high-speed cleaning mode while rinsing my face with warm water, remove the foil head, rinse the blades at the automatic 20 second high-speed cleaning mode, rinse the foil head, and let air-dry.  </li>
            <li>But for a lazy Saturday it was good enough...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money for a close shave.</li>
            <li>and it gets better everyday as my hair and skin adjusts to the routine.</li>
            <li>still have no regrets buying this razor since it cuts my hair better than any other product I&#x27;ve owned and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is the main reason I like this</li>
            <li>If you have an old shaver and you are curious if getting a new one is worth it, I can confirm that this one is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I can shave 2 or 3 days growth without a hair pulled, have far less neck irritation, and can almost say I enjoy shaving!  </li>
            <li>Those models swivel freely from side to side and, for some reason I can&#x27;t fathom, move up and down as more or less pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that back razor isn&#x27;t easy to use.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for a few months, and then I had to go over same spot on my face several times more than normal.</li>
            <li>, then I still need to hit several parts with a razor blade to get things right.  </li>
            <li>I found no difficulty shaving right up under the nasal area on the upper lip.  </li>
            <li>you have a tough or difficult beard or just want to own the best, search no further.</li>
            <li>No I don&#x27;t use goo or shave wet, so a quick comfortable dry shave is what I need.  </li>
            <li>At this price point, there should have been a leather case, or neoprene, or fine imitation leather.</li>
            <li>Shaves quickly and cleanly; long time between charges.</li>
            <li>I had never found an electric razor which worked for me; I have fairly fine facial hair, and cheaper razors simply won&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li>The handle feels light and plasticy and the head large and heavy.</li>
            <li>Instead, the razor looks like any other piece of cheap appliance or electronics I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>The base/handle of the shaver is not as comfortable in my hand as other shavers I have used.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and balanced, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and plasticky like some other shavers&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can afford to invest the money in it, you should, but only if you REALLY need it and no other razor is doing the job right.</li>
            <li>I used my new Panasonic shaver with Cremo Shave Cream</li>
            <li>Now, if you these blades were not to be hypoallergic, they would encourage growth of these live matter along with bacteria.  </li>
            <li>You might not find the WES9030P COMBO pack anymore, the new part number, which lists THIS ES-LV61 is WES9032P and is $65 for Amazon Prime as of today&#x27;s date.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m new with the electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Just got my new razor yesterday and tried it this morning.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning you new Panny</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a brand new day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning you new Panny</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a brand new day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It replaced another Panasonic razor that was in need of new foil and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The difference is the new Lift-Tech foil.</li>
            <li>Rinses to look like new and is sanitized.  </li>
            <li>battery live makes it a pleasure to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update July 2015 just received my new shaver.</li>
            <li>I was considering moving on to a new brand.  </li>
            <li>The five new blades cut like a dream</li>
            <li>It took about a week for me to get the hang of the new razor.</li>
            <li>of use: It was very easy, didn&#x27;t even feel anything hard +1</li>
            <li>Works great dry, tested wet and it just did not work for me wet.</li>
            <li>5 blades is actually only 2 blades in a huge body don&#x27;t expect to do any precision work with this razor its too big</li>
            <li>The battery counter is reasonably accurate, cleaning is simple enough.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to go through the ritual of the shaving cream, razor, and the clean up of a wet shave.</li>
            <li>, that didn&#x27;t do the job at all, only with wet shaving results were OK.</li>
            <li>and it did it very close much closer than I got from any of the above.</li>
            <li>, it holds a charge well, overall easy to use, cleans easily with soap and water (it doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning base and doesn&#x27;t use cleaning solutions like my Braun did), and it has a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li>For such a premium priced shaver, I expected better quality and service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to be able to shave wet or dry, day or night on a seconds notice.  </li>
            <li>Not as close as using an actual razor blade but close enough to give you a smooth face.</li>
            <li>Mrs. Boilermate said the Panasonic side was smoother than the Norelco side about a third of the time, and equally smooth about a third of the time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The really aren&#x27;t many negative things that I can  say.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty think beard and the hair grows fast (though I swear, as the old Panasonic got older, some of the foil wore off and turned patches of hair grey).  </li>
            <li>There is 1 in the middle to put things in order and make better final cuts by 2nd main</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this problem before where the razor is showing its age in other areas and replacing the simplest parts is too much to invest when you aren&#x27;t sure how long you will keep using the razor itself.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin specifically on my neck</li>
            <li>Clean up is just as easy as ever, with a little squirt of hand soap into the blades and a few seconds later your clean as a whistle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides?</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after my first use of the new shaver, it was obvious this wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;fair\\&quot; comparison -</li>
            <li>The razor operates wire free and is a little top heavy in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate, cleans up manually so you don&#x27;t need to blow $$$$ on extra cartridges, fast charge and enough battery life to easily last 5-6</li>
            <li>How is a digital display of a blinking 10% battery reserve any more useful than simply having a little LED light turn orange or red when battery power is low?</li>
            <li>If you buying an electric shaver for the first time, skip this section and read the next  Electric shavers basically come in 2 types - Rotary (philips norelco) &amp; foil (braun &amp; panasonic)  </li>
            <li>This model currently shows a price that is a bit higher than others I have used.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric I have owned that can actually beat a shaving cream and razor shave.</li>
            <li>Having recently switched from hot foam to a gel, I was not planning on another switch to cordless electric.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is NOT a solicited review; just a way to say thank you to Amazon and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several Panasonic shavers from the ES-LT41 to the ES-RT51 to the ES-LV61.  </li>
            <li>Like a red hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually designed to feel and move around like a regular razor, which is different than the competition, which feels more like moving machinery around your face.  </li>
            <li>not sure how much better than arc3 or arc4</li>
            <li>The shaver is a beautiful gun-metal dark blue, and is not a bright tacky light blue like on the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, you remove the outer foil section, turn on the sonic cleaning mode again and run the shaver under hot water.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, you remove the outer foil section, turn on the sonic cleaning mode again and run the shaver under hot water.  </li>
            <li>I let my husband try the razor first and never got it back.</li>
            <li>attests but a Lexus LS 460 could not be a 4 Stars if all the accolades of its extensive performance and features is to be believed, then it would have to have a higher rating like a 4.5, knowing that 5 Stars is perfection in the face of the earth</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve read this far, then well done!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked all of my electric razors but have never loved one until now.  </li>
            <li>When I shave my face a second time, I shave my neck, cheeks, and chin 90º from the first shave.</li>
            <li>At first, I wanted to dump it immediately and revert back to the disposables.  </li>
            <li>First off, it is so quiet compared to my Braun 790.</li>
            <li>Overall closeness is comparable to my razor except around the neckline which is still pretty close.  </li>
            <li>But it finally died so I bought this one because I thought if it&#x27;s more expensive it might be better.</li>
            <li>: It took off ALL the unwanted hair that was left after the first shave.</li>
            <li>First of all the plastic cap used to protect the blades actually STAYS on.  </li>
            <li>Further there were few spots which this shaver couldnt do a good spot with (especially the chin underside and neck areas.  </li>
            <li>But the Panasonic 5 blade shaver comes with hypoallergic blades which ward off growth of such bacteria and keep it clean, of course you have to do your due diligence of rinsing the blades in hot water and cleaning it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is easy, little hand soap and run it through water, that&#x27;s all...</li>
            <li>In fact, this shaver definitely provides a more comfortable shave than traditional blades - wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I can move the razor in multiple directions, going back and forth over and over and over, and I STILL cannot get all the hairs on my neck shaven clean.</li>
            <li>I previously had Panasonic ES8249 wet/dry shaver which has to be about 5 years old and going strong.</li>
            <li>new Panasonic ES-LV61-A model has one major improvement over the older models.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but what you&#x27;re getting is a very high quality marvel of engineering that will give you the closest, most comfortable electric shave possible.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone tired of spending more and more money on traditional razors.</li>
            <li>Panasonic would have won me over with better packaging, finer accessories, a dedicated website, and some way of making me feel special for buying this expensive device.</li>
            <li>Panasonic would have won me over with better packaging, finer accessories, a dedicated website, and some way of making me feel special for buying this expensive device.</li>
            <li>My old shaver was getting noisy and seemed to need new foils to prevent pulling.</li>
            <li>After apply my gel shaving cream, I started the new Panasonic up and WOW.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m always surprised at how brand new it feels, and I&#x27;m not sure why I wait so long to replace blades, but yes, ultra clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Micro thin foil is pretty amazing - but delicate and easy to tear.</li>
            <li>For the past few years I have been using model 8243 which has great.  </li>
            <li>I have a lightly colored (with some grey) moderate density beard.</li>
            <li>This leaves less space in which to fit the trimmer and appears to be a design necessity rather than a fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And living in a small apt this can be a big problem.</li>
            <li>It may seem expensive but a small tub will last you a year, the scents are superb and fade quickly.</li>
            <li>It may seem expensive but a small tub will last you a year, the scents are superb and fade quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it wet with shaving foam and the results and comfort are extraordinary.</li>
            <li>While my previous model shaved very close, this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used that shaves as close as a safety razor with identical results after skipping a day, and no irritation!</li>
            <li>It does have some issues shaving close to the sideburns mainly because of the bulky head, but no other electric shaver in the world can come close to this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may sound like i&#x27;m not recommending it at all, but thats not true.</li>
            <li>Panasonic also only gives you a 30 day money back guarantee so you pretty much must decide if you like before your face gets used to it.</li>
            <li>The shaver is also more quiet than the previous ones (I have been using wet/dry Panasonic shavers for almost 20 years).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The dry is almost as comfortable – it’s not ONLY because of the moisturizers in the shaving</li>
            <li>With the Arc5 I am able to cut the shaving time in half, it shaves just as close and no stray hairs are left.  </li>
            <li>THIS is the one, better wet than dry for me.</li>
            <li>and i must say that the prices is ok and the shave gotten from both dry and wet shave (even in the shower with me)</li>
            <li>The head freely rotates, though somewhat limited in its side-to-side and back and forth motion.  </li>
            <li>Depress two buttons on each side of the head, and the outer casing pops right off.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box with a dry shave</li>
            <li>Lastly since the head of the shaver is so large</li>
            <li>The reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that I have to augment the Panasonic razor with a razor blade on certain angles such as around the sides of my (bald guy) head where it begins to crown.</li>
            <li>Even though the head is large the front to back and side to side</li>
            <li>I think this is due to a combination of a large shaving area and head design that seems somehow better than my previous arc-4 models.  </li>
            <li>I usually resort to the trimmer for much of the time because the shaver doesn&#x27;t begin to produce a clean shave.</li>
            <li>The 5-blade Panasonic LV61 is a little lighter and better balanced [see Update note above].  </li>
            <li>I was excited to use another Panasonic shaver as the previous one was portable, efficient and quite accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor itself is quick and doesn&#x27;t yank hairs out of your face like some other electric razors</li>
            <li>seriously?!), no oil for regular maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hardly ever use a razor any more.</li>
            <li>The one I&#x27;m using exclusively now is Bump Stopper Medicated Shaving Gel by a company called High Time, which I normally get at my local Walgreens</li>
            <li>cleans easy, fast to recharge, last long on one charge, waterproof, works well dry also.</li>
            <li>I purchased a new set of blades for the razor expecting similar decent results.  </li>
            <li>It blows the older four head away effortlessly, and with the new lower price point (I paid only $149.00, it used to be $299.00)</li>
            <li>It was not cutting anywhere near what I expected.  </li>
            <li>(just didn&#x27;t think any shaver was worth more) and wasn&#x27;t going to again when the LCD display on my ES-RT51 failed.  </li>
            <li>old remington is great cutting all</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s clear, you can also see the spots you may have missed while shaving.</li>
            <li>This shaver trims my facial hair more closely than my prior 4 blade Panasonic shaver, almost equal to a wet shave with a real blade.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy, and that could be an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a step up from my old Panasonic [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>simply because it&#x27;s more convenient, but I occasionally choose to have a wet shave for the increased comfort</li>
            <li>I thought I will await the blackfriday to check the offers</li>
            <li>, it is by far the fastest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It visual charging indicator and readouts are very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the digital readout.  </li>
            <li>I could go much longer as I charge at 30% battery left though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>quite expensive shaver seems much more reasonable once when you find out how much this shaver gives.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think the difference has much to do with 4 vs. 5 blades, per se - the internal mechanism of the shaver is similar for both units.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my ES-LV61 died completely and i had to revert to using my old arc-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>old.  </li>
            <li>an aside, I pulled out my old Braun Series 7 shaver for backup while this one is in service.</li>
            <li>Overall it gives a much closer shave than the Arcitec.</li>
            <li>I should have replaced my old brain with a newer Braun.  </li>
            <li>Shaving the top of my head was a delicate operation.</li>
            <li>you know, I&#x27;m old and the hair just ain&#x27;t there anymore</li>
            <li>I was getting on my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic completely destroys that adage.  </li>
            <li>it does  a better job than the LA93, but still not spectacular.  </li>
            <li>The extended battery life with a visual readout is very valuable.  </li>
            <li>This model does not come with a self-cleaning gizmo, but it really isn&#x27;t needed as the shaver features a sonic mode designed for cleaning under the tap with regular soap and water.</li>
            <li>then my three headed Panasonic comes complete with a cleansing apparatus combine with a charging stand.</li>
            <li>You have to pack it in clothes (or something soft) to prevent it from getting banged up in your luggage anyway, so how is it going to get turned on?</li>
            <li>You have to pack it in clothes (or something soft) to prevent it from getting banged up in your luggage anyway, so how is it going to get turned on?</li>
            <li>and I still have to finish with old Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has used electric shavers his whole life, so I anticipated that he would like this one especially.</li>
            <li>it started to make a loud noise (it&#x27;s already loud, but now it&#x27;s even louder), and b)</li>
            <li>as it is now i have to use my old remington to finish off some hairs .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Frequent water rinses of the head corrected that and did not diminish the gel effectiveness.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin wasnt well suited for this.  </li>
            <li>So far no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li>Comparing it to my old Philips in terms of accuracy this one is a winner.</li>
            <li>It by far gives the closest shave of any electric razor I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am obviously very upset that this item did not even last 3 months for the price I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought his to replace my old 3-blade ES8228 Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>The Arc5&#x27;s larger head is very cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li>I like the flexible head, the digital readout telling me how much charge remains, and the locking power switch.  </li>
            <li>It is almost as loud as an electric hair clippers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my face because the natural oils help to lubricate the skin.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>Partly because I had to spend so much time going over the same areas that the razor just would not cut.  </li>
            <li>I finally purchased this razor after much consideration.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still tweaking it after nearly a</li>
            <li>and so far I have to give it 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li>I had a different model with this system and didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li>Had a 2 year old Braun 760 cc.</li>
            <li>as my old Braun did.</li>
            <li>When I traveled with the old one, every so often it would get jostled and unlock and the power button would get pressed and use up all the battery.</li>
            <li>Two are attached directly to the shaver.</li>
            <li>of the Panasonic Wet\Dry Shavers are completely WaterProof.</li>
            <li>Yes, the Panasonic LV61 is COMPLETELY</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I became tired of wasting money and time on lesser shavers and spent top dollar for this Arc 5, and I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what my old one had.</li>
            <li>but this shaves the closest by far.</li>
            <li>a side note, I don&#x27;t grow anywhere near a &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Old Mountain Goat</li>
            <li>My old Braun5775 is going to the trash.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>Had 3 shaves with it so far.</li>
            <li>price.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a mini turbine near your face when it runs (acceptable decibel levels)</li>
            <li>Its also quite loud compared to comparable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently, I tried a Braun 790cc because the price of the shaver was much lower then the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>This shaver far exceeds any product Panasonic has ever put out.</li>
            <li>So far the performance has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using my shaving cream and razor completely.</li>
            <li>A couple years ago I decided to switch completely and went to blades.  </li>
            <li>The prior electrics never seemed to give me as close a shave over my whole</li>
            <li>short, I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>Before this razor, I had a similiar Panasonic one that was two years old.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell if this is an annoyance, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Would recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It shaves closer than my old Norelco, which did not survive a bathtub drop.  </li>
            <li>No ingrown whiskers or razor burn so far either.  </li>
            <li>, smooth shaves I get everyday.</li>
            <li>But if that was the only difference, I probably still wouldn&#x27;t have thought the Panasonic was worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe worth it for those with lesser finer facial hair.</li>
            <li>For the last few years I have used the latest Braun Pulsonic&#x27;s and always updated.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, the money I spent purchasing the Arc 5 was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Been using the braun 5 series before this and the arc5 is much much better with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t that good and the it was difficult to shave place under the chin.  </li>
            <li>It is a closer shave but still irritates my face a little bit, not bad, I can live with it.</li>
            <li>it becomes more of an issue resulting in the underside of my nose often being scraped while shaving due to the sheer size of the head as I shave over the upper lip.</li>
            <li>In fact, the larger head, due to the five blades, actually makes the shave quicker, closer, and even more</li>
            <li>You have to practice using this shaver, you won&#x27;t be good at using it for a few weeks, but once your used to it and know how it works with your face, there is no going back to the blade or other cheaper units.</li>
            <li>I shower and wash my face first and then let it dry before shaving as I have always done.</li>
            <li>I tried shaving with gel at first, but then settled on dry.</li>
            <li>And does such a good job that my shaves take less than half the time.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is a snap by adding a little hand soap when operating the device in clean mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if I want a truly razor clean shave, I use it with a little gel or shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it&#x27;s very easy on my sensitive skin and leaves behind no redness or sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed the larger size of the head and the very different angle of it compared to my old shaver.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s small and it doesn&#x27;t extend far enough away from the head of the razor – it works, but you&#x27;ll find better trimmer design in Braun 5-7 series razors</li>
            <li>A fan of wet shaving with shave brush, high quality creams and straight edge razors.</li>
            <li>One charge last for more than 10 days and whether it is fully charge or down to 10% of the charge, the shave is the same.  </li>
            <li>A little soap, press the button for sonic under warm water (never hot!)</li>
            <li>About a week-and-a-half later I received a brand spanking new ES-LV61 via UPS!</li>
            <li>past reviews of other electrics are somewhat more critical than complimentary.</li>
            <li>past reviews of other electrics are somewhat more critical than complimentary.</li>
            <li>to clean, close shave every time, every after a few days growth.</li>
            <li>Now it takes me half the time my old razor did, and it is quiet, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if the timer kept accumulated time across longer breaks, but only because I&#x27;m that curious about how much less time this model takes.</li>
            <li>: i also wanted to add that the ES-LV81-K (with cleaning system) is the exact same razor its just a different color and has the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am acutely aware of the difference in feel and shave quality because recently (after only about 60 days of use)</li>
            <li>, I will never go back to razor blades, particularly for my head.</li>
            <li>, I usually need to do many passes in different positions</li>
            <li>I found the Braun was a decent shaver, but left stubble.</li>
            <li>I have used the top of the line Braun and find this one equal if not better in performance and results.</li>
            <li>Braun was decent however could not get myself to continue to buy the cleaning solution and, eventually the actual cleaner.  </li>
            <li>2 blades on outer sides are just trimmers and acting as tools to shape up and trim the beard to improve main cutters performance.</li>
            <li>The head of the shaver is rather large though, so it can feel a little top heavy at times.  </li>
            <li>The ES-LV61 emits a solid, high pitched whine when in use.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this to anyone in the same boat as I</li>
            <li>The ideal is the same closeness and little skin irritating.</li>
            <li>what a fine fine cutting instrument.    </li>
            <li>Now if you put the foil back on and use only the very edge of the shaver head (well before you get to the 2 main blades in the center), you will see that it really is a usable blade as it cuts your stubble.  </li>
            <li>I cannot deny though that for facial hair of less than a couple days growth it gives an exceedingly comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>This means it&#x27;s particularly good at getting into tight spots that are hard to reach.</li>
            <li>It works very well and does not take long.  </li>
            <li>These replacement blades don&#x27;t come cheap either, at least $50-70 (which is about standard for electric shavers; IIRC, replacement Norelco blades were about that much too).  </li>
            <li>well (always difficult with electrics) and I am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver because of its wet/dry capabilities (and spent a pretty penny doing so).  </li>
            <li>your other-hand fingers.&lt;br /&gt;the normal price is quite hiked up.&lt;br /&gt;the battery would last for about 15-20 shaves estimation only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but I can already tell it&#x27;s much better than the last Norelco.</li>
            <li>far as a down side my only complaints are that the trimmer is rather flimsy and the battrey life is much shorter then other electric razors, but that isn&#x27;t enough to dampen my love of the Panisonic Arc 5.</li>
            <li>I first have to crop it very tightly with hair clippers or shave with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sideburn trimmer is easy to turn on and works well around the sideburns and othe hard to shave areas.  </li>
            <li>so I will be a little more careful.  </li>
            <li>main differences between the Panasonic and the Braun shavers are: Braun is slightly faster and a full battery charge is enough for about 6 to 7 shaves whereas, Panasonic lasts only for about 3 to 4 shaves.</li>
            <li>Really close shave but not so good a difficult to reach areas due to the size of the head</li>
            <li>and obviously they do scrape off live matter into an enclosed chamber along with the hair.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a short transitional period when you get used to a new way of shaving.</li>
            <li>I finally decided it was time for a new one...</li>
            <li>Instead of searching around for replacement parts, I decided to get a new one recently and went for this.  </li>
            <li>It is always a rush when you get a new set of blades in, but this definitely feels like an upgrade to my Arc 4.</li>
            <li>Patented 5 blade cutting system - really does an amazing job</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the LF51-A is a winner and a real steal at it&#x27;s current price.</li>
            <li>Ok to start off I&#x27;m the type of guy who has thick coarse hair and using a razor causes bumps/</li>
            <li>The most recent models add &amp;#34;microsensing&amp;#34; which speed up and slow down the motor to deal with different hair types; I have mostly fine facial hair except on my chin; this razor without that feature has no problem.  </li>
            <li>The only negative thing I have noticed is the high pitch sound from the motor.</li>
            <li>If it were anything less complicated, we&#x27;d all be using the same tool with optimum results, right?</li>
            <li>no other Panasonic (or blade for that matter) has shaved this close.  </li>
            <li>The way I have learned it works is this: as long as all parts are kept in tip top condition and the parts have not aged past the point of not being as efficient, this shaver will deliver on its promise.</li>
            <li>Not exactly as close as a blade but pretty close.</li>
            <li>No need for the more expensive ES-LV81-K with the cleaning unit since liquid soap and water worked just fine with my previous Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I mean extremely easy.</li>
            <li>This current shaver updates the prior one in a few ways (five blades, smaller size, better lock mechanism, and improved clipper).</li>
            <li>Its so much quieter than my old Braun and any of my other shavers.  </li>
            <li>Works well wet or dry, definitely a better shave when used wet with shave cream.  </li>
            <li>The AC adapter is decent, it is well built and looks like it will survive long use.</li>
            <li>week I got this Panasonic shaver after doing a little bit of fresh research.</li>
            <li>, i think i cut my shave time in half and received a better shave then both previous razors.</li>
            <li>It shaves either wet or dry with super closeness.  </li>
            <li>It for some strange reason even with the high price does not include a stand to mount in while recharging or not in use.</li>
            <li>I get close, comfortable shaves, even in the hard to shave areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>Oh and if you take it in the shower thinking you can just run over your wet face and get a good clean shave you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it comes with a small travel case (which only the razor fits in) and an AC adaptor (which is pretty large).  </li>
            <li>so everything feels tight and right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the shave is probably not quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s certainly close enough for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t really have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>It works fine for the northern parts, but get down to the southern parts and things get a bit more difficult.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly it was not the same, the 5 blade design is a testament to \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; as it seems like the blades fight each other more than help.</li>
            <li>only the rare and few would deserve such a high mark.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is very simple and effective, thanks to the hyper vibrate feature of the cutting blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>never  gotten  such  a close  smooth shave with any electric  razor in the past.</li>
            <li>Like it, much better than my previous Philips 2D, because the 2D never clean up my neck area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I waited too long to use this product enough to make a real judgement weather or not to keep it or return it.</li>
            <li>My old electric razor (circular blades), and manual shaver left bumps all over my face and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>Both developed the same problem- after a year</li>
            <li>Really surprised with the battery life and the constant power.</li>
            <li>I like the pivoting foil blade, versus the fixed floating heads of the last electric razor I used.  </li>
            <li>He said never ever he will go back to old ways of shaving .</li>
            <li>only problem that prevents me from using this is that with close shave comes loud vibration sounds.</li>
            <li>Only once did I try an electric razor when I was around 18 years old.  </li>
            <li>your going to spend this much on a shaver and wet shave, even once in a while.</li>
            <li>your going to spend this much on a shaver and wet shave, even once in a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a 43 year old male with olive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no doubt in my mind after experiencing the shave that I now get from this Panasonic ES-LV61 that it is now undoubtably the current benchmark for Electric shavers in so far as the quality of shave that it provides.</li>
            <li>Bare box.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on the wet shaving capabilities</li>
            <li>Everything I gave a try I had to return and get back to old school razors.</li>
            <li>And I am quite surprised how big of a difference it has made.</li>
            <li>the noise is comparable to my old Norelco, which is a concern I had from the last time</li>
            <li>My last an Arc4 was over 5 years old and needed repair, so I decided to purchase the Arc5.  </li>
            <li>the plastics feel somewhat fragile but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li>and it still did not get all of it and had to revert to my 4 year old Remington (which i replaced internal battery) to finish the job and did well</li>
            <li>I could see that it was charging normally, then came back hours later</li>
            <li>Despite the excited reviews of other users I do not have the illusion that this even remotely comes close to a bladed-shave...</li>
            <li>Rotaries are good for cutting longer hairs</li>
            <li>It is kind of sad once you think about it</li>
            <li>Just a few days later, I received a refund check in the mail, for the full amount of the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried a Braun and got a better, but, not a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>For those thinking of buying for this purpose, understand that the shaver breaks down with consistent exposure to water, where the unit will just stop working -</li>
            <li>In 50 years of shaving, this is the first electric razor that&#x27;s caused me to put down the blade.  </li>
            <li>the Braun sounds a little raspier compared to the Panasonic which has a higher frequency vibration which is due to the higher frequency of razor movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer any Panasonic over any other brand I&#x27;ve tried; but this model gets that hard to smooth stubble on the chin and jaw lines without too much work or pressure.  </li>
            <li>Add the crazy sharp blades and center \\&quot;lifting strip\\&quot; and you had yourself the best electric for head shaving - at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges fast and can last two to three days on a single charge</li>
            <li>And the blade replacement kit I saw costs half as much as what the entire shaver appears to sell new.</li>
            <li>My shaving time is about half what it used to be as it cuts close with the first pass</li>
            <li>The instructions state the outer foil blades will last 2 years and the main inner blades will last 1 year,</li>
            <li>I have thick facial hair and this does create a smooth shave when excessively going over the same location for what seems like an eternity (probably 10-20 passes), but not as smooth as I get from 2-3 passes with a Mach-3 blade...</li>
            <li>Not sure if the fifth blade has anything to do with it, but it is quieter, lighter, better balanced, and gives a smoother shave than I ever remember any other Panasonic giving.</li>
            <li>With the head of the device that tilts in every angle possible,  i was at first worried that pushing too hard against my face would cause too much pressure at the joint.  </li>
            <li>with the ES-LV61-A &#x27;s \\&quot;Sonic vibration cleaning system\\&quot; and a small drop of liquid hand soap this thing comes squeeky clean in about 30 seconds of total time after your shave.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a blade, but much closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>That is kind of sad because I have found out that even though it is a little more expensive, the cleaning station does a more than average cleaning job on the shaver.   </li>
            <li>Rinse it off, and you&#x27;ve got a clear sharp shaver like new.</li>
            <li>This is because the trimmers are once again built into the back of the head, but because of the pivoting action must be built above the neck of the shaver.</li>
            <li>In the end I got the same shave in the same amount of time as with my old 3-blade model.</li>
            <li>Definitely loud enough to wake up the person next door.</li>
            <li>As this shaver is only 1 month old, I&#x27;m still trying out different angles to pick up that hair.</li>
            <li>While my old shaver still gave a close shave, it took several times going over the same place.  </li>
            <li>The extra cost is well worth the investment for the no hassle, trouble</li>
            <li>It cuts as close as a razor does without the painful scraping skin feeling, it pivots to get a closer shave around my jawline and neck, its very easy to clean, it leaves absolutely no irritation from day 1.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is probably the only broad range consumer products company whose products, no matter in which area, I will buy without any hesitation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and only bought this high-end model because I got a major coupon.  </li>
            <li>first shave took a little bit longer (~5min) as I was getting used to the foil, but the consequtive ones are getting better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took several tries with Mrs. Boilermate&#x27;s small hands and greater coordination to get it back in.</li>
            <li>Since I have a shaver that takes advantage of the benefits of wet shaving, it makes no sense to not use a high quality shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my skin is simply used to electric shavers, but I get close shaves that last beyond 5pm, with no mess of shaving cream and no nicks from razors and my skin</li>
            <li>However, I try extremely hard to write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price,</li>
            <li>The extra expense is not needed as pulling the foil and running water over both leaves it clean and a simple pat down using a dry towel gets rid of the water.</li>
            <li>so I expect the new ones to last just as long.</li>
            <li>ensure the main cutters would not cause the head to be impossibly deep from front to back, they have been reduced in width considerably from those used on other models.</li>
            <li>and I think it took my well under half the time it normally takes to shave one day growth with the old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>So I figured if Dawn dishwashing liquid was good enough to clean up the horrific Valdez oil spill - not to mention save the lives of countless wild life</li>

            <li>They just are not worth it, at least not the ones that this particular model offers over other more basic models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They just are not worth it, at least not the ones that this particular model offers over other more basic models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like this I will keep it and never go back to any other</li>
            <li>After doing much research on Amazon and other websites, I decided to order the razor from Amazon, plus Amazon had it on sale with  50.00 instant coupon.</li>
            <li>It is a whole lot easier to shave with this razor than regular lather, brush and safety razor, due to my arm.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades consist of a cutter block, 2 foils above the cutter block, and 2 foils below the cutter block (the old model has only 1 foil above the cutter block).</li>
            <li>Long time rotary users will be surprised how your face will not be prepared for this shaver.  </li>
            <li>No excuse for water in the handle section.</li>
            <li>but it took nearly twice as long as it takes to shave with my Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been oscillating between barely satisfied and not satisfied for the last few years when using a number of Norelco rotary shavers (mid-range to top-of-the-line).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a top-of-the-line Braun last year and returned it as it was too loud and pulled my hair when the hair was a bit long.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>If you buy something you&#x27;re going to use everyday, why not get the best?ve with hot foam or gel did not do the job as well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first for me, as I have sensitive skin which I usually have to slap with copious amounts of aftershave following each session.  </li>
            <li>Well wonder no more, it&#x27;s worth every bit.</li>
            <li>I followed the normal routine of wet shaving after a shower, 1) pre shave gel 2) worked up a lather with a badger brush 3)</li>
            <li>It may be considered a bit heavy by some but not uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li>But if this happens again, my rating will go down to one star (on the other hand, if it gives me years of service, I&#x27;ll raise my rating back up to my original 5-star rating).</li>
            <li>And left high and dry by Amazon since we are 2 1/2 months(!)</li>
            <li>, you absolutely cannot feel any stubble, it&#x27;s an extremely close shave!  </li>
            <li>The only things I don&#x27;t like about the &#x27;LV61 are minor: (1) like the ES8243, you can&#x27;t run it while it is plugged in for charging,  (2) the sideburn trimmer is a little smaller than the ES8243,  (3) it is easy for the &#x27;LV61 to get into head LOCK mode; you have to be remember to push the trimmer switch 2 full stops after using the trimmer to put the head back in FREE mode, (4) shaving time before recharge seems to be shorter than the advertised 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>the results with the Arc5 are nearly indistinguishable from the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I usually use shaving oil and gel cream; however, with this new shaver, it works very well dry or with water only.  </li>
            <li>center lift foil must have been inspired by the original and now defunct Braun Smart Foil, it lifts every single whisker no matter where, no matter how difficult and really does cut below the skin line for a blade quality</li>
            <li>I have a four blade, 1300 speed Panasonic, but decided  to buy the new five blade wet</li>
            <li>Trying to figure out why this item was reviewed that high by other people</li>
            <li>-- I was thinking of getting the black one just for the cleaning system, as the Braun had, but I don&#x27;t really miss the cleaner.</li>
            <li>It provides a close shave and holds a charge much longer then my previous razors.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe people gave it less stars for &amp;#34;ergonomics&amp;#34; (really people?)</li>
            <li>My shaves now take half the time and the cut is much closer.</li>
            <li>Much quieter than my previous Panasonic Arc 4.  </li>
            <li>This was my first arc-5 after my last few being arc-4.  </li>
            <li>A full shave takes at least 5-10 minutes to go over spots several times.</li>
            <li>The head is a little large, but hasn&#x27;t seemed to be a problem at all.</li>
            <li>I did my research before buying this razor, it&#x27;s one of the best rated on amazon, so granted, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li>With the new LV-61, I get an even closer shave than any of the prior models and suffer absolutely no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have turned to the Arc4 which offers a similar (if slightly lower) quality shave at a much lower price point and have accepted that I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new shaver every few years.</li>
            <li>Plus, the metallic blue is much nicer than the black finish of the cleaning unit version</li>
            <li>As mentioned in previous reviews, the Panasonic has a very efficient cleaning procedure that does not require a bulky external tank system and the ongoing purchase of cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li>After trying various products in combination with this shaver over the past few weeks, I find that my old reliable Gillette fusion gel, used sparingly, provides a smooth, close shave with zero irritation.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re holding a mirror and trying to get the fuzz on the back of your neck, it&#x27;s pretty difficult; much easier with my old Braun.    </li>
            <li>Only the back is rubberized and the front of the razor is smooth and gets slick when wet.</li>
            <li>If you are getting tired of the blades and looking for something else, this would be a fine choice.</li>
            <li>Even with a single day&#x27;s growth after shaving with this for several minutes I can go back to my old foil shaver and get rid of the remaining &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moreover, I found the Norelco had a tendency to shave off large patches of hair, in a particularly uneven manner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57, I have always used a blade, tough beard, and have to spend a lot of time, effort and shave cream to get a smooth shave  </li>
            <li>and I could never find an electric razor that was powerful enough to shave my beard without having to press hard on my face and make several passes resulting in irritation and eventually razor bumps.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cuts as close and as comfortable - not to mention crazy fast, as the Braun did before it&#x27;s fall from grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> BUT, after researching, this is one of the best electric shavers on the market in terms of affordability and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel Panasonic shavers are the best available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I began considering this purchase I thought with that price it must be an awesome shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used without a shred of doubt.</li>
            <li> This is the best substitute I could ever get.</li>
            <li> Incredible!  </li>
            <li> Incredible!  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic 5 blade electric razor is the best I have ever tried, and in that group I include the Norelco 3D  and the Braun 7.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it is working perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Very happy.</li>
            <li> got a Panasonic ARC4 with 4-Blades; and,it was the best of all.</li>
            <li> Just got it and used it twice and best shave ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic wet/dry for over thirty years and they&#x27;re the best.</li>

            <li> Excellent shaver.  </li>
            <li> These Panasonic razors are the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  </li>
            <li> The best part is the charge lasts a lot longer then</li>
            <li> Still the best close shave I have ever gotten with an electric wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Best electric on the market.</li>
            <li> Its one of the best electric Shavers I have ever had.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor i have ever used.  </li>

            <li> Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic has always been an excellent razor!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Best shave of any product ever used period -  any blade, any electric.</li>
            <li> (Panasonic&#x27;s customer service was very good</li>
            <li> The shave itself is very good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Material quality: Very good +1</li>
            <li> Very good shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shopping experience.</li>
            <li> very good.</li>
            <li> The look and feel of the razor is very good.  </li>
            <li> it gives a very good shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Braun Series 7 for years and it is still a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the lack of a charging dock, I like the Panasonic ES-LV61-A Shaver for the incredibly close shave it provides and for the ease with which it can be cleaned.</li>
            <li> Holds its charge brilliantly.</li>
            <li> My post dry-shave session was incredible, didn&#x27;t even feel like I had just shaved.  </li>
            <li> But it still didn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the 5 blade, with its faster vibrations is incredible.</li>
            <li> Panasonic gives an incredibly close shave that sets it apart from any shaver I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s incredibly time</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s incredibly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great Electric Razor, the best i have ever had.  </li>
            <li> is awesome and am quite happy with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND GOOD PRICE!</li>
            <li> good!</li>
            <li> Loved it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
            <li> color&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li> Flawless when shaving &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, and almost as good when shaving &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> All in all, I have no problems noting that this is a darn good shaver that gives a very good shave.</li>
            <li> I have always been happy with my rotary shavers</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic still has issues with the problem areas on the face I experienced with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Based on your beard this razor may still be a great buy.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting head and five blades make a great difference.</li>
            <li> Though mine still works great, it feels cheaper in quality from grip to aesthetics.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great the way it is.</li>
            <li> It is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> After two years of use, it wanted to fly like r kelly and broke as it flew off a counter.  </li>
            <li> It is a great feeling to know that after 1 or 2 swipes, your face is all gucci to go.  </li>
            <li> It is a great build.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on outer ear hair.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is waterproof is great, but I never shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summing up, the ES-LV61 is a great step forward for Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> think you would be happy with a cheaper model Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It gives the closest and fastest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and shave for the price.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> It worked great for well over a year, but then I noticed a)</li>
            <li> But, believe me, it works great.</li>
            <li> It performs incredible and as good as a blade without the cuts.</li>
            <li> Great quality.</li>
            <li> It is great for travel.  </li>
            <li> Save some money, and still have a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> For some one that always uses electrics this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> If price doesn&#x27;t matter, I think you will be happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Since then, it has been great.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic ES-LA63-S Nanotech 4-Blade -  Great for face shaving, the 30 degree \\&quot;Arc\\</li>
            <li> 5/06 2013 ( a problem with the shaver but great</li>
            <li> I was thinking about going with the newer Braun model, but I saw the great reviews on this one and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Arc5 is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and for the price it should excel in that department.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, but sometimes caused irritation.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, I think this one is great</li>
            <li> Great razor, bought it for my Dad and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> That make me happy every time he uses it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> I can purchase a Braun 790cc at a lower cost and still get a great shave, why not?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Great razor.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, battery life and ease of cleaning and use.</li>
            <li> (induction).&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that it does a great job at shaving</li>
            <li> happy with the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right out of the box, I think the shaver is great.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is great too.</li>
            <li> I used this model for over a year and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a great Shaver.</li>
            <li> and it works great on both.</li>
            <li> This is a great upgrade to the Arc 4.</li>
            <li> Still conditioning my face  to this great Panasonic Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Two cutters with 5 piece foil.</li>
            <li> the power button lock is a great thought for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Great Razor.  </li>
            <li> have been looking for a shaver and have been using Remington for years at the $60 range which has been working great...</li>
            <li> This is a very nice electric and simplifies shaving.</li>
            <li> looks nice, works perfect for me used with shaving cream in shower great shave, battery holds charge good.</li>
            <li> The battery indicator is helpful, the pivoting head is very smooth and awesome.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> The shave, while not as good as a blade razor, was close-no five o&#x27;clock shadow and it was great for under the chin.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I can successfully shave these patches by rinsing my face, drying and going over it again.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor about six months ago and absolutely love it – it gives a wonderful shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never given a gift like this before Christmas and all, but my honey hates shaving and let&#x27;s face it although my guy is handsome shaved or not even he must look his best and Adam loves it!</li>
            <li> BTW, the case is very nice too, seems to be good quality leather.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easily the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is an attractive razor and on astand would look amazing.  </li>
            <li> Pop-Up Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer does as good a job as a dedicated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Good Ergonomics&lt;</li>
            <li> but it still should provide a good shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> and it was so good</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> I loved this machine and compared to the norelco I bought that one is rubbish</li>
            <li> and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> If you think of the fact that you spend about $5 for a razor every 2-4 weeks - which adds up to $100 per year - this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has done a good job of improving their men&#x27;s shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> (And I loved the ES LA-63.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the razor.</li>
            <li> That was a good shaver, and I thought it was the bar set for others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because i read the good reviews.</li>
            <li> ergonomics of this shaver are also good.  </li>
            <li> but now I can dump my bladed razor for good.</li>
            <li> Braun 790cc is also good but it does not give as close shave as es-lv61-a.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that good if you shave after 4 or so days</li>
            <li> Good feel in hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this item partly because of the good reviews and it has performed as advertised.</li>
            <li> I figure they (the companies) have already done the research and that is their way to let the buyer know which models they consider to be superior.</li>
            <li> Over the course of my life I found that rotary shavers worked best for my admittedly light growth.</li>
            <li> The swivel head, which can be locked, does a good job going over the chin to the neck.</li>
            <li> Overrated... Not as good as the one I was trying to replace, the Panasonic ES8243 WET/DRY.&lt;br /&gt;TOO</li>
            <li> There is a lock function which is good when you travel as it prevents the shaver from switching on inadvertently.</li>
            <li> You also get a shaver that shaves well, but not twice as good as the Norelco.</li>
            <li> and I am still delighted.</li>
            <li> Good on the face, fair on the neck and as for head shaving</li>
            <li> The razor is gorgeous, the cleaning station a technological marvel.</li>
            <li> a lighter note, the ES-LV61  has a gorgeous aesthetic.</li>
            <li> a lighter note, the ES-LV61  has a gorgeous aesthetic.</li>
            <li> It also has aloe and tea tree oil which are supposed to be good at reducing irritation and preventing the formation of shaving bumps.</li>
            <li> But the ES-LV61-A is definitely a superior over that model.</li>
            <li> It did a fair job on the neck but could not handle the jaw line.</li>
            <li> it.the price is good.</li>
            <li> The battery power is also good.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> So I decided to bite the bullet a pay a ton of money for a really good electric razor.</li>
            <li> so I have the three blade Panasonic which I reviewed on Amazon and loved.  </li>
            <li> Some have been good and others not.</li>
            <li> Use a scented soap, it smells good for a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> and I was amazed with how good of a job it did</li>
            <li> good job guys.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, for 5 blades but my 8243 - 4 blade shaves just as good</li>
            <li> so i returned the Braun and they are refunding me the monies, good customer support with Braun and have to give them a heads up for that! :)</li>
            <li> All the wonderful reviews are true to their word.</li>
            <li> So remarkable I told a friend who used mine once and ordered his own that day.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver, better than Norelco, better than Braun.</li>
            <li> I rate the shave 5 stars and the shaver exceptional in just about every category including comfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion - The shave is exceptionally close, with the Braun Pulsonic</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations for a quick and great shave!</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-LV61-A Wet/Dry Shaver provides an incredibly close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Most noticeable is the reduced time and number of strokes it takes to get a great shave.  </li>
            <li> but excellent results make the price worth it.</li>
            <li> I reviewed many razors and this one is great.  </li>
            <li> if there was a 1/2 star rating but the fact that it does a great job is what matters most.  </li>
            <li> So I have an expireince using this product and very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor and worth the price point.  </li>
            <li> Shaving results have always been great, and I have no need any more for a backup shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaver feels good in your hand with its nice finish and grip&lt;</li>
            <li> But frankly, right out of the box it is a very impressive shaver.  </li>
            <li> Very clean shave and a great deal faster than my $200 rotary electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny of the cost of this great great machine......</li>
            <li> a lot!&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is I get a closer shave now, it looks as good as a shave straight out of the shower with a razor!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, very easy to use, does a good job of shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a month now, and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is in a shaver that you are supposed to be able to use in the shower or bath!  </li>
            <li> If I could rate this shaver greater than 5 stars I would!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I decided to give it a try!  </li>
            <li> I love this one!  </li>
            <li> Considering this is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver, this is probably one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made when it comes to grooming needs!</li>
            <li> this is probably the best electric razor you can get if you&#x27;re willing to spend the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the noise is an excellent razor, it feels good in my hand and is easy to to keep clean.</li>
            <li> No way, I had an almost perfect shave on the first try.</li>
            <li> I spend about a minute to create a good lather with Classic Shaving Cream (unscented) and a Rooney best quality badger brush.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable razor, it shaves close, it shaves as good as a blade, it feels good in my hand, it is very fast, and the trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just rather amazing...</li>
            <li> Really amazing product.</li>
            <li> Its a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great razor, works like a manual shaver and looks great, the battery give me about ten days.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shaver.</li>
            <li> AMAZING RAZOR.  </li>
            <li> Now that I own it</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a sure sign for me that a shave is doing a good gob.</li>
            <li> I am also the proud owner of the Panasonic Arc 4, the top Norelco and Braun models, but the Arc 5 is the best so far.</li>
            <li> so nice and safety</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit will not do better, indeed, it is not as good as manual cleaning..</li>
            <li> But the results are spectacular.</li>
            <li> Nice surprise!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life isn&#x27;t spectacular...</li>
            <li> Honestly?</li>
            <li> Honestly?</li>
            <li> Everything pops apart nicely and easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a nice razor.</li>
            <li> much  more  good  </li>
            <li> The results were truly astounding.  </li>
            <li> As a guy, I like a nicely built device, and this is nicely built.  </li>
            <li> + for another one now, which tells you that at one point in time I really liked this razor.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Braun and was considering just getting another Braun rather than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It seems&lt;br /&gt;like a nice instrument.  </li>
            <li> own two, because I shave with two--</li>
            <li> both braun and panasonic  would make for an ideal shave kit, but the price wasnt worth it for me</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with the performance of this razor.  </li>
            <li> (probably) don&#x27;t own one yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A cleaning brush and a counter stand would also have been nice.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re on the fence about this razor and still suffering through this review, let me assure you this is one spectacular machine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended.me, cleaning systems come with their own set of problems and added</li>
            <li> Another nice change is in cleaning.</li>
            <li> I had not realized that a good quality shver could be so much better than mid-range</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice shaver</li>
            <li> Handy when one is in a rush.</li>
            <li> Wet/Dry shaver is the absolute best shaver on the market!  </li>
            <li> To my surprise it is also effective on those tangly neck hairs.  </li>
            <li> from purchase, get to return on my own to manufacturer (for $10 mailing charge) and take my chances.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After charging the shaver, I let it sit for a day since I just had oral surgery and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about running this thing over my tender jaw.  </li>
            <li> Trims nice and close without roughing up your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a good Razor and it does better than my Norelco</li>
            <li> and it felt even better (to be fair</li>
            <li> The pivoting head and built in trimmer is a nice added benefit as well.</li>
            <li> This puppy shaves EVERYTHING nice and close.</li>
            <li> So I put 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t really work for me but for someone else this could be a real good product.</li>
            <li> I liked the shave I got from the this shaver.</li>
            <li> and I really liked my Braun.</li>
            <li> in all...a great electric shaver with a unique and efficient sonic cleaning mode.20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> in all...a great electric shaver with a unique and efficient sonic cleaning mode.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t look that perfect from very close look as if you shaved with good disposable razor so you may need just check-shave with razor very quickly and no foam needs to be applied.</li>
            <li> I figured that this was the best that an electric could do because Braun gets high marks on reviews.</li>
            <li> Fit and finish is excellent, good ergonomics and modern aesthetics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this new unit and will highly recommend it to anyone wanting a top-notch wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> This new model is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This one is new and the BEST!  </li>
            <li> I have mostly used Norelco as my primary shaver, but the ones I&#x27;ve had never gave me great close shave, so I&#x27;ve had to resort to razors when I needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought this about 2 months ago here at Naval Station Great Lakes, and I have to say that this is the most comfortable and reliable shaving device I have EVER used.</li>
            <li> but the reviews were incredible and I had great results with my prior razor.  </li>
            <li> All i can say he was super happy that i got him it .</li>
            <li> The flexible heads make it very easy to shave around the neck.  </li>
            <li> Amazon shipped promptly, and made my shopping experience very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is very easy.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is very easy with the 20-second cleaning</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty good!</li>
            <li> So the Panasonic has many great features (good battery life, charges quickly, cleans easily, etc.), but the closeness of the shave is unlike any shaver I have used and is what truly sets the Panasonic apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it, because I&#x27;m one of those who has to have the latest and greatest, but I really think the Arc4 shavers are a better value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is, by far, the best razor Panasonic has ever made.</li>
            <li> Used the four head Panasonic&#x27;s before, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I also tried the Panasonic with a wet-shave, and was able to achieve an amazingly close shave.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase of the Panasonic so far, as I look for build quality and durability in a product.</li>
            <li> IMHO offers the best electric shaver value on the market.</li>
            <li> I liked much more.</li>
            <li> Just go ahead and splurge and buy this razor instead of a Braun Series 7 or a Norelco with those heads stuck out in space, I have one of each of them plus a Remington and this Panasonic is by far the best of bunch.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer is an important step to keep the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> However as Consumer Reports was impressed with complete overhaul of the SensoTouch line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rapid fire fast and incredibly</li>
            <li> After near a month use, I would said this is best electric shavers I ever have!</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic electric shavers for some time and this is by far the best; making it the #1 wet/dry shaver on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shaver for about 20 years, but this is by far the best Panasonic electric shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, well built and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It still is a good buy from the original $500 price.  </li>
            <li> I had been a Braun user for many years and really liked their razors (better than Remmington or Norelco).</li>
            <li> Great razor and easy to clean</li>
            <li> I have used many electrics and this by far is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of mostly electric shavers this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and works perfectly in the shower.  </li>
            <li> looks good, feels right in your hands and nice battery life.</li>
            <li> The rotation was more than suitable for my shaving needs.  </li>
            <li> A full charge is good for 5 or 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li> the 8243 and is very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> The result is a very smooth shave with almost no stubble.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving experience was very smooth with no pull.</li>
            <li> Since it delivers very smooth shave</li>
            <li> For the shaving: this shaver is very fast and picks up most of the beard in great style.</li>
            <li> When used with shaving cream the shave felt very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> That thing is absolutely incredible and still runs like brand new.</li>
            <li> It does the job quickly and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> The handle is exactly the right size for my hand, it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> That said, this is a great travel shaver because it&#x27;s light, comes with a carrying case and gives you a lot of shaves on one quick charge.</li>
            <li> the travel case is a bit cheap considering the cost of the razor – they could have thrown in a sturdier, more form fitting plushier case – it&#x27;s not bad but it isn&#x27;t great and for someone who travels a lot, a well cushioned case is a must&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I really love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic Arc 4 is much better.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped in on the tile floor in the bathroom and the top and cover came off.  </li>
            <li> I have been an electric shaver user for many years.</li>
            <li> We are talking many decades.  </li>
            <li> Except for using this to extract more money from us</li>
            <li> I purchased a Feather AS-D2 and learned to love shaving again.  </li>
            <li> my triple head was better</li>
            <li> remain in areas no matter how many times and directions</li>
            <li> Price of replacement foil and blade is more than 50% of what the razor cost to buy (comparing sale prices of both razor and foil/blade).  </li>
            <li> As with most razors the beard trimmer has dulled.  </li>
            <li> give you more burn compared to rotary blades.   </li>
            <li> Even when I shave with a blade I sometimes go over areas more than once.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic Arc 4 was my favorite before getting the Arc 5 as my birthday gift to me.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver and I am very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> Gives a good close shave and is easy to clean</li>
            <li> there are better products for your money.</li>
            <li> I like knowing how many more shaves I have</li>
            <li> But for the price I would expect more than a year&#x27;s use out of it.  </li>
            <li> many razors and shaving cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went with the Arc5.</li>
            <li> The LV61 cuts my beard closer and smoother but the ES8243 has a better sideburn trimmer and thumb handle placement than the LV61.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Norelco Arcitec and was pleased with it until it died.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver!</li>
            <li> The shave seems to be ok on the cheek and neck areas.</li>
            <li> I did not think the ES-LV61-A Arc 5 shaver would be better than the Arc 4, but it is, and noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I really love this one.</li>
            <li> Handles much better than</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for more than a month.</li>
            <li> This shaved is ok, it shaved close.  </li>
            <li> excellent results and quieter than my last shaver</li>
            <li> Does an ok job.</li>
            <li> The arc5 razor provided a close shave but also caused more irritation.</li>
            <li> There are $50 razors with better packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no need to pack the charger for a one week trip (well unless you are shaving a lot more than just your face).</li>
            <li> love the razor</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> There is no need to pack the charger for a one week trip (well unless you are shaving a lot more than just your face).</li>
            <li> love the razor</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> Another good feature is that it is easy to clean</li>
            <li> I find that the hairs stand up more this way, and are easier to cut.</li>
            <li> I have never paid more than $75 to $100 for a shaver</li>
            <li> I will gladly deal with charging the razor more often (for me about every 5 days) and the trimmer still gets the job</li>
            <li> It does okay</li>
            <li> Panasonic is so much better than Norelco (razor burn) or Braun.  </li>
            <li> I love having more blades.</li>
            <li> It feels dainty compared to my old electrics.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic electric shaver has many improved features.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over my neck area, this does not get all the hairs and it looks stubbly when I am done.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get a better shave.</li>
            <li> Even more interesting is that you cannot operate it while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.useless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers for many years beginning with the Arc3, and they keep getting better.</li>
            <li> However, the shaver works better in the shower or after I have washed my face.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally pleased by this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all latest electric razers like norelco sensotouch 3D,Braun 790cc, panasonic ES-LA63-S and ES-LV61-A.</li>
            <li> The second best is sensotouch 3D if you have no history of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> need I say more?</li>
            <li> and they still work after more than a decade of use)</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> already didnt think it could get any better.</li>
            <li> But I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> With some practice you can get a better shave than a blade.  </li>
            <li> Instead I get used to use to shave with groomer and sure it never was a zero shaving</li>
            <li> LA63 delivers a shave I would rate at 4.5 stars but misses the mark in ergonomics, quality of feel and, most of all, maneuverability.</li>
            <li> nonsense close shave with reasonable comfort and easily wins my vote for best Panasonic 4-blade.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s currently selling on Amazon for an incredible $110!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not inclined to spend the extra $100 or more for the LV61-A (which for me is still the best of all shavers), you will likely be very happy with this model.</li>
            <li> Love the locking feature for travel.</li>
            <li> I have compared them to the top of the line braun and</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> Simply the best.</li>
            <li> I have owned every one of Braun and Panasonic&#x27;s better shavers for thirty or so years.  </li>
            <li> The razor smells better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a better shave, which is the bottom</li>
            <li> leads to even more skin irritation.</li>
            <li> If you decide to purchase this electric shaver then I sincerely hope that your shaving experience is better than mine was.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is always at the top of the list when it comes to Men&#x27;s Shaver and Panasonic ES-LV61-A</li>
            <li> I guess that the speed in which the blades spin makes it more efficient than their competition.</li>
            <li> For someone that drives a Toyota Camry and sees a Lexus LS 460 pass by there is always that nagging feeling that, yes, the Lexus is the better vehicle.</li>
            <li> This review might be more for those who are contemplating going from a 4 blade to a 5 blade razor</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES8243A for the last 4 years and have been very happy with the shave.</li>
            <li> It is a noticeably better shave.</li>
            <li> Will write more review after a month.</li>
            <li> Shave feels closer and smoother, was a worthwhile upgrade.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mostly for the wet-shave capability and mostly use the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I stated, I mostly use the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> For me, it gives a better shave than Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have owned this Panasonic shaver for almost two years and have been able to compare it with Braun&#x27;s Series 7-790 Pulsonic shaver, which I have used for about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is decided more by our beard type, shaving habits (frequency, etc.), face shape, and skin type.</li>
            <li> Very happy overall.</li>
            <li> so many fewer minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also seems to hold its charge better than the Arc4.</li>
            <li> This shaver is significantly more, but it&#x27;s also significantly better.</li>
            <li> Bottom line - this is a great shaver, but the price is VERY steep.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a lot better than the one on the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Which is what makes it all the more</li>
            <li> But my suitcase was stolen (shaver included) and I opted for Panasonic&#x27;s latest top of the line 5 blade model.</li>
            <li> Now after three months, the shaver performs much better after adjusting to my skin.  </li>
            <li> If I wait, the razor starts to smell more than I would like.</li>
            <li> best Christmas present</li>
            <li> The one hour charge lasts more than a week, and cleanup convenient...</li>
            <li> I tried shaving in the shower with soap, and the results were outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It works as well or better,</li>
            <li> go - it should get even better in time.</li>
            <li> make sure you register on line or mail in the registration card</li>
            <li> Cleaining is a snap and re-confirms how glad I am to have passed on the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using King Of Shaves gel and the results have been outstanding.</li>
            <li> The best prices for either are big surprise, on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> go - it should get even better in time.</li>
            <li> make sure you register on line or mail in the registration card</li>
            <li> Cleaining is a snap and re-confirms how glad I am to have passed on the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using King Of Shaves gel and the results have been outstanding.</li>
            <li> The best prices for either are big surprise, on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fully charged Philips gave me more than 10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Panasonic Wet/Dry Shavers over the years as I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the ability to shave in the shower with their shavers.</li>
            <li> :- )I then turn on the shaver&#x27;s 20-second ultrasonic cleaning mode.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Even better than my ES-LA63-S $129.00.</li>
            <li> I believe Panasonic wishes to keep people safe regardless of circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could have gone for a much cheaper device, but this device got tons of great reviews, so I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> a much better jobin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but</li>
            <li> If I had to purchase again I would definately look for a better charging set up</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think there is a need for so many blades.</li>
            <li> However for an electric shaver with a $500 MSRP many customers would expect a leather case and a cleaning brush to be included...if they were included I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 months and am glad I got it</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will ever buy another shaving device because of how much I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can trust anyone, you can surely trust a Sailor about this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it could survive a fall off the counter top</li>
            <li> The Norelco was slightly better.</li>
            <li> The shaver still does an OK job but needs to be recharged every 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Think twice about spending more than $100 on a shaver these days.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave!</li>
            <li> Might make him shave more than 1 or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I am hapy to pay more for the quality shave I get.</li>
            <li> Product better than advertised.</li>
            <li> Works better then</li>
            <li> Better than than my Braun 9595.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> But not with this one!&lt;br /&gt;First I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the shaver ever as it still gave me some of red skin.</li>
            <li> And it works like magic for more then 2 years now!&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> i sure it saves my time.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said that the LV61 gave him a better shave than the 790cc.  </li>
            <li> Since the day I started shaving with this, I&#x27;ve been waiting to get a better experience.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Phillips rotary</li>
            <li> I now others paid more and I probably would as well.</li>
            <li> Shave is the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and notably better than the Brauns (Series 5)</li>
            <li> I reviewed shavers on the web, and this was the top rated, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> This shaving system is one of those things for sure.</li>
            <li> 25% better than Braun 7 Series.</li>
            <li> Great product, shaves very close, takes me about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Like having a Japanese Rolls Royce and you will have it for years so why not buy the best</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for most times</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m well satisfied with this model and expect to have if for some time.  </li>
            <li> write this review having just shaved for the first time with the LV61 and let me tell you it is the smoothest shave I have ever had in my life (Including razor) !!!</li>
            <li> At first, the foil head seemed huge but with the pivoting feature, it feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> Well first of all I have to admit that I ordered this nice, nice razor for my husband.  </li>
            <li> I get a nice clean shave in faster time then</li>
            <li> I can easily compare it to a fresh good razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This razor performs smoothly around the curves of the face, gives a nice close shave, cleans easily, and holds its charge.  </li>
            <li> Best dry shave with an electric I have had... even better than my ES-LA63 which is my &amp;#34;shower shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Very clean shave</li>
            <li> Felt very smooth and easy to shave my beard.</li>
            <li> You pay more for it and the extras aren&#x27;t all that impressive, but when it comes down to shaving your face – this easily beats out what I own from Braun, Norelco, and Wahl.</li>
            <li> Unless this brakes within the next year, this shaver is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever had, superior to Braun or Philips.</li>
            <li> My Braun still didn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as I used to get with a razor, but it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased to say that I made the right choice with this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any shaving cream or oil, and the shaver does an excellent job both in the shower and dry.</li>
            <li> Add in the fact that it&#x27;s the most COMFORTABLE shave I&#x27;ve ever had by a mile, and I&#x27;m OK with the cost.</li>
            <li> I get a nice, smooth, irritation free shave with this combination of shaver and shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Shaves nice and close with no irritation, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I will use the &amp;#34;Williams Lectic Shave&amp;#34; I purchased at the sametime - excellent product paring, a smooth as silk combination.</li>
            <li> The quality has been great and digital display is nice feature to tell the amount of charge remaining.  </li>
            <li> This is very easy to clean by just holding it under running water while running for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> The LV61 is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean</li>
            <li> It gives me as close a shave as the blade razors use to and is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This unit is very easy to clean, rinse it out about once a week, and use soap once a month.</li>
            <li> Very light feel and close smooth shave..</li>
            <li> this time I went ahead knowing that this was the top of the line in panasonic and that both braun and panasonic are fine products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a fine razor</li>
            <li> I just lay it in a safe place and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The result is a trimmer of perfect length and better than the other two models discussed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice stretching the skin to get the best shave, but overall, excellent shaver.  </li>
            <li> I shave wet using shaving cream which the people at Panasonic said provides the best shave.  </li>
            <li> , most comfortable razor you could hope for.  </li>
            <li> Why is hygene all the more important in an electric shaver ?  </li>
            <li> I am confident that after a 2-3 minute shave my face is smooth as can be.  </li>
            <li> And many hours after I have shaved, my skin remains smooth.  </li>
            <li> make sure you look for the electronic coupon when adding this product to your cart if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been great.</li>
            <li> Compared to the rotary shaver, the Panasonic produces some more noise, but it is not annoying.</li>
            <li> This method kept most of the irritation and razor bumps away, but I could never achieve that smooth, close shave I desired.</li>
            <li> every 2-3 weeks anyways, what good does sterilizing it that one time really offer?  </li>
            <li> very close shave and good procuct.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Both are excellent instruments; the ES8243 is a better value, but the 5-cutter ESLV61 does cut just slightly closer+faster than the ES8243.  </li>
            <li> Rotary shavers have never been able to offer me the kind of close shave that I have been able to get through this particular foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is great for travel, battery lasts a few days on the road, and I can clean up the 5 o’clock shadow on the fly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a shaver that cuts close and quick, the Panasonic is easily the best in that area – only a razor blade will get you a closer shave</li>
            <li> I liked the idea that you clean it with soap with special cleaning program.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is easily the very best.  </li>
            <li> Easy</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;cleaning is easy and cost saving</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t purchase Panasonic&#x27;s either and am extremely pleased with the way it stays clean.</li>
            <li> When shaving, it&#x27;s easy to place your thumb on the on/off switch and accidentally turn it off.</li>
            <li> Press the on/off button for 2 seconds or more and it goes into \\&quot;clean mode\\&quot; and starts cleaning itself.</li>
            <li> This shaver which has five blade systems is an easy go over once system which gets to the root of the beard very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It might provide more comfort to have that feature, but it wasn&#x27;t worth how much more it was, to me.</li>
            <li> The head also mounts an integrated trimmer which is easily locked into place by a selector mounted below.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning was easy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a blade very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is well balanced and charges very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It cost more but if it lasts a couple years it will be more than worth it.  </li>
            <li> It advertises that cleanup is easy and it is, just rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> It did eventually provide a smooth shave, but not as smooth as it used to, and with more irritation of the skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely easily and once that occurs</li>
            <li> This is easy to avoid if you don&#x27;t add pressure.</li>
            <li> easy use, easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Also, the beard lube cleaned off easily under running water.</li>
            <li> The charging time is very quick also.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is by far the best I have ever used, (rotary or straight).</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easily done.  </li>
            <li> My Braun Complete 360 shaver isn&#x27;t good for travel because of the elaborate cleaning system.</li>
            <li> In that sense, I would rate it four stars for head shaving because it really does a good job; my head is cue-ball smooth when I am done.</li>
            <li> I got it at a good price and so far I am really satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> By far the most superior electric foil razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver for a superior shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is selling a good shaver as a luxury high end</li>
            <li> I still expect this to be something special, the electrical connector should work better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a very solid choice in a razor, and if you can swallow the large up front cost it should provide you many years of a great shaving experience!</li>
            <li> I liked the Braun Series 3, it provided a pretty close shave</li>
            <li> My beard is a challenge for anything I&#x27;ve tried (short of a sharpened rock), but this shaver does a beautiful job without breaking a sweat.</li>
            <li> Whilst this is the first time I have used a foil shaver, I am amazed at how effective this shaver is.</li>
            <li> The overall construction of the shaver is quite good and sturdy (accidentally dropped it once in the sink) though overall i&#x27;m just not that impressed.</li>
            <li> and I must say that everything I read about this shaver is true and I am really enjoying the close</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth; no pulls, and while I have to run over a patch of bristle more than once, my razor shave with hot foam or gel did not do the job as well.</li>
            <li> Also the most comfortable and easiest to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun 790cc - Hands down was the best electric razor I ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still hands down the best electric I have ever used</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still hands down the best electric I have ever used</li>
            <li> The LV61 is, hands down, the best of the Panasonics I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> After each shave I clean the razor by taking the head off and using an air can to clean out all of the shavings, it has worked pretty good for me this way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many electric razors over the years (most recently Braun&#x27;s), and this razor is BY FAR the best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I had a new replacement screen and blade set for my Arc 3, I installed them to make the comparison fair.  </li>
            <li> However all was fine.  </li>
            <li> Awesome shaver, shaves close, quickly, no cuts or burns.</li>
            <li> But, typically, if I have an appointment or engagement that requires me to look my best, I will go with the razor.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not a serial reviewer or anything, but I as a sufferer of shaving for most of my life I had to say this is the Grand Father Lord of all electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> and it works fine and continues to shave</li>
            <li> and it works fine and continues to shave</li>
            <li> Fine hair issue gone.</li>
            <li> The shaver does just fine in those areas.  </li>
            <li> shaver is light and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic replaced the unit under warranty, and the foil has been fine for the six months since then.  </li>
            <li> This may work fine on peach fuzz or if you have fine frog hair and you shave every morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but this is one fine shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent product was previously using a Braun &amp; Philips Arcitec shaver.</li>
            <li> the Arc 4 ES-LA-63 and 93 and shaves more quickly.</li>
            <li> I would urge you to never buy a can of edge, or for that matter most any shave cream that&#x27;s sold in super markets and drug stores.</li>
            <li> I would urge you to never buy a can of edge, or for that matter most any shave cream that&#x27;s sold in super markets and drug stores.</li>
            <li> Another thing worth mentioning is that head gets kind of hot, which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> So far he is impressed with his new shaver.</li>
            <li> Maybe, if you have to have the latest and greatest, but it seems to give the same results as my ES8243A did when it had new blades, and it&#x27;s about twice the price.</li>
            <li> The best thing about the new 5-blade Panasonic is that it indeed provides a better shave than my prior Panasonic!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, but it certainly lives up to its claims and provides an amazing shave.  </li>
            <li> The battery is also a huge improvement, with the four head getting just over 4 shaves compared to the five blades 7+...</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this shaver does!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ve tried almost every shaver from the Braun 7 series to the old 4 blade panasonic to the philips norelco 3d.</li>
            <li> The LED light on this newer model is brighter, so I can see it clearly even in a brightly lit room.</li>
            <li> It is a huge improvement over the ES8066.  </li>
            <li> Nothing too huge</li>
            <li> I was blown away by how fabulous this razor is.  </li>
            <li> It trims so well and leaves my legs so smooth.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- Close and Comfortable Shave</li>
            <li> shaver is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> did they cut as smooth as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Not that great doesn&#x27;t shave that well have to go over an over the same spot</li>
            <li> -- Another important thing is to dual voltage operability if you travel to Asia/Europe and this shaver can work with dual voltages  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> always feels smooth.    </li>
            <li> Light, and battery lasts for weeks on a charge.</li>
            <li> The shave with Panasonic is extremely smooth and close</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower using Nivea shaving cream and it is a smooth as silk shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has reached the level of the blade with protection of one&#x27;s skin thus achieving a close and comfortable shave.   </li>
            <li> My face comes out baby smooth.</li>
            <li> When I spend this kind of money, I absolutely expect to be in awe over the presentation.</li>
            <li> It delivers a close smooth shave all over my face.</li>
            <li> On the one hand it works for places like sideburns and light mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> If you buy something you&#x27;re going to use everyday, why not get the best?</li>
            <li> on a blood thinner, it is important that I do not cut myself shaving.</li>
            <li> but still need a blade to make it really smooth.</li>
            <li> Before using the Panasonic LV61 electric shaver, I never thought that an electric shaver can give a smooth and close shave as a razor.</li>
            <li> The body is finished in a 3/4 slip-resistant &amp; fingerprint resistant material, which is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> The body is also contoured for a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li> I feel as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s posterior.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and purchase those cheap $4 razors....</li>
            <li> By far the best after a Braun 7505 (former favorite) and a Braun 8000 series flagship that dropped and cracked the head.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Arc 5 electric shaver provides a close, irritation free shaving experience, and has an efficient and convenient sonic cleaning mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but I still have difficulty in attaining a smooth shave in one area of stubborn growth.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the quicker description; however (again, in my case), my Arc 3 was never as smooth or as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> woulnt fit the Panasonic charger</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this shaver.....</li>
            <li> skin is smooth to the touch with no stubble at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;important is TOO free because it&#x60;s not well damped.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> after about a week my face is as smooth as a babys bottom.  </li>
            <li> smooth, close shave</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a smooth finish at all.</li>
            <li> but my chin is as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> smooth operation - no snagging or pulling</li>
            <li> overall, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> the question is would I have paid for this if it didn&#x27;t come to me for free as part of the Vine programs, knowing what I know now?</li>
            <li> The shaver felt almost too light when I started using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a great fan of Panasonic razors and have been one for several years.  </li>
            <li> The shaves are always smooth and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as easy to clean the razor itself.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I had purchased the shaver on Amazon and still had the purchase acknowledgment in my email files.  </li>
            <li> Every place is baby smooth after shave.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen is available here on Amazon ([[ASIN:B003NGN3A2</li>
            <li> I bought this one after 3.5 years of great service from the earlier gen LA93 Arc4.</li>
            <li> B00B6A8JQA Aveeno Men&#x27;s Shave Gel, Fragrance Free, 7 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li> Ditch the cheap shavers, ditch the razors, get the Arc V.</li>
            <li> With tis shaver you get a cheap plug that goes into the bottom.</li>
            <li> ES-LV61 seems to cut the stubble below the skin level and the result is a baby skin smooth shave which still feels smooth by lunch.  </li>
            <li> Washing is easy and they recommend a bit of liquid hand soap to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, does not require a cleaning station.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> the cheap ones that you get from Walmart</li>
            <li> Have been using the LV61 for several weeks and the results have been great.  </li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and had no tugging or scraping.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that today&#x27;s generation has Li-Ion batteries to keep up with current technology!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and to take care of.</li>
            <li> It sound like my neighbor is using his chainsaw.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a shave on a cheap budget you  will probably be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Cheap soap costs too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;-Fast, smooth, and comfortable</li>
            <li> life isn&#x27;t very impressive, I find myself charging it every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It glides comfortably and is not too noisy.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I took out a Square Trade warranty when I purchased the shaver, and they are reimbursing me for the cost of the item without any hassle at all.</li>
            <li> The skin felt smooth afterwards and was not irritated.</li>
            <li> Smooth and close with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I have a light beard.  </li>
            <li> thay gave me a good close shave and have always lasted 5 or more years with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> many, many years ago when they first came out and indeed that is a great shaver with a really long battery life.  </li>
            <li> Amazing tool!!!!!!! Feel like the guy who&#x27;s had his head in the sand and finally caught up to modern day technology.</li>
            <li> It shaved almost as close as a blade with no irritation, way superior to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition and 2 days early.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Those are better at touching up hair around the ears and curly whiskers close to sideburns where the whole head can&#x27;t pass over them.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, this shaver is great for head shaving too, and the larger head actually makes the shaver ideal for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Pour in some liquid hand soap right in the top and it gives itself a bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I just need some more usage to get the right hold.</li>
            <li> The LED display is very bright, and easy to read, even in a pitch black room.  </li>
            <li> - the lock is actually very useful during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Panasonic should have taken a page from so many other luxury product makers and created a beautiful box worthy of this price.</li>
            <li> Clean, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This really gives you a nice clean close shave.</li>
            <li> I have had other Panasonic models before but this one is just incredible, it is almost as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely THRILLED with my new ARC 5 shaver!</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver, very smooth and still adjusting to reaching all areas on my face.</li>
            <li> There are some great features - it is wet/dry so you can use it wherever, the LCD screen gives you detailed info about how charged it is, how long you&#x27;ve used it, etc.  </li>
            <li> The shave is quick and easy, and the result is even smoother than after a blade shave.</li>
            <li> Nice follow up to the older model.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy shaving.</li>
            <li> The cleaning procedure was easy, and much better than getting the large bulky canisters with the alcohol soak.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but it certainly does an awesome job dry.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the very best shaving experience I have have had shavers from Philips and Braun, but this takes my shaving experience to  a new level.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and shaving with this shaver is quick and leaves you clean</li>
            <li> have always received great shaves from the ES-LT41 and the ES-RT51, but the shaves I am now get from this ES-LV61 are significantly better and take less time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how they keep improving this product but very happy with it.</li>
            <li> got it for same price of top Arc4 with cleaning station, but thought 5 cutters are better plus the better balance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Original post:</li>
            <li> ######## I originally put this as a comment, but pasting it here since it&#x27;s applicable ########3  Replacement Foil and Blades report:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  </li>
            <li> I emailed them a copy of my original receipt from Amazon and my serial #&#x27;s &amp; case #&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> When the Braun system is $200 and generally does a good job, the Panasonic seems overpriced.</li>
            <li> When the Braun system is $200 and generally does a good job, the Panasonic seems overpriced.</li>
            <li> Nothing revolutionary in my mind, but it is effective, and most likely the closest electric shave available.  </li>
            <li> How rare is that!?</li>
            <li> I got a remarkably closer shave everywhere on my face but especially so under my chin and jaw.  </li>
            <li> Strong, powerful, quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> And powerful, as well!</li>
            <li> I never seen him this excited he said it worked like knife on butter.</li>
            <li> I still needed another pass with a small foil Wahl, as the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t function at its best when used sideways-</li>
            <li> This one is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever used which is a LOT better.  </li>
            <li> The first time I took of the top off to rinse it out, I accidentally popped out one of the foils out of the head.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver about which I can safely say: yes, it DOES shave as close or closer than a Gillette.</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed, this razor is like driving a luxury automobile.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the LV61 so far.</li>
            <li> It provides a quick, fast, comfortable shave and is very easy to clean even without the optional cleaning accessory.  </li>
            <li> It was also easy to maintain with the easy cleaning method using hand soap and hot water from your faucet.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is light weight, gives a much closer shave than the Braun 799 and a much much more friendly experience than the Norelco 9300 (see their reviews).</li>
            <li> It also helps to keep the shaver in like new condition and smelling quite nice.</li>
            <li> I thought the large head on the LV-61 would be a problem, but the shaver is light, is very comfortable to hold and the head size actually feels good against my head, face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic linear shaver and it is by far the best.</li>
            <li> To Clean&lt;br /&gt;You can easily clean the shaver by rinsing it under tap water while it is running.</li>
            <li> Plus, you can clean it with liquid soap and water and also shave with water and shaving cream if you prefer.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic I own and love them.  </li>
            <li> It does cut cleanly and to the skin but does not cut neck hair that well at all.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would have the facility to clean and charge as well,it did not</li>
            <li> There is an illuminated LCD display on the front that lets you know battery status, the length of your shave, when to clean the shaver heads, when to replace the shaver heads, and when the sonic cleaning mode is activated.  </li>
            <li> I would just buy the razor and clean it with water after each use, or once a week.</li>
            <li> and it is way easier to clean</li>
            <li> I guess you have to clean it with water as the instructions say.</li>
            <li> That said, it works like a charm and amazon is directly responsible for the tremendous joy of enjoying it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> to clean with liquid soap under running water&lt;br /&gt;-Ultra</li>
            <li> You use liquid soap and the \\&quot;clean mode\\&quot; to buzz it clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through several and this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s soap based and unlike the alcohol based Braun Clean &amp; renew it causes buildup and doesn&#x27;t strip the blades clean.</li>
            <li> All you need is a drop, press for sonic clean (keep the foil on) rinse and viola</li>
            <li> All you need is a drop, press for sonic clean (keep the foil on) rinse and viola</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> This one has a five blade system thus giving a very close shave and also much quieter noise and vibration wise.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;- Bright blue LED light, stays on while charging –</li>
            <li> Also, I found that I could clean the razor just as well myself by applying some liquid soap and running it under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was replacing my old Panasonic shaver ES8003, which I had for ten years and was excellent.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t do a clean job if you want to trim around your beard or sideburns.</li>
            <li> It just trims it but do NOT perform a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> If you wanted to clean something, would you keep a cup of hairy soapy water to rinse it with for a month?</li>
            <li> a winner,easy clean and a close shave.....</li>
            <li> I need to use razor to clean that area.</li>
            <li> Looks fantastic, runs fantastic, charges quick, 1 hour battery, on-button lock, trimmer, multi-adjustable head, super close shave...</li>
            <li> I switched to blades for a few years and loved the nice close shave feeling...until my wife figured out</li>
            <li> Good quality , clean shave , easy to clean and long</li>
            <li> Plus for while not being the ultimate machine it pretty much beats the competition in what it does best.</li>
            <li> I keep believing that half points pinpoint products more accurately than whole points for as I was saying earlier a Toyota Camry very much so would deserve a 4 Stars if it is every bit as good as the slogan that it is the best selling vehicle in its class</li>
            <li> You can be just as luxurious in the Mercedes and be perfectly content, but when you want fine-attention to detail, slight improvements here and there, elegance, a nice solid feel, you splurge, sometimes twice the price of a Mercedes, so that you can roll around in style - the Rolls-Royce!    </li>
            <li> Like a fine luxury car, it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use - nice comfortable hold &amp; quiet in running.</li>
            <li> Specially if you have a rough/hard beard.  </li>
            <li> The razor fits fine, but good luck with the power cord if you&#x27;re going on a long trip.  </li>
            <li> under my jaw and neck could have been a bit better (Still very smooth), and would be, had I spent more time shaving those areas...</li>
            <li> In fact, it does as great job as my razors -- and the mild irritation that such close shave typically brings: that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li> This is the best model I&#x27;ve owned so far and easily beats out shavers I&#x27;ve tried from other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> I was quite sceptical at first since all my life I used good old blades.</li>
            <li> Works great with a wet beard also.</li>
            <li> The shave is great, not much better than the Arc 4, but better.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, better than the Braun 760</li>
            <li> Still, it was good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> and I got a good one on this 170$ including international shipping.</li>
            <li> It also has a feature where you can charge it for 10 minutes and then get in a full shave.</li>
            <li> It has always been my experience that shavers, no matter how good, can never quite give you the same shave as a razor.</li>
            <li> Trying to remember my chin-stubble test for when my LA63 was brand-new, I think both are very close and still better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> The price on the LV61 (about $150 recently) was too good to pass-up.  </li>
            <li> and it holds a charge for almost a full week.  </li>
            <li> Is it really THAT much better than the four head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid, good looking razor.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Control wise the shaver is very simple.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve had several but none have been as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> Really close shave, much better than the rotary style shavers.  </li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t sure if it made sense to spend as much as the Panasonic</li>
            <li> I have not used my razor for a full month</li>
            <li> This shaver reminds me a whole lot to their top of the line that come with the cleaning system as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;-Well-balanced, solid feel - good ergonomics&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-1 hr to full charge</li>
            <li> If I had to pay full price now, I would do it.  </li>
            <li> In the interests of full disclosure, I received this item through Amazon Vine.</li>
            <li> for I think this is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.   </li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s 45 day grace period is more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I am a true Braun user since the Eltron days.  </li>
            <li> The regular tap-water rinse is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it&#x27;s true that it takes between 3 and 4 weeks for your skin to get used to the razor, and</li>
            <li> The box comes with the razor of course, a manual, charger, nice quality soft carrying case and a plastic head protector.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it&#x27;s true that it takes between 3 and 4 weeks for your skin to get used to the razor, and</li>
            <li> The box comes with the razor of course, a manual, charger, nice quality soft carrying case and a plastic head protector.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery showed a full charge but the motor would not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, instead, they were going to send me a full refund of my purchase price.  </li>
            <li> The display is really helpful as it gives you the percent of battery life remaining as well as how many minutes and seconds</li>
            <li> like I said for this much money they should have a better system.</li>
            <li> my last Panasonic was good</li>
            <li> The Panasonic gives the absolute closest shave I have ever had in my life, the shave process feels more like</li>
            <li> Much closer and better then</li>
            <li> then tried the 4 blade Panasonic, liked the shave, tried it in the shower, didn&#x27;t help more, so I used it dry.</li>
            <li> is what I do and what works the best for me: only shave in shower, put some liquid soap on your face and then shave with slow moves touching your skin very lightly.</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to use and has a lot of motion.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit high but it is definitely worth every buck and most importantly...</li>
            <li> I think that the nano sharp blades that move at the faster speed have combined to make this a great product.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is great and since 2010 I&#x27;m not using any other type of razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many shavers over the years, a majority of them by Remington, most recently Braun.  </li>
            <li> very well designed, solid and fits great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit</li>
            <li> Many have come close and are more than sufficient for my daily shaving needs.</li>
            <li> On the plus side:  It charges quickly.</li>
            <li> : very close shave and fast, nice trimmer that works well</li>
            <li> Panasonic has decent warranty service, but it is still a hassle and will probably take a month or more.  </li>
            <li> I read some concerns about the sound being loud but shaving in the shower negates most of it.</li>
            <li> Excellent electric razor - love the larger screen area than my previous razor had</li>
            <li> Super quality construction in all areas.</li>
            <li> As I said the shave with this is quick</li>
            <li> Well at the time 1-2 years ago he bought the best and most expensive Braun shaver that could find in the store.</li>
            <li> am getting the best shave ever above my upper lip...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve primarily been a manual shaver man most of my life, bouncing from the early Mach 3s, to Remingtons, and then my trusty Fusion.  </li>
            <li> A quick 5-10 minute charge will get you maybe 1-2 shaves.  </li>
            <li> It does, however, seem to charge relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> shaver has a rubber back and a nicely shaped handle that makes shaving comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It trims my sideburns quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Close, fast shave Easy to clean  Cons:</li>
            <li> So much better than my older Braun.</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied but could be better.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different electric razors in many price ranges.  </li>
            <li> This one is not the top selection on the distinguished Panasonic line up but seems to share the same components of their more costly siblings.</li>
            <li> The battery charges reasonably quickly, about one hour and lasts for 20 shaves or so.  </li>
            <li> The great feature of this of course is that this supports wet shave, which is particularly useful for this shaver.</li>
            <li> &gt;* 5 minute quick charge&lt;br</li>
            <li> I particularly like being able to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and you run out of power – luckily it quick-charges in emergencies</li>
            <li> The way this shaver adjusts to facial contours is great and the shave is so gentle.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the mornings when I am in a hurry and need a quick shave</li>
            <li> I had - smooth shave, fast and comfortable</li>
            <li> and how quickly it did.</li>
            <li> shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be cleaned quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Pivoting head and built in trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> At the end we find the shaver perfect for my sensitive skin , no hard work , not very noisy and very light .&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> it is so close and very easy on sensitive skin wih ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I did read reviews (like this one), and found it received a high number of reviews like mine, so went ahead and bought it, and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Myself I am not yet sure if I will continue to use this or return to my high end rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> far as electric razors go this is a decent unit but can&#x27;t rate it higher since there are flaws, and it just isn&#x27;t that great of a shave when compared to a razor blade.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied overall with this shaver.</li>
            <li> would recommend staying with a normal shaver :)</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic, come 5:00, my skin is still pretty smooth with almost no stubble.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from my Arc4 when it finally stopped working and am very pleased with the Arc5.</li>
            <li> It was comfortable on my face from the first day of use.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d buy an electric razor that would be better than a normal disposable safety razor.</li>
            <li> The fact that I no longer have to worry about slicing a sweet two-inch layer of skin off my scalp any given morning (which is what prompted my purchase to begin with) makes using electric shavers worth the aggravation.</li>
            <li> The stubble that remained was almost equivalent to a full day&#x27;s worth of growth.</li>
            <li> Quick easy and fast ....</li>
            <li> highly recommend Aveeno Men&#x27;s Shave Gel, Fragrance Free, 7 oz available from Amazon.</li>
            <li> One other thing I liked was that the shaver was easy to clean.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re almost better off buying a new, cheaper shaver every year.</li>
            <li> Also a set of blades cost more than a brand new Norelco shaver</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and use and charges fast.</li>
            <li> a cool, comfortable straight razor, Barber shop quality</li>
            <li> It is easy on my skin, with a dab of lotion my skin looks good – same old face!  </li>
            <li> While I ordinarily never pass up any gadget, I get a better result with the hand soap.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a reason for the hot towels, the shaving brush and the rich dense creams.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a reason for the hot towels, the shaving brush and the rich dense creams.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m impressed, most of my cons are also problems with other razors – it&#x27;s a bit nit-picky, but considering the higher cost I hold it to a higher standard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be short... Could not be better!</li>
            <li> Really nice, I had a previous model with 3 cutters, but this is much better.</li>
            <li> I tried a Braun foil.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning method as described in so many of the comments for this shaver is as everyone says: very simple, very quick:</li>
            <li> But if I shaved after a 2-3 period, this shaver did a very good job at nailing down the growth to a smooth shave with minimal burn, better than the norelco.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to dry off afterwards and theunreachable dries easily sitting on the shelf in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I like how fast I can get a quick shave – not the smoothest – but good enough for work.</li>
            <li> but I reckon if it does the job well for which it was designed that should be the primary yardstick and this one certainly measures</li>
            <li> + minutes to get a decent shave with my old shaver, depending on how long it had been since I&#x27;d cleaned it, this one gives me a superb shave in 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> An investment in a good electric shaver really pays over time - no price is small to wake up each day in the morning, get a clean shave in a minute or two and walk out confidently.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately with the sale, I was able to get one at just a little more than a 4 blade cost.</li>
            <li> that will save money and time on cleaining and keep it in good shape for future.&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed at all, this beast took me less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> For the year it works, the shave is fantastic- bought it based on recommendations on here- handled my problem shaving areas very well.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, smooth skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> Performance definitely a step up from my old Braun, smooth comfortable and close shave with no tugging experienced so far.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades shave very closely, and the freely pivoting head help keep them in close contact with your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Only issue that you will feel its huge to use under the neck, but at last I can go to work fully shaved :)</li>
            <li> The thing that kept me from giving it up was that the areas it did cut, were very close and smooth.  </li>
            <li> free, non-irritating, absolutely closest shave you will ever experience in your life.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and fast.  </li>
            <li> The shave is worth 5 stars, but the price compared to the Arc4 shavers led me to give it a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> Plus, a couple reviewers said it was worth the upgrade.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> , I feel it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have primarily used Norelco (Philips) and Braun products, but recently was able to use one of the Panasonic shavers (the ES-LA63-S).</li>
            <li> Reading those comments from others made me laugh before I received the razor.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li> One nice improvement is that there&#x27;s a \\&quot;lock-ring\\&quot; for the power button such that it prevents the shaver from accidentally turning on if you shove it in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> get so far around a weeks worth of shave or more before I recharge.</li>
            <li> , I love it so far (2 days).</li>
            <li> This model is a clear improvement and a clear step towards the best possible shave!</li>
            <li> but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> But is it really worth $500?</li>
            <li> /&gt;The value equation, is it really worth $500?</li>
            <li> /&gt;The value equation, is it really worth $500?</li>
            <li> razor may career a hefty price tag, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the expense.  </li>
            <li> Remember the old adage that an electric shaver will never be able to replicate the results of a manual blade or razor?  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works no differently, and I was able to get a smooth trim on my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps more troubling is its face shaving capability (or lack thereof), which when you think about it, makes no sense because it was designed for the face rather than the scalp as far as I know.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a Panasonic ES8228 shaver that was 4 years old and 2 blade shaver did a better job on my neck..</li>
            <li> well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good, but not what I expected for the price I pay.</li>
            <li> He loved it so much that I bought a second one for my husband.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the price?  </li>
            <li> The head is not too big and it fits nice in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money invested.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> most in a shaver is a head that pivots from front to back as I find that necessary to do a good job on my neck and jawline.</li>
            <li> I sometimes cannot tell the difference in shave closeness between this and the LV61-A, although the latter is definitely more comfortable in terms of smoothness.</li>
            <li> This is good for anyone in the military.</li>
            <li> I can only report my own findings, based on my application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to clean, but needs frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li> The three heads of the Norelco cover more area than the rectangular head of the Panasonic, but this isn&#x27;t really an advantage in real life.</li>
            <li> And it will put a smile on your face.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li> My biggest issue that I still have with the shaver is that it requires a lot of cleaning, much more frequently then the sensor states.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pending that, I can say this purchase was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the difference in price is worth having this one versus the 4 blade since I have not used that one.  </li>
            <li> Rather than gliding across my skin and taking the stubble off all in one pass, it dragged and skipped across my skin, pulling on but not cutting the stubble.  </li>
            <li> Much like a straight blade or safety razor, let the weight do most of the work.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the extra $100 bucks - not for me, cleaning systems come with their own set of problems and added</li>
            <li> it was worth a shot</li>
            <li> it was worth a shot</li>
            <li> As mentioned in my initial review, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if the replacement shaver is also covered by a fresh 2 year warranty?</li>
            <li> This last one was good but it just caused way too much irritation.</li>
            <li> Three more are driven by two clips that are attached directly to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the close shave.</li>
            <li> LED screen is useful, keeping track of shave time and battery life</li>
            <li> The Braun was good but not perfect and was as good as I thought I could get UNTIL this Panasonic came along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Its pricy but worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost of either shaver is well worth the price and the investment.  </li>
            <li> and I had 2 day&#x27;s worth of stubble to deal with.  </li>
            <li> but you get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Maybe worth $20-25.&lt;br /&gt;  2.</li>
            <li> , as surprised as I am to admit it, if you upgrade from an Arc 4 you are going to love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have actually completely stopped using my manual razor now which is great because the entire shaving process before took almost 10 minutes when using a manual razor.</li>
            <li> Got it on sale for $150--and worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the faster the foil vibrates, the more efficient it is in giving a clean shave on the very first run and this is currently the fastest in the market  Comparison to Braun  :</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve used Braun dry shavers for many years and was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to not put your hand or finger on that button while using the razor (when the on / off switch is pressed for too long, the razor goes into clean mode).</li>
            <li> Other Good features  :</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> About once per year is the right time frame.</li>
            <li> About once per year is the right time frame.</li>
            <li> older four head model did the same in nearly seven minutes, and I thought that was good!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a year ago, mainly because I liked that you can clean it regularly with some soap and water.</li>
            <li> Note: I MUST clean it daily, it is quick and easy, but every day.</li>
            <li> Clean up with soap and water is a real advantage.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I cannot get a clean face shave no matter how much time I spend.</li>
            <li> An upgrade from KOS would be the British - Taylors Of Old Bond Street, one of the densist creams there are, the formula hasn&#x27;t changed in hundreds of years - it&#x27;s a remarkable product.</li>

            <li> This shaver is very expensive, but I wanted the best and I love Panasonic equipment</li>
            <li> If you want to stop this movement, however, you can engage the head lock button and get full concentration on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The flip side of this missing feature, happily, is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re thinking of plunking down $500 for a shaver, you may think that you&#x27;ll get something that plays music and provides a back massage in addition to an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I really like the new design because it helps to get more stubble on the \\&quot;up\\&quot; stroke than my 4-blade Panasonic ES-LA63-S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above, I think that Panasonic delivers some seriously good shavers and sometimes when brand new, their prices seem to attest to that fact.</li>
            <li> The shaver head is very large and almost seems like overkill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for three months but am not concerned about the longevity since my previous Panasonic performed flawlessly for a couple years.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Shaving both wet and dry is excellent.</li>
            <li> I had been using Philips SensoTouch 3D 1260X for about 2 years before, and was more or less satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The handle feels solid, strong and comfortable.</li>
            <li> You wonder if it&#x27;s worth the higher price tag?</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to experiment on what works for you, but generally I&#x27;ve found that the simpler the better.  </li>
            <li> Another great plus is that there are no more cleaner cartridges to buy.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I normally use blades (Mach 3), which are comfortable and shave close.  </li>
            <li> Shaves barely any better than my ES8259.</li>
            <li> Mostly because I&#x27;ve always had to use a regular razor to tidy up the neck, since there was always hair and stubble left there.  </li>
            <li> great item, use it everyday, in our household!</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, this model is worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are not RAZOR SHARP and does not perform as good as a razor but the results are really consistent and even...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sit on the fence with this one, it&#x27;s the best electric, wet dry shaver you can get at any price, just buy it!</li>
            <li> I began looking for a new razor and was worried at first as I had used a rotary style unit my entire life but the Panasonic foil units got some really good reviews.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a quick and easy to use system that in the long run will save you money.  </li>
            <li> The new Panasonic with five blades is easier to shave with than the Braun, but not by a huge margin.</li>
            <li> the Panasonic does the right job and does it consistently...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 10 times better dry shave than the Braun and the wet shave is the best I have ever had outside of a barber shop.</li>
            <li> A wide array of five blades makes it challenging to smoothly shave under the nose or under the ear at the jaw line.</li>
            <li> That shaver had its own quality issues, but I am reminded that it actually provides a much closer shave for me than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> upper level units are far superior.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver overall, it is a bit spendy but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This model has a huge head that pivots freely from front to back and side to side.</li>
            <li> The next time I used the shaver I noticed it did a good job of of sucking up the shaving gel which clogs up the foil which I expect is finer than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> Super fast charge.</li>
            <li> Then I spray USkincare Damask Rose Hydrosol Regenerating Toner on my face and neck, tap my face with my fingertips to spread the toner, and let it dry for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> He just started using it and says it gives him a nice close shave, even using dry.</li>
            <li> these areas, but this shaver required repeated passes to do a complete job, one which was handled easily by the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I never thought that increasing my pay out for a shaving device would actually help, but it really, really did.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver at a good time, my old one was starting to nick and show signs of wear.</li>
            <li> you have a light to average beard or are simply satisfied with a good but not spectacular shave at a reasonable cost, IMHO you don&#x27;t need more than the 8103S.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the overall battery life as I&#x27;m able to get about an hours worth of shaving time out of one charge and the recharge time is pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> The LV61 is the first electric shaver that I can honestly say shaves difficult areas as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li> The first shave I did with this was dry, and it was fairly amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;very very very close shaving&lt;</li>
            <li> and therefore you aren&#x27;t using very much electricity hence the longer charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not completely annoying, but if you shave in the same room that the wife/girlfriend is sleeping in, they will most likely get woken up by the sound.  </li>
            <li> Fast, easy to clean under the faucet, gives a close, comfortable shave and rivals a blade razor when used wet with a shaving gel which is my preferred way to shave</li>
            <li> in 30s both the outside and the inside are clean like new - that is easier even than cleaning my dry/wet Norelco as the sonic motion and liquid soap made it simpler.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend! :)</li>
            <li> My three year old Panasonic electric shaver finally gave up and I started a new search for a great wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> Dry, the shave was not any better than my more than 6 year old Braun with worn cutter.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products from safety razors, cheap electric razors and of course the pro glide, mach 3 etc</li>
            <li> For example, with the Norelco it would take about 12 minutes to get a full, decent shave.  </li>
            <li> It was also good to be able to use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This gets just as close and is easy on the skin and such a quick shave</li>
            <li> The rotary was always king of getting those hardy little buggers, but this one&#x27;s pretty good, too.</li>
            <li> (I prefer ELTRON to Remington&#x27;s version which leaves residue) on a heavy beard with some bristle that doesn&#x27;t grow perpendicular to my skin (IE: some grow flat atop the skin surface), now with a growing number of the tougher gray whiskers, and a close-cropped van-dyke (what most folks call a goatee).&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s maiden shearing was a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is huge and as a result I couldn&#x27;t get the hairs directly under my nose.</li>
            <li> My first Arc5 died during the warranty period</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver with shaving cream, and I&#x27;m amazed at the improvement.</li>
            <li> I have owned many and when the last one broke</li>
            <li> All problems have been while travelling where razor is not in the exact position</li>
            <li> I think shavers have passed their logical limit in number of blades.</li>
            <li> First shaver ever that has cut the hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> Judging myself as having a lighter stubble/beard growth pattern than most, you will likely want to replace your blades every 8-12 months for optimal shaving results.]    </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get so hot</li>
            <li> Also, as I own the cleaning unit version of the Arc 4 (ES LA-93) as well,  I can say with confidence,the Panasonic shavers come cleaner when you simply rinse them with hand soap and do the normal sonic cleaning routine.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I was willing to pay for the shipping and repair, but soon found out that the ES-RT51 (purchased from Amazon) was still under the two year warranty.</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of Panasonic shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> This is the first high-end electric shaver that I bought.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought the top of the line to shave my husband, who needs personal care.</li>
            <li> It shaves consistently well.  </li>
            <li> the ESLV-61 was simply that much better.  </li>
            <li> First, some background.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t matter whether I shave in the shower or just splash some hot water on my face before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The front to back pivot is much better damped</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because of its higher speed and additional blades.</li>
            <li> This is the first to deliver a close shave that allows me to toss my traditional razor which in he past I have kept for occasions where I&#x27;ve needed to look my best.</li>
            <li> It is my first experience&lt;</li>
            <li> Very pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love everything about being Italian except  one thing -- that  never ending 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> skin is noticeably softer after my first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I do not know exactly why</li>
            <li> too many to choose from, total baloney I say</li>
            <li> I took advantage of an Amazon sale last week and was able to get this LV61 for $150 even though my ES8243A was still working mechanically</li>
            <li> Had several razors over the years including top of the line Braun and most recently a Norelco Senso Touch 3D.  </li>
            <li> My first Panasonic.</li>
            <li> much are 70 hours worth to you?  </li>
            <li> Panasonic tells you to shave with a back and forth motion, rather than the rotary motion most electric shavers tell you to use.</li>
            <li> On pg.3 of the manual there is precaution about cleaning the shaver with hot water.</li>
            <li> Then I heat some water to 180º F while my shaving brush is soaking in hot water in the sink.</li>
            <li> But my skin seemed to adjust and after the first week</li>
            <li> Seeing my last attempts were rotary, I decided to give foil a chance to see if the results were any better.  </li>
            <li> This razor provides a close shave with no irritation, which for me is a first.  </li>
            <li> Shaving was much easier, and my skin was much smoother afterward, and stayed smooth for much longer into the day.  </li>
            <li> Panasonics may be a bit pricey, but the warranty support more than enough makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same spot (not as many times anyway)</li>
            <li> Pop off the cover, and just rinse everything with hot water.</li>
            <li> you most recently used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice rubbery grip, though I haven&#x27;t used it for wet shaving</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is my first Panasonic electric shaver</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver was an Arc 4 from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> all of the stellar reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as for the shaving performance, It&#x27;s been 4 days since my last shave and my face is literally baby-butt smooth!</li>
            <li> First Panasonic shaver purchased after Philips and Braun.</li>
            <li> You may want to tray a signal razor first as well and save some money.</li>
            <li> Price is higher</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it only takes 1 hour to recharge.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that the ES-LV61-A is the exact shame shaver as the ES-LV81-K.  </li>
            <li> Actualy, I use LV61 model for more than two years and this one i bought as a present for my father.</li>
            <li> I actually spend more time jamming this electric into my skin over and over to get the remaining whiskers than I would with the ritual</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve been using different electric shavers for about 20 years (braun mostly), I gave it the time manual says.</li>
            <li> you have chance, try it first.</li>
            <li> Yes, the results will improve in time but first shaves will give an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive, but a great shave!</li>
            <li> The first hundred being the cost.</li>
            <li> Dual voltage, wet/dry, easy to clean, built-in display to tell you how much of a charge is left.</li>
            <li> If not for left over hair that it couldn&#x27;t get no matter how many passes I made I would go with this product.</li>
            <li> Finally fed up with the challenge of cleaning top of the line Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever posted.</li>
            <li> However, the foil ripped within a month of first purchasing it, and Panasonic refused to replace it under warranty, after first telling me they would.</li>
            <li> During the last years, I realized that the shave was not satisfactory any more, even though I replaced the rotary blades as recommended.</li>
            <li> As you know if you have used electric shavers before, this may be a first.  </li>
            <li> Again, maybe a first.  </li>
            <li> My prior favorite was the Panasonic Vortex ES 8109 and its nondocking relatives.</li>
            <li> This razor takes far fewer passes to leave a smooth face.</li>
            <li> The head on this model feels like it pivots better than the models with fewer blades: maybe it is the larger surface.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Really good everyday electric shaver, but</li>
            <li> Saving 10 solid minutes (maybe more) of shaving every single day for a better result, is indeed worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Excellent results, very smooth with no irritation, and does it every other day in three minutes or a bit less, although not as close under the chin  initially as a Norelco rotary.  </li>
            <li> new one feels better in the hands than my old one.  </li>
            <li> shave closr then previous rotary shaver and happy so far.</li>
            <li> Other reviews of less than perfect shaves may not have figured out the shaver needed more rinses during the shave to keep the foil open.</li>
            <li> The shave is pretty smooth for an electric razor, The brush and safety razor is a little closer and smoother, but I am satisfied with this Panasonic Electric Razor, I use a pre electric shave lotion, so my face is not irritated.</li>
            <li> Not with a $20 shaver or even the most expensive rotary shaver will you get this kind of a feeling - I can tell you from my own personal experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros: Easy to clean, holds charge for long time, charges fast, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I pretty much keep my beard most of the year and just shave under the neck daily.  </li>
            <li> Check out the other reviews and make up your own mind.  </li>
            <li> However, rather than being the shaver itself, it&#x27;s because I am, like I mentioned previously, skinny AND bony, but other than that, it&#x27;s and awesome shaver and</li>
            <li> I have not tried a wet shave yet, but it does clean up easy under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Lastly, a display screen with bright blue LED digits showsbattery life</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough for wet shaving with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> have owned a Braun 3 series for 5 years and never really felt the shaving performance was that great, especially when compared to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shaves extremly clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Comes with a Sonic vibrate cleaner which create a pulsating action when you hold it under water - it will clean the micro follicles in the shaver.  </li>
            <li> This panasonic is easily the most expensive,  but it does more than the job.  </li>
            <li> Dry feature is nice if you like to shave in the shower, but I do my shaving before I get in the shower, so I can&#x27;t really comment too much on that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it looks like it needs it, clean the razor under running water using an old toothbrush for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> today offer a charge to last for a couple of days, which is good enough.    </li>
            <li> The good news, the Panasonic website sells them and they are in the $15 arena (the foils are much more expensive, $60).</li>
            <li> The good news, the Panasonic website sells them and they are in the $15 arena (the foils are much more expensive, $60).</li>
            <li> The first feature you&#x27;ll notice about the Panasonic is the particularly strikingly large head, comprising 5-blades.  </li>
            <li> As I (and apparently others) have had less than an excellent experience with various electric razor washers, and as the Panasonic with the washer is $100 more (!)</li>
            <li> Thought it just might shave a little closer, but really all up I am very satisfied with my first Amazon purchase.  </li>
            <li> I agree with all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have read all the positive comments and I respect your opinions.</li>
            <li> [Small Update 10-8-2011: When you charge the 4-blade LA63 overnight, when it is done, it will brightly glow and blink \\&quot;100%\\&quot;</li>
            <li> my stubble is pretty reasonable.  </li>
            <li> but this is pretty much the elite of shavers.</li>
            <li> I am a blade and badger brush guy, and so I really debated shelling out the money to buy my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Basically, this thing shaves extremely well and is a real pleasure to own.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster than all my other shavers, yet smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to spend this much money on an electric razor, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The wet shave on the Braun is just as close as the Panasonic, and the much more compact head cuts closer to features like the nose and ears, and works better in the concave area under the back corners of the jaw.    </li>
            <li> After my first shave with this I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I was done shaving.</li>
            <li> If you can buy it as a lightning deal like I did then buying  this razor is pretty much a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li> I had it for 8 years this one cuts better, the battery charge not as long</li>
            <li> first electric razor and Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> And my wife confirmed the quality of the shave too!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be better to have a stand, but if I only need to charge for 1hr every 10days or so, it might be actually simpler to keep the cords in the drawer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not a bad idea to use the clear plastic cover for the foil and the travel case when the razor goes into carry on luggage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not a bad idea to use the clear plastic cover for the foil and the travel case when the razor goes into carry on luggage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is no better at providing a good say</li>
            <li> It just was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like times have changed and I am thrilled with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Even hours later, I can tell this razor was far superior compared to the old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On each side of the slit foil are the main shaver blocks which are&lt;br /&gt;fitted in traditional fashion to the top of the shaver inside.</li>
            <li> It does have issues with certain spots, like around the neck and adams apple, like pretty much all electric razors do.  </li>
            <li> I looked at Braun and Norelco, but finally realized I was pretty darn happy with my previous Panasonic, so why change?&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the four other electric razors I own, this one is pretty loud and it has a different tone to the buzz that I find more noticeable...</li>
            <li> This higher end model gives a very smooth shave, is not as rough on your skin, and is much faster.  </li>
            <li> For one, the five blade head is HUGE, and the body supporting it is also a bit larger than it&#x27;s four bladed counterpart.</li>
            <li> The case is actually a nice black leather soft-case with a plastic cap for the shaver head.  </li>
            <li> And, it is easily cleaned by simply running it under water with some liquid soap.</li>
            <li> The blades are encased in a head, which has an easily removable outer casing, which exposes the inner blades for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I was able to dry shave WITHOUT SKIN IRRITATION.  </li>
            <li> it is easy, and I prefer manually cleaning it than having to deal with those big bulky charger/</li>
            <li> For me, dry gives better results.</li>
            <li> I use it only with shaving cream and hot water, does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> This thing does an outstanding job dry shaving and it feels as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> My last shaver was good but this one is quieter, faster,cleaner and holds a charge twice as long as it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li> * Hands down the most powerful motor there is at a whopping 14,000 CPM&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head, while large, doesn&#x60;t feel out of proportion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly the quietest.  </li>
            <li> This decision was purely driven by cost.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver, a bit weak on neck hairs..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, effective and considerate and worth the long term investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, effective and considerate and worth the long term investment.</li>
            <li> The ES-LV61 provides a great shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Not only is it incredibly easy to handle but the shave is very close.  </li>
            <li> a brief history, I used philips (series8) electric shaver for almost 3 years and it was fine</li>
            <li> Although the earlier models shaved pretty close, they always caused significant irritation and missed some spots on the neck area.  </li>
            <li> It has a easy clean  clean up just running under water and no necessary cleaning solutions required like other razors.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t dared try to see if the older one would work, not at these prices!    </li>
            <li> I guess I wish the razor came with a brush to help with cleaning, but luckily I had one from my previous razor that makes cleanup super quick.  </li>
            <li> even though it picks up most of your stubble, and shaves it baby smooth, there are still areas where it doesn&#x27;t quite get right down to your skin in certain areas, and you have to make several passes.</li>
            <li> prefer the braun which did not have a very smooth shave, but had options to adjust for sensitive skin and could be used daily with no skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes cleaning A LOT easier as opposed to prev model where it was not a flat surface and instead filled with nooks and crannies for stuff to accummulate.</li>
            <li> The rest of the shaver worked just fine, but I could no longer tell how much charge was left in the shaver.</li>
            <li> The wide large head is most noticeable when shaving under my nose or up to the edges of my sideburns, where I cannot get as close in either case.  </li>
            <li> Coming from a Braun shaver for the last 10 years, and a norelco before that, I will say this is a great little razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend saving yourself $100 and sticking with this LV61, because the integrated sonic vibration mode is more than sufficient to clean the shaver, unless, you&#x27;re really that lazy.  </li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, I&#x27;ve had many other shavers in the past but never really give too much thought with foil shaver</li>
            <li> My last shaver was the Norelco 8894 XL Spectra, also known as the James Bond Shaver, the last hefty, durable device made by Norelco (or anyone else), so I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to find another shaver anything like it ( I own two</li>
            <li> I ever bought myself…I highly recommend it to anyone willing to pay this much for a razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a fast and very close shave!</li>
            <li> I wondered if the large head would make shaving more difficult, but I find it helps smooth out the face to get a closer more complete shave.</li>
            <li> The digital displays provides you with an accurate reading of how much of a charge remains.  </li>
            <li> The shavers have constantly improved over the years in terms of battery life and closer, comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li> I have never found a product capable of getting all the hair</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit leery about spending that much on a razor, but seeing it&#x27;s something I use every day</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> , the Panasonic will shave as close as a blade shave and as fast as an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was fast, shaved close, and pain-free.</li>
            <li> Expecting much longer shaving time I didn&#x27;t want to go to a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> much</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave on my face.</li>
            <li> If you are graduating from a Gilette to this one - you will find that this is much easier to adapt to than a rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> You see the blades are so much close to your skin</li>
            <li> I have to say that Panasonic has really improved the concept of this line of shaver.</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> I think that this Panasonic shaves much closer than what I was used to.  </li>
            <li> However, the Panasonic Men&#x27;s 5-Blade Shaving System comes as close to a razor as one can reasonably expect.  </li>
            <li> The LV61 gives a much closer shave with no irritation whatsoever and much fewer strokes.  </li>
            <li> , it is very top-heavy.  </li>
            <li> I did the same thing with the LV61 and it will balance on my finger near the midpoint of the shaver, meaning it is very balanced and that explains why it just feels better in your hand.]    </li>
            <li> The button to turn on the shaver feels like real metal.  </li>
            <li> much time do you spend shaving with a razor?&lt;br /&gt;Are</li>
            <li> Since there wasn&#x27;t much price difference between the Arc4 and the Arc5</li>
            <li> It runs so much quieter than the Arc4.</li>
            <li> tried one of the newer rotary norelco&#x27;s for awhile, but after a month or two the results weren&#x27;t much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the one hand it covers ground really fast on my face.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Gives much closer shave than the Panasonics I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li> and it had the whole cleaning kit, which by the way is a pain in the butt because you keep having to buy the cleaning kits.</li>
            <li> it irritates my whole face</li>
            <li> It shaves very close too.</li>
            <li> it really is.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the ES8429S which gave a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> very thoroughly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I really don&#x27;t like is that you cannot use the shaver while it is plugged</li>
            <li> very thoroughly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I really don&#x27;t like is that you cannot use the shaver while it is plugged</li>
            <li> This one shaves me very close and no irritation.</li>
            <li> It will be ready by the time you need it again.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Well it is not 500$ for nothing, it is pretty small but handy, I bought for my dad and he is very picky about his shavers so this one seems to hit the spot.</li>
            <li> read the reviews - lots of them and on lots of razors because I really wanted one to work.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in the face.</li>
            <li> It is VERY comparable to Braun, but I say it has a smoother shave</li>
            <li> However, when the coupon came around for the ES-LV61, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, and thought I&#x27;d see how much (if any) technology has progressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I expect to much ??  </li>
            <li> Really, much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and gives my a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> After reading whole bunch of reviews i ordered this machine for birthday.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> Very close to &amp;#34;Gillette shave&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> very nice,comfortable,and I&#x27;ll buy panasonic shaver again.</li>
            <li> The LV61 shaves much closer than the ES8243A and the shave is much faster.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> MUCH HYPE OVER THE SIZE OF THE FOILS</li>
            <li> The ultra fast motor is quieter than Philips/Norelco (rotary) and Wahl (foil).</li>
            <li> I find it provides a very close shave when used with a shave gel in the shower.</li>
            <li> The shave is closer and you can finish shaving much fast.</li>
            <li> it is very balanced to hold.</li>
            <li> Therefore, this wet+dry option is absolutely great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is definitely very well made.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s very intuitive to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a detailed description of how I get such close results: Before going to bed, I wash my face and neck with a couple drops of USkincare Awaken Foam Cleanser and USkincare Bamboo Polish (which is an exfoliating scrub).</li>
            <li> Next I shave, detach the foil head, lightly rinse out the cutters, and lather my face again.</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re hypoallergenic, the shave is very close, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel any irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li> The cutters and foil head on my stolen Panasonic were almost ready for replacement after two years</li>
            <li> Much faster shave.  </li>
            <li> so head shaving  is not only comfortable as all the foils float -</li>
            <li> Just as German Engineering is most always top shelf, Japanese knives and blades are second to none.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfectly balanced and surprisingly light and quiet - it&#x27;s form meets function.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfectly balanced and surprisingly light and quiet - it&#x27;s form meets function.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to go over the same spots a couple of times to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace a shaver tried this one and it works really well.</li>
            <li> , the ES-LV61-A really does have 5 Blades.</li>
            <li> One is always charged and ready to go when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Be careful when touching the foils when they are detached from the shaver and are not supported by the underlying blades.</li>
            <li> Even the slightest crease or dent in a foil can adversely affect the performance of the whole foil \ blade assembly.lying blades.</li>
            <li> Even the slightest crease or dent in a foil can adversely affect the performance of the whole foil \ blade assembly.</li>
            <li> I then purchased a sensotouch 2D,and was very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the Nerelco Sensotouch 2D to a Nerelco sensotouch 3D, again, very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a while now and really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> So even when shaving for 5 days in a row, it still gives me a very close shave with practically no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I had a Braun series 7 and this one is much faster, smoother, and cuts deeper all kinds of hair since day 1.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very dense beard.</li>
            <li> is very portable and does its job..</li>
            <li> and you are ready for the closest shave you have ever had in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> found the Panasonic smoother, quicker and a much better wet shaver then the Norelco.</li>
            <li> The trimming tool is much narrower compared to the Arc 4.</li>
            <li> But I get much smoother results on my face than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> In real world, Arc5 leaves about %20-30 of the beard.</li>
            <li> was very convenient for my husband to use.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to spend as much as I did ($250.00) on this</li>
            <li> As one would expect it is not as close as a blade,  but it is very close.  </li>
            <li> Decided to try the newest Panasonic and it gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This provides a very close shave in five minutes.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close and fast, I like it.</li>
            <li> In fact, in that respect, I think a red LED light on the outside would actually be more useful than a digital readout because you don’t see the readout until you turn on the shaver</li>
            <li> and I find that I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times to get the kind of shave</li>
            <li> I am loving it everyday.</li>
            <li> As warm weather approaches, I will take the entire beard off for a while and post back.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t built to last, mostly for profit and early replacement.  </li>
            <li> Battery life isn&#x27;t so hot in comparison to my old braun, but admittedly it&#x27;s running at a MUCH higher RPM, and I use the cleaning mode every shave.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave dry, and it does a very good job with that.  </li>
            <li> In spite of an oversized head that doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any benefit; ineffective in capturing fine, flat hairs resulting in skin irritation.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!!!  </li>
            <li> The vibration itself is not a big deal, but the noise is very distinct.</li>
            <li> First off, let me start off by saying I am new to electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 4-5 days of not shaving, the new razor arrived and I charged it up for first use.  </li>
            <li> When I got the new Panasonic ES-LV61-A, I conducted a first test and used it after the rotary shave</li>
            <li> Clean, close, smooth shave with little skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I have tried it dry, wet, in the shower, with “Electric shave” gels and liquids, and  dry works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Compared to several other electric razors I have used, the Panasonic feels good in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I heard this was a good shaver because razor blades irritate my face, but I need to be clean shaven, so I guess I have to go with irritation over random face stubble.</li>
            <li> in all, this product is worth the monies i paid for it and am &amp;#34;VERY&amp;#34; happy with this and would recommend this shaver for all those with difficult thick hair and hard to shave areas like under the chin where the hairs also go in different directions like mine, this shaver does a great job! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Is a little louder, but cleans up very easy.  </li>
            <li> This one is a better model than the other one I had (which I passed along to one of my sons).  </li>
            <li> so sharp blades are a necessity and can&#x27;t be used more than twice.  </li>
            <li> I guess the other three blades actually do more than you might think.</li>
            <li> The shave was extremely patchy, and took more time per shave than using a disposable.  </li>
            <li> I have used other electric shavers for many years, but I never got a close shave.</li>
            <li> I did replace with an OEM battery, but it just didn&#x27;t hold charge like the original, so I finally had to retire it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other electric shavers does a better job.</li>
            <li> Better than 4 of other brands I tried.</li>
            <li> The way this one shaves is more comfortable and it gets me to a fairly clean shave faster than my previous - about 90 seconds typical.  </li>
            <li> i had in my mind to buy a eletric shaver for a long time and for a very good reasons but my delicate skin didn&#x27;t agree with me .</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to crack it open to clean</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, it simply does not give me a clean shave on my cheeks, and shaving my neck is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> About the only place I can get a clean shave is along my jawline.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum then, I would give this shaver four stars for its head shaving capability but only two stars for its face shaving ability given that I cannot get a clean shave no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> Also, the Braun shaver is easier to clean using only liquid soap and water.</li>
            <li> Dry shave is easy and fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no ridiculous sanitizing stand, cleaning is simple and straightforward</li>
            <li> , this one seems to be a high quality item, and works really well.</li>
            <li> The foil cutters really don&#x27;t work very well on the southern most areas, they have a tendency to cut a bit further than you&#x27;d like (read bleeding).</li>
            <li> At least the replacement blades are supposed to be reasonably priced ($50 for an entire set of replacement foils and blades) and I&#x27;m glad that shaving is a better experience.  </li>
            <li> It does give a better shave than most other models but the potential buyer will obviously need to factor price against the benefit of a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> That said, it requires several passes and a lot of patience to achieve that clean look and feel (about four minutes, which doesn’t sound like a long time, but believe me, it is longer than you realize).</li>
            <li> I would like to return it, but I already spent a month with it because panasonic says that your face needs a month with the new shave method, but it didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing in the three years, I probably would have spent close to that much money on disposable blades and shaving cream - so the deal isn&#x27;t that bad.unreachable dries easily sitting on the shelf in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and cuts shaving time in half for me.  </li>
            <li> The next day I noticed a lot of fine white (old guy) hairs around the front of the neck that I thought was clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely convinced more is better, but it has a few other minor improvements that make it nice.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and use either wet or dry with easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet-dry shavers ever since they first came out in the early 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I put it on the charger (for only about the 5th full charge cycle).  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic only needs 1 hour charging time, before full operation.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Frankly, when I first noticed this, I was completely taken aback.</li>
            <li> Not to say that one does not work or lasts, only that top of line is that top of the line and at least on shavers one could aspire for the leader of the pack (vroom, vroom).</li>
            <li> And something like a neoprene travel case would be a nice touch rather than an ordinary vinyl case, given this</li>
            <li> On a full charge, I get maybe 4-5 shaves only.</li>
            <li> you need a trimmer to finish off some tiny hairs that it will just not cut.&lt;br /&gt;the motor is very quiet and the glide over the skin is very smooth  .</li>
            <li> I loved the closeness of a blade shave, but daily shaving with a razor took a little too much time and, more importantly, was irritating</li>
            <li> Elegant, efficient and powerful - this is the first electric I&#x27;ve used over the past 30 some odd years that does indeed deliver a comfortable, blade quality close</li>
            <li> Elegant, efficient and powerful - this is the first electric I&#x27;ve used over the past 30 some odd years that does indeed deliver a comfortable, blade quality close</li>
            <li> Philips has taken the brand down a notch and you&#x27;ll need to spend more than I did for this shaver to get something comparable and it takes longer to shave with the rotary.  </li>
            <li> I have used the new shaver for a month and recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> The main complaint is that the head is too large to effectively reach under the nose.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome, although it has some few weak points, like noise (it&#x27;s really noisy!)</li>
            <li> Worth the money and Panasonic makes quality products and not just relying on the name brand like the other famous Japanese company that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Everything &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; makes is junk with overpricing and betting people will buy based on branding.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li> high end electrics have their pros and cons and of course what works well for one has poor results for another - hence gentlemen, the seemingly endless search for a great, comfortable and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver cuts well, shaves, oh, so comfortably, cleans easily, and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It simply feels more elegant, solid and less plastic-y.  </li>
            <li> The feel of this one is noticeably better than my previous.  </li>
            <li> It took a week to figure out that I should just go with and against the grain, and I&#x27;m able to shave in less than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> But previous Panasonic&#x27;s have shaved better on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The biggest downside of the Panasonic is that it requires replacement of the blades every 1-2 years, though I expect those who are less hirsute can observe a more lax replacement system.  </li>
            <li> It takes half an hour or more each time.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous one I was using, which was also from Panasonic btw, this razor cannot stand on the counter top</li>
            <li> I clean the shaver after each use (just blow and brush the bits out, then rinse with water) and it takes me less time to shave with and clean this shaver than it used to take me just to shave with my old one.</li>
            <li> Shaving dry, I thought both sides were similarly smooth.</li>
            <li> It also does not \\&quot;gumup\\&quot;/clog the shaver like most of the previously mentioned products, does not rinse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a fraction of the price of many of the previously mentioned products.</li>
            <li> just hoped for a bit more based on previous products.</li>
            <li> For daily cleaning, simply lift the top and blow.  </li>
            <li> On the shaver are 2 main blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the main point: How does it shave?</li>
            <li> My last 2 were Braun models, and I found that the earlier model worked better than the newer one.</li>
            <li> Should I buy this LV61 or the more expensive ($100 more MSRP)</li>
            <li> This is a noticeable improvement over older models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The LV 61 looks unwieldy but actually handles better than the LA 63 despite the much larger head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It runs out of charge fairly quickly and that would be the only knock I would have on this.  </li>
            <li> I went with the Arc 5 and was expecting to get something more over my Arc 3 because this razor is a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> This razor surprised me being better than I expected -  </li>
            <li> I looked for the cleaning system for this particular model but could not find one, so</li>
            <li> It happened to me couple times with the older one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It will never make you a decent cup of tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main difference is in the closeness of the shave and zero irritation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself accidentally pushing the power switch and the power lock is a clever feature for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had with some of the older models I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it but the $50 replacement that looks the same are for the cheaper model although there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> The build is solid, better than the Norelco; same level as the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Disregarding that detail, I was very pleasantly surprised at how fast it took to get a very close shave, comparable</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, there are 2 main cutter blades.</li>
            <li> Having used various electric shavers, I&#x27;ve only been 90% satisfied.</li>
            <li> my older Braun</li>
            <li> Much closer shave, the only thing is you have little worning when it&#x27;s going to run out of power, still very pleased with it , glade</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer albeit hard to see due to the size of the head -</li>
            <li> I told him that online now a days vs. buying in a store &amp;#34;brick and mortar&amp;#34; you can buy the most expensive shaver which normally in store would cost a bunch more.</li>
            <li> The lock seems to provide more precision for the tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> The Vine program gave me the opportunity to try a product at the high, high end of pricing, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li> I chose it based on the high ratings it received here, at Consumer Reports, and at Hammacher Schlemmer.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I believe he said it was high</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see where Panasonic invested the additional money to justify this high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you are weighing between a 4 blade or 5 blade wet/dry, I would highly recommend the 5 blade.</li>
            <li> If the price is still too high for you, then get the LF51 four head instead.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shaver and purchased the 1250 with cleaning station.</li>
            <li> Price is high.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend the Panasonic ES-LV61-A or the ES-LV81-K.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I switched to Pansonic years ago  because of the high speed.</li>
            <li> High quality in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> One thing to note is that this model is a little older, and it was when I bought it Dec. 2014, there are newer models for more money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I dive into the Panasonic ES-LV61 here for whatever it&#x27;s worth is a quick run down on my electrics:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly it seems a bit more water drains from the body of the razor after shaving in the shower than when new (may be related to plug issues).</li>
            <li> The device is easy to clean,  can be used wet or dry, and has a motor that operates at a faster speed than everything else.  </li>
            <li> but this one surprised me because it shave so much closer and better than all my previous shaver.  </li>
            <li> of my adult life I&#x27;ve just had to accept that I would look scraggly after a certain point in the day.  </li>
            <li> It just seems balanced a little to the top end if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because the &#x27;LV61 cuts closer, you might feel a little more irritation; I do, on the underlip area.  </li>
            <li> Because my beard is thicker than most, it always takes me a little longer to shave.  </li>
            <li> i just plug directly in to the shaver and clean it with a brush when necessary.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;multi-flex active pivoting head\\&quot; is really nice and allows you to shave with relative ease.  </li>
            <li> Pro: high-frequency seems to do a good job cutting whiskers without pulling: consistently clean, close shave&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver takes 1 hour to charge, has a 45-minute run time, and a 5-minute quick charge if you need to get a quick shave in and the shaver&#x27;s battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver takes 1 hour to charge, has a 45-minute run time, and a 5-minute quick charge if you need to get a quick shave in and the shaver&#x27;s battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> To give you a better idea of how this blade configuration may work on your face, I find that on my upper lip only one main cutter and the lift-tech foil are doing the work because only two blades will fit, and on the area below my lower lip and above my chin, it&#x60;s one main foil and the finishing foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many articulation points on the shaver head and the foils independently move as well, despite how oversized the head of the shaver is – I can still maneuver in on all of the tough problem areas like the chin, top lip under the nose, and jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This shaver did an excellent job on the sideburns but irritate the face under the eyes badly.</li>
            <li> and the LA63 will not balance even with my finger near the very end</li>
            <li> But the real improvement here is that it&#x27;s much quieter doing the same job as the much noisier four head.</li>
            <li> Skin feel was much smoother than my old Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It is so much faster (about 2 minutes per shave) than my old Braun 8900 series</li>
            <li> For wet, I&#x27;ll use a brush and shaving cream - this is a ridiculously comfortable shave, and it&#x27;s as close (or closer) than a razor &amp; shaving cream…no pinching, pulling, burning, etc.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, lousy accessories.</li>
            <li> This thing was so much smoother and quieter compared to my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I wonder though if the extra blades where worth it</li>
            <li> Success at last!</li>
            <li> As someone with a coarse beard and face adapted to electrics, getting a close shave has never been a fun exercise.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s pretty much nothing left not to like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, it is a piece of plastic and won&#x27;t last as long as the Norelco</li>
            <li> now if it only would cut all the hairs it would be worth the cost .but</li>
            <li> If you are willing to spend this much on a shaver, go the extra mile and get the LV61.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopeful that I can pretty much abandon the razor &amp; shave cream routine entirely with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I normally time about 3:15 to do a shave in the morning.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I believe it is definitely worth the price if you can afford it, but it is definitely on the pricey end.</li>
            <li> Then I remove the foil head and briefly rinse the cutters and foil, reattach the foil head, squirt on a couple pumps of diluted Dr. Bronners liquid soap on the foil, run the shaver at the automatic 20 second high-speed cleaning mode while rinsing my face with warm water, remove the foil head, rinse the blades at the automatic 20 second high-speed cleaning mode, rinse the foil head, and let air-dry.  </li>
            <li> But for a lazy Saturday it was good enough...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money for a close shave.</li>
            <li> and it gets better everyday as my hair and skin adjusts to the routine.</li>
            <li> still have no regrets buying this razor since it cuts my hair better than any other product I&#x27;ve owned and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is the main reason I like this</li>
            <li> If you have an old shaver and you are curious if getting a new one is worth it, I can confirm that this one is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I can shave 2 or 3 days growth without a hair pulled, have far less neck irritation, and can almost say I enjoy shaving!  </li>
            <li> Those models swivel freely from side to side and, for some reason I can&#x27;t fathom, move up and down as more or less pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that back razor isn&#x27;t easy to use.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a few months, and then I had to go over same spot on my face several times more than normal.</li>
            <li> , then I still need to hit several parts with a razor blade to get things right.  </li>
            <li> I found no difficulty shaving right up under the nasal area on the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> you have a tough or difficult beard or just want to own the best, search no further.</li>
            <li> No I don&#x27;t use goo or shave wet, so a quick comfortable dry shave is what I need.  </li>
            <li> At this price point, there should have been a leather case, or neoprene, or fine imitation leather.</li>
            <li> Shaves quickly and cleanly; long time between charges.</li>
            <li> I had never found an electric razor which worked for me; I have fairly fine facial hair, and cheaper razors simply won&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> The handle feels light and plasticy and the head large and heavy.</li>
            <li> Instead, the razor looks like any other piece of cheap appliance or electronics I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> The base/handle of the shaver is not as comfortable in my hand as other shavers I have used.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and balanced, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and plasticky like some other shavers&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can afford to invest the money in it, you should, but only if you REALLY need it and no other razor is doing the job right.</li>
            <li> I used my new Panasonic shaver with Cremo Shave Cream</li>
            <li> Now, if you these blades were not to be hypoallergic, they would encourage growth of these live matter along with bacteria.  </li>
            <li> You might not find the WES9030P COMBO pack anymore, the new part number, which lists THIS ES-LV61 is WES9032P and is $65 for Amazon Prime as of today&#x27;s date.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m new with the electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Just got my new razor yesterday and tried it this morning.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning you new Panny</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a brand new day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning you new Panny</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a brand new day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It replaced another Panasonic razor that was in need of new foil and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The difference is the new Lift-Tech foil.</li>
            <li> Rinses to look like new and is sanitized.  </li>
            <li> battery live makes it a pleasure to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update July 2015 just received my new shaver.</li>
            <li> I was considering moving on to a new brand.  </li>
            <li> The five new blades cut like a dream</li>
            <li> It took about a week for me to get the hang of the new razor.</li>
            <li> of use: It was very easy, didn&#x27;t even feel anything hard +1</li>
            <li> Works great dry, tested wet and it just did not work for me wet.</li>
            <li> 5 blades is actually only 2 blades in a huge body don&#x27;t expect to do any precision work with this razor its too big</li>
            <li> The battery counter is reasonably accurate, cleaning is simple enough.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to go through the ritual of the shaving cream, razor, and the clean up of a wet shave.</li>
            <li> , that didn&#x27;t do the job at all, only with wet shaving results were OK.</li>
            <li> and it did it very close much closer than I got from any of the above.</li>
            <li> , it holds a charge well, overall easy to use, cleans easily with soap and water (it doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning base and doesn&#x27;t use cleaning solutions like my Braun did), and it has a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li> For such a premium priced shaver, I expected better quality and service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to be able to shave wet or dry, day or night on a seconds notice.  </li>
            <li> Not as close as using an actual razor blade but close enough to give you a smooth face.</li>
            <li> Mrs. Boilermate said the Panasonic side was smoother than the Norelco side about a third of the time, and equally smooth about a third of the time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The really aren&#x27;t many negative things that I can  say.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty think beard and the hair grows fast (though I swear, as the old Panasonic got older, some of the foil wore off and turned patches of hair grey).  </li>
            <li> There is 1 in the middle to put things in order and make better final cuts by 2nd main</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this problem before where the razor is showing its age in other areas and replacing the simplest parts is too much to invest when you aren&#x27;t sure how long you will keep using the razor itself.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin specifically on my neck</li>
            <li> Clean up is just as easy as ever, with a little squirt of hand soap into the blades and a few seconds later your clean as a whistle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides?</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after my first use of the new shaver, it was obvious this wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;fair\\&quot; comparison -</li>
            <li> The razor operates wire free and is a little top heavy in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Easy to operate, cleans up manually so you don&#x27;t need to blow $$$$ on extra cartridges, fast charge and enough battery life to easily last 5-6</li>
            <li> How is a digital display of a blinking 10% battery reserve any more useful than simply having a little LED light turn orange or red when battery power is low?</li>
            <li> If you buying an electric shaver for the first time, skip this section and read the next  Electric shavers basically come in 2 types - Rotary (philips norelco) &amp; foil (braun &amp; panasonic)  </li>
            <li> This model currently shows a price that is a bit higher than others I have used.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric I have owned that can actually beat a shaving cream and razor shave.</li>
            <li> Having recently switched from hot foam to a gel, I was not planning on another switch to cordless electric.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is NOT a solicited review; just a way to say thank you to Amazon and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several Panasonic shavers from the ES-LT41 to the ES-RT51 to the ES-LV61.  </li>
            <li> Like a red hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually designed to feel and move around like a regular razor, which is different than the competition, which feels more like moving machinery around your face.  </li>
            <li> not sure how much better than arc3 or arc4</li>
            <li> The shaver is a beautiful gun-metal dark blue, and is not a bright tacky light blue like on the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, you remove the outer foil section, turn on the sonic cleaning mode again and run the shaver under hot water.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, you remove the outer foil section, turn on the sonic cleaning mode again and run the shaver under hot water.  </li>
            <li> I let my husband try the razor first and never got it back.</li>
            <li> attests but a Lexus LS 460 could not be a 4 Stars if all the accolades of its extensive performance and features is to be believed, then it would have to have a higher rating like a 4.5, knowing that 5 Stars is perfection in the face of the earth</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve read this far, then well done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked all of my electric razors but have never loved one until now.  </li>
            <li> When I shave my face a second time, I shave my neck, cheeks, and chin 90º from the first shave.</li>
            <li> At first, I wanted to dump it immediately and revert back to the disposables.  </li>
            <li> First off, it is so quiet compared to my Braun 790.</li>
            <li> Overall closeness is comparable to my razor except around the neckline which is still pretty close.  </li>
            <li> But it finally died so I bought this one because I thought if it&#x27;s more expensive it might be better.</li>
            <li> : It took off ALL the unwanted hair that was left after the first shave.</li>
            <li> First of all the plastic cap used to protect the blades actually STAYS on.  </li>
            <li> Further there were few spots which this shaver couldnt do a good spot with (especially the chin underside and neck areas.  </li>
            <li> But the Panasonic 5 blade shaver comes with hypoallergic blades which ward off growth of such bacteria and keep it clean, of course you have to do your due diligence of rinsing the blades in hot water and cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is easy, little hand soap and run it through water, that&#x27;s all...</li>
            <li> In fact, this shaver definitely provides a more comfortable shave than traditional blades - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I can move the razor in multiple directions, going back and forth over and over and over, and I STILL cannot get all the hairs on my neck shaven clean.</li>
            <li> I previously had Panasonic ES8249 wet/dry shaver which has to be about 5 years old and going strong.</li>
            <li> new Panasonic ES-LV61-A model has one major improvement over the older models.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but what you&#x27;re getting is a very high quality marvel of engineering that will give you the closest, most comfortable electric shave possible.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone tired of spending more and more money on traditional razors.</li>
            <li> Panasonic would have won me over with better packaging, finer accessories, a dedicated website, and some way of making me feel special for buying this expensive device.</li>
            <li> Panasonic would have won me over with better packaging, finer accessories, a dedicated website, and some way of making me feel special for buying this expensive device.</li>
            <li> My old shaver was getting noisy and seemed to need new foils to prevent pulling.</li>
            <li> After apply my gel shaving cream, I started the new Panasonic up and WOW.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m always surprised at how brand new it feels, and I&#x27;m not sure why I wait so long to replace blades, but yes, ultra clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Micro thin foil is pretty amazing - but delicate and easy to tear.</li>
            <li> For the past few years I have been using model 8243 which has great.  </li>
            <li> I have a lightly colored (with some grey) moderate density beard.</li>
            <li> This leaves less space in which to fit the trimmer and appears to be a design necessity rather than a fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And living in a small apt this can be a big problem.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive but a small tub will last you a year, the scents are superb and fade quickly.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive but a small tub will last you a year, the scents are superb and fade quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it wet with shaving foam and the results and comfort are extraordinary.</li>
            <li> While my previous model shaved very close, this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used that shaves as close as a safety razor with identical results after skipping a day, and no irritation!</li>
            <li> It does have some issues shaving close to the sideburns mainly because of the bulky head, but no other electric shaver in the world can come close to this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may sound like i&#x27;m not recommending it at all, but thats not true.</li>
            <li> Panasonic also only gives you a 30 day money back guarantee so you pretty much must decide if you like before your face gets used to it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is also more quiet than the previous ones (I have been using wet/dry Panasonic shavers for almost 20 years).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The dry is almost as comfortable – it’s not ONLY because of the moisturizers in the shaving</li>
            <li> With the Arc5 I am able to cut the shaving time in half, it shaves just as close and no stray hairs are left.  </li>
            <li> THIS is the one, better wet than dry for me.</li>
            <li> and i must say that the prices is ok and the shave gotten from both dry and wet shave (even in the shower with me)</li>
            <li> The head freely rotates, though somewhat limited in its side-to-side and back and forth motion.  </li>
            <li> Depress two buttons on each side of the head, and the outer casing pops right off.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box with a dry shave</li>
            <li> Lastly since the head of the shaver is so large</li>
            <li> The reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that I have to augment the Panasonic razor with a razor blade on certain angles such as around the sides of my (bald guy) head where it begins to crown.</li>
            <li> Even though the head is large the front to back and side to side</li>
            <li> I think this is due to a combination of a large shaving area and head design that seems somehow better than my previous arc-4 models.  </li>
            <li> I usually resort to the trimmer for much of the time because the shaver doesn&#x27;t begin to produce a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The 5-blade Panasonic LV61 is a little lighter and better balanced [see Update note above].  </li>
            <li> I was excited to use another Panasonic shaver as the previous one was portable, efficient and quite accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor itself is quick and doesn&#x27;t yank hairs out of your face like some other electric razors</li>
            <li> seriously?!), no oil for regular maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use a razor any more.</li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;m using exclusively now is Bump Stopper Medicated Shaving Gel by a company called High Time, which I normally get at my local Walgreens</li>
            <li> cleans easy, fast to recharge, last long on one charge, waterproof, works well dry also.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new set of blades for the razor expecting similar decent results.  </li>
            <li> It blows the older four head away effortlessly, and with the new lower price point (I paid only $149.00, it used to be $299.00)</li>
            <li> It was not cutting anywhere near what I expected.  </li>
            <li> (just didn&#x27;t think any shaver was worth more) and wasn&#x27;t going to again when the LCD display on my ES-RT51 failed.  </li>
            <li> old remington is great cutting all</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s clear, you can also see the spots you may have missed while shaving.</li>
            <li> This shaver trims my facial hair more closely than my prior 4 blade Panasonic shaver, almost equal to a wet shave with a real blade.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy, and that could be an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a step up from my old Panasonic [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> simply because it&#x27;s more convenient, but I occasionally choose to have a wet shave for the increased comfort</li>
            <li> I thought I will await the blackfriday to check the offers</li>
            <li> , it is by far the fastest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It visual charging indicator and readouts are very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the digital readout.  </li>
            <li> I could go much longer as I charge at 30% battery left though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> quite expensive shaver seems much more reasonable once when you find out how much this shaver gives.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think the difference has much to do with 4 vs. 5 blades, per se - the internal mechanism of the shaver is similar for both units.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my ES-LV61 died completely and i had to revert to using my old arc-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> old.  </li>
            <li> an aside, I pulled out my old Braun Series 7 shaver for backup while this one is in service.</li>
            <li> Overall it gives a much closer shave than the Arcitec.</li>
            <li> I should have replaced my old brain with a newer Braun.  </li>
            <li> Shaving the top of my head was a delicate operation.</li>
            <li> you know, I&#x27;m old and the hair just ain&#x27;t there anymore</li>
            <li> I was getting on my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic completely destroys that adage.  </li>
            <li> it does  a better job than the LA93, but still not spectacular.  </li>
            <li> The extended battery life with a visual readout is very valuable.  </li>
            <li> This model does not come with a self-cleaning gizmo, but it really isn&#x27;t needed as the shaver features a sonic mode designed for cleaning under the tap with regular soap and water.</li>
            <li> then my three headed Panasonic comes complete with a cleansing apparatus combine with a charging stand.</li>
            <li> You have to pack it in clothes (or something soft) to prevent it from getting banged up in your luggage anyway, so how is it going to get turned on?</li>
            <li> You have to pack it in clothes (or something soft) to prevent it from getting banged up in your luggage anyway, so how is it going to get turned on?</li>
            <li> and I still have to finish with old Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has used electric shavers his whole life, so I anticipated that he would like this one especially.</li>
            <li> it started to make a loud noise (it&#x27;s already loud, but now it&#x27;s even louder), and b)</li>
            <li> as it is now i have to use my old remington to finish off some hairs .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frequent water rinses of the head corrected that and did not diminish the gel effectiveness.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin wasnt well suited for this.  </li>
            <li> So far no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> Comparing it to my old Philips in terms of accuracy this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> It by far gives the closest shave of any electric razor I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am obviously very upset that this item did not even last 3 months for the price I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought his to replace my old 3-blade ES8228 Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> The Arc5&#x27;s larger head is very cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> I like the flexible head, the digital readout telling me how much charge remains, and the locking power switch.  </li>
            <li> It is almost as loud as an electric hair clippers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my face because the natural oils help to lubricate the skin.</li>
            <li> but my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Partly because I had to spend so much time going over the same areas that the razor just would not cut.  </li>
            <li> I finally purchased this razor after much consideration.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still tweaking it after nearly a</li>
            <li> and so far I have to give it 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I had a different model with this system and didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li> Had a 2 year old Braun 760 cc.</li>
            <li> as my old Braun did.</li>
            <li> When I traveled with the old one, every so often it would get jostled and unlock and the power button would get pressed and use up all the battery.</li>
            <li> Two are attached directly to the shaver.</li>
            <li> of the Panasonic Wet\Dry Shavers are completely WaterProof.</li>
            <li> Yes, the Panasonic LV61 is COMPLETELY</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I became tired of wasting money and time on lesser shavers and spent top dollar for this Arc 5, and I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my old one had.</li>
            <li> but this shaves the closest by far.</li>
            <li> a side note, I don&#x27;t grow anywhere near a &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Old Mountain Goat</li>
            <li> My old Braun5775 is going to the trash.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Had 3 shaves with it so far.</li>
            <li> price.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a mini turbine near your face when it runs (acceptable decibel levels)</li>
            <li> Its also quite loud compared to comparable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently, I tried a Braun 790cc because the price of the shaver was much lower then the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> This shaver far exceeds any product Panasonic has ever put out.</li>
            <li> So far the performance has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using my shaving cream and razor completely.</li>
            <li> A couple years ago I decided to switch completely and went to blades.  </li>
            <li> The prior electrics never seemed to give me as close a shave over my whole</li>
            <li> short, I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> Before this razor, I had a similiar Panasonic one that was two years old.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell if this is an annoyance, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Would recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer than my old Norelco, which did not survive a bathtub drop.  </li>
            <li> No ingrown whiskers or razor burn so far either.  </li>
            <li> , smooth shaves I get everyday.</li>
            <li> But if that was the only difference, I probably still wouldn&#x27;t have thought the Panasonic was worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe worth it for those with lesser finer facial hair.</li>
            <li> For the last few years I have used the latest Braun Pulsonic&#x27;s and always updated.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, the money I spent purchasing the Arc 5 was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Been using the braun 5 series before this and the arc5 is much much better with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> The shave wasn&#x27;t that good and the it was difficult to shave place under the chin.  </li>
            <li> It is a closer shave but still irritates my face a little bit, not bad, I can live with it.</li>
            <li> it becomes more of an issue resulting in the underside of my nose often being scraped while shaving due to the sheer size of the head as I shave over the upper lip.</li>
            <li> In fact, the larger head, due to the five blades, actually makes the shave quicker, closer, and even more</li>
            <li> You have to practice using this shaver, you won&#x27;t be good at using it for a few weeks, but once your used to it and know how it works with your face, there is no going back to the blade or other cheaper units.</li>
            <li> I shower and wash my face first and then let it dry before shaving as I have always done.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving with gel at first, but then settled on dry.</li>
            <li> And does such a good job that my shaves take less than half the time.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is a snap by adding a little hand soap when operating the device in clean mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if I want a truly razor clean shave, I use it with a little gel or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it&#x27;s very easy on my sensitive skin and leaves behind no redness or sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed the larger size of the head and the very different angle of it compared to my old shaver.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s small and it doesn&#x27;t extend far enough away from the head of the razor – it works, but you&#x27;ll find better trimmer design in Braun 5-7 series razors</li>
            <li> A fan of wet shaving with shave brush, high quality creams and straight edge razors.</li>
            <li> One charge last for more than 10 days and whether it is fully charge or down to 10% of the charge, the shave is the same.  </li>
            <li> A little soap, press the button for sonic under warm water (never hot!)</li>
            <li> About a week-and-a-half later I received a brand spanking new ES-LV61 via UPS!</li>
            <li> past reviews of other electrics are somewhat more critical than complimentary.</li>
            <li> past reviews of other electrics are somewhat more critical than complimentary.</li>
            <li> to clean, close shave every time, every after a few days growth.</li>
            <li> Now it takes me half the time my old razor did, and it is quiet, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if the timer kept accumulated time across longer breaks, but only because I&#x27;m that curious about how much less time this model takes.</li>
            <li> : i also wanted to add that the ES-LV81-K (with cleaning system) is the exact same razor its just a different color and has the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am acutely aware of the difference in feel and shave quality because recently (after only about 60 days of use)</li>
            <li> , I will never go back to razor blades, particularly for my head.</li>
            <li> , I usually need to do many passes in different positions</li>
            <li> I found the Braun was a decent shaver, but left stubble.</li>
            <li> I have used the top of the line Braun and find this one equal if not better in performance and results.</li>
            <li> Braun was decent however could not get myself to continue to buy the cleaning solution and, eventually the actual cleaner.  </li>
            <li> 2 blades on outer sides are just trimmers and acting as tools to shape up and trim the beard to improve main cutters performance.</li>
            <li> The head of the shaver is rather large though, so it can feel a little top heavy at times.  </li>
            <li> The ES-LV61 emits a solid, high pitched whine when in use.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this to anyone in the same boat as I</li>
            <li> The ideal is the same closeness and little skin irritating.</li>
            <li> what a fine fine cutting instrument.    </li>
            <li> Now if you put the foil back on and use only the very edge of the shaver head (well before you get to the 2 main blades in the center), you will see that it really is a usable blade as it cuts your stubble.  </li>
            <li> I cannot deny though that for facial hair of less than a couple days growth it gives an exceedingly comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> This means it&#x27;s particularly good at getting into tight spots that are hard to reach.</li>
            <li> It works very well and does not take long.  </li>
            <li> These replacement blades don&#x27;t come cheap either, at least $50-70 (which is about standard for electric shavers; IIRC, replacement Norelco blades were about that much too).  </li>
            <li> well (always difficult with electrics) and I am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because of its wet/dry capabilities (and spent a pretty penny doing so).  </li>
            <li> your other-hand fingers.&lt;br /&gt;the normal price is quite hiked up.&lt;br /&gt;the battery would last for about 15-20 shaves estimation only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but I can already tell it&#x27;s much better than the last Norelco.</li>
            <li> far as a down side my only complaints are that the trimmer is rather flimsy and the battrey life is much shorter then other electric razors, but that isn&#x27;t enough to dampen my love of the Panisonic Arc 5.</li>
            <li> I first have to crop it very tightly with hair clippers or shave with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer is easy to turn on and works well around the sideburns and othe hard to shave areas.  </li>
            <li> so I will be a little more careful.  </li>
            <li> main differences between the Panasonic and the Braun shavers are: Braun is slightly faster and a full battery charge is enough for about 6 to 7 shaves whereas, Panasonic lasts only for about 3 to 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Really close shave but not so good a difficult to reach areas due to the size of the head</li>
            <li> and obviously they do scrape off live matter into an enclosed chamber along with the hair.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a short transitional period when you get used to a new way of shaving.</li>
            <li> I finally decided it was time for a new one...</li>
            <li> Instead of searching around for replacement parts, I decided to get a new one recently and went for this.  </li>
            <li> It is always a rush when you get a new set of blades in, but this definitely feels like an upgrade to my Arc 4.</li>
            <li> Patented 5 blade cutting system - really does an amazing job</li>
            <li> Overall, I think the LF51-A is a winner and a real steal at it&#x27;s current price.</li>
            <li> Ok to start off I&#x27;m the type of guy who has thick coarse hair and using a razor causes bumps/</li>
            <li> The most recent models add &amp;#34;microsensing&amp;#34; which speed up and slow down the motor to deal with different hair types; I have mostly fine facial hair except on my chin; this razor without that feature has no problem.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have noticed is the high pitch sound from the motor.</li>
            <li> If it were anything less complicated, we&#x27;d all be using the same tool with optimum results, right?</li>
            <li> no other Panasonic (or blade for that matter) has shaved this close.  </li>
            <li> The way I have learned it works is this: as long as all parts are kept in tip top condition and the parts have not aged past the point of not being as efficient, this shaver will deliver on its promise.</li>
            <li> Not exactly as close as a blade but pretty close.</li>
            <li> No need for the more expensive ES-LV81-K with the cleaning unit since liquid soap and water worked just fine with my previous Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I mean extremely easy.</li>
            <li> This current shaver updates the prior one in a few ways (five blades, smaller size, better lock mechanism, and improved clipper).</li>
            <li> Its so much quieter than my old Braun and any of my other shavers.  </li>
            <li> Works well wet or dry, definitely a better shave when used wet with shave cream.  </li>
            <li> The AC adapter is decent, it is well built and looks like it will survive long use.</li>
            <li> week I got this Panasonic shaver after doing a little bit of fresh research.</li>
            <li> , i think i cut my shave time in half and received a better shave then both previous razors.</li>
            <li> It shaves either wet or dry with super closeness.  </li>
            <li> It for some strange reason even with the high price does not include a stand to mount in while recharging or not in use.</li>
            <li> I get close, comfortable shaves, even in the hard to shave areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> Oh and if you take it in the shower thinking you can just run over your wet face and get a good clean shave you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it comes with a small travel case (which only the razor fits in) and an AC adaptor (which is pretty large).  </li>
            <li> so everything feels tight and right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the shave is probably not quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s certainly close enough for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t really have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> It works fine for the northern parts, but get down to the southern parts and things get a bit more difficult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly it was not the same, the 5 blade design is a testament to \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; as it seems like the blades fight each other more than help.</li>
            <li> only the rare and few would deserve such a high mark.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very simple and effective, thanks to the hyper vibrate feature of the cutting blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> never  gotten  such  a close  smooth shave with any electric  razor in the past.</li>
            <li> Like it, much better than my previous Philips 2D, because the 2D never clean up my neck area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I waited too long to use this product enough to make a real judgement weather or not to keep it or return it.</li>
            <li> My old electric razor (circular blades), and manual shaver left bumps all over my face and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> Both developed the same problem- after a year</li>
            <li> Really surprised with the battery life and the constant power.</li>
            <li> I like the pivoting foil blade, versus the fixed floating heads of the last electric razor I used.  </li>
            <li> He said never ever he will go back to old ways of shaving .</li>
            <li> only problem that prevents me from using this is that with close shave comes loud vibration sounds.</li>
            <li> Only once did I try an electric razor when I was around 18 years old.  </li>
            <li> your going to spend this much on a shaver and wet shave, even once in a while.</li>
            <li> your going to spend this much on a shaver and wet shave, even once in a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a 43 year old male with olive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no doubt in my mind after experiencing the shave that I now get from this Panasonic ES-LV61 that it is now undoubtably the current benchmark for Electric shavers in so far as the quality of shave that it provides.</li>
            <li> Bare box.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really comment on the wet shaving capabilities</li>
            <li> Everything I gave a try I had to return and get back to old school razors.</li>
            <li> And I am quite surprised how big of a difference it has made.</li>
            <li> the noise is comparable to my old Norelco, which is a concern I had from the last time</li>
            <li> My last an Arc4 was over 5 years old and needed repair, so I decided to purchase the Arc5.  </li>
            <li> the plastics feel somewhat fragile but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> and it still did not get all of it and had to revert to my 4 year old Remington (which i replaced internal battery) to finish the job and did well</li>
            <li> I could see that it was charging normally, then came back hours later</li>
            <li> Despite the excited reviews of other users I do not have the illusion that this even remotely comes close to a bladed-shave...</li>
            <li> Rotaries are good for cutting longer hairs</li>
            <li> It is kind of sad once you think about it</li>
            <li> Just a few days later, I received a refund check in the mail, for the full amount of the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a Braun and got a better, but, not a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> For those thinking of buying for this purpose, understand that the shaver breaks down with consistent exposure to water, where the unit will just stop working -</li>
            <li> In 50 years of shaving, this is the first electric razor that&#x27;s caused me to put down the blade.  </li>
            <li> the Braun sounds a little raspier compared to the Panasonic which has a higher frequency vibration which is due to the higher frequency of razor movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer any Panasonic over any other brand I&#x27;ve tried; but this model gets that hard to smooth stubble on the chin and jaw lines without too much work or pressure.  </li>
            <li> Add the crazy sharp blades and center \\&quot;lifting strip\\&quot; and you had yourself the best electric for head shaving - at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges fast and can last two to three days on a single charge</li>
            <li> And the blade replacement kit I saw costs half as much as what the entire shaver appears to sell new.</li>
            <li> My shaving time is about half what it used to be as it cuts close with the first pass</li>
            <li> The instructions state the outer foil blades will last 2 years and the main inner blades will last 1 year,</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair and this does create a smooth shave when excessively going over the same location for what seems like an eternity (probably 10-20 passes), but not as smooth as I get from 2-3 passes with a Mach-3 blade...</li>
            <li> Not sure if the fifth blade has anything to do with it, but it is quieter, lighter, better balanced, and gives a smoother shave than I ever remember any other Panasonic giving.</li>
            <li> With the head of the device that tilts in every angle possible,  i was at first worried that pushing too hard against my face would cause too much pressure at the joint.  </li>
            <li> with the ES-LV61-A &#x27;s \\&quot;Sonic vibration cleaning system\\&quot; and a small drop of liquid hand soap this thing comes squeeky clean in about 30 seconds of total time after your shave.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a blade, but much closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> That is kind of sad because I have found out that even though it is a little more expensive, the cleaning station does a more than average cleaning job on the shaver.   </li>
            <li> Rinse it off, and you&#x27;ve got a clear sharp shaver like new.</li>
            <li> This is because the trimmers are once again built into the back of the head, but because of the pivoting action must be built above the neck of the shaver.</li>
            <li> In the end I got the same shave in the same amount of time as with my old 3-blade model.</li>
            <li> Definitely loud enough to wake up the person next door.</li>
            <li> As this shaver is only 1 month old, I&#x27;m still trying out different angles to pick up that hair.</li>
            <li> While my old shaver still gave a close shave, it took several times going over the same place.  </li>
            <li> The extra cost is well worth the investment for the no hassle, trouble</li>
            <li> It cuts as close as a razor does without the painful scraping skin feeling, it pivots to get a closer shave around my jawline and neck, its very easy to clean, it leaves absolutely no irritation from day 1.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is probably the only broad range consumer products company whose products, no matter in which area, I will buy without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and only bought this high-end model because I got a major coupon.  </li>
            <li> first shave took a little bit longer (~5min) as I was getting used to the foil, but the consequtive ones are getting better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took several tries with Mrs. Boilermate&#x27;s small hands and greater coordination to get it back in.</li>
            <li> Since I have a shaver that takes advantage of the benefits of wet shaving, it makes no sense to not use a high quality shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my skin is simply used to electric shavers, but I get close shaves that last beyond 5pm, with no mess of shaving cream and no nicks from razors and my skin</li>
            <li> However, I try extremely hard to write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price,</li>
            <li> The extra expense is not needed as pulling the foil and running water over both leaves it clean and a simple pat down using a dry towel gets rid of the water.</li>
            <li> so I expect the new ones to last just as long.</li>
            <li> ensure the main cutters would not cause the head to be impossibly deep from front to back, they have been reduced in width considerably from those used on other models.</li>
            <li> and I think it took my well under half the time it normally takes to shave one day growth with the old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> So I figured if Dawn dishwashing liquid was good enough to clean up the horrific Valdez oil spill - not to mention save the lives of countless wild life</li>
            <li> So I figured if Dawn dishwashing liquid was good enough to clean up the horrific Valdez oil spill - not to mention save the lives of countless wild life</li>
            <li> They just are not worth it, at least not the ones that this particular model offers over other more basic models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They just are not worth it, at least not the ones that this particular model offers over other more basic models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like this I will keep it and never go back to any other</li>
            <li> After doing much research on Amazon and other websites, I decided to order the razor from Amazon, plus Amazon had it on sale with  50.00 instant coupon.</li>
            <li> It is a whole lot easier to shave with this razor than regular lather, brush and safety razor, due to my arm.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades consist of a cutter block, 2 foils above the cutter block, and 2 foils below the cutter block (the old model has only 1 foil above the cutter block).</li>
            <li> Long time rotary users will be surprised how your face will not be prepared for this shaver.  </li>
            <li> No excuse for water in the handle section.</li>
            <li> but it took nearly twice as long as it takes to shave with my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been oscillating between barely satisfied and not satisfied for the last few years when using a number of Norelco rotary shavers (mid-range to top-of-the-line).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a top-of-the-line Braun last year and returned it as it was too loud and pulled my hair when the hair was a bit long.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> If you buy something you&#x27;re going to use everyday, why not get the best?ve with hot foam or gel did not do the job as well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first for me, as I have sensitive skin which I usually have to slap with copious amounts of aftershave following each session.  </li>
            <li> Well wonder no more, it&#x27;s worth every bit.</li>
            <li> I followed the normal routine of wet shaving after a shower, 1) pre shave gel 2) worked up a lather with a badger brush 3)</li>
            <li> It may be considered a bit heavy by some but not uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li> But if this happens again, my rating will go down to one star (on the other hand, if it gives me years of service, I&#x27;ll raise my rating back up to my original 5-star rating).</li>
            <li> And left high and dry by Amazon since we are 2 1/2 months(!)</li>
            <li> , you absolutely cannot feel any stubble, it&#x27;s an extremely close shave!  </li>
            <li> The only things I don&#x27;t like about the &#x27;LV61 are minor: (1) like the ES8243, you can&#x27;t run it while it is plugged in for charging,  (2) the sideburn trimmer is a little smaller than the ES8243,  (3) it is easy for the &#x27;LV61 to get into head LOCK mode; you have to be remember to push the trimmer switch 2 full stops after using the trimmer to put the head back in FREE mode, (4) shaving time before recharge seems to be shorter than the advertised 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> the results with the Arc5 are nearly indistinguishable from the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I usually use shaving oil and gel cream; however, with this new shaver, it works very well dry or with water only.  </li>
            <li> center lift foil must have been inspired by the original and now defunct Braun Smart Foil, it lifts every single whisker no matter where, no matter how difficult and really does cut below the skin line for a blade quality</li>
            <li> I have a four blade, 1300 speed Panasonic, but decided  to buy the new five blade wet</li>
            <li> Trying to figure out why this item was reviewed that high by other people</li>
            <li> -- I was thinking of getting the black one just for the cleaning system, as the Braun had, but I don&#x27;t really miss the cleaner.</li>
            <li> It provides a close shave and holds a charge much longer then my previous razors.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people gave it less stars for &amp;#34;ergonomics&amp;#34; (really people?)</li>
            <li> My shaves now take half the time and the cut is much closer.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than my previous Panasonic Arc 4.  </li>
            <li> This was my first arc-5 after my last few being arc-4.  </li>
            <li> A full shave takes at least 5-10 minutes to go over spots several times.</li>
            <li> The head is a little large, but hasn&#x27;t seemed to be a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I did my research before buying this razor, it&#x27;s one of the best rated on amazon, so granted, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> With the new LV-61, I get an even closer shave than any of the prior models and suffer absolutely no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have turned to the Arc4 which offers a similar (if slightly lower) quality shave at a much lower price point and have accepted that I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new shaver every few years.</li>
            <li> Plus, the metallic blue is much nicer than the black finish of the cleaning unit version</li>
            <li> As mentioned in previous reviews, the Panasonic has a very efficient cleaning procedure that does not require a bulky external tank system and the ongoing purchase of cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li> After trying various products in combination with this shaver over the past few weeks, I find that my old reliable Gillette fusion gel, used sparingly, provides a smooth, close shave with zero irritation.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re holding a mirror and trying to get the fuzz on the back of your neck, it&#x27;s pretty difficult; much easier with my old Braun.    </li>
            <li> Only the back is rubberized and the front of the razor is smooth and gets slick when wet.</li>
            <li> If you are getting tired of the blades and looking for something else, this would be a fine choice.</li>
            <li> Even with a single day&#x27;s growth after shaving with this for several minutes I can go back to my old foil shaver and get rid of the remaining &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moreover, I found the Norelco had a tendency to shave off large patches of hair, in a particularly uneven manner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57, I have always used a blade, tough beard, and have to spend a lot of time, effort and shave cream to get a smooth shave  </li>
            <li> and I could never find an electric razor that was powerful enough to shave my beard without having to press hard on my face and make several passes resulting in irritation and eventually razor bumps.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cuts as close and as comfortable - not to mention crazy fast, as the Braun did before it&#x27;s fall from grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to shave around an intricate goatee or get right under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if you&#x27;ve had little success with other electrics.</li>
            <li> Also, despite have a 2-3 day growth for a few shavings the pulling was minimal wet or dry, although the pulling was more when used dry.      </li>
            <li> Due to the additional blade, the head is larger than the prior generation of 4 blade shavers, but not so large that it can&#x27;t be maneuvered well under your nose and around the contours of your face due to the multidirectional swiveling head (not just side to side, but also forwards and backwards as well as in and out).  </li>
            <li> The trick is to use less pressure than one would normally think to use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you would like a video of the whole exhausting process to finally achieve a decent look.</li>
            <li> Even if I wasn&#x27;t in the shower the sound is only a little louder and surely not obtrusive.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has to be used very carefully and sometimes that big old shaver head goes places you don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin with ingrown hair and was shaving with traditional shaving method till I turn into 32, result - lot of black marks under chin because of razor burns/bumps.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my old shaver was due for replacement blades and just doesn&#x27;t have the battery life it used to.</li>
            <li> Made me wonder why I tried other brands when my old Panasonic wore out.</li>
            <li> After waiting an eternity for the price of the Panasonic LV-61 to drop (it never really did!), I took the plunge and purchased one instead of replacing the expired foil and cutter of my trusty old Panasonic ES8249K.</li>
            <li> Second problem is with flat lying hair.</li>
            <li> Inspite of 5 blades, the shave would occasionally leave out some hair which are lying flat against the skin.</li>
            <li> When you remove the outerfoil apparatus, the innards are all flat with the two inner blades protruding up.</li>
            <li> I thought Norelco is in trouble if that is how they differentiate the high end from the low end.</li>
            <li> As delicately as I can put it, the trimmer does a good job on really thick hedges and gets things close enough to finish up with a razor, but don&#x27;t try the foil head on the final clear cut on those delicate parts.</li>
            <li> With the new blades and screen, my Arc 3 again reminded me of why I had always preferred it over any previous shaver</li>
            <li> The price will come down - it already has from nearly five hundred dollars (yes!)</li>
            <li> I do a typical 3 minute complete shave for my coarse facial hair which is saying</li>
            <li> That is not what one really wants due to the extreme abrasion.</li>
            <li> only thing i&#x27;m surprised at is that it&#x27;s a black plastic shell painted blue...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this method completely eliminates the formation of soap scum that would normally develop on the shaver parts over time from shaving cream and liquid soap.</li>
            <li> or so I tried various battery-powered electric shavers but was getting discouraged at how soon they would break/fail and how expensive they were becoming.  </li>
            <li> The 4-blade LA63 would barely have enough power after 5-minutes (from empty) to truly give me a work-presentable shave....time to get out the disposable razor.    </li>
            <li> The display panel on the handle shows how long the razor has been used since last charge and the percent charge left.</li>
            <li> The display panel on the handle shows how long the razor has been used since last charge and the percent charge left.</li>
            <li> A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) provides information about the shaver&#x27;s current state--how long it&#x27;s been on, whether it needs cleaning, what percent of charge is left.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that you cant have it plugged in and running but battery lasts long and charges in 5 minutes for 1 shave so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> the only problem is the battery won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor a few times now and have to say it does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> and I was disappointed, but this is such a good razor that there is no irritation from going against the grain</li>
            <li> I leaves the skin very soft with less passes.  </li>
            <li> Even with my less than thick growth the shaver does not do a good job on more than 3-4 days growth, it pulls quite uncomfortably and struggles to cut resulting in a much longer time to shave as you continually go back and forth over the same area experiencing a combination of cutting and pulling.</li>
            <li> The ES-LV61 mows through this growth effortlessly, and in only five minutes and 20 seconds---5:20 flat!!</li>
            <li> Norelco was very comparable to the Braun and probably would still have it if it was not for the poor quality of the new replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Typically, when I use a shaver in the morning I find the need to touch up later in the day or early evening.  </li>
            <li> It is completely waterproof and designed to be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It shaves nearly as close, dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Billy Jealousy Hydroplane, Jack Black Beard Lube, Aveeno shaving gel, various Edge and Gillette shaving gels, Noxzema Sensitive Skin shaving foam, Barbasol, Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, etc.</li>
            <li> With the box come a charger, a black leatherette soft case, and a brief instruction booklet.</li>
            <li> I would imagine that it works pretty well for women, legs, under arms, and lady parts (at least the northern area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes the battery life is not as long as some other brands, but they don&#x27;t shave nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;-Shaping limitations (a small gripe, really) for which I forgive it.&lt;br /&gt;-Won&#x27;t work when plugged</li>
            <li> after using razor for a long time, I thought about trying a different brand/type.</li>
            <li> I have used other manufacturers best electrics in the past but have always been disappointed ending up going back to blades.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts a long time and when it does need a charge it only takes about an hour.</li>
            <li> have no idea how long the blades will last.</li>
            <li> have no idea how long the blades will last.</li>
            <li> I lock it while going over the flat sides of my face; for around my jaw, to swivel; and for mustache and side burns, to  trim.</li>
            <li> The reviews talked of the long lasting close shave they got.</li>
            <li> After each shave, it briefly displays how long you have been shaving.</li>
            <li> Blades last twice a long as the $75 shavers</li>
            <li> The shaver has 3 settings--Free (the head swivels left and right up and down, Lock (no swivel) and trim (a little trimmer pops up) that can be changed single handedly.</li>
            <li> It really falls down trimming other hair.</li>
            <li> It looks like with a few tools the battery is not hard replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like with a few tools the battery is not hard replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once applied to the skin along with a little water, this shaving gel is clear and low foaming.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any real difference between this shaver and their previous shavers, other than the 5 cutter heads.  </li>
            <li> my high-end rotary Norelco (I should note that I&#x27;ve only ever shaved with an electric shaver and always shave dry).  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re also probably asking yourself why this shaver is so expensive and do you really have to spend this much money to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;Before delving in to the LV61-A</li>
            <li> Panasonic promotes this shaver as requiring less passes than my old model</li>
            <li> After about a year and a half of owning this shaver, I noticed the screen completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this I would shave with a Gillette Fusion blade razor, but after three or four days of shaving I would find it difficult to get a smooth shave</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic was two years old and had one blade change but never worked this well.</li>
            <li> The problem seems to be that the shaver head is too big which makes it harder to shave smaller areas.</li>
            <li> the outer blades are a bit spaced out from the inner blades, so there is an empty spot that i kinda have to go back and finish.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching and found myself ultimately going back and forth between the Braun 7 series and the Panasonic LV61.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it as a wet shaver yet,  but with a humid summer approaching, and the way it is currently performing I foresee no problems on this front.</li>
            <li> So far i have been using this shaver for the last few weeks</li>
            <li> That means I spent $200 up front and can expect continue to spend at least $130 a year keeping fresh blades on the shaver.</li>
            <li> Cons: the only thing that I might mention is that with its large razor head, it was somewhat awkward to use at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this shaver with a single pump of Kiss</li>
            <li> It only took a single pass with a couple touch-ups in the problem areas (parts of my neck and side of my jaw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic recommends replacing the foil head once a year and the cutters once every other year as a general guideline.  </li>
            <li> the one that is self cleaning, and more expensive, is not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I just returned the Philips Norelco, which started going really slow (with full battery) after less than a week.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- fast, cut my shaving time down in half and come out with a closer shave&lt;</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with 1st two,  just a sucker for new and better.  </li>
            <li> It typically takes no more than an hour to go from &#x27;empty&#x27; to a full charge.  </li>
            <li> , I can only say it works much better than the less expensive ($85?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After experimenting with different shaving techniques and products, I figured, this isn&#x27;t getting any better with the less expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> For those of you that have been using various brands of dry shavers, you will not go back once you switch to a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over five years now after I&#x27;ve come to a determination that Gillette and all the other manual razor systems are much more expensive to use.  </li>
            <li> but there is one major problem: The outer metal for oil gets little tiny brakes</li>
            <li> The razor is a deep Indigo blue with metallic  navy accents and a black rubber back</li>
            <li> The razor is a deep Indigo blue with metallic  navy accents and a black rubber back</li>
            <li> On the negative - comes with zero accessories other than the AC adapter and the bag, which is only large enough for the shaver.</li>
            <li> Opening the box, I was surprised how little was included...</li>
            <li> Foil shavers are faster and easier to adapt to, since they are very much like your gilette razors, but there are a few downsides - foils are difficult to clean since the hair gets trapped in the inner chamber and foil shavers</li>
            <li> and I also have very pronounced jaw bones, which means this shaver has a really hard time in my neck area and under the jaw</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as I have tried several cheaper versions, but one thing I had read over and over again after very much research was that with electric razors, you really do get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> What really shocked me was the meanness of the accessories included for the calibre of shaver this is...very cheap feeling soft case which is totally unsuitable for travel, no cleaning brush</li>
            <li> At least in my case, the shave was much closer, quicker, and smoother - I&#x27;d use the descriptive term \\&quot;substantially\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, don&#x27;t be afraid to use a lather, it works even better when you do.</li>
            <li> I researched a long time but never found a comparison between this and the three-headed units that I used for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as a wet shaver in the shower with cream</li>
            <li> Hold&#x27;s its charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> If it continues to work like this for a long time, then I will stay with Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The trimmer had a long reach and the ergonomics were spot on.  </li>
            <li> The head is massive; it is about the width of two manual razors across and about three manual razors wide.</li>
            <li> Just thought I&#x27;d add my thoughts on this shaver as a long time</li>
            <li> As someone who serves in the military and HAS to have a close shave daily</li>
            <li> I paid $260 for this piece of %$#@ for crying out loud.  </li>
            <li> Long battery</li>
            <li> and it holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> shaver is about .5 inches longer than the LV61 and that length (which I consider a disadvantage in ergonomics and handling) is all in the head, which stands taller than the LV61 and makes it appear larger though it really is not.</li>
            <li> Gifts, not directly sent out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only way I can get any satisfaction is to shave every day and spend twice as long on it as I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> The charge on it is  really long.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve used a number of different shaving creams, gels, solutions over my years of wet shaving with Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> Shaving everyday with a razor is completely torturous for me, therefore I turned to electric.</li>
            <li> I have used normal packet razors and metal razors, have tried a Phillips but was too rough and still left small stubble.  </li>
            <li> took a shot on this one and I have been pleasantly surprised by how close it gets everyday.  </li>
            <li> My old Panasonic ES8066 has lasted me for years, it still works, but has had a few falls, but it is built like a tank.  </li>
            <li> long, thorough shaves at a minimum.</li>
            <li> But for some reason normal razors now require a small mortgage to pay for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of the cleaning system, it is a complete waste on all levels:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> then i tried the series 3 Braun and it could not get me the shave that it says it can and took me twice as long to shave</li>
            <li> but with the time I save in the morning from having to shave with a blade and irritating my skin, the cost of the Panasonic is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It lacks in some areas, enough to take it down a star in terms of value for the money but rest assured that when it comes to the sole purpose of shaving, this is the shaver to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently lost 75% usage from my right arm, which made regular shaving extremely difficult, my wife suggested an electric razor.</li>
            <li> the more inclined I am to believe that the quality will surpass the less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and a razor blade and there is only a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> I mean, really.</li>
            <li> I mean, really.</li>
            <li> This is about my 4th or 5th Panasonic (when it comes time to replace the foil/cutters I usually just buy a new shaver).  </li>
            <li> Panasonic far exceeds the quality of every other shaver on the market, hands down.  </li>
            <li> Not too worried about the other features such as battery life -</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of electric shavers - there are some brands that shave closer than a razor!</li>
            <li> While shaving my face, this doesn&#x27;t matter as they feel the same, but when shaving my head, it just doesn&#x27;t feel all that stable in my hand due to the way you have to hold onto it.</li>
            <li> Did not take that long to make me a convert!</li>
            <li> The Arc5 provides an extremely close shave  in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now, it gives me a great shave with little irritation and the battery doesn&#x27;t crap out too soon</li>
            <li> After several years of trying other razors I returned to the panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Panosonic razors but have tried all the other leading models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but appears to be well worth the money!</li>
            <li> In my 40&#x27;s I still only need to shave every other day.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant due to the 5 blades and the possible awkwardness of trying to shave.  </li>
            <li> The only other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned is the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, so I&#x27;m using that as a baseline.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a petroleum derivative or other potentially harmful non-organic products on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had it for 6 weeks now and It still irritates my face a bit and even make me bleed a tiny bit sometimes but other than that it is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Electric razors have come a long way!  </li>
            <li> Once you try the Panasonic, you will understand why every other company vastly reduces the price of their shavers during the Holidays.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and sensitive, my beard tough - using a blade takes forever with a lot of nicks, so I stick to electric.  </li>
            <li> Having spent my whole life with an electric razor it is hard to tell people to go retro.  </li>
            <li> have had other electric shavers and I stopped using them quickly  since they did a poor job...</li>
            <li> Being a very long time electric shaver user I dismissed the note that says, please take a month to get use to the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was some of the grippy material on the front/face of the shaver, but this is a very minor quibble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to shave in the shower, so dry shaving, preceded by a shaver powder stick, is my procedure.  </li>
            <li> dry was a disaster shaving that makes you look like a clown with hair</li>
            <li> to dry shave 2 days beard,</li>
            <li> when done with the soap cleaning process, just pop the foil off, rinse the foil and head, blow out any excess water and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how it works as a dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> All you do is turn it off, rinse it off, and set it on your counter to dry.</li>
            <li> All you do is turn it off, rinse it off, and set it on your counter to dry.</li>
            <li> I use it dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used electric razors and always shaved dry.</li>
            <li> (the dry gets</li>
            <li> I shave dry with a shaving stick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this shaver dry.</li>
            <li> Tried both dry and with shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> (Alternatively, you could leave the head detached from the shaver to air dry if you have the space to do so.)</li>
            <li> I shave dry with a shave stick</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower, use it dry - works well either way.  </li>
            <li> This works well dry</li>
            <li> Dry</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it I charged it up and gave it a test run with a dry shave</li>
            <li> I noticed a few people mention that it was really only 2-blades, since when you pop the cover off, you only see two blades.  </li>
            <li> The only caveats about its performance are that I have to make multiple passes over my neck, and that it can snag on my hairs a bit when I let my stubble grow out for a few days.  </li>
            <li> All the shavers discussed here are about the same length and weight so the weight missing from this model&#x27;s head must be in the handle, giving it that solid</li>
            <li> I am a black male in the military with very coarse beard hair</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is just gives a very poor shave, will not cut whiskers that are not standing up straight and the blades last barely 4 months.</li>
            <li> This razor did not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I had no particular reason, other than to try something different.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 and have a pretty tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty tough beard</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, let me explain just what this shaver is shaving, every single day of the year.</li>
            <li> This is repeated every single day, no problem at all.</li>
            <li> It conforms to every single angle and curve with a definitive hug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shaves on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> charging unit does not come with a giant black box that takes up five sockets on a outlet strip, but instead it has a small (wider than normal) plug that takes up a single outlet and weights less than several pounds.</li>
            <li> becuase I&#x27;s a matter of one day before having a very red neck wtih rough hair painfull  to touch, tried the other shavers like philips ( 3 circular heads) but neve worked.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard and normally shave four or five times a week.  </li>
            <li> I popped the compartment off (like when you clean the blades) and the trimmer started working again, but I&#x27;m afraid to use it with those exposed-blades (as soon as I put that part back on it stops working again).  </li>
            <li> I have the next model down and comparing it to that</li>
            <li> Since trying the LV61, my shave time has gone down to about 1:45 to 2:00 because I don&#x27;t have to make multiple passes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even really down to personal preference of shaver, because it&#x27;s not always a (frontal lobe) choice.</li>
            <li> I do like the ability to lock and open the head so it will move up and down or stay locked in one position.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blades are a little pricey, but I haven&#x27;t had the razor long enough to have to purchase yet.  </li>
            <li> and short, I suggest steering clear of buying a more expensive version of a shaver because of seemingly useless bells and whistles.</li>

            <li> - obviously Panasonic shavers will cost a lot less to maintain over the years  Value for Money  :</li>
            <li> They need to show a picture of a black one for the black line and then the blue for the blue line.</li>
            <li> It works well wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> do dry shaves, haven&#x27;t tried it wet</li>
            <li> Switching from the Braun to the Panasonic, it only takes me about 4 minutes to shave, which is almost 2 minutes less than it took with the Braun.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, the bigger heads on the LA63 and LV61 result in shorter trimmers than the 8103S.</li>
            <li> It shaves nicely wet or dry, although sometimes it misses or tugs hairs.</li>
            <li> and I have shaved both wet and dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost been a year and usually these heads last about 18 months, but I&#x27;m starting to notice a degradation in closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had to take extra passes, but that went away after a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> * Can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the time saving elements of a dry shave but will tell you that a wet shave is even closer and faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still prefer the time saving elements of a dry shave but will tell you that a wet shave is even closer and faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head construction is also not ideal and very flimsy overall.</li>
            <li> I have used it primarily wet shaving and twice dry.  </li>
            <li> The next day my mouth was less tender</li>
            <li> both wet and dry</li>
            <li> Wet or Dry</li>
            <li> 799CC-6WD CC4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver to replace the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both wet and dry methods</li>
            <li> My Face Moisture Shave mixed with a little water for the face, and a single pump for the head as well.</li>
            <li> However, with the Panasonic I notice that my 5-o&#x27;clock shadow is not nearly as visible as with some other shavers.  </li>
            <li> On the negative side:  The only negative is a pretty subjective one: the price.  </li>
            <li> The very first expensive shaver that I&#x27;ve bought in my life.</li>
            <li> it looks cheap (compared to my previous one)and does not recharge by induction (too expensive to produce</li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-VI is black and has a few, I&#x27;m too old to say it</li>
            <li> If you measure the distance of where those 2 main blades are, they are a little less than half an inch towards the center of the head.  </li>
            <li> This is a little harder to get in the tight spots like near your nose or by the sideburns.</li>
            <li> From what it looks like the shaver at times pushes some hair flat against the skin, where the razor over subsequent passes is not able to lift and cut.  </li>
            <li> For the past 10 years or so I&#x27;ve been using a routine of alternating every other day between a Norelco 3 head pivoting razor and using a manual razor, either a Gilette Fusion Proglide power and a Schick Hydro 5 sensitive series.</li>
            <li> I only bought the LV61 because the price had dropped from around $400 to a little under $200.  </li>
            <li> If only it had died a little sooner (under 30 days), Amazon would have handled it for me.</li>
            <li> This is a major improvement over the ES-LA93K, which I have used for the past years.</li>
            <li> From a usage standpoint, assuming I get several years out of it, the price is a little easier to swallow.</li>
            <li> Also, I wish the travel bag that was included was a little bigger.  </li>
            <li> This model is a little big for travel</li>
            <li> When the cleaning icon comes up on the LCD you simply turn the shaver off, wet the head of the shaver and apply a little liquid hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my old Norelco (with the goo) and the difference is hard to imagine.</li>
            <li> The inclination to press hard is natural but try to avoid undue pressure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a tough fast growing bread and I  use it as a wet shaver in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to have to replace the foil or the blades, but when I do, I am going to think long and hard about it.  </li>
            <li> I suffered for many years with a bad shave.  </li>
            <li> but I think many guys have this issue; and 2) the battery needs charging every 10 shaves or so, which isn&#x27;t bad, but I wish it lasted longer.  </li>
            <li> the cutting blades aren&#x27;t powerful or precise, so the the four foils are just useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but these bells and whistles seem like a way to merely increase the price of the shaver than actually serving any useful purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The LV 61 did all of this without the frequent hair pulling on the longer hairs that was so common with the LA 63.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An old girlfriend, who always complained about finding untamed whiskers said that I had never had a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my sensitive skin or any breakouts on my neck which were fairly common with my Norelco.</li>
            <li> and I received a replacement in a few weeks) and the replacement died shortly after the expiration of the warranty.  </li>
            <li> a wet shave provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried it wet</li>
            <li> It takes a couple passes to get the hair on my neck but from what I hear that&#x27;s to be expected from electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I have not tried a wet shave yet</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i have  such a heavy beard , but this does it.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> The cutters point out perpendicular to the shaver with absolutely no protection, it will cut through skin.</li>
            <li> I use it wet, with a foam, because that&#x27;s what I am used to.</li>
            <li> I found that the Panasonic 5 blade, although expensive, is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> There is no real difference between this and a blade for my beard.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when shaving your head and all is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacement foils/cutters are expensive (but they are worth it because of the quality of the shave)</li>
            <li> Of course, regular razor blades are not cheap either, so I guess it may balance out.  </li>
            <li> yes it is expensive but worth.</li>
            <li> , the LV 61 is expensive but, is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really no question.</li>
            <li> It gets even closer wet, shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> very dissapointed, lot of time for a poor shave.</li>
            <li> Everything about it speaks of quality, ergonomics and careful execution.</li>
            <li> and I expected an execellent razor.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot from a shaver that, as of this writing, retails for five hundred bucks.</li>
            <li> The head has a wide \\&quot;margin\\&quot; around it, making precision shaving a challenge.</li>
            <li> Next I use a couple pumps of USkincare Oil-Free Aloe Hydrant Gel with Green Tea and spread it across my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I also bought a Norelco a few years back.  </li>
            <li> It does everything I expected.  </li>

            <li> I recently decided to use the Braun for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s painless by the way there&#x27;s absolutely no sense of pulling or burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It takes a few hours before my hair grows out to appear the way it did immediately after shaving with my prior 4 blade Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the Panasonic ES-LV61 wet with a shaving cream that I have been using for about 15 years (from the Body Shop...</li>
            <li> so i send repair shop at McAllen exchange center.</li>
            <li> Giving this shaver a five-star rating after trying a Philips norelco 3D with not much of satisfaction.</li>
            <li> the display on the shaver shows the charge you have and time you spent shaving</li>
            <li> Wet the shave is so close.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for last few weeks, daily beard and few times rest of my head per week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what the advertisers say about comparing this to a wet razor shave.</li>
            <li> wet razor shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all when your face is wet.</li>
            <li> the last one, so I don&#x27;t need to risk losing the cord when I travel for a few days.  </li>
            <li> display and the lock work exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Only required are a few drops of liquid hand soap, tap water, and the engagement of a 20-sec vibration cycle.</li>
            <li> The latest model (pulsonic) didn&#x27;t irritate as much but the shave closeness was terrible.  </li>
            <li> Probably at least worth the difference in price between this model and the slow Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use the razor when it&#x27;s plugged in, kind of annoying when you aren&#x27;t paying attention</li>
            <li> When I first began using the shaver, I was a little disappointed because my skin was slightly red for the first few days.</li>
            <li> Yeah the replacement blades are pricey too, but at least I&#x27;m able to find replacement blades unlike some other brand razor that shall remain nameless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other electric razors and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other electric razors and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> It is well built, feels solid in the hand and its narrow head makes it extremely maneuverable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaves faster than my previous Panasonic 3-blade model but like my previous model it leaves some hair that grows parallel to my skin.</li>
            <li> I then re-attach the shaver head and set the shaver down to air dry.</li>
            <li> It is certainly far easier to clean, I would now rank Panasonic No. 1</li>
            <li> When my electric kettle beeps, I pour the water into my Dirty Bird Pottery shaving scuttle (original style).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being about 80 years old and very lazy</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say there&#x27;s really no difference, other than the Arc 5 is \\&quot;quicker\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> If this were a $50 electronic-razor I would&#x27;ve given it 2 stars, but since I paid nearly $200 for this, it only gets 1 star because nothing that expensive should last less than a year.</li>
            <li> I am not positive</li>
            <li> The first locks the head of the shaver from pivoting, and the second pops out the trimmer for cutting sideburns.  </li>
            <li> Both shavers say you can use them with shaving cream, so about half the shaves were done dry and the rest after lathering up with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> There are probably less expensive versions of this razor – fewer bells and whistles - if the shave is anywhere near this one, go for it, but this one far surpassed my wildest expectations</li>
            <li> Braun was good, but if I didn&#x27;t shave for a few days I would have trouble cutting the thick hairs.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor and Feather razor blades for several years, and with a Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor (Series 8000) when I&#x27;m too lazy to lather up for a blade shave.  </li>
            <li> I looked for braun and panasonic, and was about to get braun due to promotion</li>
            <li> razors are a thing of the past... saves alot of time, no irritation, don&#x27;t need any after shave cream, wish I saw this earlier</li>
            <li> 9-17-12 - While replying to some comments on my review, I decided to read what other people were saying in their reviews.  </li>
            <li> Inside of the foil that you pop-off, are the other 3 blades.  </li>
            <li> I came across this due to necessity.</li>
            <li> Instead, it is packaged and represented like any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Instead, it is packaged and represented like any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seemed expensive at a first glance</li>
            <li> Have never used it any other way.</li>
            <li> I prefer Panasonic shavers to the other brands (Braun, Norelco, Remington)</li>
            <li> Been using this shaver for about 6 years and would not use any other.</li>
            <li> I have had other elec.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the Mach-3/Quattro/Fusion manual razor wars, where each manufacturer would try to up the other in terms of the number of blades.  </li>
            <li> I suspect this is due to the fact that it is a wet-dry shaver, so it automatically disables function when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Like the footprint, not too big or small - fits in the medicine cabinet, no sweat.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric razors in the past and have always gone back.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about the claims</li>
            <li> The other three blades are built into the screen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using on him, but definitely not worth the $200 plus dollars spent.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but there is no denying this is the closest shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the one I received was defective or not, but I had to go over the same spot on my face like 20-30 times before there was any noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what he said, \\&quot;I have tried electric shavers in the past but have never been a big fan.  </li>
            <li> use is every other day.</li>
            <li> Just like other electric shavers, Panasonic tells you it will take up to 30 days for your face to \\&quot;get</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something you will use and appreciate every day or can get away with using every other day.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the closeness, they are all about the same including the ne Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I have tried them in the past and they have always irritated my skin and did not get a close enough shave as seen with a razor.  </li>
            <li> &quot; in the blades and foils work extremely well.</li>
            <li> both my skin and the float system of the head have gotten used to each other - the shave has improved.</li>
            <li> both my skin and the float system of the head have gotten used to each other - the shave has improved.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for 35 years and the Panasonic ES-LV61-A $268.00 gives a closer shave than any of the other 17 shavers I have tested.</li>
            <li> Yes, they work extremely well in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have used every generation of Panasonic shaver for the past &amp;#62;20 years, and I upgraded to this model from their last generation Arc 4 model.  </li>
            <li> otherwise you will lose the ability to use the other socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hesitated due to its price.</li>
            <li> then other shavers</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first read the other reviews here</li>
            <li> That finally broke and for the past 8 years</li>
            <li> Faster than the other shavers (Braun &amp; Panasonic) that I have owned.</li>
            <li> The other quit after 3 yrs</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is not necessary to buy the insurance since I have never gotten past three years with their shavers.</li>
            <li> After reading up on the Arc 5 shaver, I was convinced this was the shaver for me due to the wet/dry capabilities.</li>
            <li> I have used it wet and dry, the wet shave is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but to me, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Pretty inconvenient in the middle of a shave to say the least, especially as it doesn&#x27;t function while plugged into an outlet.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric I&#x27;ve used to get at the neck folds (hate these things), and some other awkward areas.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s disappointing that the other model failed twice, it&#x27;s good customer service to offer an upgraded replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my previous Panasonic wet/dry shaver dry a few times and preferred it wet.</li>
            <li> I have always thought of using an electric for a wet shave to be somewhat of a gimmick - well I&#x27;ve given it a few tries and the expperiance</li>
            <li> I have always thought of using an electric for a wet shave to be somewhat of a gimmick - well I&#x27;ve given it a few tries and the expperiance</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really tired of thinking about what is wrong with an electric shaver i paid more than 200 bucks....</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with the Norelco, despite being advertised as being able to dry shave, was never able to do so without irritating my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is only annoying if you are a light sleeper and the blinking LED indicator in a dark room</li>
            <li> mess\\&quot; not to mention impossible - unless I liked looking like a Zombie  from a George Romero Movie, not a good</li>
            <li> The Norelco can be used wet, but has very small hair chambers and can be quite difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> A few drops of Shave Secret (a blend of natural oils that does not clog the pores) with only a few drops of water</li>
            <li> The unique cutting foil had what seemed an arbitrary array of different punch outs, half moons, octagons, stars , triangles and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a method to the madness as it lifted virtually every hair no matter how short or how difficult.</li>
            <li> The power plug is a little wide</li>
            <li> I am active duty military and must shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Notwithstanding that it has 5 blades, it seems to have less drag, or certainly no more drag, the other Panasonics I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first has the cleaner, bad and recharger, the second, shown here, doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price.  </li>
            <li> I now have the same complaint.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise that was my only complaint with this.</li>
            <li> As others mentioned, the only negative is the price although it has dropped quite a bit from it&#x27;s lofty launch price.</li>
            <li> One complaint about the Panasonics over the Braun is that the Braun can be plugged into the AC charger and can be used at the same time.  </li>
            <li> This is really only a concern for \\&quot;always late\\&quot; people like myself when you are late for work, go to use the electric shaver</li>
            <li> (ES&#x3D;LA-63) is nicer inside than the ES-LA-93, although I stopped using the cleaner unit on that one lately, and use it a a charging stand and dryer only.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price IMO.</li>
            <li> At least for my hair, which is fairly coarse, so it takes forever to get my head shaved if I skip a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I think this item does not worth 150-200 USD.</li>
            <li> I called Panasonic for Customer Service, but I got an outside hire not equipped to handle or forward a complaint or offer a solution.</li>
            <li> I find the cleaner does work, but the noise and the bother are not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The larger head may be negative factor for some</li>
            <li> No matter how much time I spend shaving, by 5:00 every day I have that stereotypical shadow.  </li>
            <li> That being said this shaver is just not worth what Panasonic is asking for it.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this shaver is expensive, but my thought was (1) I’ll use it almost every day (minimally 5-days/week) and (2) had my last electric razor for about 5-years.</li>
            <li> I never liked the big cleaning mechanism that came with the four blade, so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Average time displayed is 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The inner and outer blades have to be replaced at least every two years.</li>
            <li> Really, I would forgo the more expensive version of this and save the plastic, electricity, and chemicals used in the cleaning/charging base and go for the simpler model.</li>
            <li> It has saved me from soap and water, I had a battery powered shaver before but was to slow, not enough</li>
            <li> However, after more than 6 months, I hate it.</li>
            <li> Also, the shaver has a large edge around the blades which make it almost impossible to shave the areas around my side burns, therefore I must use the detail trimmer around the entire side burn area during every shave.     </li>
            <li> I had to go slowly and with the grain until I got it cut down enough to go against the grain.</li>
            <li> Currently it seems like replacement blades for the 5-blade LV61 are around $75-$99 or so and not easily found on Amazon (as of this writing) - this may play a small factor in your buying decision.    </li>
            <li> Only negative is it is a lot louder than previous shavers I have owned.</li>
            <li> I had it down to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> It just mows &#x27;em down.</li>
            <li> It has cut down the shaving time from 10 minutes down to 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The instructions show a tear down to dispose of the battery.</li>
            <li> The instructions show a tear down to dispose of the battery.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re putting down five benjamins for this system, then replacement blade costs probably aren&#x27;t going to deter you from making the purchase.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever had, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I just trim it down...</li>
            <li> They all serve to break down and soften the whiskers which are made of Keratin which is quite dense and found in the enamel of our teeth as well.</li>
            <li> They all serve to break down and soften the whiskers which are made of Keratin which is quite dense and found in the enamel of our teeth as well.</li>
            <li> I replaced hands down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been on trips where I&#x27;ve worn the battery down on the trip</li>
            <li> My routine was to shave down, reapply shaving cream and shave up against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came down to the Braun 7 series and the Arc 5.</li>
            <li> Because of the high center arch it&#x27;s impossible to get the foils to lay flat on your scalp</li>
            <li> usually opt for dry shaving</li>
            <li> On multiple-day growth it pulled noticeably when used dry, but no more so than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Dry shaving and no razor burns, usually takes 2-3 minutes for beard and 6-8 minutes for head and beard..</li>
            <li> Dawns patented grease and oil cutting properties, strip those nano blades slick clean.</li>
            <li> Dawns patented grease and oil cutting properties, strip those nano blades slick clean.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is not a smooth cut, and it is difficult to reach certain areas.  </li>
            <li> For the last 30 days after arriving in the mail from Amazon, I have been getting unbelievably close shaves with very little or no irritation and/or hair bumps</li>
            <li> It gives me a slightly closer shave that</li>
            <li> With this one I&#x27;m finished in 4 Minutes, and because it takes less time</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that they advertise a picture of a \\&quot;blue\\&quot; razor and then send the black one.</li>
            <li> The 4-blade LA63 feels slightly heavier and top-heavy.  </li>
            <li> previously had a Braun Series 3-350cc</li>
            <li> Leaves a slight burning sensation after the shave is completed</li>
            <li> If the hairs get longer than half an inch, the foil won&#x27;t cut them without pulling.</li>
            <li> It takes me half the time to shave now, and I have to go over spots</li>
            <li> again much less</li>
            <li> The closeness stays with me through the day, with much less 5 o&#x27;clock shadow than before.</li>
            <li> This razor definately shaves closer than my previous rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> It produces a shave just as close as I got with a brand name 5 blade razor in half the time and without any cuts, nicks, or razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Twice the shave in half the time.</li>
            <li> However, I will definitely look to an alternative when this one wears out its utility (which may be sooner than later unfortunately –</li>
            <li> This of course is a nightmare if you did not notice you were low on charge and started shaving, only to have the battery die mid-shave (which unfortunately has happened to me).</li>
            <li> I had the previous one (4 blades) and decided to upgrade to 5 blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it would typically be at 5:00 the day before.  </li>
            <li> this(it is usually less when sold by Amazon</li>
            <li> With his Braun machine it took him half an hour to shave n</li>
            <li> still would leave some black spots of hair.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s 5-Blade Shaving System with Nanotech Blades, Black is no exception.</li>
            <li> This is an upgrad from my previous BRAUN 5400 series.</li>
            <li> I shaved one half of my face with the Panasonic and half with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Panasonic ES8243A.</li>
            <li> Cons: There is no stand for the razor so that it can rest vertically and take up less shelf space.</li>
            <li> On the upside I can shave in less then 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This thing cuts way closer than my rotary shavers with less irritation and it cuts closer and faster than my Braun series 5 and 7 foil shaver</li>
            <li> The small cleaning brush needs a small compartment on the outside of the carrying case so it doesn&#x27;t get lost.  </li>
            <li> It takes less than 4 minutes to shave.</li>
            <li> Previously used 2 LA63 ARC4&lt;</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smoother then with a calssic razor and takes less time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Replaced a previous Panasonic electric razor that i had for years.  </li>
            <li> Shaving time is less than 5 min, as shown on the LCD display.</li>
            <li> and I want something that can endure the slightly harsher environment.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned earlier, the trimmer is, unfortunately, the same as the LA63 and a little too short, making it difficult to see what you are doing because of the big head partly obstructing your view.&lt;br /&gt;Now about the 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Add a little dishwashing liquid or liquid soap to the outer blades, hold down the power button to activate the \\&quot;sonic vibration mode\\&quot;, at which point the razor self-cleans.  </li>
            <li> only had a little trouble on stubble under my nose and under my chin where my neck meets my head, but this is common to all electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I started using it wet, however, it gave me an unbelievably close shave.  </li>
            <li> Not good enough to get up to the line, though (hence the 4 stars).</li>
            <li> The only negative I have thus far is the size of the head makes it difficult to get under the nose area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not be afraid or intimidated by the higher cost of the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I had those thick hairs, and they were getting long.</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery last for me approximately about 2 weeks with the razor being used every other day.  </li>
            <li> If money is tight, go with another Panasonic model.  </li>
            <li> On a few of my previous Panasonic shavers, the LCD display had problems after a year or so, but I have had no problems with the LCD display on this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I think this razor is a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> the on/off button, which could be triggered as one shaves, has a little lever to keep it from being shut off should one&#x27;s holding of the shaver bring fingers to that area.  </li>
            <li> That is a little misleading.  </li>
            <li> --it cleans with just water and a little bit of liquid soap.</li>
            <li> These products are relatively expensive when compared to drug store brands, but they last quite a while because I have to use only a small amount each time.</li>
            <li> but I find little difference in the amount of passes required.</li>
            <li> but now I appreciate how little it weighs.</li>
            <li> no fiddling with little brushes.  </li>
            <li> Shaving gel gets a little closer shave.  </li>
            <li> /fall off of the surface of your skin, and gets even slicker with the application of a little water.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for the past 15 years and always have been a fan of Panasonic due to its wet/dry versatility.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- just a little noisy</li>
            <li> but I am facing little difficulty when cleaning hairs from chin and neck.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the large head would prevent my getting to the tight places...</li>
            <li> Also, the head was so big that it was very hard to get a close shave around the neck and jawline.</li>
            <li> and it is a bit awkward shaving around it as the head is a bit large</li>
            <li> If you push hard you can irritate your skin a little but not much.  </li>
            <li> Usually on the neck, directly under the chin, but also occasionally in other random places on the cheek.  </li>
            <li> In just slightly over half the time it usually took with the LA 63</li>
            <li> have very thick hair and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing in the three years, I probably would have spent close to that much money on disposable blades and shaving cream - so the deal isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Where they are similar is that they both have only two cutting blades.</li>
            <li> Replacement parts are expensive so with not much choice, i went back to razor blades.  </li>
            <li> I use this shaver with a Wet application and find that I don&#x27;t have to constantly redo difficult shaving areas.  </li>
            <li> Crazy fast 14,000 cycles per minute</li>
            <li> I have severe arthritis in my hands and some things are just too heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the one criticism regarding the missing stand.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with that at all.</li>
            <li> and it was completely dead - no display,</li>
            <li> I inquired by email to Panasonic support and after a few days got instructions to mail it in for warranty replacement.</li>
            <li> but they always seem a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for work purposes, though I&#x27;d probably still go with a manual razor for going out to dinner, or something like that</li>
            <li> The shaver sliced through them without any trouble or snagging.</li>
            <li> When I let my beard grow longer than 3-4 days, I do notice some pulling, but nothing too harsh like</li>
            <li> , this LV61 shaver is not interchangeable with the shaver on the LV81 cleaning/docking system; the LV61 is missing three electrodes on the rear of the body which allow charging with the cleaning/docking system.  </li>
            <li> I just learned that you need to replace the blades every few months, which at the time of writing, cost an additional $64 per replacement.</li>
            <li> Something else I noticed is that immediately after shaving, the hairs are invisible, but become visble again within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4 shaver for approximately 2 years religiously changing the outer foil and dinner blade has</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on the Arc 5 and would advise going with a lower model.</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t waste your money on razors with cleaning stands.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worse, the front to back pivot motion I consider so&lt;</li>
            <li> Eliminates the frustration of arriving somewhere with a dead razor.</li>
            <li> I got an effortless shave, with fewer passes, and no grays left behind.</li>
            <li> , I wish I&#x27;d known about Panasonic sooner as I&#x27;d have wasted</li>
            <li> The two trouble spots continue to be trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> Under close inspection, there were two breaks in the foil where the metal separating two holes was missing.  </li>
            <li> A FEW TIPS THAT MAY</li>
            <li> A FEW TIPS THAT MAY</li>
            <li> The base the system gets filled with gunk which must be cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Just remove the foil blade cover after every few shaves and rinse the foil and blades.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and would always get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at around 4 pm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had an ES8249K, an ES8243A, an ES8109S and also an ES-LA63, which I returned after two weeks as it was just too bulky, heavy and caused my hand to cramp.)</li>
            <li> I then remove the shaver head and give the shaver and head a few shakes to remove any excess cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have dropped it in the garbage accidently a few times.</li>
            <li> Brought the Panasonic ES-LV61 a few days ago and the shave it gives is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> And, it saves me a few minutes somehow...</li>
            <li> It is broken inner holder</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for me, paying this type of money for something to shave my face with seemed completely unreasonable and useless.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> All round?</li>
            <li> to go through few passes to get it all shaved but is closest to a razor.</li>
            <li> The panasonic leaves them both for dead in terms of shave tiime &amp; closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want to chance getting another defective product with such poor customer service.</li>
            <li> On the other hand it blocks the trimmer from view and makes it difficult to get into tight places (especially to shave around or trim a beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this with Jack Black Shave Lube (Over sink, not shower) and got a shave that was as close as the blade I usually use (Gilette Fusion).</li>
            <li> break in a few months, and the cartridges are not easily obtained in here.</li>
            <li> No more mess with the shave cream.</li>
            <li> That may be commonfor guys with beards that aren&#x27;t as thick, but it&#x27;s foreign to me.  </li>
            <li> My beard grows quite slowly and if I don&#x27;t shave every other day with this I have to use a blade.  </li>
            <li> I used the product as instructed and was not pressing hard on my neck area at all, and the bleeding is what made me realize that this product is not worth even $20.  </li>
            <li> and if a less expensive version would have yeilded the same results...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this you must be thinking about moving over from another brand such as Braun or Remington or moving up from a less expensive Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Next, I rinse my face with cold water to close the pores and towel dry.</li>
            <li> the first shave from this bad boy was quite remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first shave from this bad boy was quite remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was beginning to slow down.</li>
            <li> short battery life: drains down in a few days, even if not used; a little disappointing for the cost</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only two shortcomings I see are: 1) the stubble on my neck can be a little difficult to remove and once the shaving cream is removed, I notice some spots I missed...</li>
            <li> I have a light beard and it&#x27;s hard for the razor to get to the base of some if the hairs.</li>
            <li> I almost always draw blood when using a razor and my skin always feels raw.  </li>
            <li> Like almost all shavers these days there is a center cutting strip (which Panny calls slit foil) in the middle.</li>
            <li> My face has some \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; hair shaving needs and that shaver meet expectation if not perfectly than close enough..</li>
            <li> think the price however should be at least half off of what it is.</li>
            <li> battery lasts 2 weeks and shaves in a minute or less and my beard is really thick.  </li>
            <li> close, quick, pain-free shave that doesn&#x27;t cut the crap out of your face.</li>
            <li> I therefore suspect that this razor does well with taut skin (skin covering the jaw and scalp), but suffers terribly with skin that is more malleable (along the cheeks and neck, with no hard bone underneath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I usually ended up with raw skin.  </li>
            <li> I suggest not getting lured by some of the bells and whistles of this model that, in my opinion, are of very little value in practice.</li>
            <li> and I had to buy a lot of them since they get dull just after a few shavings.</li>
            <li> It looks expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I know this is slightly unfair to Norelco because it was the low end version</li>
            <li> The problem turned out to be the small electronic switch on the circuit board-</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m set for a few years, shaver-wise!  </li>
            <li> I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It also irritates my skin and causes redness, and at a few points has even caused me to bleed!  </li>
            <li> For example, the digital display of the percent battery remaining is nearly useless.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers on/off for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> No more blade shaving for me.</li>
            <li> What was promised in the literature and online blurb to be a simple job is so difficult.</li>
            <li> had a lesser model Panasonic, on which the LED display failed.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable.....</li>
            <li> my beard is growing in all directions, small hair under the skin , shaving with a razor was not  not an option since 11 years,</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used electric shavers from Norelco and Braun, and had settled on a Panasonic Arc 3.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a blade in the past, and (again for me)</li>
            <li> I am a guy with a heavy beard (I use a shared amazon account with my wife, but I assure you I&#x27;m a guy!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give it a 4.5 for the slick front but will do a 5.0 because I can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed any speed increase over the version that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I also got a number of small cuts as well.</li>
            <li> The final con is the price, this is a seriously expensive razor  </li>
            <li> (the LCD screens on my past 3 or 4 wet/drys have gone haywire for some reason but</li>
            <li> This display is absolutely useless: 1, because it is not interesting information, and 2, it stays on so briefly that by the time I&#x27;ve done checking out the shave, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> and there was no more redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> Initially I had some acne breakouts on my chin where it was difficult to shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not many.</li>
            <li> Using the cheaper electric shavers, with &amp;#34;Satisfaction Guarantee&amp;#34; on the box did the job, as shaving my face obviously, but they were still uncomfortable and gave me</li>
            <li> I shave my scalp and face about every two days, so it usually takes about 20 minutes a shave.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is mediocre and short but it does work.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not just a small cord that can be rolled up and put in a bag.</li>
            <li> always shave wet and use a product called Shave Secret instead of cream or gel.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty I lost the cord during a recent trip and it was difficult to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> so it was definitely past its prime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Italian man, with a very tough beard that grows like a weed every day.</li>
            <li> I bought the cleaning system with the Norelco but found it unnecessary due to washing it after every use in the shower</li>
            <li> yet but still has trouble cutting all my facial hail.  </li>
            <li> Very noisy - still not a great shave, especially poor dry shave</li>
            <li> (they tell you this in an enclosed accessories booklet), but I think, for the current $499 Amazon price, a basic charging base could have been included.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of replacing expensive razor blades so often and my Norelco was almost 10 years old</li>
            <li> This is not a very good tool to use for manscaping.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that feature is missing on this model and the 4-blade models other than the LA63-S.</li>
            <li> In this case the charger plug attachment is now a bit dodgy, I have on a few occassions found the razor did not charge because the plug contact was not good.</li>
            <li> I certainly hope that the short time it took for this one to fail is just bad luck and not a sign of poor longevity for this model.  </li>
            <li> And I mean UNBELIEVABLY CLOSE.  </li>
            <li> I have used the previous generations of the cleaning stand, and grew tired of purchasing the detergent/cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever, leaves lot&#x27;s of stubble behind along with razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco SensoTouch 3D  -  Rotary shavers have long had poor reviews in relationship to their non rotary cousins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine how this shaver could be improved.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to &#x27;scrub&#x27; the hard spots.  </li>
            <li> The blade users will find that hard to believe.</li>
            <li> Hard to say</li>
            <li> One review mentioned it was hard to get under the nose but did not find it so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really disappointed as I had extremely high hopes for the shaver.</li>
            <li> For the price of this shaver I would have thought a hard case or at least one made of leather would have been provided.</li>
            <li> The head is also a little awkward to remove in order to empty.</li>
            <li> I fired this bad boy up and immediately noticed that it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d expect at least a charging dock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is common for all electric shavers, tip is to hide the hair with</li>
            <li> This is a disappointing end to an otherwise terrific experience with five-blade razor.  </li>
            <li> included travel case is a joke, cheap nasty vinyl zippered case.</li>
            <li> , so you don&#x27;t have to guess when to plug it in until its too late.</li>
            <li> figuring that it will help my skin and since I use it at least once every day, I&#x27;d treat myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is at least as close of a shave as I used to get with a blade.  </li>
            <li> This top-heaviness makes it feel rather clumsy and unergonomic.</li>
            <li> So unfortunately, this has been unable to displace my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I was expecting at least some since I have not used electric in over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll caveat this review by saying when it comes to shaving I&#x27;m a fanatic and perhaps a bit too compulsive.</li>
            <li> Because I use the shaver in the shower with a shave gel; once a month I soak the LV61 in Tilex Soap Scum Remover (now sold as a diluted Tilex Bathroom Cleaner) for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d expect at least a cleaning brush or a stand for the shaver.</li>
            <li> I had been using Braun 7 series for the last few years, wanted a change, not that Braun is bad.</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers for at least 25 years.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t hate it so much because I can do it whenever I want</li>
            <li> (bloody hell, man - really?)</li>
            <li> My beard is on the thick side</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a head shaver as well using a straight blade is literally a \\&quot;Bloody</li>
            <li> If your whiskers stand up to this razor they&#x27;re in for some serious trouble!!  </li>
            <li> I am 75 years old which equals an awful lot of shaves over those years using a very diverse range of whisker cutting devices....</li>
            <li> Traditional razors get very expensive</li>
            <li> It provides a very, very slick surface over which your shaver can glide.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to shut the shaver off until I plugged in the charger, which automatically shuts down the shaver.</li>
            <li> to a still ridiculous three hundred plus.</li>
            <li> But I did do some research on foil replacements and found that Panasonic foils are less expensive compared to Braun foils</li>
            <li> It has 2 cutters, just like my previous shaver and the bulky head makes it difficult to reach areas on your face with precision.</li>
            <li> red skin, cuts, random uncut hairs here and there and so on.</li>
            <li> My previous cordless electrics had either NiCd or NiMH batteries and had mediocre lifetimes.  </li>
            <li> His hands were to shaky for using a blade.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that one of the battery cells must have gone bad while charging...  </li>
            <li> NOT good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this expensive shaver!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could do a complete shave in around 5 minutes, sometimes I had to use the trimmer to cut these longer type hairs that grow close to my face which was annoying.</li>
            <li> I also used a toothbrush to remove some small hairs that had deposited on the base of the inner blades.  </li>
            <li> So shaving everyday with your typical razor felt like i was scraping the skin off of my face every morning and resulting in painful irritation.</li>
            <li> Two or three day growth is not a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Spending this much money I think you should at least get a stand up charger base!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re inclined to spend over $400 on a shaver, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed in Panasonic&#x27;s entries into personal care.  </li>
            <li> and it is very hard to not cut my head</li>
            <li> It has now been a couple of weeks since they got it, and it has been impossible to find out the status of the replacement by email, even after a couple of tries.</li>
            <li> -fewer passes required, so your skin suffers less, recovers quicker.&lt;br /&gt;-Useable pop-out trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li> With a fairly tough beard it takes a while to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Tough lesson to learn 😞</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my handicapped son who has a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only was it expensive, but for something with 5 blades I had a really bad shave with it.</li>
            <li> I am confused with the five blade in the name.</li>
            <li> it accidently drop and broken into pieces I thought of upgrading to another philips norelco 1150X/46,</li>
            <li> Also,  if the hair is a week or so grown the arc 5 has trouble cutting the hair on my neck and face.</li>
            <li> That of course is in an absolute sense, but given that this razor also costs $200, it really is a terrible value.</li>
            <li> Even worse?</li>
            <li> The 3-blade 8103S is the least expensive at about $78 here at Amazon&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just use the Bamboo Polish twice a week to avoid irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> If I did not receive this through Vine, I could not imagine paying the $500, especially without the cleaner base.  </li>
            <li> Makes it a bit annoying when the battery runs out in the middle of a shave</li>
            <li> At three months, shaving effectiveness decreased drastically.  </li>
            <li> The poor reviews of the cleaning station, the soap based cleaning cartridges are problematic in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic stands behind its products.  </li>
            <li> Replacement blades and foil are a bit expensive but those don&#x27;t need to be change all that often (at least not for me).  </li>
            <li> Till age 37 I was only using disposable razors as all my tries for electric shavers failed miserably:</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> After all you use it every day so why be annoyed with something used that often.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, and I have sensitive skin which is a horribly unfortunate combination.</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> Well, needless to say, after several weeks of being disappointed every day that I shaved with the Braun, I can to my senses, returned the Braun and purchased the Panasonic ES-LV61-A.  </li>
            <li> the hair stubble didn&#x27;t stay within the razor but rather came out as I shaved, making a mess (and making it impossible to shave neatly anywhere but over a sink).</li>
            <li> Arch isn&#x27;t as dramatic  </li>
            <li> That said, even normally, a dry shave-only shaver can be annoying when you messed up your routine and you washed your face before shaving</li>
            <li> Looking at other brands now. :(</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s rather pathetic for a shaver whose sale price is usually no less than $200 cut rate.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> : Expensive, can&#x27;t cut all my hair (need to use sideburn trimmer to cut stubborn areas)</li>
            <li> Sorry, I do not have a clue as to how Braun shavers are - they make foil shavers too.  </li>
            <li> the shaver is quite expensive, but I look at it in this way:&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I failed to see their reasoning in this and nothing happened for almost a month</li>
            <li> but I still am not impressed with the product and wish that I had exchanged it sooner.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I have to say no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I though silly but have come to appreciate.</li>
            <li> Do I still think $240 is too expensive?  </li>
            <li> Is the Panasonic expensive?  </li>
            <li> Once in a while I get nostalgic and use a blade.  </li>
            <li> After shaving, if you rub your face the wrong way, it&#x27;s sandpaper city.</li>
            <li> There is this bundle of random hairs on my neck that it can&#x27;t grab for some reason.</li>
            <li> When the display on the replacement also failed, Panasonic offered me an LV61 as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> also appreciate that it comes alone, without a silly cleaning station.</li>
            <li> Have always been disappointed in the past with electric shavers that I am tried.</li>
            <li> Nick&#x27;s on the face regularly – replacement for oils are $60 each – I have now gone through two and six months which equates to this razor costing me 250 additional dollars a year just to maintain which is outrageous</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s expensive, but</li>
            <li> Difficult to get close shave,  </li>
            <li> Makes a difference from Philips and Braun which recommend using their expensive cleaning modules and cleaning liquid.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to come from a Norelco, which I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> The charging cord has a bit of a base that is a few inches.</li>
            <li> How wrong I was.</li>
            <li> you are merely wiping your face with a cloth.  </li>
            <li> So I am stuck with a inferior and expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> Sadly, there were no visible improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> unlike Arc5, that randomly leaves some of the beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They said, I NEED to pay for shipping and it&#x27;s also written in manual and they are sorry.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m sorry too</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t buy anything from Panasonic again and warn others about laughable shipping policy.</li>
            <li> The replacement screen and blades are expensive however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too expensive, like $70.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but look for discounts and think of making up the cost in blades,gel and avoided nicks.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much wrong with it until the battery started to die and it&#x27;s not user serviceable.  </li>
            <li> Along with that problem I have by nature a very tough beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, I must clarify that I have a very tough and fast-growing beard.</li>
            <li> This is a very poor and expensive shave.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!, very bad around the neck, very bad in the mustage, is just working in the sides.</li>
            <li> The razor recharges with an AC adapter connected to its base; for the price, I was expecting at least a pedestal/stand of some sort.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s something to be expected, this shaver has an awful Achilles&#x27;s heels, and</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed with the shave as it is not that close or even worse than the one I had.</li>
            <li> This would easily go down as the worst purchase I have ever made at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> unfortunatley, it comes with two cutting blades, and four foils.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for about eight months now, and I am sad to report that I am disappointed I purchased it.</li>
            <li> boy was i wrong!</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong!</li>
            <li> Got it for an insane price of $149.99 usually $399.99  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in failure of the unit within 2 1/2 months of purchase.  </li>
            <li> It does a bad job on longer hairs; the tendency is to pull those hairs as opposed to cutting them (it hurts a lot).</li>
            <li> Also I believe that the replacement blades and head are very expensive.</li>
            <li> So if they have to be replaced once per year, that&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> So if they have to be replaced once per year, that&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> sadly it was a very bad decision</li>
            <li> I have tried some electric razors and been disappointed.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s crazy!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that the shaver does not cut a close as some of the reviews I had read suggested.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with this Panasonic at all.  </li>
            <li> If you are considering this one, (or the self cleaning model), go ahead, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I hate the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I hate the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I thought by using an electric razor I would never have to deal with that crap again.</li>
            <li> One thing that is lacking, however, is some sort of base.</li>
            <li> The Norelco came with a charging base</li>
            <li> Proctor &amp; Gamble bought out Braun, they scrapped the patented cutting block and foil and replaced it with a genereic that&#x27;s awful -  just take a look at the reviews both on and off</li>
            <li> The swivel head is still annoying to me, so I still keep it in locked mode</li>
            <li> Someone even after 3 years of being with rotary shavers, I still get a bit fearful as I take my rotary shaver around the neck, but not with this Panasonic foil shavers  Hygiene &amp; Safety  :  </li>
            <li> The drawbacks I see are: crummy storage pouch (on something so expensive!!!), and price!</li>
            <li> For me this shaver is terrible</li>
            <li> and it was terrible.  </li>
            <li> The nasty 5:00 shadow that I used to get doesn&#x27;t show up since I&#x27;ve been shaving with this.  </li>
            <li> My experience was this razor was terrible for head shaving.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i had in my mind to buy a eletric shaver for a long time and for a very good reasons but my delicate skin didn&#x27;t agree with me . At the end we find the shaver perfect for my sensitive skin , no hard work , not very noisy and very light .&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet-dry shavers ever since they first came out in the early 1970&#x27;s.  I shave wet using shaving cream which the people at Panasonic said provides the best shave.  The shavers have constantly improved over the years in terms of battery life and closer, comfortable shaves.  For the past few years I have been using model 8243 which has great.  I only bought the LV61 because the price had dropped from around $400 to a little under $200.  Well, I really love this shaver.  It gives me a slightly closer shave that the 8243 and is very comfortable to use.  I highly recommend this shaver for a superior shave.</li>
            <li> Best Electric Razor on the Market</li>
            <li> The shave is worth 5 stars, but the price compared to the Arc4 shavers led me to give it a 4 star rating. I bought it because my old shaver was due for replacement blades and just doesn&#x27;t have the battery life it used to. Plus, a couple reviewers said it was worth the upgrade. Maybe, if you have to have the latest and greatest, but it seems to give the same results as my ES8243A did when it had new blades, and it&#x27;s about twice the price. I&#x27;m keeping it, because I&#x27;m one of those who has to have the latest and greatest, but I really think the Arc4 shavers are a better value.</li>
            <li> Works very well, better than the Braun 760 I had, whose flip-up trimmer broke almost from the start.&lt;br /&gt;The color&#x27;s beautiful -- I was thinking of getting the black one just for the cleaning system, as the Braun had, but I don&#x27;t really miss the cleaner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because of its wet/dry capabilities (and spent a pretty penny doing so).  I shave in the shower each morning and, figured at this price point, this would be a well-built shaver that would last for the long-term.  For those thinking of buying for this purpose, understand that the shaver breaks down with consistent exposure to water, where the unit will just stop working - it becomes unresponsive and won&#x27;t turn on.  My first Arc5 died during the warranty period (Panasonic&#x27;s customer service was very good and I received a replacement in a few weeks) and the replacement died shortly after the expiration of the warranty.  I had no complaints about the quality of the shave - it was excellent while it worked.  Just beware that when it says wet/dry, it does not stand up to daily use in the shower over time.  I have turned to the Arc4 which offers a similar (if slightly lower) quality shave at a much lower price point and have accepted that I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new shaver every few years.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric  razor  I  have  ever owned.  I have  never  gotten  such  a close  smooth shave with any electric  razor in the past.</li>
            <li> My old electric razor (circular blades), and manual shaver left bumps all over my face and irritated my skin.  This one hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin (I don&#x27;t use shaving cream) yet but still has trouble cutting all my facial hail.  I have never found a product capable of getting all the hair so can&#x27;t really complain.  I wonder though if the extra blades where worth it and if a less expensive version would have yeilded the same results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have no regrets buying this razor since it cuts my hair better than any other product I&#x27;ve owned and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is the main reason I like this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not purchase the cleaning stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to clean, holds charge for long time, charges fast, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Expensive, can&#x27;t cut all my hair (need to use sideburn trimmer to cut stubborn areas)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many electric razors over the years (most recently Braun&#x27;s), and this razor is BY FAR the best.  I was blown away by how fabulous this razor is.  Well worth the investment.  Simply put, it&#x27;s the smoothest, most comfortable razor you could hope for.  It provides a close shave and holds a charge much longer then my previous razors.  I was a bit leery about spending that much on a razor, but seeing it&#x27;s something I use every day, I feel it is well worth the money.  I did read reviews (like this one), and found it received a high number of reviews like mine, so went ahead and bought it, and am glad I did.  HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Use it when i do not have enough time to use a real double blade safety razor.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic linear shaver and it is by far the best. With a fairly tough beard it takes a while to get a close shave. Years ago, using a Braun, it would take me around 15 minutes. For me the Panasonic shavers were a big step forward and with the one I had last (ES-LA63) I had it down to 7 minutes. With this one I&#x27;m finished in 4 Minutes, and because it takes less time I&#x27;m getting 10 shaves between charges.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Arc 4 is much better.  Find the Arc 5 is much to big and does not give as close shave as the Arc 4.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve used Braun dry shavers for many years and was pretty satisfied. This Panasonic is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver with shaving cream, and I&#x27;m amazed at the improvement. The shave is quick and easy, and the result is even smoother than after a blade shave. It&#x27;s hard to imagine how this shaver could be improved.</li>
            <li> I have always been happy with my rotary shavers thay gave me a good close shave and have always lasted 5 or more years with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try a foil shaver and went with this one here. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Very clean shave and a great deal faster than my $200 rotary electric shaver. You can feel the quality. The thing just hums. Lol. Made in Japan..... not china</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband, and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Well first of all I have to admit that I ordered this nice, nice razor for my husband.  Don&#x27;t tell him but I have been using it quite a bit on my legs.  It trims so well and leaves my legs so smooth.  My only complaint is the price.  I think this razor is a little pricey.  After all, its only a razor.  I accidentally dropped in on the tile floor in the bathroom and the top and cover came off.  I thought to myself, Oh I have ruined it since the cover is made of plastic.  However all was fine.  The razor operates wire free and is a little top heavy in my opinion.  It is not heavy, and that could be an issue for me.  I have severe arthritis in my hands and some things are just too heavy for me.  This is not.  It just seems balanced a little to the top end if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;I think the price however should be at least half off of what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many shavers over the years, a majority of them by Remington, most recently Braun.  This Panasonic may be as close to a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shaver as I&#x27;ve gotten.  Acquired through the Vine program , I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d ever spend on a shaver what this shaver is priced at.  The Vine program gave me the opportunity to try a product at the high, high end of pricing, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The head pivots, the on/off button, which could be triggered as one shaves, has a little lever to keep it from being shut off should one&#x27;s holding of the shaver bring fingers to that area.  A neat feature.  The shaver cuts well, shaves, oh, so comfortably, cleans easily, and can be used wet or dry.  I don&#x27;t tend to shave in the shower, so dry shaving, preceded by a shaver powder stick, is my procedure.  If you&#x27;re inclined to spend over $400 on a shaver, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed in Panasonic&#x27;s entries into personal care.  It&#x27;s just rather amazing...oh, and rechargeable!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor and Feather razor blades for several years, and with a Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor (Series 8000) when I&#x27;m too lazy to lather up for a blade shave.  I decided to try the Panasonic Arc5 electric shaver because I wanted the best of both worlds - the closeness of a safety razor with the ease of and electric shaver.  I used my new Panasonic shaver with Cremo Shave Cream and I am very pleased with the results, the Panasonic will shave as close as a blade shave and as fast as an electric shaver.  Problem areas like my chin get butchered when shaving with a blade and with my Norelco shaver I could never get close a close shave on my chin, but with the Panasonic shaver I get the closest shave ever without a nick or any irritations.  I highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a fast and very close shave!</li>
            <li> I have been an electric shaver user for many years. I have primarily used Norelco (Philips) and Braun products, but recently was able to use one of the Panasonic shavers (the ES-LA63-S). This was a predecessor to the model being reviewed and a 4-blade system. The LA63 - without a doubt - provided the best shave I had ever had. It was fast, shaved close, and pain-free. It was also easy to maintain with the easy cleaning method using hand soap and hot water from your faucet.  This current shaver updates the prior one in a few ways (five blades, smaller size, better lock mechanism, and improved clipper). The best thing about the new 5-blade Panasonic is that it indeed provides a better shave than my prior Panasonic!!! Not sure how they keep improving this product but very happy with it. The drawbacks I see are: crummy storage pouch (on something so expensive!!!), and price! Really, I would forgo the more expensive version of this and save the plastic, electricity, and chemicals used in the cleaning/charging base and go for the simpler model. The price will come down - it already has from nearly five hundred dollars (yes!) to a still ridiculous three hundred plus. If you can afford it, do not hesitate!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-LV61-A Wet/Dry Shaver provides an incredibly close and comfortable shave. It&#x27;s a step up from my old Panasonic [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU ES-LA63-S]] 4-Blade Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver, which I&#x27;ve been using for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Panasonic ES-LV61-A model has one major improvement over the older models. It has 5 nanotech blades instead of 4. The 5 blades consist of a cutter block, 2 foils above the cutter block, and 2 foils below the cutter block (the old model has only 1 foil above the cutter block). I really like the new design because it helps to get more stubble on the \\&quot;up\\&quot; stroke than my 4-blade Panasonic ES-LA63-S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- Close and Comfortable Shave&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic shaves as close as traditional shaving blades. In fact, this shaver definitely provides a more comfortable shave than traditional blades - wet or dry. There&#x27;s no need for shaving foam, although you can use it if you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wet/Dry Convenience&lt;br /&gt;I usually opt for dry shaving simply because it&#x27;s more convenient, but I occasionally choose to have a wet shave for the increased comfort a wet shave provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy To Clean&lt;br /&gt;You can easily clean the shaver by rinsing it under tap water while it is running. There&#x27;s no need to crack it open to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pop-Up Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer does as good a job as a dedicated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good Ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is comfortable to hold. The back of the shaver is rubberized to help improve your grip on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- No Charging Dock / Cleaning Station&lt;br /&gt;This model doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning station like the [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K]] does. For the price, I&#x27;d expect at least a charging dock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lack of a charging dock, I like the Panasonic ES-LV61-A Shaver for the incredibly close shave it provides and for the ease with which it can be cleaned.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver, shaves close, quickly, no cuts or burns. Awesome shaver, better than Norelco, better than Braun.</li>
            <li> I have from the beginning of my shaving life used Norelco shavers. We are talking many decades.  I have owned many and when the last one broke I ran out during the holiday&#x27;s to only find the low end shaver on the shelf.  It didn&#x27;t even have a battery level indicator.  I thought Norelco is in trouble if that is how they differentiate the high end from the low end. I suffered for many years with a bad shave.  I know this is slightly unfair to Norelco because it was the low end version but it still should provide a good shaving experience.  I decided enough is enough and after some research settled on the Panasonic.  All I can say is wow!!!  The Panasonic still has issues with the problem areas on the face I experienced with the Norelco. However after a short amount of time the Panasonic does the job.  I don&#x27;t think even with the best of Norelco&#x27;s I have owned did they cut as smooth as the Panasonic.  With the Noreclo I felt like I needed another shave in the afternoon.  With the Panasonic it almost feels like I just shaved at the end of the day. My biggest learning experience is not to use a circular motion when shaving.  The result is a very smooth shave with almost no stubble.  Being a very long time electric shaver user I dismissed the note that says, please take a month to get use to the Panasonic.  It won&#x27;t take a month but with such a close shave it does feel like a razor blade rather than an electric.  Long time rotary users will be surprised how your face will not be prepared for this shaver.  I am confused with the five blade in the name. It probably should be called the five foil with two blades.  Except for using this to extract more money from us I would fear what my skin would look like if there actually were five blades in the razor. I agree with the one criticism regarding the missing stand.  Reading those comments from others made me laugh before I received the razor.  Now that I own it I now have the same complaint.  It is an attractive razor and on astand would look amazing.  Lastly I would say now cost is not a reason not to buy the product.  I paid $260 but I can see the price has already jumped up to $302.  It still is a good buy from the original $500 price.  2015 - As they say razors are not as close as safety razors. Still, it was good enough for me.  Recently the shave has worsened.  It was not cutting anywhere near what I expected.  I purchased a new set of blades for the razor expecting similar decent results.  Nothing appeared to improve.  I decided to try a safety razor.  I purchased a Feather AS-D2 and learned to love shaving again.  Expecting much longer shaving time I didn&#x27;t want to go to a safety razor.  Based on the work the electric razor was putting me through I decided to switch.  Having spent my whole life with an electric razor it is hard to tell people to go retro.  Based on your beard this razor may still be a great buy.  For me it turned out not to be the case.</li>
            <li> Not that great doesn&#x27;t shave that well have to go over an over the same spot my triple head was better</li>
            <li> a brief history, I used philips (series8) electric shaver for almost 3 years and it was fine , it took time finish saving but it did the job OK.&lt;br /&gt;after it accidently drop and broken into pieces I thought of upgrading to another philips norelco 1150X/46, sadly it was a very bad decision, that didn&#x27;t do the job at all, only with wet shaving results were OK. dry was a disaster shaving that makes you look like a clown with hair remain in areas no matter how many times and directions you change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now after using razor for a long time, I thought about trying a different brand/type. I looked for braun and panasonic, and was about to get braun due to promotion however Amazon kept removing the item from my cart even though I tried the help from chat rep.&lt;br /&gt;finally I thought I will await the blackfriday to check the offers and I got a good one on this 170$ including international shipping. this time I went ahead knowing that this was the top of the line in panasonic and that both braun and panasonic are fine products.&lt;br /&gt;I got it for same price of top Arc4 with cleaning station, but thought 5 cutters are better plus the better balance.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need the cleaning station as I read the reviews on it break in a few months, and the cartridges are not easily obtained in here. I liked the idea that you clean it with soap with special cleaning program. that will save money and time on cleaining and keep it in good shape for future.&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed at all, this beast took me less than 2 minutes to dry shave 2 days beard, and it did it very close much closer than I got from any of the above. I can easily compare it to a fresh good razor.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it wet and it was so good and so fast.&lt;br /&gt;to summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the good:&lt;br /&gt;super fast&lt;br /&gt;very very very close shaving&lt;br /&gt;very good&lt;br /&gt;cleaning is easy and cost saving&lt;br /&gt;the travel lock&lt;br /&gt;the flexibility and fixing of the shaving head&lt;br /&gt;how well it balanced in hand&lt;br /&gt;very closeshaving&lt;br /&gt;did I mention how close this shaver is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bad:&lt;br /&gt;not much but I will list some:&lt;br /&gt;not best for shaping your beard (goatee or what ever your pref.) but this is common for all electric shavers, tip is to hide the hair with your other-hand fingers.&lt;br /&gt;the normal price is quite hiked up.&lt;br /&gt;the battery would last for about 15-20 shaves estimation only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for speed&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars for shaping your beard&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for hiked price&lt;br /&gt;1000 stars compared to norelco which is a rubbish that costed me 110$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;again I loved this machine and compared to the norelco I bought that one is rubbish, I cant imagine any shaver that will beat this in speed and closeness.&lt;br /&gt;if you are in market for an electric shaver then get this one, look for coupons or deals if you can</li>
            <li> I am active duty military and must shave everyday. Traditional razors get very expensive so I decided to give this electric a try. I&#x27;m very pleased to say that I made the right choice with this one. I get a very close shave on my face. It takes a couple passes to get the hair on my neck but from what I hear that&#x27;s to be expected from electric shavers. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone tired of spending more and more money on traditional razors.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor money can buy, Period!  I have used other manufacturers best electrics in the past but have always been disappointed ending up going back to blades.  I am 49 and have a pretty tough beard. Using the ES-LV61-A in combo with williams lectric shave, i have been amazed with the results.  I have not tried a wet shave yet but, i will hazard a guess and say it will probably be the best shave i have ever had.  This thing is expensive for sure but you do get what you pay for.  It is smaller than i thought it would be and that is a good thing.  very well designed, solid and fits great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: i also wanted to add that the ES-LV81-K (with cleaning system) is the exact same razor its just a different color and has the cleaning system. i saw no need for the added cost, time and hassle to have the cleaning system. with the ES-LV61-A &#x27;s \\&quot;Sonic vibration cleaning system\\&quot; and a small drop of liquid hand soap this thing comes squeeky clean in about 30 seconds of total time after your shave. when done with the soap cleaning process, just pop the foil off, rinse the foil and head, blow out any excess water and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Update: Price of replacement foil and blade is more than 50% of what the razor cost to buy (comparing sale prices of both razor and foil/blade).  I&#x27;ve had this problem before where the razor is showing its age in other areas and replacing the simplest parts is too much to invest when you aren&#x27;t sure how long you will keep using the razor itself.  In this case the charger plug attachment is now a bit dodgy, I have on a few occassions found the razor did not charge because the plug contact was not good. All problems have been while travelling where razor is not in the exact position I keep it at home.  As with most razors the beard trimmer has dulled.  Lastly it seems a bit more water drains from the body of the razor after shaving in the shower than when new (may be related to plug issues). This is a disappointing end to an otherwise terrific experience with five-blade razor.  I will probably go back to simpler razors that can be bought for what this razors replacement foil and blade cost.  Original post: I&#x27;ve used electric shavers since I began to shave.  My skin is soft and sensitive, my beard tough - using a blade takes forever with a lot of nicks, so I stick to electric.  Last +/- 10 years, Panasonics.  Every generation has improved, but this razor has crossed a threshold.  I can shave 2 or 3 days growth without a hair pulled, have far less neck irritation, and can almost say I enjoy shaving!  I think it is also saving me a minute or two every morning, it is by far the fastest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Also the quietest and smoothest yet.  No drawbacks either.  Really amazing product. Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li> I think shavers have passed their logical limit in number of blades. A wide array of five blades makes it challenging to smoothly shave under the nose or under the ear at the jaw line. That said, this is a great travel shaver because it&#x27;s light, comes with a carrying case and gives you a lot of shaves on one quick charge. Plus, you can clean it with liquid soap and water and also shave with water and shaving cream if you prefer. My Braun Complete 360 shaver isn&#x27;t good for travel because of the elaborate cleaning system. The Braun gives a closer shave than this Panasonic, so I&#x27;ll keep my Braun for home use and use the Panasonic for travel. It gives a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers  ----------------  If you buying an electric shaver for the first time, skip this section and read the next  Electric shavers basically come in 2 types - Rotary (philips norelco) &amp; foil (braun &amp; panasonic)  Rotaries are good for cutting longer hairs let us say you skip to shave over a holiday then start shaving on Monday morning. Foil shavers are faster and easier to adapt to, since they are very much like your gilette razors, but there are a few downsides - foils are difficult to clean since the hair gets trapped in the inner chamber and foil shavers give you more burn compared to rotary blades.   This is a foil shaver  About Panasonic 5-Blade Shaving System  ---------------------------------------  Shave Quality  :  Rotary shavers have never been able to offer me the kind of close shave that I have been able to get through this particular foil shaver.  I have tried cheaper foil shavers before, but almost always it has left me with razor burns.  East of use  : The flexible heads make it very easy to shave around the neck.  If you are graduating from a Gilette to this one - you will find that this is much easier to adapt to than a rotary shaver.  Someone even after 3 years of being with rotary shavers, I still get a bit fearful as I take my rotary shaver around the neck, but not with this Panasonic foil shavers  Hygiene &amp; Safety  :  Why is hygene all the more important in an electric shaver ?  You see the blades are so much close to your skin and obviously they do scrape off live matter into an enclosed chamber along with the hair.  Now, if you these blades were not to be hypoallergic, they would encourage growth of these live matter along with bacteria.  But the Panasonic 5 blade shaver comes with hypoallergic blades which ward off growth of such bacteria and keep it clean, of course you have to do your due diligence of rinsing the blades in hot water and cleaning it.  Self Cleaning   Comes with a Sonic vibrate cleaner which create a pulsating action when you hold it under water - it will clean the micro follicles in the shaver.  Other Good features  : Not too worried about the other features such as battery life - it is not a mobile phone to be held in hand for hours together - almost ALL the shavers in the market today offer a charge to last for a couple of days, which is good enough.    -- Another important thing is to dual voltage operability if you travel to Asia/Europe and this shaver can work with dual voltages  -- 14000 rpm : the faster the foil vibrates, the more efficient it is in giving a clean shave on the very first run and this is currently the fastest in the market  Comparison to Braun  : Sorry, I do not have a clue as to how Braun shavers are - they make foil shavers too.  Remington and Philips make rotary shavers.   But I did do some research on foil replacements and found that Panasonic foils are less expensive compared to Braun foils - obviously Panasonic shavers will cost a lot less to maintain over the years  Value for Money  : An investment in a good electric shaver really pays over time - no price is small to wake up each day in the morning, get a clean shave in a minute or two and walk out confidently.  Not with a $20 shaver or even the most expensive rotary shaver will you get this kind of a feeling - I can tell you from my own personal experience.  I did not realize this until I started using the a quality foil shaver like this.  If you think of the fact that you spend about $5 for a razor every 2-4 weeks - which adds up to $100 per year - this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely THRILLED with my new ARC 5 shaver! I have the next model down and comparing it to that I have to say that Panasonic has really improved the concept of this line of shaver. Mine is used to shave my legs and it is the smoothest shave ever. The battery charge lasts a long time and when it does need a charge it only takes about an hour. It also has a feature where you can charge it for 10 minutes and then get in a full shave. I haven&#x27;t used this feature yet, but if you sometimes forget to charge an appliance like I do, and then are in a hurry this is a great idea! This is very easy to clean by just holding it under running water while running for about 30 seconds. I didn&#x27;t like that they advertise a picture of a \\&quot;blue\\&quot; razor and then send the black one. They need to show a picture of a black one for the black line and then the blue for the blue line. Otherwise that was my only complaint with this.</li>
            <li> good~!! Really works well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver. I researched a long time but never found a comparison between this and the three-headed units that I used for years.  I think that this Panasonic shaves much closer than what I was used to.  It visual charging indicator and readouts are very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY happy with this shaver!</li>
            <li> It has always been my experience that shavers, no matter how good, can never quite give you the same shave as a razor. Many have come close and are more than sufficient for my daily shaving needs. But, typically, if I have an appointment or engagement that requires me to look my best, I will go with the razor.  However, the Panasonic Men&#x27;s 5-Blade Shaving System comes as close to a razor as one can reasonably expect.  On the plus side:  It charges quickly. It typically takes no more than an hour to go from &#x27;empty&#x27; to a full charge.  It is easy to clean. For daily cleaning, simply lift the top and blow.  For a thorough cleaning the directions suggest wetting the blade, applying some soap, and turning on the shaver until the soap does its job.  It works very well and does not take long.  The sideburn trimmer is easy to turn on and works well around the sideburns and othe hard to shave areas.  The shave itself is very good.  It works well around the chin, and around the nooks and crannies and corners of my face.  It works well wet and dry.  Typically, when I use a shaver in the morning I find the need to touch up later in the day or early evening.  However, with the Panasonic I notice that my 5-o&#x27;clock shadow is not nearly as visible as with some other shavers.  That&#x27;s a sure sign for me that a shave is doing a good gob. It is well designed and handles well when I&#x27;m shaving.  The digital displays provides you with an accurate reading of how much of a charge remains.  On the negative side:  The only negative is a pretty subjective one: the price.  This model currently shows a price that is a bit higher than others I have used.  It does give a better shave than most other models but the potential buyer will obviously need to factor price against the benefit of a very close shave.  All in all, I have no problems noting that this is a darn good shaver that gives a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has done a good job of improving their men&#x27;s shavers over the years.  I went from an 8109, to a ES-LA63, and now the ES-LV61.  I have a pretty tough beard and I&#x27;ve needed to use a razor to touch up where my electric shavers had difficulty.  Even when I shave with a blade I sometimes go over areas more than once.  I&#x27;ve always had issues with an electric where my neck meets the jawbone below my ears.  The LV61 is the first electric shaver that I can honestly say shaves difficult areas as good as a blade.  When I took it out of the box, it looked so similar to the LA63 that I thought it was merely a different color with no performance enhancements.  After using it, there is no comparison between the two.  The LV61 gives a much closer shave with no irritation whatsoever and much fewer strokes.  I&#x27;ve only used it as a wet shaver in the shower with cream so I can&#x27;t say how it works as a dry shaver.  For those of you that have been using various brands of dry shavers, you will not go back once you switch to a wet shaver.  As others mentioned, the only negative is the price although it has dropped quite a bit from it&#x27;s lofty launch price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a shaver junkie who daily shaves my face and entire scalp (I&#x27;m bald by choice, you understand).  I am also the proud owner of the Panasonic Arc 4, the top Norelco and Braun models, but the Arc 5 is the best so far. Fast, easy to clean under the faucet, gives a close, comfortable shave and rivals a blade razor when used wet with a shaving gel which is my preferred way to shave and I never cut myself getting the close shave. The Braun cannot be used or cleaned with water. It needs to be charged in its bulky cleaning station that uses pricey alcohol cleaning cartridges. The Norelco can be used wet, but has very small hair chambers and can be quite difficult to clean. The Panasonic Arc 4 was my favorite before getting the Arc 5 as my birthday gift to me. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li> A close shave. First shaver ever that has cut the hairs on my neck. Hold&#x27;s its charge for a long time. Very happy.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver and I am very impressed with it.  Gives a good close shave and is easy to clean</li>
            <li> good! so nice and safety</li>
            <li> reviews on amazon claimed that this was a five blade shaver. unfortunatley, it comes with two cutting blades, and four foils. the cutting blades aren&#x27;t powerful or precise, so the the four foils are just useless. do not buy. there are better products for your money.</li>
            <li> still doesn&#x27;t cut neck hair.</li>
            <li> I had been a Braun user for many years and really liked their razors (better than Remmington or Norelco). I decided to try this Panasonic razor when it was necessary to replace my Braun 7-series. I chose it based on the high ratings it received here, at Consumer Reports, and at Hammacher Schlemmer. I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a month now, and I love it! If it continues to work like this for a long time, then I will stay with Panasonic. I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: very close shave and fast, nice trimmer that works well, it holds a charge well, overall easy to use, cleans easily with soap and water (it doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning base and doesn&#x27;t use cleaning solutions like my Braun did), and it has a nice carrying case. Cons: the only thing that I might mention is that with its large razor head, it was somewhat awkward to use at first. However, I like actually like that now.</li>
            <li> If your whiskers stand up to this razor they&#x27;re in for some serious trouble!!  No kidding... I get the quickest shave I believe I&#x27;ve ever had with this razor. It just mows &#x27;em down. Of course I&#x27;v never shaved with five blades at once before.  I really like the digital readout.  I like knowing how many more shaves I have before it&#x27;s recharge time.  I do have a mustache and it is a bit awkward shaving around it as the head is a bit large but I&#x27;m getting the hang of that too.</li>
            <li> razors are a thing of the past... saves alot of time, no irritation, don&#x27;t need any after shave cream, wish I saw this earlier</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaver.  This is the second Panasonic I own and love them.  This one is a better model than the other one I had (which I passed along to one of my sons).  The pivoting head and five blades make a great difference.</li>
            <li> This 5-blade Panasonic LV61 shaver is like the Rolls-Royce of shavers, it&#x27;s definitely pricey, but what a fine fine cutting instrument.    How does it compare to a Braun Pulsonic (model 9595/790cc)?  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  I had a Braun Pulsonic many, many years ago when they first came out and indeed that is a great shaver with a really long battery life.  It had this \\&quot;sterilizing\\&quot; charger, but you had to routinely buy the alcohol-based cleaning-solution packs.  The trimmer had a long reach and the ergonomics were spot on.  The travel case was a chintsy, opaque plastic hard-case with a cleaning comb.    I always thought the \\&quot;sterilizing\\&quot; charger was a bit overrated --- you don&#x27;t need it, if you&#x27;re only recharging it once every 2-3 weeks anyways, what good does sterilizing it that one time really offer?  Frankly though, I&#x27;ve used electric razors some 25 years, well before these \\&quot;sterilizing\\&quot; gizmos came out...    How does it compare to the 4-blade Panasonic LA63?  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  The 4-blade LA63 feels slightly heavier and top-heavy.  Though mine still works great, it feels cheaper in quality from grip to aesthetics.  The button to turn on the shaver is \\&quot;chrome-plastic-coated\\&quot; and has worn off to reveal some white-plastic.  The trimmer is fairly short and does not give you the reach the Braun does.  If you&#x27;re holding a mirror and trying to get the fuzz on the back of your neck, it&#x27;s pretty difficult; much easier with my old Braun.    [Update 10-8-11: I went and did the &#x27;balance it on your finger trick\\&quot; and the LA63 will not balance even with my finger near the very end, it is very top-heavy.  I did the same thing with the LV61 and it will balance on my finger near the midpoint of the shaver, meaning it is very balanced and that explains why it just feels better in your hand.]    No fancy \\&quot;sterilizing\\&quot; system, just an AC charger.  The case is actually a nice black leather soft-case with a plastic cap for the shaver head.  I will state that the 4-blade LA63 shaves closer than the Braun.    What&#x27;s improved with the 5-blade LV61 over the 4-blade LA63?  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  The 5-blade Panasonic LV61 is a little lighter and better balanced [see Update note above].  The quality is leagues ahead of the LA63.  It simply feels more elegant, solid and less plastic-y.  The button to turn on the shaver feels like real metal.  One nice improvement is that there&#x27;s a \\&quot;lock-ring\\&quot; for the power button such that it prevents the shaver from accidentally turning on if you shove it in your suitcase. [Update: the 4-blade LA63 does have a sliding \\&quot;lock-button\\&quot; to keep it from accidentally turning on when shoved in a suitcase]    The trimmer is identical and visual LED indicators are the same. The leather travel soft-case and protective cap, etc is also the same.  The AC charger has a different part number and I haven&#x27;t dared try to see if the older one would work, not at these prices!    Another improvement is the 5-minute fast-charge.  One complaint about the Panasonics over the Braun is that the Braun can be plugged into the AC charger and can be used at the same time.  Both Panasonics will not turn on while plugged-in.  This is really only a concern for \\&quot;always late\\&quot; people like myself when you are late for work, go to use the electric shaver and it is out of battery.  With my Braun, I could just plug in and use it.  The 4-blade LA63 would barely have enough power after 5-minutes (from empty) to truly give me a work-presentable shave....time to get out the disposable razor.    [Small Update 10-8-2011: When you charge the 4-blade LA63 overnight, when it is done, it will brightly glow and blink \\&quot;100%\\&quot; forever until you unplug it.  This is only annoying if you are a light sleeper and the blinking LED indicator in a dark room will bother you all night.  When you charge the 5-blade LV61, it will glow a solid blue while it is chargingand at some point when it reaches 100%, it stops glowing and turns its blue LED indicators off.]    The Shave:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  The shave on the 5-blade LV61 is as close as any blade razor without drawing blood!  I did the chin-stubble test and with this 5-blade LV61, you absolutely cannot feel any stubble, it&#x27;s an extremely close shave!  I almost always draw blood when using a razor and my skin always feels raw.  Perhaps my skin is simply used to electric shavers, but I get close shaves that last beyond 5pm, with no mess of shaving cream and no nicks from razors and my skin always feels smooth.    Is it closer than my 4-blade LA63?  Trying to remember my chin-stubble test for when my LA63 was brand-new, I think both are very close and still better than the Braun.  The 5-blade LV61 if anything provides a faster shave (than the Braun).  The instructions state the outer foil blades will last 2 years and the main inner blades will last 1 year, but I think that&#x27;ll vary based on how scruffy you get.  For my 4-blade LA63, I believe 8 months is about when I replaced the blades.  Note: Currently it seems like replacement blades for the 5-blade LV61 are around $75-$99 or so and not easily found on Amazon (as of this writing) - this may play a small factor in your buying decision.    Overall thoughts:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  The Braun is the Cadillac.  The 4-blade LA63 is the Mercedes.  The 5-blade LV61 is the Rolls Royce.  You can be just as luxurious in the Mercedes and be perfectly content, but when you want fine-attention to detail, slight improvements here and there, elegance, a nice solid feel, you splurge, sometimes twice the price of a Mercedes, so that you can roll around in style - the Rolls-Royce!    [Update: 9-17-12 - While replying to some comments on my review, I decided to read what other people were saying in their reviews.  I noticed a few people mention that it was really only 2-blades, since when you pop the cover off, you only see two blades.  That is a little misleading.  On the shaver are 2 main blades.  Inside of the foil that you pop-off, are the other 3 blades.  If you measure the distance of where those 2 main blades are, they are a little less than half an inch towards the center of the head.  Now if you put the foil back on and use only the very edge of the shaver head (well before you get to the 2 main blades in the center), you will see that it really is a usable blade as it cuts your stubble.  So yes, this is indeed a 5-blade shaver and verified.]    ######## I originally put this as a comment, but pasting it here since it&#x27;s applicable ########3  Replacement Foil and Blades report:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  [Update: 12-13-12 - In October, I purchased the replacement outer foil (Part no: WES9171P) and inner blades (Part no: WES9170P) and paid $38 shipped and $21 shipped respectively (I&#x27;m a Prime member). I can verify those are indeed the correct part numbers. Note: There is also part no: WES9030P which is the outer foil and inner blades in a COMBO package. Well, as of October 2012, the cheapest I could find WES9030P for on Amazon was $70 shipped. Now, I paid $38+$21 shipped, which is $59 total! And yes, in this case, it is cheaper to buy both separately than getting the combo. Also, note that this puts my replacement interval at ~1 year, definitely NOT the 2 year life that Panasonic puts in the owner&#x27;s manual. Judging myself as having a lighter stubble/beard growth pattern than most, you will likely want to replace your blades every 8-12 months for optimal shaving results.]    [Update: 1-30-15 - You might not find the WES9030P COMBO pack anymore, the new part number, which lists THIS ES-LV61 is WES9032P and is $65 for Amazon Prime as of today&#x27;s date.  So yes, as of 1-30-15 it is now cheaper to buy the COMBO pack - WES9032P ~$65]</li>
            <li> This is the best razor my fiance has used, however, at the price there is no way we could afford it. If you can afford to invest the money in it, you should, but only if you REALLY need it and no other razor is doing the job right. Because after all, it is just a razor.</li>
            <li> Had two of these in two years. Both developed the same problem- after a year the switch would start sticking- not going on, going on but switching to high-speed cleaning mode by itself, and even coming on by itself!  I dissembled the second one, thinking maybe some water got around the mechanical switch.  I found lots of moisture and mineral deposit INSIDE the handle section!  This is in a shaver that you are supposed to be able to use in the shower or bath!  I hadn&#x27;t done so with this one- just rinsing off under the sink.  The problem turned out to be the small electronic switch on the circuit board- even  just tilting the circuit board would make it come on! Why bother with a warranty if they will all have the same defect. This product is not as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;  For the year it works, the shave is fantastic- bought it based on recommendations on here- handled my problem shaving areas very well. But for the price I would expect more than a year&#x27;s use out of it.  No excuse for water in the handle section. Looking at other brands now. :(</li>
            <li> Ok to start off I&#x27;m the type of guy who has thick coarse hair and using a razor causes bumps/in-grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I previously had a Braun Series 3-350cc but it got stolen from my car in Amsterdam. I liked the Braun Series 3, it provided a pretty close shave and it&#x27;s side burn trimmer was well made. I could do a complete shave in around 5 minutes, sometimes I had to use the trimmer to cut these longer type hairs that grow close to my face which was annoying. I blamed my face/hair for this problem but things changed now that I have a Panasonic ES-LV61! No longer do I need a trimmer to get those unruly hairs and no longer do I shave for 5 minutes! I do a typical 3 minute complete shave for my coarse facial hair which is saying a lot!&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is I get a closer shave now, it looks as good as a shave straight out of the shower with a razor!&lt;br /&gt;I get so far around a weeks worth of shave or more before I recharge. I could go much longer as I charge at 30% battery left though.&lt;br /&gt;I do dry shaves, haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the shaver is quite expensive, but I look at it in this way:&lt;br /&gt;How many razors and shaving cream do you buy in a year to get that close shave?&lt;br /&gt;How much time do you spend shaving with a razor?&lt;br /&gt;Are you the type who hates to shave with a razor as it causes irritation and bumps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That quite expensive shaver seems much more reasonable once when you find out how much this shaver gives.</li>
            <li> I had an Arc4 shaver for about 5 years and it was time to replace it. Since there wasn&#x27;t much price difference between the Arc4 and the Arc5 I decided to try the Arc5. Plus I like the blue color. I&#x27;m so glad I went with the Arc5. It runs so much quieter than the Arc4. I read a review complaining that it wouldn&#x27;t get those longer neck hairs but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with that at all. It has a neat feature on the front where you can rotate the dial around the power switch that will lock it out so you can travel with it and not worry about accidentally turning it on. Very satisfied overall with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Light, and battery lasts for weeks on a charge.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a companion to my ES8243. Where they are similar is that they both have only two cutting blades. The Arc5 has five heads while the ES8243 has three. The LV61 cuts my beard closer and smoother but the ES8243 has a better sideburn trimmer and thumb handle placement than the LV61. The LV61 is way overpriced. I didn&#x27;t buy it until it went on flash sale for $149.99.</li>
            <li> gooooooooooood!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great shaver! I just returned the Philips Norelco, which started going really slow (with full battery) after less than a week. Not even in the same league. The shave with Panasonic is extremely smooth and close, I love it so far (2 days). I can&#x27;t believe people gave it less stars for &amp;#34;ergonomics&amp;#34; (really people?) or that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;top heavy&amp;#34;...it&#x27;s a SHAVER! You hold it against your face! It&#x27;s not meant to handle for 5 hours a day, it&#x27;s great the way it is. Unless this brakes within the next year, this shaver is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever had, superior to Braun or Philips. You won&#x27;t regret it. BTW, the case is very nice too, seems to be good quality leather.</li>
            <li> Meet all expectations!  All the wonderful reviews are true to their word. This razor performs smoothly around the curves of the face, gives a nice close shave, cleans easily, and holds its charge.  It has cut down the shaving time from 10 minutes down to 2-3 minutes. Amazon shipped promptly, and made my shopping experience very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for a very long time.  I use them in the shower.  This was my first arc-5 after my last few being arc-4.  The feel of this one is noticeably better than my previous.  The way this one shaves is more comfortable and it gets me to a fairly clean shave faster than my previous - about 90 seconds typical.  I think this is due to a combination of a large shaving area and head design that seems somehow better than my previous arc-4 models.  I don&#x27;t really think the difference has much to do with 4 vs. 5 blades, per se - the internal mechanism of the shaver is similar for both units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am acutely aware of the difference in feel and shave quality because recently (after only about 60 days of use) my ES-LV61 died completely and i had to revert to using my old arc-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one had been working perfectly.  I put it on the charger (for only about the 5th full charge cycle).  I could see that it was charging normally, then came back hours later and it was completely dead - no display, no motor.  I can only assume that one of the battery cells must have gone bad while charging...  So, this one is getting warranty replacement.  I certainly hope that the short time it took for this one to fail is just bad luck and not a sign of poor longevity for this model.  Panasonic has decent warranty service, but it is still a hassle and will probably take a month or more.  If only it had died a little sooner (under 30 days), Amazon would have handled it for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Best dry shave with an electric I have had... even better than my ES-LA63 which is my &amp;#34;shower shaver&amp;#34; now that it is 2.5 yrs. old.  The price on the LV61 (about $150 recently) was too good to pass-up.  I think I&#x27;m set for a few years, shaver-wise!  Like just about all Panasonic products I&#x27;ve owned, this one seems to be a high quality item, and works really well.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a year ago, mainly because I liked that you can clean it regularly with some soap and water. A couple of months ago, the shaver started dropping charge as soon as the level reached 60%. It would go 60% to 0% without warning. Pretty inconvenient in the middle of a shave to say the least, especially as it doesn&#x27;t function while plugged into an outlet. I inquired by email to Panasonic support and after a few days got instructions to mail it in for warranty replacement. It has now been a couple of weeks since they got it, and it has been impossible to find out the status of the replacement by email, even after a couple of tries. They said the only way I can get status is by calling (how can that be?) and I already tried calling twice, and gave up each time after 30 minutes on hold. For such a premium priced shaver, I expected better quality and service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I pulled out my old Braun Series 7 shaver for backup while this one is in service. That shaver had its own quality issues, but I am reminded that it actually provides a much closer shave for me than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I regret purchasing this item and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I came across this due to necessity. I had been using a Norelco Arcitec and was pleased with it until it died. I called because it was under warranty and with some talking Norelco sent me a replacement. Here is where the story begins. The second one died and when I called to have it replaced I ran into a wall. They asked for a sales receipt, &amp; serial #. I emailed them a copy of my original receipt from Amazon and my serial #&#x27;s &amp; case #&#x27;s. They replied that I had to send them in a format that they could copy. I failed to see their reasoning in this and nothing happened for almost a month so I needed to look for a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched on Amazon all razors and finally decided on The ES-LV61 and I&#x27;m glad I did. Overall it gives a much closer shave than the Arcitec. I shave in the shower using Nivea shaving cream and it is a smooth as silk shave. I read some concerns about the sound being loud but shaving in the shower negates most of it. Even if I wasn&#x27;t in the shower the sound is only a little louder and surely not obtrusive. I bought the cleaning system with the Norelco but found it unnecessary due to washing it after every use in the shower so I didn&#x27;t purchase Panasonic&#x27;s either and am extremely pleased with the way it stays clean.</li>
            <li> I have the model prior to this one. read all the glowing reviews on it too.  just no way does the panasonic compare to the braun.  I question the legitimacy of the reviews posted here.  the braun mid to upper level units are far superior.  I never use sterilizing stand i just plug directly in to the shaver and clean it with a brush when necessary. for me I will never trust anything but the braun after purchasing two panasonic units.</li>
            <li> Excellent electric razor - love the larger screen area than my previous razor had; it makes for a faster, yet close, shave.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have ever had. Owned Braun, Philips, and even Panasonic 3 blade before. This is the best!  Hope it will last...</li>
            <li> Works great dry, tested wet and it just did not work for me wet. You have to practice using this shaver, you won&#x27;t be good at using it for a few weeks, but once your used to it and know how it works with your face, there is no going back to the blade or other cheaper units. I love this shaver overall, it is a bit spendy but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not a serial reviewer or anything, but I as a sufferer of shaving for most of my life I had to say this is the Grand Father Lord of all electric shavers.  I&#x27;ve been a Braun guy for quite some time but they always seem a bit harsh. No I don&#x27;t use goo or shave wet, so a quick comfortable dry shave is what I need.  Where I used to look forward to the weekend of not shaving, with this unit I may just start shaving every day.  Very comfortable and cuts shaving time in half for me.  Doesn&#x27;t get so hot and I don&#x27;t need to &#x27;scrub&#x27; the hard spots.  For me and my super-tough beard, this is a Godsend.</li>
            <li> 5 blades is actually only 2 blades in a huge body don&#x27;t expect to do any precision work with this razor its too big and I still needed to use a str8 edge and cream to be baby butt smoothe</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of electric shavers - there are some brands that shave closer than a razor! The blade users will find that hard to believe. That is not what one really wants due to the extreme abrasion. The ideal is the same closeness and little skin irritating. Panasonic has reached the level of the blade with protection of one&#x27;s skin thus achieving a close and comfortable shave.   Fantastic shaver! It is the best yet on one&#x27;s neck.   Super quality construction in all areas. I wish Panasonic would bring back the induction chargers.   This model is a clear improvement and a clear step towards the best possible shave!</li>
            <li> My husband has stuck with the 3 rotating head shavers for 20 years.  In finding this, we thought we&#x27;d give it a try.  The main complaint is that the head is too large to effectively reach under the nose.  That was a dealer breaker for my husband.  This one is louder than his Remington.  The shave seems to be ok on the cheek and neck areas.</li>
            <li> Success at last! The Panasonic is light weight, gives a much closer shave than the Braun 799 and a much much more friendly experience than the Norelco 9300 (see their reviews). And, it is easily cleaned by simply running it under water with some liquid soap. As I (and apparently others) have had less than an excellent experience with various electric razor washers, and as the Panasonic with the washer is $100 more (!) I advise getting this one. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he LOVES it!  He says it&#x27;s the best razor he has ever used.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I did not think the ES-LV61-A Arc 5 shaver would be better than the Arc 4, but it is, and noticeably better. This is the first electric I have owned that can actually beat a shaving cream and razor shave. My face comes out baby smooth. Not a hint of any stubble left after this machine does its thing.  I really love this one. Handles much better than the Arc 4 ES-LA-63 and 93 and shaves more quickly. (And I loved the ES LA-63. Also, as I own the cleaning unit version of the Arc 4 (ES LA-93) as well,  I can say with confidence,the Panasonic shavers come cleaner when you simply rinse them with hand soap and do the normal sonic cleaning routine. The cleaning unit will not do better, indeed, it is not as good as manual cleaning..I have owned both Arc 4 shavers for five years and the one that is manual rinse cleaning only (ES&#x3D;LA-63) is nicer inside than the ES-LA-93, although I stopped using the cleaner unit on that one lately, and use it a a charging stand and dryer only.  Same applies on the ES&#x3D;LV-61. Don&#x27;t waste money on the cleaning unit. version. Plus, the metallic blue is much nicer than the black finish of the cleaning unit version</li>
            <li> It is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for more than a month. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Great razor, can shave while doing the house work!  No more mess with the shave cream. Just as good as the razor.</li>
            <li> As someone with a coarse beard and face adapted to electrics, getting a close shave has never been a fun exercise.  This is easily the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last 12 years or so I had tried three different iterations of the braun linear shavers.  Although the earlier models shaved pretty close, they always caused significant irritation and missed some spots on the neck area.  The latest model (pulsonic) didn&#x27;t irritate as much but the shave closeness was terrible.  I had permanent five o-clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one of the newer rotary norelco&#x27;s for awhile, but after a month or two the results weren&#x27;t much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this one I get a quicker and closer shave, especially around the neck area.  I no longer have a 5 clock after 12 o clock.  In fact, even around 5 my stubble is pretty reasonable.  Definitely recommend if you&#x27;ve had little success with other electrics.</li>
            <li> I should have replaced my old brain with a newer Braun.  This shaved is ok, it shaved close.  However I constantly find hairs that I missed especially in the neck area.  The problem seems to be that the shaver head is too big which makes it harder to shave smaller areas. No tried giving it 30 days as suggested but I still am not impressed with the product and wish that I had exchanged it sooner.  Tough lesson to learn 😞</li>
            <li> excellent results and quieter than my last shaver</li>
            <li> my care giver can use it on me. i didn&#x27;t think it would work because&lt;br /&gt;i have  such a heavy beard , but this does it.&lt;br /&gt;thank you  panasonic.</li>
            <li> Does an ok job. Doesn&#x27;t give a close enough shave in the jawline and neck areas. Leaves a slight burning sensation after the shave is completed</li>
            <li> The ES-LV61 provides a great shave wet or dry. Used with shaving cream it provides closeness comparable to a blade razor. Thought I might regret spending the money but well worth the price. Only caveat is you cannot shave with the power cord attached, so the unit must be charged at all times to be used.</li>
            <li> I prefer the es8243. The arc5 razor provided a close shave but also caused more irritation. Also, the head was so big that it was very hard to get a close shave around the neck and jawline. Tried this for several weeks and prefer the arc4 (which is a third of the price when on sale). Not worth the price IMO.</li>
            <li> I owned a panasonic back during the highschool days.  It was given to me as a bday present.  After two years of use, it wanted to fly like r kelly and broke as it flew off a counter.  Replacement parts are expensive so with not much choice, i went back to razor blades.  Since then ive owned a phillips, and a braun razor.  This panasonic is easily the most expensive,  but it does more than the job.  I am confident that after a 2-3 minute shave my face is smooth as can be.  It is a great feeling to know that after 1 or 2 swipes, your face is all gucci to go.  The device is easy to clean,  can be used wet or dry, and has a motor that operates at a faster speed than everything else.  With the head of the device that tilts in every angle possible,  i was at first worried that pushing too hard against my face would cause too much pressure at the joint.  But after a while i was like quit tripping.  ever since i have not been worried at all.  It is a great build.</li>
            <li> In spite of an oversized head that doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any benefit; ineffective in capturing fine, flat hairs resulting in skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable razor, it shaves close, it shaves as good as a blade, it feels good in my hand, it is very fast, and the trimmer works well. But is it really worth $500? Sadly, I have to say no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a luxury product. The shaver itself is well built and designed. The handle is exactly the right size for my hand, it fits perfectly. The on off button is surrounded by a lock switch and it&#x27;s very easy to not put your hand or finger on that button while using the razor (when the on / off switch is pressed for too long, the razor goes into clean mode). The head is massive; it is about the width of two manual razors across and about three manual razors wide. The size is a mixed blessing. On the one hand it covers ground really fast on my face. On the other hand it blocks the trimmer from view and makes it difficult to get into tight places (especially to shave around or trim a beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the luxury ends is the included accessories. The box is hideous. When I spend this kind of money, I absolutely expect to be in awe over the presentation. I should open the box and be amazed by the product. Instead, the razor looks like any other piece of cheap appliance or electronics I&#x27;ve bought. Panasonic should have taken a page from so many other luxury product makers and created a beautiful box worthy of this price. There are $50 razors with better packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included travel case is a joke, cheap nasty vinyl zippered case. At this price point, there should have been a leather case, or neoprene, or fine imitation leather. This is the nastiest vinyl I&#x27;ve ever seen. The AC adapter is decent, it is well built and looks like it will survive long use. I still expect this to be something special, the electrical connector should work better. There is no stand, and no included cleaning supplies. The instructions recommend a cleaning soap that should be in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is excellent. I have tried some electric razors and been disappointed. I am a razor and shaving cream man. This machine shaves as close as a razor and shaving cream. It does the job quickly and feels good on my face. It does not give me razor burn. It delivers a close smooth shave all over my face. It does a bad job on longer hairs; the tendency is to pull those hairs as opposed to cutting them (it hurts a lot). Two or three day growth is not a pleasant experience. Razors do not have this problem; they cut hair no matter the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is another mixed deal. On the one hand it works for places like sideburns and light mustache trimming. It really falls down trimming other hair. The cutters point out perpendicular to the shaver with absolutely no protection, it will cut through skin. Shaving the top of my head was a delicate operation. If the hairs get longer than half an inch, the foil won&#x27;t cut them without pulling. The trimmer has to be used to get these longer hairs and it is very hard to not cut my head, I hesitate to use the trimmer beyond where I can see in the mirror. It does a great job on outer ear hair. This is not a very good tool to use for manscaping. It works fine for the northern parts, but get down to the southern parts and things get a bit more difficult. The trimmer has to be used very carefully and sometimes that big old shaver head goes places you don&#x27;t want. The foil cutters really don&#x27;t work very well on the southern most areas, they have a tendency to cut a bit further than you&#x27;d like (read bleeding). As delicately as I can put it, the trimmer does a good job on really thick hedges and gets things close enough to finish up with a razor, but don&#x27;t try the foil head on the final clear cut on those delicate parts. I would imagine that it works pretty well for women, legs, under arms, and lady parts (at least the northern area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works perfectly in the shower. It is completely waterproof and designed to be used wet or dry. It is very easy to dry off afterwards and theunreachable dries easily sitting on the shelf in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges in about 30 minutes. The display panel on the handle shows how long the razor has been used since last charge and the percent charge left. The battery lasts an eternity. There is no need to pack the charger for a one week trip (well unless you are shaving a lot more than just your face). It&#x27;s probably not a bad idea to use the clear plastic cover for the foil and the travel case when the razor goes into carry on luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value equation, is it really worth $500? When the Braun system is $200 and generally does a good job, the Panasonic seems overpriced. For the level of shave and the waterproof, I would peg this as a $300 razor. Panasonic would have won me over with better packaging, finer accessories, a dedicated website, and some way of making me feel special for buying this expensive device. Instead, it is packaged and represented like any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how long the blades will last. The good news, the Panasonic website sells them and they are in the $15 arena (the foils are much more expensive, $60). So if they have to be replaced once per year, that&#x27;s not too bad. The instructions show a tear down to dispose of the battery. It looks like with a few tools the battery is not hard replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the razor, I hate the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 8, 2015 Update: I&#x27;ve used this razor for over three years now. I still love it. I&#x27;ve tried a few other electric razors and keep coming back to this. I&#x27;ve replaced the blades one time, and should have done it way sooner. About once per year is the right time frame. I&#x27;m guessing in the three years, I probably would have spent close to that much money on disposable blades and shaving cream - so the deal isn&#x27;t that bad.unreachable dries easily sitting on the shelf in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges in about 30 minutes.

            <li> Having recently switched from hot foam to a gel, I was not planning on another switch to cordless electric. However, this one was enough to convince me. When you&#x27;re thinking of plunking down $500 for a shaver, you may think that you&#x27;ll get something that plays music and provides a back massage in addition to an excellent shave. However, this shaver (or Shaving System as Panasonic likes to call it) is simplicity itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging unit does not come with a giant black box that takes up five sockets on a outlet strip, but instead it has a small (wider than normal) plug that takes up a single outlet and weights less than several pounds. A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) provides information about the shaver&#x27;s current state--how long it&#x27;s been on, whether it needs cleaning, what percent of charge is left. The shaver has 3 settings--Free (the head swivels left and right up and down, Lock (no swivel) and trim (a little trimmer pops up) that can be changed single handedly. I lock it while going over the flat sides of my face; for around my jaw, to swivel; and for mustache and side burns, to  trim. It also has a lock on/off button that I though silly but have come to appreciate. When shaving, it&#x27;s easy to place your thumb on the on/off switch and accidentally turn it off. By the simple expedient of locking it on and then locking it off there are no accidental start/stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the biggest plus to this shaver is cleaning it. Press the on/off button for 2 seconds or more and it goes into \\&quot;clean mode\\&quot; and starts cleaning itself. Pour in some liquid hand soap right in the top and it gives itself a bubble bath. Rinse it off, and you&#x27;ve got a clear sharp shaver like new. Because it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver (for those of you who like to shave in the shower), you can drop it in the tub and it just keeps on buzzing until you pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the main point: How does it shave? It&#x27;s very smooth; no pulls, and while I have to run over a patch of bristle more than once, my razor shave with hot foam or gel did not do the job as well. The trimmer lets me handle mustache and sideburn trimming along with shaving. It&#x27;s simple, effective and considerate and worth the long term investment. If you buy something you&#x27;re going to use everyday, why not get the best?ve with hot foam or gel did not do the job as well.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over five years now after I&#x27;ve come to a determination that Gillette and all the other manual razor systems are much more expensive to use.  Until now I&#x27;ve never found an electric shaving system that even came close to comparable shaving quality of the manual razor.&lt;br /&gt; After using the Panasonic Wet/Dry ES-LV61 for over ten days I finally found an electric system that can rival the manual razor.  I use this shaver with a Wet application and find that I don&#x27;t have to constantly redo difficult shaving areas.  This shaver which has five blade systems is an easy go over once system which gets to the root of the beard very quickly.  It is easy to use and shaving with this shaver is quick and leaves you clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt; Another good feature is that it is easy to clean and it holds a charge for almost a full week.  As I said the shave with this is quick and therefore you aren&#x27;t using very much electricity hence the longer charge.&lt;br /&gt; I would strongly recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a quick and easy to use system that in the long run will save you money.  If I could rate this shaver greater than 5 stars I would!</li>
            <li> Really good everyday electric shaver, but even though it picks up most of your stubble, and shaves it baby smooth, there are still areas where it doesn&#x27;t quite get right down to your skin in certain areas, and you have to make several passes. I use it everyday for work purposes, though I&#x27;d probably still go with a manual razor for going out to dinner, or something like that</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how this shaver performed.  I thought  the shave would have been closer.</li>
            <li> This razor did not live up to my expectations. It does cut cleanly and to the skin but does not cut neck hair that well at all. Also,  if the hair is a week or so grown the arc 5 has trouble cutting the hair on my neck and face.</li>
            <li> 5 days using without recharging. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> on a blood thinner, it is important that I do not cut myself shaving. This meets all of my needs, and I would recommend it to anyone that is in a similar condition. It is a little expensive, but to me, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. I was quite sceptical at first since all my life I used good old blades. Seemed expensive at a first glance but so were Gilette Fusion blades and I had to buy a lot of them since they get dull just after a few shavings. With this one I replace blades just once a year. There&#x27;s a short transitional period when you get used to a new way of shaving. But the results are spectacular. Very close shave, smooth skin afterwards. I use it wet, with a foam, because that&#x27;s what I am used to. Have never used it any other way. Very well made. Panasonic is probably the only broad range consumer products company whose products, no matter in which area, I will buy without any hesitation. This shaver just reinforces this opinion. If you are getting tired of the blades and looking for something else, this would be a fine choice.</li>
            <li> I have a lightly colored (with some grey) moderate density beard. I have been using an electric shaver of one sort or another for 45 years. My last 2 were Braun models, and I found that the earlier model worked better than the newer one. I figured that this was the best that an electric could do because Braun gets high marks on reviews. It was never a close shave and I had to go over spots numerous times for some of the hairs to get cut. I even had to use the sideburn trimmer to scrape neck hairs that wouldn&#x27;t get cut normally.&lt;br /&gt;  I found that the Panasonic 5 blade, although expensive, is worth every penny.  It is the closest shave that I have ever gotten, and I get no skin irritation or pulling when the hairs get cut. I shower and wash my face first and then let it dry before shaving as I have always done. I find that the hairs stand up more this way, and are easier to cut. It takes me half the time to shave now, and I have to go over spots again much less often.&lt;br /&gt;  I like the fact that the indicator states the % power left, so you don&#x27;t have to guess when to plug it in until its too late. The head is a little large, but hasn&#x27;t seemed to be a problem at all. It swivels almost imperceptibly.&lt;br /&gt;  I got it as a birthday present (after picking it out myself) figuring that it will help my skin and since I use it at least once every day, I&#x27;d treat myself.&lt;br /&gt;  I also find that my beard is not getting scruffy later in the day, having been cut closer to the root.  I think that the nano sharp blades that move at the faster speed have combined to make this a great product.&lt;br /&gt;  The fact that it is waterproof is great, but I never shave in the shower. The cleaning procedure was easy, and much better than getting the large bulky canisters with the alcohol soak.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a major improvement over the ES-LA93K, which I have used for the past years. My shaves now take half the time and the cut is much closer. There is no real difference between this and a blade for my beard. Overall, it is terrific!!!!</li>
            <li> I had never found an electric razor which worked for me; I have fairly fine facial hair, and cheaper razors simply won&#x27;t cut it.  It took a week to figure out that I should just go with and against the grain, and I&#x27;m able to shave in less than 2 minutes.  When I only went with the grain, it was taking 4-5 minutes and I was disappointed, but this is such a good razor that there is no irritation from going against the grain and it was the speed and quality (it looks like I used a manual razor) of the shave, that lack of irritation, that erased all doubt.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this.  One thing to note is that this model is a little older, and it was when I bought it Dec. 2014, there are newer models for more money.  The most recent models add &amp;#34;microsensing&amp;#34; which speed up and slow down the motor to deal with different hair types; I have mostly fine facial hair except on my chin; this razor without that feature has no problem.  It might provide more comfort to have that feature, but it wasn&#x27;t worth how much more it was, to me.</li>
            <li> Gives much closer shave than the Panasonics I&#x27;ve used for years.  I prefer any Panasonic over any other brand I&#x27;ve tried; but this model gets that hard to smooth stubble on the chin and jaw lines without too much work or pressure.  The closeness stays with me through the day, with much less 5 o&#x27;clock shadow than before.</li>
            <li> My father always says, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. I told him that online now a days vs. buying in a store &amp;#34;brick and mortar&amp;#34; you can buy the most expensive shaver which normally in store would cost a bunch more. Well at the time 1-2 years ago he bought the best and most expensive Braun shaver that could find in the store. I believe he said it was high $200&#x27;s for it and it had the whole cleaning kit, which by the way is a pain in the butt because you keep having to buy the cleaning kits. Well anyways, I bought this for him and he has been using it for about a month or two and he said that it is the cleanest shave he has ever had with a shaver. I used it a couple times just to test it and I agree. After a couple shaves if you go back to anything else you realize what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Just thought I&#x27;d add my thoughts on this shaver as a long time Panasonic user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, by far, the best razor Panasonic has ever made. Lofty words you say? Is it really THAT much better than the four head it one up&#x27;s? Yes, yes it is, by leaps and bounds in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me explain just what this shaver is shaving, every single day of the year. I&#x27;m an Italian man, with a very tough beard that grows like a weed every day. To add to that, I also shave my head because, you know, I&#x27;m old and the hair just ain&#x27;t there anymore ;-) The ES-LV61 mows through this growth effortlessly, and in only five minutes and 20 seconds---5:20 flat!! This is repeated every single day, no problem at all. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older four head model did the same in nearly seven minutes, and I thought that was good! But the real improvement here is that it&#x27;s much quieter doing the same job as the much noisier four head. The battery is also a huge improvement, with the four head getting just over 4 shaves compared to the five blades 7+...again, no contest here. Clean up is just as easy as ever, with a little squirt of hand soap into the blades and a few seconds later your clean as a whistle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides? For one, the five blade head is HUGE, and the body supporting it is also a bit larger than it&#x27;s four bladed counterpart. While shaving my face, this doesn&#x27;t matter as they feel the same, but when shaving my head, it just doesn&#x27;t feel all that stable in my hand due to the way you have to hold onto it. Not a deal breaker, but something that should be mentioned. Just be careful when shaving your head and all is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summing up, the ES-LV61 is a great step forward for Panasonic shavers. It blows the older four head away effortlessly, and with the new lower price point (I paid only $149.00, it used to be $299.00) it&#x27;s a steal. Don&#x27;t sit on the fence with this one, it&#x27;s the best electric, wet dry shaver you can get at any price, just buy it!</li>
            <li> excellent product.This razor definately shaves closer than my previous rotary shaver.I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Have been using Braun for over 30 yrs but was dissatisfied because it leaves the short hairs on the side of the face.  Wanted, needed a closer shave. This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  It&#x27;s 10 times better dry shave than the Braun and the wet shave is the best I have ever had outside of a barber shop.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - nice comfortable hold &amp; quiet in running. Holds its charge brilliantly. Thought it just might shave a little closer, but really all up I am very satisfied with my first Amazon purchase.  Rgds Noel Mcmahon Australia</li>
            <li> First of all, this is NOT a solicited review; just a way to say thank you to Amazon and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several Panasonic shavers from the ES-LT41 to the ES-RT51 to the ES-LV61.  I have never paid more than $75 to $100 for a shaver (just didn&#x27;t think any shaver was worth more) and wasn&#x27;t going to again when the LCD display on my ES-RT51 failed.  I decided to send it into Panasonic for repair.  I was willing to pay for the shipping and repair, but soon found out that the ES-RT51 (purchased from Amazon) was still under the two year warranty. I just needed to provide proof of purchase.  To my surprise, Amazon tracks all of my purchases even back two years.  So I got my proof of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;So I figured Panasonic was just going to repair my shaver at no cost to me.  But instead of a repair job, Panasonic sent me the newer ES-LV61 model.  Nice surprise!&lt;br /&gt;I have always received great shaves from the ES-LT41 and the ES-RT51, but the shaves I am now get from this ES-LV61 are significantly better and take less time.  I get close, comfortable shaves, even in the hard to shave areas of my face.  Do I still think $240 is too expensive?  NO!  You do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for your purchase tracking and thank you Panasonic for your consideration to upgrade my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A life-time Panasonic user - Dale.</li>
            <li> I used an ES8243A for 5+ years before going to the ES-LV61-A.  Both are excellent instruments; the ES8243 is a better value, but the 5-cutter ESLV61 does cut just slightly closer+faster than the ES8243.  Because the &#x27;LV61 cuts closer, you might feel a little more irritation; I do, on the underlip area.  The only things I don&#x27;t like about the &#x27;LV61 are minor: (1) like the ES8243, you can&#x27;t run it while it is plugged in for charging,  (2) the sideburn trimmer is a little smaller than the ES8243,  (3) it is easy for the &#x27;LV61 to get into head LOCK mode; you have to be remember to push the trimmer switch 2 full stops after using the trimmer to put the head back in FREE mode, (4) shaving time before recharge seems to be shorter than the advertised 45 minutes.  I prefer Panasonic shavers to the other brands (Braun, Norelco, Remington) I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I came from using a Braun Series 3. That was a good shaver, and I thought it was the bar set for others. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Braun was good, but if I didn&#x27;t shave for a few days I would have trouble cutting the thick hairs. I had to go slowly and with the grain until I got it cut down enough to go against the grain. Otherwise, the hair would snag and it would cut me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic was way different. By the time it got here, I hadn&#x27;t shaved for three days. I had those thick hairs, and they were getting long. The shaver sliced through them without any trouble or snagging. Like a red hot knife through butter. This thing is just awesome.</li>
            <li> As someone who serves in the military and HAS to have a close shave daily I needed an electric razor that worked as well as a regular shave. This razor exceeded my expectations. It produces a shave just as close as I got with a brand name 5 blade razor in half the time and without any cuts, nicks, or razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a down side my only complaints are that the trimmer is rather flimsy and the battrey life is much shorter then other electric razors, but that isn&#x27;t enough to dampen my love of the Panisonic Arc 5. I will gladly deal with charging the razor more often (for me about every 5 days) and the trimmer still gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor may career a hefty price tag, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57, I have always used a blade, tough beard, and have to spend a lot of time, effort and shave cream to get a smooth shave  I decided to try this shaver- best in class –  This shaver works well except my jaw-line and neck. It does okay but still need a blade to make it really smooth. I like how fast I can get a quick shave – not the smoothest – but good enough for work. I have tried it dry, wet, in the shower, with “Electric shave” gels and liquids, and  dry works the best for me. It is great for travel, battery lasts a few days on the road, and I can clean up the 5 o’clock shadow on the fly. It is easy on my skin, with a dab of lotion my skin looks good – same old face!  Note: I MUST clean it daily, it is quick and easy, but every day.</li>
            <li> Drags. My husband says he should have stayed with his Braun shaver. The Panasonic is not a smooth cut, and it is difficult to reach certain areas.  This was a gift for me, Roxanne&#x27;s husband Doug.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the expense.  This is about my 4th or 5th Panasonic (when it comes time to replace the foil/cutters I usually just buy a new shaver).  Panasonic is so much better than Norelco (razor burn) or Braun.  But I&#x27;m just not feeling like I am getting a $330.00 shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any real difference between this shaver and their previous shavers, other than the 5 cutter heads.  I don&#x27;t see where Panasonic invested the additional money to justify this high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting the best shave ever above my upper lip...no other Panasonic (or blade for that matter) has shaved this close.  But previous Panasonic&#x27;s have shaved better on my neck.  I&#x27;m getting about 10 shaves per charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you would be happy with a cheaper model Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Before using the Panasonic LV61 electric shaver, I never thought that an electric shaver can give a smooth and close shave as a razor. Believe it or not, this shaver does!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ve tried almost every shaver from the Braun 7 series to the old 4 blade panasonic to the philips norelco 3d. If you have hypersensitive skin like I do, I recommend that you shave using the Nivea anti-irritation shaving gel and aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver do not hesitate to buy this one.</li>
            <li> Looks fantastic, runs fantastic, charges quick, 1 hour battery, on-button lock, trimmer, multi-adjustable head, super close shave... There&#x27;s pretty much nothing left not to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only had a little trouble on stubble under my nose and under my chin where my neck meets my head, but this is common to all electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinses in water. I also found that my handheld waterpik flosser also made an EXCELLENT gunk cleaner for this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this and feel like a boss.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because i read the good reviews. And also they said us the best electric shaver in the market. For me this shaver is terrible it irritates my whole face let me bleeding and does not work properly. I prefer the braun 7 insteat of this one</li>
            <li> Been using this shaver for about 6 years and would not use any other.</li>
            <li> Clean, close, smooth shave with little skin irritation. Goes through a 3 day beard like it was nothing, especially under the chin. I have had other elec. razors that didn&#x27;t come close to the speed and quality of the shave from this razor.</li>
            <li> The five cutter foils are awesome! The shave is as close as a blade!  Used the four head Panasonic&#x27;s before, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has used the same brand razor for the last 33 years of our marriage and he just loves how close his shave is now and the convince of a razor that can be used with water or in the shower.</li>
            <li> Best Shaver I have ever used! It shaves very close too. I love having more blades. It charges fast and can last two to three days on a single charge</li>
            <li> Coming from a Braun shaver for the last 10 years, and a norelco before that, I will say this is a great little razor.  Nothing revolutionary in my mind, but it is effective, and most likely the closest electric shave available.  Don&#x27;t let the pictures fool you, it isn&#x27;t that big.  It&#x27;s actually designed to feel and move around like a regular razor, which is different than the competition, which feels more like moving machinery around your face.  It feels dainty compared to my old electrics.  Yes it have 5 blades, but only 2 moving heads, just like the Braun, so not sure how much better than arc3 or arc4 it really is.  When I let my beard grow longer than 3-4 days, I do notice some pulling, but nothing too harsh like I was getting on my old Braun.  I have not tried a wet shave yet, but it does clean up easy under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Hitherto trying the Panasonic ES-LV61, I didn&#x27;t even know manufacturers made $500 electric shavers.  $500 you say, that&#x27;s crazy!  Yes, I thought so too until I used the Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve primarily been a manual shaver man most of my life, bouncing from the early Mach 3s, to Remingtons, and then my trusty Fusion.  My last electric shaver was a $90 Norelco 1150X, which I thought was pricey for a shaver.  I had a bad experience with the Norelco, despite being advertised as being able to dry shave, was never able to do so without irritating my sensitive skin.  Moreover, I found the Norelco had a tendency to shave off large patches of hair, in a particularly uneven manner.  So my faith in electric shavers was shaken until the Panasonic...  EXTERIOR DESIGN:  The first feature you&#x27;ll notice about the Panasonic is the particularly strikingly large head, comprising 5-blades.  It reminds me of the Mach-3/Quattro/Fusion manual razor wars, where each manufacturer would try to up the other in terms of the number of blades.  However on the Panasonic, the 5 blades aren&#x27;t a gimmick, they do wonders.  The blades are encased in a head, which has an easily removable outer casing, which exposes the inner blades for cleaning.  Depress two buttons on each side of the head, and the outer casing pops right off.  The head freely rotates, though somewhat limited in its side-to-side and back and forth motion.  The rotation was more than suitable for my shaving needs.  The head also mounts an integrated trimmer which is easily locked into place by a selector mounted below.  The shaver is a beautiful gun-metal dark blue, and is not a bright tacky light blue like on the Norelco.  The body is finished in a 3/4 slip-resistant &amp; fingerprint resistant material, which is comfortable to hold.  The body is also contoured for a comfortable grip.  There is a chrome circular selector switch that toggles between operating mode and travel lock mode.  Lastly, a display screen with bright blue LED digits showsbattery life, minutes/seconds the shaver was in use (a helpful feature), charge status, etc..  The LED display is very bright, and easy to read, even in a pitch black room.  The razor recharges with an AC adapter connected to its base; for the price, I was expecting at least a pedestal/stand of some sort.  Oh well.  It&#x27;s a solid, good looking razor.    OPERATION:  The Panasonic only needs 1 hour charging time, before full operation.  A quick 5-10 minute charge will get you maybe 1-2 shaves.  The ES-LV61 emits a solid, high pitched whine when in use.  The 14,000 cpm and 5 blades is no joke here.  I was able to dry shave WITHOUT SKIN IRRITATION.  That&#x27;s a first for me, as I have sensitive skin which I usually have to slap with copious amounts of aftershave following each session.  My post dry-shave session was incredible, didn&#x27;t even feel like I had just shaved.  I also tried the Panasonic with a wet-shave, and was able to achieve an amazingly close shave.  Remember the old adage that an electric shaver will never be able to replicate the results of a manual blade or razor?  The Panasonic completely destroys that adage.  I feel as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s posterior.  The Panasonic also allows shaving in the shower.  The trimmer works no differently, and I was able to get a smooth trim on my sideburns.  The LV61 is also very easy to clean.  Add a little dishwashing liquid or liquid soap to the outer blades, hold down the power button to activate the \\&quot;sonic vibration mode\\&quot;, at which point the razor self-cleans.  I also used a toothbrush to remove some small hairs that had deposited on the base of the inner blades.  OVERALL THOUGHTS:  Is the Panasonic expensive?  Yes, but it certainly lives up to its claims and provides an amazing shave.  Cue heavenly music playing from above.  Should I buy this LV61 or the more expensive ($100 more MSRP) LV81 shaving system with integrated charging base/cleaning dock?  I&#x27;d recommend saving yourself $100 and sticking with this LV61, because the integrated sonic vibration mode is more than sufficient to clean the shaver, unless, you&#x27;re really that lazy.  There is one caveat, this LV61 shaver is not interchangeable with the shaver on the LV81 cleaning/docking system; the LV61 is missing three electrodes on the rear of the body which allow charging with the cleaning/docking system.  The biggest downside of the Panasonic is that it requires replacement of the blades every 1-2 years, though I expect those who are less hirsute can observe a more lax replacement system.  These replacement blades don&#x27;t come cheap either, at least $50-70 (which is about standard for electric shavers; IIRC, replacement Norelco blades were about that much too).  If you want a cost-effective system, stick with manual razors.  If you&#x27;re putting down five benjamins for this system, then replacement blade costs probably aren&#x27;t going to deter you from making the purchase.</li>
            <li> I used to use the ES8429S which gave a much closer shave.  I switched to blades for a few years and loved the nice close shave feeling...until my wife figured out I was spending about $50 a month in Blades.  I have pretty sensitive skin so sharp blades are a necessity and can&#x27;t be used more than twice.  I tried the LA93-K and it was terrible.  I ordered this since it had 5 blades....it does  a better job than the LA93, but still not spectacular.  Takes  about 6- 8 min to shave, then I still need to hit several parts with a razor blade to get things right.  With blades I could go 36-48 hours without shaving again.  This gives me 24 max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life isn&#x27;t spectacular...I can get about 3-4 shaves tops before it needs a recharge.  It does, however, seem to charge relatively quickly.  Cleaning it is easy, and I prefer manually cleaning it than having to deal with those big bulky charger/cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as electric razors go this is a decent unit but can&#x27;t rate it higher since there are flaws, and it just isn&#x27;t that great of a shave when compared to a razor blade.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic electric shaver has many improved features.  It shaves either wet or dry with super closeness.  Clean up with soap and water is a real advantage.  The extended battery life with a visual readout is very valuable.  I reccommend this Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of Panasonic shavers for many years. I use one every day to shave my head and face in the shower. This new model is the best I have ever used. It gives the closest and fastest shave I have ever experienced. It is easy to hold and use and charges fast. This is a noticeable improvement over older models.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 30 days, every day, and it does not work well at all.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I go over my neck area, this does not get all the hairs and it looks stubbly when I am done.  It also irritates my skin and causes redness, and at a few points has even caused me to bleed!  I used the product as instructed and was not pressing hard on my neck area at all, and the bleeding is what made me realize that this product is not worth even $20.  Do not buy this!  Save your money and purchase those cheap $4 razors....you&#x27;ll get a better shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Braun 3 series that got taken over by Skynet and became sentient- circuit board turns itself on and off. Very happy with the purchase of the Panasonic so far, as I look for build quality and durability in a product. Fit and finish is excellent, good ergonomics and modern aesthetics. Performance definitely a step up from my old Braun, smooth comfortable and close shave with no tugging experienced so far. This model does not come with a self-cleaning gizmo, but it really isn&#x27;t needed as the shaver features a sonic mode designed for cleaning under the tap with regular soap and water. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 50 years.  Once in a while I get nostalgic and use a blade.  Then back to the buzz.  This is my 3rd Panasonic.  Nothing wrong with 1st two,  just a sucker for new and better.  This one is new and the BEST!  Instructions say use it exclusively for 60 days.  Did not take that long to make me a convert!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  only been a week but I will agree with the others that you can get a close as a blade with this razor.  By far the best after a Braun 7505 (former favorite) and a Braun 8000 series flagship that dropped and cracked the head.</li>
            <li> Very impressed...if you use this daily in the shower you can maintain a fusion pro glide like shave...but if you skip a day, there is a noticeable difference in closeness, and you will probably want to use a razor for a day to get back to maintaining a close shave</li>
            <li> Foil damaged in 7 months and cuts skin - Panasonic brazenly refuses to provide a replacement.  I paid $260 for this piece of %$#@ for crying out loud.  This would easily go down as the worst purchase I have ever made at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the shaver does not cut a close as some of the reviews I had read suggested.</li>
            <li> This razor is the very best. Clean, smooth and comfortable. Bye bye Norelco. Twice the shave in half the time.</li>
            <li> It is no better at providing a good say then my three headed Panasonic comes complete with a cleansing apparatus combine with a charging stand. I was hoping that this would have the facility to clean and charge as well,it did not</li>
            <li> I was a rotary shaver user and have quite a stubborn beard but this is pretty much the elite of shavers. Really surprised with the battery life and the constant power. You wonder if it&#x27;s worth the higher price tag? Well wonder no more, it&#x27;s worth every bit. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Arc 5 electric shaver provides a close, irritation free shaving experience, and has an efficient and convenient sonic cleaning mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Control wise the shaver is very simple.  It only has one button, the power button.  Around the power button is a rotating control to lock the shaver&#x27;s power button for use when traveling.  On the back of the shaver is a sliding switch that has two positions.  The first locks the head of the shaver from pivoting, and the second pops out the trimmer for cutting sideburns.  There is an illuminated LCD display on the front that lets you know battery status, the length of your shave, when to clean the shaver heads, when to replace the shaver heads, and when the sonic cleaning mode is activated.  Included with the shaver is a zippered travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a rubber back and a nicely shaped handle that makes shaving comfortable.  The head of the shaver is rather large though, so it can feel a little top heavy at times.  The 5 blades shave very closely, and the freely pivoting head help keep them in close contact with your skin.  Indeed, it&#x27;s probably one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had, and works just as well my high-end rotary Norelco (I should note that I&#x27;ve only ever shaved with an electric shaver and always shave dry).  Additionally, it&#x27;s very easy on my sensitive skin and leaves behind no redness or sensitivity.  The only caveats about its performance are that I have to make multiple passes over my neck, and that it can snag on my hairs a bit when I let my stubble grow out for a few days.  Lastly since the head of the shaver is so large it&#x27;s hard to shave around an intricate goatee or get right under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is very easy.  When the cleaning icon comes up on the LCD you simply turn the shaver off, wet the head of the shaver and apply a little liquid hand soap.  Next, you press the power button for two seconds to activate the sonic cleaning mode, which runs for 20 seconds.  Lastly, you remove the outer foil section, turn on the sonic cleaning mode again and run the shaver under hot water.  It cleans the blades and shaver housing very thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver takes 1 hour to charge, has a 45-minute run time, and a 5-minute quick charge if you need to get a quick shave in and the shaver&#x27;s battery is dead.  One thing I really don&#x27;t like is that you cannot use the shaver while it is plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/08/2012 Update: I&#x27;m still using it daily and it works fine and continues to shave closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all...a great electric shaver with a unique and efficient sonic cleaning mode.20 seconds.

            <li> I have owned this razor for about eight months now, and I am sad to report that I am disappointed I purchased it. My experience is mixed because I use it to shave both my head and face. In that sense, I would rate it four stars for head shaving because it really does a good job; my head is cue-ball smooth when I am done. That said, it requires several passes and a lot of patience to achieve that clean look and feel (about four minutes, which doesn’t sound like a long time, but believe me, it is longer than you realize). Moreover, if you skip a day, forget it. At least for my hair, which is fairly coarse, so it takes forever to get my head shaved if I skip a day. And if I skip two? I literally cannot use the shaver. I first have to crop it very tightly with hair clippers or shave with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps more troubling is its face shaving capability (or lack thereof), which when you think about it, makes no sense because it was designed for the face rather than the scalp as far as I know. Anyway, I cannot get a clean face shave no matter how much time I spend. For whatever reason, it simply does not give me a clean shave on my cheeks, and shaving my neck is a nightmare. I can move the razor in multiple directions, going back and forth over and over and over, and I STILL cannot get all the hairs on my neck shaven clean. About the only place I can get a clean shave is along my jawline. I therefore suspect that this razor does well with taut skin (skin covering the jaw and scalp), but suffers terribly with skin that is more malleable (along the cheeks and neck, with no hard bone underneath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum then, I would give this shaver four stars for its head shaving capability but only two stars for its face shaving ability given that I cannot get a clean shave no matter what I do. That of course is in an absolute sense, but given that this razor also costs $200, it really is a terrible value. Even worse? I just learned that you need to replace the blades every few months, which at the time of writing, cost an additional $64 per replacement. That means I spent $200 up front and can expect continue to spend at least $130 a year keeping fresh blades on the shaver. NOT good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this being said, I will never go back to razor blades, particularly for my head. The fact that I no longer have to worry about slicing a sweet two-inch layer of skin off my scalp any given morning (which is what prompted my purchase to begin with) makes using electric shavers worth the aggravation. However, I will definitely look to an alternative when this one wears out its utility (which may be sooner than later unfortunately – it can only hold a four-day charge now as it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I suggest not getting lured by some of the bells and whistles of this model that, in my opinion, are of very little value in practice. For example, the digital display of the percent battery remaining is nearly useless. How is a digital display of a blinking 10% battery reserve any more useful than simply having a little LED light turn orange or red when battery power is low? It’s not like this model kicks into power reserve or anything, and you can’t see the readout while you’re shaving anyway, so it&#x27;s not like you will suddenly know you need to hurry up and finish before the battery dies. Even more interesting is that you cannot operate it while it is plugged in. I suspect this is due to the fact that it is a wet-dry shaver, so it automatically disables function when plugged in. This of course is a nightmare if you did not notice you were low on charge and started shaving, only to have the battery die mid-shave (which unfortunately has happened to me). In fact, in that respect, I think a red LED light on the outside would actually be more useful than a digital readout because you don’t see the readout until you turn on the shaver anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The lock mechanism is alsouseless in my opinion. I travel a lot, and I take my shaver with me every trip. I have never once used the lock mechanism to prevent it from being turned on accidentally, nor have I ever had it turn on accidentally. I mean, really. What are the odds? You have to pack it in clothes (or something soft) to prevent it from getting banged up in your luggage anyway, so how is it going to get turned on? And at home? Honestly? All you do is turn it off, rinse it off, and set it on your counter to dry. How is it going to turn on by itself just sitting there? Why pay for this feature. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but these bells and whistles seem like a way to merely increase the price of the shaver than actually serving any useful purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long and short, I suggest steering clear of buying a more expensive version of a shaver because of seemingly useless bells and whistles. They just are not worth it, at least not the ones that this particular model offers over other more basic models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I&#x27;ll grin and bear this purchase until I can no longer, but then I will have to start the search all over. If anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.useless in my opinion. I travel a lot, and I take my shaver with me every trip.

            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers for many years beginning with the Arc3, and they keep getting better. The Arc5 provides an extremely close shave  in a short amount of time. I don&#x27;t use any shaving cream or oil, and the shaver does an excellent job both in the shower and dry. However, the shaver works better in the shower or after I have washed my face. I used to use shaving cream and/or oil, but did not notice that they shortened my shaving time.  The pop-up sideburn trimmer has improved over the Arc4. It trims my sideburns quickly and efficiently.  Once the shaver shows 10% power remaining, you should recharge it as soon as possible or the shaver might stop in the middle of your shave.  On a few of my previous Panasonic shavers, the LCD display had problems after a year or so, but I have had no problems with the LCD display on this shaver.  Pros: Close, fast shave Easy to clean  Cons: Replacement foils/cutters are expensive (but they are worth it because of the quality of the shave)</li>
            <li> Great Shaver, a bit weak on neck hairs.. I replaced it with a Panasonic ES8228 shaver that was 4 years old and 2 blade shaver did a better job on my neck..</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome, although it has some few weak points, like noise (it&#x27;s really noisy!) but it&#x27;s something to be expected, this shaver has an awful Achilles&#x27;s heels, and it&#x27;s pronounced jaw bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m skinny and I also have very pronounced jaw bones, which means this shaver has a really hard time in my neck area and under the jaw, I usually need to do many passes in different positions and I still have to finish with old Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the neck, oh boy the neck, thins thing HURTS! However, rather than being the shaver itself, it&#x27;s because I am, like I mentioned previously, skinny AND bony, but other than that, it&#x27;s and awesome shaver and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this thing has a trimmer, I didn&#x27;t know until I opened the box, AND foam doesn&#x27;t work well with the shaver, dry/water/lotion work perfectly.</li>
            <li> good, but not what I expected for the price I pay.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t that close and there are hairs it just can&#x27;t get to. After shaving, if you rub your face the wrong way, it&#x27;s sandpaper city. There is this bundle of random hairs on my neck that it can&#x27;t grab for some reason. I have to use a beard trimmer to get those, then plow that area enough times with this razor to make it somewhat invisible. Something else I noticed is that immediately after shaving, the hairs are invisible, but become visble again within a few hours. Maybe I&#x27;m just a freak of nature...</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it expensive, but for something with 5 blades I had a really bad shave with it. Felt like I had tried to trim my stubble with a pair of scissors.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend staying with a normal shaver :)</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers on/off for the past 4 years. None would shave close and all would cause a lot of irritation on the neck. This one shaves me very close and no irritation. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like using this razor.  Smooth shave.  No pulling.  Long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomics of this shaver are also good.  Compared to several other electric razors I have used, the Panasonic feels good in my hand.  I like the pivoting foil blade, versus the fixed floating heads of the last electric razor I used.  I believe it was a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet/Dry feature is nice if you like to shave in the shower, but I do my shaving before I get in the shower, so I can&#x27;t really comment too much on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning was easy.  Everything pops apart nicely and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only thing that would deter me from buying this is the cost.  Not the cost of the unit itself, but the cost of consumeables.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to have to replace the foil or the blades, but when I do, I am going to think long and hard about it.  Of course, regular razor blades are not cheap either, so I guess it may balance out.  I&#x27;ll have to do the math when it comes time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a nice razor.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research, I decided to buy this shaver for a friend of mine, as his birthday present. He loved it so much that I bought a second one for my husband. It is everything it is stated to be. How rare is that!?</li>
            <li> Great razor and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Easily the best electric shaver I have ever used. No more blade shaving for me. This is an electric that finally does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now, it gives me a great shave with little irritation and the battery doesn&#x27;t crap out too soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally pleased by this shaver.  Over the years I&#x27;ve had several but none have been as good as this one.  It took until I was 76 but now I can dump my bladed razor for good.</li>
            <li> I have tried all latest electric razers like norelco sensotouch 3D,Braun 790cc, panasonic ES-LA63-S and ES-LV61-A. Here is my review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin with ingrown hair and was shaving with traditional shaving method till I turn into 32, result - lot of black marks under chin because of razor burns/bumps. my journey in finding the best electric razor ends with es-lv61-a. it is so close and very easy on sensitive skin wih ingrown hairs. yes it is expensive but worth. The second best is sensotouch 3D if you have no history of ingrown hairs other wise you will get razor burns. Braun 790cc is also good but it does not give as close shave as es-lv61-a.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this I will keep it and never go back to any other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review will help you guys... happy shaving!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first high-end electric shaver that I bought. Here is my assessment based on five points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving quality: You won&#x27;t even feel the shaving +1&lt;br /&gt;Neck shaving quality: I had to do numerous back-and-forth -1&lt;br /&gt;Material quality: Very good +1&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use: It was very easy, didn&#x27;t even feel anything hard +1&lt;br /&gt;Battery life: My battery died in the third week -1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I think this item does not worth 150-200 USD.</li>
            <li> I had a predessor 10 years ago, it was my best shave then and this one is now.  Yes the battery life is not as long as some other brands, but they don&#x27;t shave nearly as well.  When the window says it has 10% left after you shave, you just plug it in.  It will be ready by the time you need it again.</li>
            <li> much  more  good  price  thank  you^^</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, worth the money. I have it for over 6 months now, still works great.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, close shave every time, every after a few days growth.</li>
            <li> So much better than my older Braun. I love it. I use it with Nivea shaving cream and it&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4 shaver for approximately 2 years religiously changing the outer foil and dinner blade has recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I received my LV 61 plugged it in for about an hour and commence to shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being about 80 years old and very lazy I only shave every 3 to 4 days and had not shaved since Friday.  The results were truly astounding.  In just slightly over half the time it usually took with the LA 63 I got a remarkably closer shave everywhere on my face but especially so under my chin and jaw.  The LV 61 did all of this without the frequent hair pulling on the longer hairs that was so common with the LA 63.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LV 61 looks unwieldy but actually handles better than the LA 63 despite the much larger head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the LV 61 is expensive but, is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should anything change I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Strong, powerful, quick and easy to use.  Like the footprint, not too big or small - fits in the medicine cabinet, no sweat. Really close shave, much better than the rotary style shavers.  Fully washable, cleans with soap and water, don&#x27;t need the extra cleaning station found on it&#x27;s more expensive big brother. Compact travel pouch and charging cord so it&#x27;s easy to pack.Great shaver and shave for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the top of the line to shave my husband, who needs personal care. What a struggle to cut his daily beard. It takes half an hour or more each time. I usually resort to the trimmer for much of the time because the shaver doesn&#x27;t begin to produce a clean shave. I get so weary using this gadget. What was promised in the literature and online blurb to be a simple job is so difficult. He has used electric shavers his whole life, so I anticipated that he would like this one especially. Perhaps you would like a video of the whole exhausting process to finally achieve a decent look. I would appreciate a call from the company and an offer of a solution. I called Panasonic for Customer Service, but I got an outside hire not equipped to handle or forward a complaint or offer a solution.</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver I have owned. Shaves as close as a blade very quickly. Easy to clean. Only negative is it is a lot louder than previous shavers I have owned.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth shave.  No tugging/pulling, even with a two-day beard.  Works well wet or dry, definitely a better shave when used wet with shave cream.  Not as close as a blade, but much closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve tried.  The nasty 5:00 shadow that I used to get doesn&#x27;t show up since I&#x27;ve been shaving with this.  Is it worth the price?  Hard to say, I can only say it works much better than the less expensive ($85?) predecessor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lesser model Panasonic, on which the LED display failed.  Panasonic replaced the shaver.  When the display on the replacement also failed, Panasonic offered me an LV61 as a replacement.  Although it&#x27;s disappointing that the other model failed twice, it&#x27;s good customer service to offer an upgraded replacement.</li>
            <li> Love it. Charges quickly, very easy to use, does a good job of shaving. The reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that I have to augment the Panasonic razor with a razor blade on certain angles such as around the sides of my (bald guy) head where it begins to crown. The shave is close, but not close enough to go 24 hrs if I were going out somewhere at night and had shaved in the morning. Otherwise, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I had been a razor user, but converted to electric razors about 5 years ago. I found the Braun was a decent shaver, but left stubble. I have a light beard and it&#x27;s hard for the razor to get to the base of some if the hairs. In fact, it pulled on my beard from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the 4 blade Panasonic, liked the shave, tried it in the shower, didn&#x27;t help more, so I used it dry. But it still didn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the 5 blade, with its faster vibrations is incredible. Never had so close a shave. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 homes, bought one for each. The first has the cleaner, bad and recharger, the second, shown here, doesn&#x27;t. I find the cleaner does work, but the noise and the bother are not worth it in my opinion. I would just buy the razor and clean it with water after each use, or once a week.</li>
            <li> It seems refined but I still have difficulty in attaining a smooth shave in one area of stubborn growth.  I have to end up using a razor to finish up.  Overall satisfied but could be better.</li>
            <li> Amazing tool!!!!!!! Feel like the guy who&#x27;s had his head in the sand and finally caught up to modern day technology. Unbelievable.....close, quick, pain-free shave that doesn&#x27;t cut the crap out of your face. Worth every penny of the cost of this great great machine......need I say more? LOL</li>
            <li> Well it is not 500$ for nothing, it is pretty small but handy, I bought for my dad and he is very picky about his shavers so this one seems to hit the spot. It is pretty easy to use and has a lot of motion.</li>
            <li> My last shaver was the Norelco 8894 XL Spectra, also known as the James Bond Shaver, the last hefty, durable device made by Norelco (or anyone else), so I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to find another shaver anything like it ( I own two and they still work after more than a decade of use) but I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with this Panasonic at all.  It provides a quick, fast, comfortable shave and is very easy to clean even without the optional cleaning accessory.  Sure, it is a piece of plastic and won&#x27;t last as long as the Norelco but, like I said, no manufacturer puts out a durable device these days.</li>
            <li> OK.  I have tried electric razors in the past and have always gone back. They never shave close enough and I always had problems with ingrown hairs on my face.  It just was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like times have changed and I am thrilled with this razor.  I use it dry and no, it is not as close as a blade but you would never know it.  I have no ingrown hairs and this thing is unbelieveable.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews - lots of them and on lots of razors because I really wanted one to work.&lt;br /&gt;This one fits the bill.  It runs out of charge fairly quickly and that would be the only knock I would have on this.  I would not use another.  I hate shaving.  Now, I don&#x27;t hate it so much because I can do it whenever I want and I don&#x27;t need a mirror and a sink and I can use it later to avoid the 5:00 shadow if I need to.  I love this thing. If you are considering which one, this is it.  Really no question.</li>
            <li> very close shave and good procuct.  I have the 8243 already didnt think it could get any better. boy was i wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Arc 3 for almost 4 years. That thing is absolutely incredible and still runs like brand new. It&#x27;s the 8th electric razor I&#x27;ve owned in my life and no razor comes close to it in any category from ease of maintenance, to closeness of shave to obvious durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to purchase another razor in case something happened to my Arc 3 and I was up a creek. I went with the Arc 5 and was expecting to get something more over my Arc 3 because this razor is a lot more expensive. However, in my experience, I notice absolutely NO difference over my 4 year old Arc 3. I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on the Arc 5 and would advise going with a lower model.</li>
            <li> This order stated the following, &amp;#34;Includes Cleaning Brush, Replacement Accessories: WES9941P (Outer Foil), WES9942P (Inner Blade) and WES9979P (Combo Set), Black&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;These parts were not shipped</li>
            <li> I am a blade and badger brush guy, and so I really debated shelling out the money to buy my first electric razor.  But I am glad I did.  The instructions say you need to shave with this for a month to get the best out of it.  But frankly, right out of the box it is a very impressive shaver.  As a guy, I like a nicely built device, and this is nicely built.  It is well balanced and charges very quickly.  The head is not too big and it fits nice in your hand.  The first shave I did with this was dry, and it was fairly amazing.  Pretty much as close as a blade.  It gets even closer wet, shaving in the shower.  You&#x27;ll need to experiment on what works for you, but generally I&#x27;ve found that the simpler the better.  Just spread some shower wash on your face in the shower and use this razor for a couple of minutes.  With some practice you can get a better shave than a blade.  It still amazes me.  There is no skin irritation.  None.  It is very convenient to be able to shave wet or dry, day or night on a seconds notice.  It shaves consistently well.  It is very easy to clean - don&#x27;t waste your money on razors with cleaning stands.  It charges quickly. and it holds a charge for a long time.  Basically, this thing shaves extremely well and is a real pleasure to own.  Like a fine luxury car, it is worth the money.  You get what you pay for, and consider this, you shave a lot.  Buy one.  I did not regret buying this, and you won&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> Hi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new with the electric shavers. I was looking for reviews in the internet. Firth I bought a panasonic arc 3. very dissapointed, lot of time for a poor shave. Then I bought a lithium all in one. Very dissapointed in the face. Then I wanted to buy the &#x27;best one&amp;#34; and this was suppose to be. The reviews says that is the fastest shave, and the closest one.  Very dissapointed!, very bad around the neck, very bad in the mustage, is just working in the sides. I would like to return it, but I already spent a month with it because panasonic says that your face needs a month with the new shave method, but it didn&#x27;t get better. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> my beard is growing in all directions, small hair under the skin , shaving with a razor was not  not an option since 11 years, becuase I&#x27;s a matter of one day before having a very red neck wtih rough hair painfull  to touch, tried the other shavers like philips ( 3 circular heads) but neve worked. Instead I get used to use to shave with groomer and sure it never was a zero shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is absoulotely working, I have been using it since about a month and for me it&#x27;s enough period, with razor no matter if I didn&#x27;t use it for years then I use it once , its a suffer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue that you will feel its huge to use under the neck, but at last I can go to work fully shaved :)</li>
            <li> I have to use an electric razor because of taking a medication blood thinner and can not risk bleeding that could result from using a blade razor. Along with that problem I have by nature a very tough beard. I have used many electrics and this by far is the best one ever. It gives me as close a shave as the blade razors use to and is very easy to use and clean. Like the fact that I can use in the shower to save time if needed.</li>
            <li> It is VERY comparable to Braun, but I say it has a smoother shave and it is way easier to clean --it cleans with just water and a little bit of liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous one I was using, which was also from Panasonic btw, this razor cannot stand on the counter top</li>
            <li> After several years of trying other razors I returned to the panasonic.  It is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Made me wonder why I tried other brands when my old Panasonic wore out.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th electric shaver that I have purchased, and in my opinion it is the BEST shaver that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve owned this razor for over two years. It worked great for well over a year, but then I noticed a) it started to make a loud noise (it&#x27;s already loud, but now it&#x27;s even louder), and b) the hair stubble didn&#x27;t stay within the razor but rather came out as I shaved, making a mess (and making it impossible to shave neatly anywhere but over a sink). So I bought replacement blades, which improved things, but then after about a month or so, the same thing happened. Now, perhaps my razor was somehow damaged (I have kids, I travel a lot, ?), and the razor is no longer a precision-made machine . . . so I&#x27;m going to lay out another $150+ for another one now, which tells you that at one point in time I really liked this razor. But if this happens again, my rating will go down to one star (on the other hand, if it gives me years of service, I&#x27;ll raise my rating back up to my original 5-star rating).</li>
            <li> i got one and after 4 weeks i returned it.&lt;br /&gt;then my wife gave me one for christmas and have been using it now for 2 weeks,&lt;br /&gt;not that good if you shave after 4 or so days .&lt;br /&gt; for daily use it is ok.but you need a trimmer to finish off some tiny hairs that it will just not cut.&lt;br /&gt;the motor is very quiet and the glide over the skin is very smooth  . now if it only would cut all the hairs it would be worth the cost .but as it is now i have to use my old remington to finish off some hairs .&lt;br /&gt;my old remington is great cutting all but it does require the use of the trimmer at all times in extended position to get the job done and it is noisy and not as smooht as the arc5.</li>
            <li> I like the 5 blades concept - faster shave, closer shave.  The shaver is also more quiet than the previous ones (I have been using wet/dry Panasonic shavers for almost 20 years).&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i&#x27;m surprised at is that it&#x27;s a black plastic shell painted blue... blue paint started coming off after 2 weeks of using.</li>
            <li> I had the previous one (4 blades) and decided to upgrade to 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great and since 2010 I&#x27;m not using any other type of razor.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I recommend this product. Worth the money invested.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! And powerful, as well!</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used electric shavers from Norelco and Braun, and had settled on a Panasonic Arc 3.  However, when the coupon came around for the ES-LV61, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, and thought I&#x27;d see how much (if any) technology has progressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had a new replacement screen and blade set for my Arc 3, I installed them to make the comparison fair.  With the new blades and screen, my Arc 3 again reminded me of why I had always preferred it over any previous shaver I&#x27;d experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after my first use of the new shaver, it was obvious this wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;fair\\&quot; comparison - the ESLV-61 was simply that much better.  At least in my case, the shave was much closer, quicker, and smoother - I&#x27;d use the descriptive term \\&quot;substantially\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say there&#x27;s really no difference, other than the Arc 5 is \\&quot;quicker\\&quot;.  I agree with the quicker description; however (again, in my case), my Arc 3 was never as smooth or as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a blade in the past, and (again for me) the results with the Arc5 are nearly indistinguishable from the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I usually use shaving oil and gel cream; however, with this new shaver, it works very well dry or with water only.  Also, I prefer to use with the head in the \\&quot;locked\\&quot; position.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> woulnt fit the Panasonic charger</li>
            <li> Been using the braun 5 series before this and the arc5 is much much better with my thick hair. Only downside is that you cant have it plugged in and running but battery lasts long and charges in 5 minutes for 1 shave so not a big deal. Not fond of the trimmer either .</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this shaver..... Would buy it again....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about the claims but once I started using this shaver I became a believer.  Its so much quieter than my old Braun and any of my other shavers.  My shaving time is about half what it used to be as it cuts close with the first pass and I find that I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times to get the kind of shave I like.  The larger head may be negative factor for some but I wouldn&#x27;t let that be a deterrent from buying this shaver.  I believe if you try it you will like it.  It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> In about six decades of using them, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I bought it to replace my Panasonic  ES8243A. Whereas it took me between 9.5 and 13+ minutes to get a decent shave with my old shaver, depending on how long it had been since I&#x27;d cleaned it, this one gives me a superb shave in 5-6 minutes. That&#x27;s about as close to shaving nirvana as I expect to get. I clean the shaver after each use (just blow and brush the bits out, then rinse with water) and it takes me less time to shave with and clean this shaver than it used to take me just to shave with my old one. My beard is a challenge for anything I&#x27;ve tried (short of a sharpened rock), but this shaver does a beautiful job without breaking a sweat.</li>
            <li> First, some background.  I am a guy with a heavy beard (I use a shared amazon account with my wife, but I assure you I&#x27;m a guy!).  I have to shave every day, and if I don&#x27;t do so, it will be obvious to anyone who gets within 20 feet of me.  No matter how much time I spend shaving, by 5:00 every day I have that stereotypical shadow.  Several years ago, I decided to give electic shavers a try.  I loved the closeness of a blade shave, but daily shaving with a razor took a little too much time and, more importantly, was irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with a Norelco, then a Panasonic (not the Arc 5), then I used a Braun for several years up until a month ago when I bought this shaver.  I really liked the Braun and was considering just getting another Braun rather than the Panasonic.  My Braun still didn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as I used to get with a razor, but it was pretty good.  Quite frankly, I had given up hope of getting a shave as close as a blade.  And I wasn&#x27;t sure if it made sense to spend as much as the Panasonic costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I decided to give it a try!  Because my beard is thicker than most, it always takes me a little longer to shave.  Switching from the Braun to the Panasonic, it only takes me about 4 minutes to shave, which is almost 2 minutes less than it took with the Braun.  But if that was the only difference, I probably still wouldn&#x27;t have thought the Panasonic was worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic gives an incredibly close shave that sets it apart from any shaver I&#x27;ve tried.  I usually shave dry, and it does a very good job with that.  When I started using it wet, however, it gave me an unbelievably close shave.  And I mean UNBELIEVABLY CLOSE.  It is at least as close of a shave as I used to get with a blade.  And it doesn&#x27;t matter whether I shave in the shower or just splash some hot water on my face before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth to the touch with no stubble at all.  That may be commonfor guys with beards that aren&#x27;t as thick, but it&#x27;s foreign to me.  And many hours after I have shaved, my skin remains smooth.  As I mentioned before, I have always ended up with a 5:00 shadow with any razor/shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  With the Panasonic, come 5:00, my skin is still pretty smooth with almost no stubble.  I&#x27;m writing this review in the morning having shaved yesterday morning, and my beard is at about the level it would typically be at 5:00 the day before.  So the Panasonic has many great features (good battery life, charges quickly, cleans easily, etc.), but the closeness of the shave is unlike any shaver I have used and is what truly sets the Panasonic apart.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this you must be thinking about moving over from another brand such as Braun or Remington or moving up from a less expensive Panasonic. You&#x27;re also probably asking yourself why this shaver is so expensive and do you really have to spend this much money to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;Before delving in to the LV61-A I thought a brief review of the Panny line of linear shavers might be in order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -- The 3-blade 8103S is the least expensive at about $78 here at Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and IMHO offers the best electric shaver value on the market. It delivers a shave I would rate at 4.25 stars out of five.(Note that this model has been replaced by the LT41-K which is almost identical in features.) It is well built, feels solid in the hand and its narrow head makes it extremely maneuverable. This means it&#x27;s particularly good at getting into tight spots that are hard to reach. All the shavers discussed here are about the same length and weight so the weight missing from this model&#x27;s head must be in the handle, giving it that solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;The feature I look for most in a shaver is a head that pivots from front to back as I find that necessary to do a good job on my neck and jawline. Unfortunately, that feature is missing on this model and the 4-blade models other than the LA63-S. Those models swivel freely from side to side and, for some reason I can&#x27;t fathom, move up and down as more or less pressure is applied. If you want to stop this movement, however, you can engage the head lock button and get full concentration on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The flip side of this missing feature, happily, is a good trimmer. This is because the trimmer is located on the back of the head and the bracket that holds it in place traverses the neck of the shaver, thereby precluding any fore and aft motion of the head. The result is a trimmer of perfect length and better than the other two models discussed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a light to average beard or are simply satisfied with a good but not spectacular shave at a reasonable cost, IMHO you don&#x27;t need more than the 8103S. And the fact that this shaver constantly runs neck-to-neck with the Braun 790cc for best-selling linear shaver on Amazon would seem to bear this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --The 4-blade LA63-S is considerably more expensive at about $200 as I write this(it is usually less when sold by Amazon but at the moment Amazon seems to be out of stock or just leaving it to third-party sellers). This model has a huge head that pivots freely from front to back and side to side. The handle feels light and plasticy and the head large and heavy. This top-heaviness makes it feel rather clumsy and unergonomic. Worse, the front to back pivot motion I consider so&lt;br /&gt;important is TOO free because it&#x60;s not well damped. It sort of reminds me of a rolling pin over dough!&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is about .5 inches longer than the LV61 and that length (which I consider a disadvantage in ergonomics and handling) is all in the head, which stands taller than the LV61 and makes it appear larger though it really is not. Oddly, the bigger heads on the LA63 and LV61 result in shorter trimmers than the 8103S. This is because the trimmers are once again built into the back of the head, but because of the pivoting action must be built above the neck of the shaver. This leaves less space in which to fit the trimmer and appears to be a design necessity rather than a fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LA63 delivers a shave I would rate at 4.5 stars but misses the mark in ergonomics, quality of feel and, most of all, maneuverability. I ditched mine after just two months of use in favor of the Braun Series 7,&lt;br /&gt;which I liked much more. But this is not the place to get into the Braun...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO the LA63 is Panasonic&#x60;s miss. If you are willing to spend this much on a shaver, go the extra mile and get the LV61.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --The 5-blade LV61 is Panasonic&#x60;s crown jewel. Everything about it speaks of quality, ergonomics and careful execution. The handle feels solid, strong and comfortable. The head, while large, doesn&#x60;t feel out of proportion. The balance between the two is perfect. The head doesn&#x60;t feel as big as the LA63 because it is shorter in height even though it is broader from front to back to accommodate the five blades. The front to back pivot is much better damped so everything feels tight and right. As mentioned earlier, the trimmer is, unfortunately, the same as the LA63 and a little too short, making it difficult to see what you are doing because of the big head partly obstructing your view.&lt;br /&gt;Now about the 5 blades. Like almost all shavers these days there is a center cutting strip (which Panny calls slit foil) in the middle. The two auxiliary blades are located at the outside extremes of the screen.&lt;br /&gt;The one in front is the finishing foil and in back is the lift-tech foil. On each side of the slit foil are the main shaver blocks which are&lt;br /&gt;fitted in traditional fashion to the top of the shaver inside. The other three blades are built into the screen.&lt;br /&gt;To ensure the main cutters would not cause the head to be impossibly deep from front to back, they have been reduced in width considerably from those used on other models. That means less main cutter contact than others and makes you wonder how this thing can cut so well. I guess the other three blades actually do more than you might think. Frankly, when I first noticed this, I was completely taken aback. But, believe me, it works great. To give you a better idea of how this blade configuration may work on your face, I find that on my upper lip only one main cutter and the lift-tech foil are doing the work because only two blades will fit, and on the area below my lower lip and above my chin, it&#x60;s one main foil and the finishing foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO this is the best electric shaver on the US market today. I rate the shave 5 stars and the shaver exceptional in just about every category including comfort.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tough or difficult beard or just want to own the best, search no further. This is the king of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: FEBRUARY 7, 2014 ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since writing this review I&#x27;ve had occasion to try the 4-blade Panasonic LF51-A model and was very impressed with it. It delivers a no- nonsense close shave with reasonable comfort and easily wins my vote for best Panasonic 4-blade. It&#x27;s meant to replace the venerable 8243A model but doesn&#x27;t seem to be well-known. And it&#x27;s currently selling on Amazon for an incredible $110! If you&#x27;re not inclined to spend the extra $100 or more for the LV61-A (which for me is still the best of all shavers), you will likely be very happy with this model. As I said in my review of it on December 23, 2013 I sometimes cannot tell the difference in shave closeness between this and the LV61-A, although the latter is definitely more comfortable in terms of smoothness. Overall, I think the LF51-A is a winner and a real steal at it&#x27;s current price.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my wife to shave. It shaves nicely wet or dry, although sometimes it misses or tugs hairs. Plenty of battery life.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my handicapped son who has a very thick beard. The reviews talked of the long lasting close shave they got. It is a step above&lt;br /&gt;a smaller Panasonic ES-SA40 I was using on him, but definitely not worth the $200 plus dollars spent. Maybe worth it for those with lesser finer facial hair.</li>
            <li> I previously had Panasonic ES8249 wet/dry shaver which has to be about 5 years old and going strong. I use Billy Jealousy as my shaving creme with wetting. If you haven&#x27;t tried it I would recommend. It looks expensive but a little goes a long way. I purchased this shaver because of its higher speed and additional blades. My old shaver was getting noisy and seemed to need new foils to prevent pulling. I first noticed the larger size of the head and the very different angle of it compared to my old shaver. Only the back is rubberized and the front of the razor is smooth and gets slick when wet. I just need some more usage to get the right hold. Shaving experience was very smooth with no pull. One review mentioned it was hard to get under the nose but did not find it so. Skin feel was much smoother than my old Panasonic. The next day I noticed a lot of fine white (old guy) hairs around the front of the neck that I thought was clean. The next time I used the shaver I noticed it did a good job of of sucking up the shaving gel which clogs up the foil which I expect is finer than my old shaver. Frequent water rinses of the head corrected that and did not diminish the gel effectiveness. Fine hair issue gone. Other reviews of less than perfect shaves may not have figured out the shaver needed more rinses during the shave to keep the foil open. One final comment. Don&#x27;t buy the model with cleaning system. The extra expense is not needed as pulling the foil and running water over both leaves it clean and a simple pat down using a dry towel gets rid of the water. I&#x27;d like to give it a 4.5 for the slick front but will do a 5.0 because I can&#x27;t and I believe I&#x27;ll get use to it. Another winner from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have used panasonic electric shavers  for about 10 years,and philips shavers for about 5 years.This shaver have an excellent shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different electric razors in many price ranges.  This is the first to deliver a close shave that allows me to toss my traditional razor which in he past I have kept for occasions where I&#x27;ve needed to look my best.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.  I thought that it would shave closer.  It is my first experience&lt;br /&gt;with a electric razor.  Maybe I expect to much ??  It has ben a month, maybe&lt;br /&gt;longer it will improve.  If not, will have to use a blade occasionally.  It seems&lt;br /&gt;like a nice instrument.  A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> after about a week my face is as smooth as a babys bottom.  And it seems to shave faster.  It cost more but if it lasts a couple years it will be more than worth it.  My wife appreciates it a lot.</li>
            <li> It performs incredible and as good as a blade without the cuts. It does have some issues shaving close to the sideburns mainly because of the bulky head, but no other electric shaver in the world can come close to this one.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Panosonic razors but have tried all the other leading models. This is the best ever. Very pricey but worth it. Love the locking feature for travel. Eliminates the frustration of arriving somewhere with a dead razor.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  Close shave. Good feel in hand.</li>
            <li> these panasonic arc 5 razors are the best.  I have compared them to the top of the line braun and Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own two, because I shave with two--saves time.  the one that is self cleaning, and more expensive, is not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The shaver is the smoothest of the lot. with 5 blades  it is smoother than 1290x and 790cc.  However it did cause some skin irritation and&lt;br /&gt;my sensitive skin wasnt well suited for this.  Further there were few spots which this shaver couldnt do a good spot with (especially the chin underside and neck areas.  When I run over those areas repeatedly it leads to skin inflammation.  Since it delivers very smooth shave you can shave only every 2 days instead of every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the braun which did not have a very smooth shave, but had options to adjust for sensitive skin and could be used daily with no skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;having both braun and panasonic  would make for an ideal shave kit, but the price wasnt worth it for me</li>
            <li> Very noisy - still not a great shave, especially poor dry shave</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but there is no denying this is the closest shave I have ever gotten manual or electric razor. Love this razor. Simply the best.</li>
            <li> Really, much better than I expected.  I have owned every one of Braun and Panasonic&#x27;s better shavers for thirty or so years.  I was afraid the large head would prevent my getting to the tight places... under my nose for instance.  The shaver does just fine in those areas.  It&#x27;s quiet and gives my a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Just got my new razor yesterday and tried it this morning.  Closest shave I have ever had, hands down.  I&#x27;ve alternated between a safety razor and a Braun middle-of-the-road electric for years with mixed results and lots of nicks and irritated skin.  Hopeful that I can pretty much abandon the razor &amp; shave cream routine entirely with this shaver.  It&#x27;s expensive but appears to be well worth the money!</li>
            <li> After reading whole bunch of reviews i ordered this machine for birthday. Guess what, Boyfriend called me all in excitement and thanking me that i got him it. I never seen him this excited he said it worked like knife on butter. With his Braun machine it took him half an hour to shave n still would leave some black spots of hair. With this machine took him only 5 min and he was like is this it? All i can say he was super happy that i got him it . He said never ever he will go back to old ways of shaving .</li>
            <li> Excellent performance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a fine razor but the one I recieved would not accept a charge to the battery so I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I love everything about being Italian except  one thing -- that  never ending 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Women always complain about my scratchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of my adult life I&#x27;ve just had to accept that I would look scraggly after a certain point in the day.  Thankfully that&#x27;s no longer the case since I purchased my Panasonic&#x27;s Arc5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is noticeably softer after my first couple of shaves. An old girlfriend, who always complained about finding untamed whiskers said that I had never had a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the shave, I also like the lock feature which keeps the device from accidentally shutting off during operation, a problem that some users encountered in earlier versions. Cleanup is a snap by adding a little hand soap when operating the device in clean mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an earlier version of this razor which included the separate cleaning machine. While I ordinarily never pass up any gadget, I get a better result with the hand soap. The razor smells better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had a couple of shaves with the Arc5 but I haven&#x27;t noticed any speed increase over the version that I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s just a better shave, which is the bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re purchasing on Amazon make sure you look for the electronic coupon when adding this product to your cart if it&#x27;s still available. I saved $50. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just go ahead and splurge and buy this razor instead of a Braun Series 7 or a Norelco with those heads stuck out in space, I have one of each of them plus a Remington and this Panasonic is by far the best of bunch. I doubt that the others will ever get used again unless I give them away. I wish I had splurged and bought Panasonic years ago.</li>
            <li> This is good for anyone in the military.This gets just as close and is easy on the skin and such a quick shave</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for about two weeks now. So far no problems with it at all. Super fast charge. Quiet compared to my ancient Braun. This really gives you a nice clean close shave. Not as close as using an actual razor blade but close enough to give you a smooth face. This was a birthday present from my wife. The price is a bit high but it is definitely worth every buck and most importantly... wife approved !!!</li>
            <li> Gifts, not directly sent out. Hope that the quality is no problem.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and beard. This is the best electric I&#x27;ve used to get at the neck folds (hate these things), and some other awkward areas. I use it as a sort of pre-shaver before using a disposable in the shower. And, don&#x27;t be afraid to use a lather, it works even better when you do.</li>
            <li> best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Have a Braun787 and it doesn&#x27;t match.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth, close shave and it doesn&#x27;t miss spots like the Braun. Works great with a wet beard also. Almost as close (98%) as a DE shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver does NOT provide a close shave.  Not only that but it took nearly twice as long as it takes to shave with my Mach 3. Unlike the Mach 3 I didn&#x27;t get a smooth finish at all. The stubble that remained was almost equivalent to a full day&#x27;s worth of growth. The shaving head is huge and as a result I couldn&#x27;t get the hairs directly under my nose. I got this shaver so that I could shave every day and not have to deal with skin irritation. Well not only did I get razor bumps I also got a number of small cuts as well. How does that happen? I thought by using an electric razor I would never have to deal with that crap again. Another thing worth mentioning is that head gets kind of hot, which I&#x27;m sure leads to even more skin irritation. So yeah this is going back to Amazon. I really wanted this to work but it wasn&#x27;t meant to be I suppose.  On the plus side my chin has never been smoother. The rest of my face feels like sandpaper but my chin is as smooth as glass. I&#x27;ve got to give it credit for that. One other thing I liked was that the shaver was easy to clean. I mean extremely easy. You don&#x27;t need the cleaning station at all. That being said this shaver is just not worth what Panasonic is asking for it. If you decide to purchase this electric shaver then I sincerely hope that your shaving experience is better than mine was.</li>
            <li> I bought this item partly because of the good reviews and it has performed as advertised.</li>
            <li> This razor surprised me being better than I expected -  and I expected an execellent razor. Very close to &amp;#34;Gillette shave&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The razor was a gift for my husband - he just loves it&#x27;s features.  Great quality. It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the one I received was defective or not, but I had to go over the same spot on my face like 20-30 times before there was any noticeable difference. I did my research before buying this razor, it&#x27;s one of the best rated on amazon, so granted, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It works very well. Comparing it to my old Philips in terms of accuracy this one is a winner. My only complain is that back razor isn&#x27;t easy to use.</li>
            <li> very nice,comfortable,and I&#x27;ll buy panasonic shaver again.</li>
            <li> I let my husband try the razor first and never got it back. Here&#x27;s what he said, \\&quot;I have tried electric shavers in the past but have never been a big fan.  The shave wasn&#x27;t that good and the it was difficult to shave place under the chin.  I have now used this shaver for a month and I am a fan.  The shave, while not as good as a blade razor, was close-no five o&#x27;clock shadow and it was great for under the chin.  When I am in a hurry, no accidental nicks or cuts.  It advertises that cleanup is easy and it is, just rinse it off.  One charge last for more than 10 days and whether it is fully charge or down to 10% of the charge, the shave is the same.  It is great for travel.  I have not used my razor for a full month and I do not miss it\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Panasonic is always at the top of the list when it comes to Men&#x27;s Shaver and Panasonic ES-LV61-A Men&#x27;s 5-Blade Shaving System with Nanotech Blades, Black is no exception. This shaver reminds me a whole lot to their top of the line that come with the cleaning system as well. I looked for the cleaning system for this particular model but could not find one, so I guess you have to clean it with water as the instructions say. That is kind of sad because I have found out that even though it is a little more expensive, the cleaning station does a more than average cleaning job on the shaver.   For the shaving: this shaver is very fast and picks up most of the beard in great style. I guess that the speed in which the blades spin makes it more efficient than their competition. I have used the top of the line Braun and find this one equal if not better in performance and results. I used it for a while before I presented this review and have been impressed with the shaver&#x27;s efficient power. I used it in the shower but must confess I still prefer the out of the shower option, this is just a personal preference because in the shower it performed as equal and being already under running water allowed for the cleaning part as well. The way I have learned it works is this: as long as all parts are kept in tip top condition and the parts have not aged past the point of not being as efficient, this shaver will deliver on its promise. As I mentioned above, I think that Panasonic delivers some seriously good shavers and sometimes when brand new, their prices seem to attest to that fact. I do not know exactly why but it seems the most expensive the shaver the more inclined I am to believe that the quality will surpass the less expensive ones. I figure they (the companies) have already done the research and that is their way to let the buyer know which models they consider to be superior. It is kind of sad once you think about it but it is reality at its best exemplified.  For someone that drives a Toyota Camry and sees a Lexus LS 460 pass by there is always that nagging feeling that, yes, the Lexus is the better vehicle. Not to say that one does not work or lasts, only that top of line is that top of the line and at least on shavers one could aspire for the leader of the pack (vroom, vroom). This one is not the top selection on the distinguished Panasonic line up but seems to share the same components of their more costly siblings. That said, it works like a charm and amazon is directly responsible for the tremendous joy of enjoying it on a daily basis. Sometimes a person can not be thankful enough and this is one of those times for me.  I keep believing that half points pinpoint products more accurately than whole points for as I was saying earlier a Toyota Camry very much so would deserve a 4 Stars if it is every bit as good as the slogan that it is the best selling vehicle in its class attests but a Lexus LS 460 could not be a 4 Stars if all the accolades of its extensive performance and features is to be believed, then it would have to have a higher rating like a 4.5, knowing that 5 Stars is perfection in the face of the earth only the rare and few would deserve such a high mark. Anywhoo, that is my take and Panasonic ES-LV61-A (they keep throwing a 100 variations to keep a person jumping hoops trying to figure out parts and models, just like computers-too many to choose from, total baloney I say, keep it simple!) deserves a solid 4 Stars Plus for while not being the ultimate machine it pretty much beats the competition in what it does best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used electric razors and always shaved dry. Over the course of my life I found that rotary shavers worked best for my admittedly light growth. In my 40&#x27;s I still only need to shave every other day. I had the opportunity to try this foil razor and compare it to a rotary so I took the chance.  It by far gives the closest shave of any electric razor I have ever tried. Not exactly as close as a blade but pretty close. The swivel head, which can be locked, does a good job going over the chin to the neck. The battery charges reasonably quickly, about one hour and lasts for 20 shaves or so.  On the downside the size of the head is an issue, combined with the closeness of the shave it becomes more of an issue resulting in the underside of my nose often being scraped while shaving due to the sheer size of the head as I shave over the upper lip. Even with my less than thick growth the shaver does not do a good job on more than 3-4 days growth, it pulls quite uncomfortably and struggles to cut resulting in a much longer time to shave as you continually go back and forth over the same area experiencing a combination of cutting and pulling. The base/handle of the shaver is not as comfortable in my hand as other shavers I have used. It for some strange reason even with the high price does not include a stand to mount in while recharging or not in use. It is also the loudest electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The final con is the price, this is a seriously expensive razor  Whether these cons outweigh the fact that it gives me the closest shave an electric has given me is up to the consumer. Myself I am not yet sure if I will continue to use this or return to my high end rotary shaver. I cannot deny though that for facial hair of less than a couple days growth it gives an exceedingly comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for 15 years now so my review may be a bit biased as I haven&#x27;t used any of the competitor&#x27;s wet/dry shavers. Before that I was solely a Braun user. This review might be more for those who are contemplating going from a 4 blade to a 5 blade razor wet/dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES8243A for the last 4 years and have been very happy with the shave. I took advantage of an Amazon sale last week and was able to get this LV61 for $150 even though my ES8243A was still working mechanically (the LCD screens on my past 3 or 4 wet/drys have gone haywire for some reason but the razor works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was always hesitant to try the 5 blade because of its cost and my satisfaction with the 4 blade. Fortunately with the sale, I was able to get one at just a little more than a 4 blade cost. Now that I&#x27;ve tried one, I now think I should have upgraded earlier. The LV61 shaves much closer than the ES8243A and the shave is much faster. I normally time about 3:15 to do a shave in the morning. Since trying the LV61, my shave time has gone down to about 1:45 to 2:00 because I don&#x27;t have to make multiple passes like I used to. I&#x27;m very impressed with it. Hopefully, the LCD screen will last on this one compared to the ES8243A. If you are weighing between a 4 blade or 5 blade wet/dry, I would highly recommend the 5 blade. It is a noticeably better shave.</li>
            <li> Had several razors over the years including top of the line Braun and most recently a Norelco Senso Touch 3D.  Braun was decent however could not get myself to continue to buy the cleaning solution and, eventually the actual cleaner.  Norelco was very comparable to the Braun and probably would still have it if it was not for the poor quality of the new replacement heads.  After doing some research i was just about to purchase the Pan. Arc4 for approx $150.  Then i received a coupon for $100 off this Arc5 which made it the same price as the Arc4.  Was hesitant due to the 5 blades and the possible awkwardness of trying to shave.  I am absolutely thrilled with the performance of this razor.  Not only is it incredibly easy to handle but the shave is very close.  Most noticeable is the reduced time and number of strokes it takes to get a great shave.  No kidding, i think i cut my shave time in half and received a better shave then both previous razors.</li>
            <li> The very first expensive shaver that I&#x27;ve bought in my life. Felt very smooth and easy to shave my beard. Still trying to adapt the shaver so the rating is based on the shaver. Will write more review after a month.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Had the Arc IV and decided to try this. Shave feels closer and smoother, was a worthwhile upgrade.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mostly for the wet-shave capability and mostly use the trimmer.  Despite the excited reviews of other users I do not have the illusion that this even remotely comes close to a bladed-shave... for it does not.  I have thick facial hair and this does create a smooth shave when excessively going over the same location for what seems like an eternity (probably 10-20 passes), but not as smooth as I get from 2-3 passes with a Mach-3 blade... and I have shaved both wet and dry (the dry gets closer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated, I mostly use the trimmer.  I do not like the irritation of hair growing back after a smooth-shave, so I just trim it down... the last Panasonic I owned lasted for almost a year before the trimmer started having problems (using maybe once or twice a week).  I have used this maybe once every 2 weeks and I&#x27;m already having troubles with the trimmer (after 3 months of light-use).  It makes a high-pitch noise and doesn&#x27;t cut-for-crap.  I reset it (put the trimmer back in and pop-it-out) and no change, I rinse it... no change, I flick it... still no change.  Sometimes I shake it and it starts working again for a second or two before it makes the high-pitch noise and stops working again.  I popped the compartment off (like when you clean the blades) and the trimmer started working again, but I&#x27;m afraid to use it with those exposed-blades (as soon as I put that part back on it stops working again).  It didn&#x27;t have this problem before being used in wet-conditions, but now it doesn&#x27;t want to work in the shower.  I am obviously very upset that this item did not even last 3 months for the price I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the last time I purchase a Panasonic.  If this were a $50 electronic-razor I would&#x27;ve given it 2 stars, but since I paid nearly $200 for this, it only gets 1 star because nothing that expensive should last less than a year.</li>
            <li> Overrated... Not as good as the one I was trying to replace, the Panasonic ES8243 WET/DRY.&lt;br /&gt;TOO MUCH HYPE OVER THE SIZE OF THE FOILS WHICH IS JUST A MARKETING GIMMICK. It has 2 cutters, just like my previous shaver and the bulky head makes it difficult to reach areas on your face with precision. A bit disappointed with the shave as it is not that close or even worse than the one I had. There is a lock function which is good when you travel as it prevents the shaver from switching on inadvertently. It happened to me couple times with the older one.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  For me, it gives a better shave than Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have owned this Panasonic shaver for almost two years and have been able to compare it with Braun&#x27;s Series 7-790 Pulsonic shaver, which I have used for about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I must clarify that I have a very tough and fast-growing beard. It takes me between 10 and 12 minutes to shave. Both shavers cut my beard close enough for around 6 hours. After that, I need to retouch my beard if I have an event that requires it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main differences between the Panasonic and the Braun shavers are: Braun is slightly faster and a full battery charge is enough for about 6 to 7 shaves whereas, Panasonic lasts only for about 3 to 4 shaves. Also, the Braun shaver is easier to clean using only liquid soap and water. If I were to buy again any of these two shavers, I would buy the Braun Series 7-790</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that any shaver review can be a mixed blessing in itself. It&#x27;s not even really down to personal preference of shaver, because it&#x27;s not always a (frontal lobe) choice. It is decided more by our beard type, shaving habits (frequency, etc.), face shape, and skin type. If it were anything less complicated, we&#x27;d all be using the same tool with optimum results, right? I can only report my own findings, based on my application.&lt;br /&gt;My use is every other day. I shave dry with a shaving stick (I prefer ELTRON to Remington&#x27;s version which leaves residue) on a heavy beard with some bristle that doesn&#x27;t grow perpendicular to my skin (IE: some grow flat atop the skin surface), now with a growing number of the tougher gray whiskers, and a close-cropped van-dyke (what most folks call a goatee).&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s maiden shearing was a pleasant experience. The ultra fast motor is quieter than Philips/Norelco (rotary) and Wahl (foil). I got an effortless shave, with fewer passes, and no grays left behind. No lay-flats or in-growns. The rotary was always king of getting those hardy little buggers, but this one&#x27;s pretty good, too. *Not good enough to get up to the line, though (hence the 4 stars). I still needed another pass with a small foil Wahl, as the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t function at its best when used sideways- which is what is required when using a foil shaver. I have found it to be the smoothest, almost effortless shave on two days of my bristle, in any contour.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve read this far, then well done! If the price is still too high for you, then get the LF51 four head instead. Save some money, and still have a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped some of you searching for the holy grail of shavers. I wish someone had done this before I began my quest, but hey - now I&#x27;ve done it so you don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;-Well-balanced, solid feel - good ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet&lt;br /&gt;-Efficient&lt;br /&gt;-Wet/dry use&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean with liquid soap under running water&lt;br /&gt;-Ultra smooth operation - no snagging or pulling&lt;br /&gt;-Powerful -fewer passes required, so your skin suffers less, recovers quicker.&lt;br /&gt;-Useable pop-out trimmer&lt;br /&gt;-On/off switch lock&lt;br /&gt;-1 hr to full charge&lt;br /&gt;-Quick charge for one shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;-Shaping limitations (a small gripe, really) for which I forgive it.&lt;br /&gt;-Won&#x27;t work when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;-It will never make you a decent cup of tea.&lt;br /&gt;-Price (ouch)&lt;br /&gt;-You (probably) don&#x27;t own one yet.&lt;br /&gt;-Price (bloody hell, man - really?) *Maybe an ES-LV52 would be an easier price tag to swallow for essentially the same item, saving around $100..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers of all types (rotary, linear, foil) for over 50 years.  Their performance was surprisingly similar.  This one is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever used which is a LOT better.  As I write this review, I&#x27;ve used it for a month.  It&#x27;s faster than all my other shavers, yet smooth and comfortable.  It&#x27;s also quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that it comes alone, without a silly cleaning station.</li>
            <li> My first Panasonic. I am getting a closer shave now. Very happy overall. Fairly easy to clean, but needs frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li> Definitely the very best shaving experience I have have had shavers from Philips and Braun, but this takes my shaving experience to  a new level.</li>
            <li> Until last month I had been using an almost 20-year-old German-made foil shaver.  Thought it was time for a replacement.  This shaver simply does not work if you have any length to your stubble.  My beard grows quite slowly and if I don&#x27;t shave every other day with this I have to use a blade.  Even with a single day&#x27;s growth after shaving with this for several minutes I can go back to my old foil shaver and get rid of the remaining &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried shaving in the shower and that just makes it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only way I can get any satisfaction is to shave every day and spend twice as long on it as I&#x27;m used to.  Even then I still can feel roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed as I had extremely high hopes for the shaver.</li>
            <li> the outer blades are a bit spaced out from the inner blades, so there is an empty spot that i kinda have to go back and finish. overall, it is a great product. looks good, feels right in your hands and nice battery life.</li>
            <li> This is an upgrad from my previous BRAUN 5400 series. the extra foils make my shaving faster, not necessarily closer. The battery indicator is helpful, the pivoting head is very smooth and awesome. This is a little harder to get in the tight spots like near your nose or by the sideburns.</li>
            <li> looks nice, works perfect for me used with shaving cream in shower great shave, battery holds charge good.</li>
            <li> I followed the normal routine of wet shaving after a shower, 1) pre shave gel 2) worked up a lather with a badger brush 3) used this Panasonic shaver 4) applied after shave. It took about ten minutes from start to finish to get a  BBS  face with zero irritation.  This is the best system I have ever used. My beard is medium density / coarse.</li>
            <li> I bought his to replace my old 3-blade ES8228 Panasonic shaver. The Arc5&#x27;s larger head is very cumbersome to use. In the end I got the same shave in the same amount of time as with my old 3-blade model. I also got red marks on my neck.</li>
            <li> the only problem is the battery won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked all of my electric razors but have never loved one until now.  I love this one!  I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and only bought this high-end model because I got a major coupon.  If I had to pay full price now, I would do it.  I had the mid-range model Panasonic ES-LT41-K before this.  This higher end model gives a very smooth shave, is not as rough on your skin, and is much faster.  Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. The charge on it is  really long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a blade since this arrived...have had other electric shavers and I stopped using them quickly  since they did a poor job...the Panasonic does the right job and does it consistently...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough information praising this razor on Amazon already.  I agree with all the positive reviews.  It is so much faster (about 2 minutes per shave) than my old Braun 8900 series, I wish I&#x27;d known about Panasonic sooner as I&#x27;d have wasted so many fewer minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, over seven years at 300 shaves/year and 2 minutes gained/shave, I would have gained 70 hours or almost 3 solid days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much are 70 hours worth to you?  Probably at least worth the difference in price between this model and the slow Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from my Arc4 when it finally stopped working and am very pleased with the Arc5. I find it provides a very close shave when used with a shave gel in the shower. It also seems to hold its charge better than the Arc4. I wish there was some of the grippy material on the front/face of the shaver, but this is a very minor quibble.</li>
            <li> In the interests of full disclosure, I received this item through Amazon Vine. However, I try extremely hard to write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price, for I think this is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.   The only other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned is the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, so I&#x27;m using that as a baseline.  This shaver is significantly more, but it&#x27;s also significantly better. The shave is closer and you can finish shaving much fast. For example, with the Norelco it would take about 12 minutes to get a full, decent shave.  According to this Panasonic, it took 3 minutes 10 seconds (the LCD tells you this!).  The \\&quot;multi-flex active pivoting head\\&quot; is really nice and allows you to shave with relative ease.  There are some great features - it is wet/dry so you can use it wherever, the LCD screen gives you detailed info about how charged it is, how long you&#x27;ve used it, etc.  You can also lock the razor so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally go off when traveling.  As others have mentioned, it comes with a small travel case (which only the razor fits in) and an AC adaptor (which is pretty large).  I&#x27;ve uploaded a couple pics under Customer Images so people can see what they look like.  One thing that is lacking, however, is some sort of base. The Norelco came with a charging base and I they should have included one with the Panasonic.  Yes, you can buy one (they tell you this in an enclosed accessories booklet), but I think, for the current $499 Amazon price, a basic charging base could have been included.  The instructions in the booklet indicate that it will take about a month for your skin to adjust to the razor.  I&#x27;ll try and update my review in a month or so to give my impressions.    Bottom line - this is a great shaver, but the price is VERY steep.  If you&#x27;re willing to spend this much money on an electric razor, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot from a shaver that, as of this writing, retails for five hundred bucks. I must say I didn&#x27;t quite get it.  Opening the box, I was surprised how little was included...the shaver, a vinyl carrying case, and the power adapter. For the price of this shaver I would have thought a hard case or at least one made of leather would have been provided. A cleaning brush and a counter stand would also have been nice.  When evaluating this shaver I compared it to the [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch Shaver]] that converted me from a blade shaver. I shaved one half of my face with the Panasonic and half with the Norelco. I alternated which side I shaved with each shaver. Tests were done with one-, two-, and three-day growths.  Just like other electric shavers, Panasonic tells you it will take up to 30 days for your face to \\&quot;get used to\\&quot; it. Panasonic also only gives you a 30 day money back guarantee so you pretty much must decide if you like before your face gets used to it. Norelco&#x27;s 45 day grace period is more reasonable. This shaver comes with a two year warranty.  While the Panasonic shaver looks top-heavy it is very balanced to hold. Like the Norelco, the Panasonic cannot be used with the charger plugged in. It only takes an hour to charge up.  I like the flexible head, the digital readout telling me how much charge remains, and the locking power switch.  Both shavers say you can use them with shaving cream, so about half the shaves were done dry and the rest after lathering up with [[ASIN:B00172WFZS Proraso]].  On multiple-day growth it pulled noticeably when used dry, but no more so than the Norelco. When used with shaving cream the shave felt very smooth. It is noticeably louder than the Norelco.   The three heads of the Norelco cover more area than the rectangular head of the Panasonic, but this isn&#x27;t really an advantage in real life. Panasonic tells you to shave with a back and forth motion, rather than the rotary motion most electric shavers tell you to use. That takes some getting used to. The head has a wide \\&quot;margin\\&quot; around it, making precision shaving a challenge. The wide large head is most noticeable when shaving under my nose or up to the edges of my sideburns, where I cannot get as close in either case.  Shaving dry, I thought both sides were similarly smooth. When shaving with shaving cream the Norelco side was noticeably smoother to me. The trimmer is a lot better than the one on the Norelco.  Cleaning: On pg.3 of the manual there is precaution about cleaning the shaver with hot water. Otherwise the only cleaning instructions are to wait for the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; indicator to come on. You use liquid soap and the \\&quot;clean mode\\&quot; to buzz it clean. The parts and accessories insert included with the shaver lists a cleaning stand and solution refills, similar to Braun&#x27;s, but the manual makes no mention of it.  The first time I took of the top off to rinse it out, I accidentally popped out one of the foils out of the head. It took several tries with Mrs. Boilermate&#x27;s small hands and greater coordination to get it back in. This is a \\&quot;minus\\&quot; in my opinion.  The Wife Test:  It was a wash. Mrs. Boilermate said the Panasonic side was smoother than the Norelco side about a third of the time, and equally smooth about a third of the time.  Conclusion:  As of this writing, for the cost of one Panasonic shaver you could buy two Norelco shavers and still have money left over. For that money you get fewer accessories and a shorter money-back guarantee. You also get a shaver that shaves well, but not twice as good as the Norelco. Given a choice, I would opt for the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have mostly used Norelco as my primary shaver, but the ones I&#x27;ve had never gave me great close shave, so I&#x27;ve had to resort to razors when I needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Panasonic shave, close shave is not a problem. In fact, it does as great job as my razors -- and the mild irritation that such close shave typically brings: that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s doing a great job. The great feature of this of course is that this supports wet shave, which is particularly useful for this shaver. You can apply shaving cream to prepare yourself for close shave. That said, even normally, a dry shave-only shaver can be annoying when you messed up your routine and you washed your face before shaving: then you&#x27;re truly out of luck. Therefore, this wet+dry option is absolutely great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, with an electric shaver, there is no worry about cuts, unlike traditional razors. Which is what makes it all the more amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that prevents me from using this is that with close shave comes loud vibration sounds. It is almost as loud as an electric hair clippers. Definitely loud enough to wake up the person next door. And living in a small apt this can be a big problem. The vibration itself is not a big deal, but the noise is very distinct. So unfortunately, this has been unable to displace my old shaver. Instead, I can only use it on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is definitely very well made. After each shave, it briefly displays how long you have been shaving. This display is absolutely useless: 1, because it is not interesting information, and 2, it stays on so briefly that by the time I&#x27;ve done checking out the shave, it&#x27;s gone. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very intuitive to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the question is would I have paid for this if it didn&#x27;t come to me for free as part of the Vine programs, knowing what I know now? I believe it is definitely worth the price if you can afford it, but it is definitely on the pricey end.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Panasonic ES8243A. It shaved almost as close as a blade with no irritation, way superior to my old Norelco. But my suitcase was stolen (shaver included) and I opted for Panasonic&#x27;s latest top of the line 5 blade model. No need for the more expensive ES-LV81-K with the cleaning unit since liquid soap and water worked just fine with my previous Panasonic. While my previous model shaved very close, this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used that shaves as close as a safety razor with identical results after skipping a day, and no irritation! And I&#x27;m talking about both neck and face -- no stubble! This is a detailed description of how I get such close results: Before going to bed, I wash my face and neck with a couple drops of USkincare Awaken Foam Cleanser and USkincare Bamboo Polish (which is an exfoliating scrub). I just use the Bamboo Polish twice a week to avoid irritating my skin. Next, I apply a couple pumps of USkincare Moisture Control Lotion with Vitamin C.  In the morning, I take a shower to moisten and hydrate my face. I don&#x27;t wash my face because the natural oils help to lubricate the skin. Then I heat some water to 180º F while my shaving brush is soaking in hot water in the sink. When my electric kettle beeps, I pour the water into my Dirty Bird Pottery shaving scuttle (original style). I spend about a minute to create a good lather with Classic Shaving Cream (unscented) and a Rooney best quality badger brush. Then I spend another minute to thoroughly lather my face. Next I shave, detach the foil head, lightly rinse out the cutters, and lather my face again. When I shave my face a second time, I shave my neck, cheeks, and chin 90º from the first shave. Shaving just once does not give me a safety razor close shave. Then I remove the foil head and briefly rinse the cutters and foil, reattach the foil head, squirt on a couple pumps of diluted Dr. Bronners liquid soap on the foil, run the shaver at the automatic 20 second high-speed cleaning mode while rinsing my face with warm water, remove the foil head, rinse the blades at the automatic 20 second high-speed cleaning mode, rinse the foil head, and let air-dry.  Next, I rinse my face with cold water to close the pores and towel dry. Then I spray USkincare Damask Rose Hydrosol Regenerating Toner on my face and neck, tap my face with my fingertips to spread the toner, and let it dry for a couple minutes. Next I use a couple pumps of USkincare Oil-Free Aloe Hydrant Gel with Green Tea and spread it across my face and neck. A good moisturizer is an important step to keep the skin moisturized.  These products are relatively expensive when compared to drug store brands, but they last quite a while because I have to use only a small amount each time. Plus they&#x27;re hypoallergenic, the shave is very close, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel any irritated afterwards. I&#x27;m not into using shaving cream that&#x27;s a petroleum derivative or other potentially harmful non-organic products on my skin. I never thought different skin care products made such a big a difference before using USkincare.  Now let&#x27;s get to a review of the shaver itself. I&#x27;ve only been using it for three months but am not concerned about the longevity since my previous Panasonic performed flawlessly for a couple years. My beard is on the thick side but my skin is sensitive. When I first began using the shaver, I was a little disappointed because my skin was slightly red for the first few days. But my skin seemed to adjust and after the first week and there was no more redness. Panasonic promotes this shaver as requiring less passes than my old model but I find little difference in the amount of passes required. The main difference is in the closeness of the shave and zero irritation. I&#x27;ve never used this shaver dry. I&#x27;ve used my previous Panasonic wet/dry shaver dry a few times and preferred it wet. Since I have a shaver that takes advantage of the benefits of wet shaving, it makes no sense to not use a high quality shaving cream. The LED light on this newer model is brighter, so I can see it clearly even in a brightly lit room. At first, the foil head seemed huge but with the pivoting feature, it feels great on my face. The shaver felt almost too light when I started using it but now I appreciate how little it weighs. Ergonomics are perfect. I don&#x27;t find myself accidentally pushing the power switch and the power lock is a clever feature for travel. And the noise level is quite low. I don&#x27;t use the trimmer feature so I can&#x27;t comment on it. The replacement cutter and foil combo sells for around $50. The cutters and foil head on my stolen Panasonic were almost ready for replacement after two years so I expect the new ones to last just as long. Panasonic recommends replacing the foil head once a year and the cutters once every other year as a general guideline.  Conclusion: Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but what you&#x27;re getting is a very high quality marvel of engineering that will give you the closest, most comfortable electric shave possible. It&#x27;s something you will use and appreciate every day or can get away with using every other day. And it will put a smile on your face. Is it worth the money? Hell yes! This shaver is flawless.   Cons: There is no stand for the razor so that it can rest vertically and take up less shelf space. It would also look nicer on a stand. Panasonic should design and offer a stand with a clip or something to hold the foil head while it&#x27;s drying after cleaning. And something like a neoprene travel case would be a nice touch rather than an ordinary vinyl case, given this is a premium shaver at a premium price.</li>
            <li> I have always used disposable razors and shaving cream.  Only once did I try an electric razor when I was around 18 years old.  At the time, I disliked it so much, maybe it was a low quality razor or I just did not give it the 30 day chance.     I&#x27;ve been using this razor exclusively now for almost three months.  At first, I wanted to dump it immediately and revert back to the disposables.  The shave was extremely patchy, and took more time per shave than using a disposable.  Partly because I had to spend so much time going over the same areas that the razor just would not cut.  To get rid of some of the patchiness I had to go with the detail trimmer over these select areas.  The thing that kept me from giving it up was that the areas it did cut, were very close and smooth.  Also, despite have a 2-3 day growth for a few shavings the pulling was minimal wet or dry, although the pulling was more when used dry.      Now after three months, the shaver performs much better after adjusting to my skin.  However, still I have some patchiness which can only be removed by the detail trimmer.  Usually on the neck, directly under the chin, but also occasionally in other random places on the cheek.  From what it looks like the shaver at times pushes some hair flat against the skin, where the razor over subsequent passes is not able to lift and cut.  Sometimes I can successfully shave these patches by rinsing my face, drying and going over it again.  However, I still often need to use the detail trimmer.  Also, the shaver has a large edge around the blades which make it almost impossible to shave the areas around my side burns, therefore I must use the detail trimmer around the entire side burn area during every shave.     My biggest issue that I still have with the shaver is that it requires a lot of cleaning, much more frequently then the sensor states.  If I wait, the razor starts to smell more than I would like. Also, when I received this through Vine, it did not include thecleaner component that it mentioned on the product description.  So the cleaning must be done manually with liquid hand soap and the cleaning cycle on the razor.      If I did not receive this through Vine, I could not imagine paying the $500, especially without the cleaner base.  But now that I have I do appreciate some of the conveniences that it brings, and would overall recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun and Norelco and this Panasonic razor gives the fastest and closest shave of all.  Also the most comfortable and easiest to clean.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased this razor after much consideration.  I am a true Braun user since the Eltron days.  I also bought a Norelco a few years back.  Not sure about the closeness, they are all about the same including the ne Panasonic.  The two trouble spots continue to be trouble spots.  The difference with the LV61 is that instead of 20 passes I only need 4 or 5 passes.  I leaves the skin very soft with less passes.  Much faster shave.  More expensive than the Braun but it will be cheaper to maintain.  The regular tap-water rinse is good. I got it at a good price and so far I am really satisfied with it.  For some one that always uses electrics this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Norelco (with the goo) and the difference is hard to imagine. This shaves as close as a blade with NO discomfort. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, but I can&#x27;t see this changing. Obviously, this shaver is expensive, but my thought was (1) I’ll use it almost every day (minimally 5-days/week) and (2) had my last electric razor for about 5-years. From a usage standpoint, assuming I get several years out of it, the price is a little easier to swallow. Add in the fact that it&#x27;s the most COMFORTABLE shave I&#x27;ve ever had by a mile, and I&#x27;m OK with the cost. The comfort factor is big...&lt;br /&gt;Shaving both wet and dry is excellent. For wet, I&#x27;ll use a brush and shaving cream - this is a ridiculously comfortable shave, and it&#x27;s as close (or closer) than a razor &amp; shaving cream…no pinching, pulling, burning, etc. And cleaning it is a piece of cake.  The dry is almost as comfortable – it’s not ONLY because of the moisturizers in the shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LV61 is the Rolls Royce of shavers… best Christmas present I ever bought myself…I highly recommend it to anyone willing to pay this much for a razor. There are probably less expensive versions of this razor – fewer bells and whistles - if the shave is anywhere near this one, go for it, but this one far surpassed my wildest expectations</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! First off, it is so quiet compared to my Braun 790. It literally hums! The shave it truly the closest I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor. Totally amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con: It seems like it is way to fragile. I feel like if I ever dropped it, I&#x27;d be out a couple of hundred $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nov 2013 - update: this thing is still kicking! However, I&#x27;m thinking that it&#x27;s time to replace the blades. It&#x27;s almost been a year and usually these heads last about 18 months, but I&#x27;m starting to notice a degradation in closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New con: you can&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s plugged in. Makes it a bit annoying when the battery runs out in the middle of a shave and you don&#x27;t have time to wait for a charge...</li>
            <li> Have always been disappointed in the past with electric shavers that I am tried. They always fell significantly short of what I hoped for. It has been 3 weeks and I am still delighted. Quick easy and fast ....but excellent results make the price worth it.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned.  It does everything I expected.  Worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a shaver that works like it should.</li>
            <li> In 50 years of shaving, this is the first electric razor that&#x27;s caused me to put down the blade.  It shaves nearly as close, dry or wet.  After trying various products in combination with this shaver over the past few weeks, I find that my old reliable Gillette fusion gel, used sparingly, provides a smooth, close shave with zero irritation.  If I&#x27;m pressed for time, a splash of Williams Lectric Shave also produces acceptable results.  I&#x27;m not sure yet whether I prefer the head locked or floating.  The lock seems to provide more precision for the tight spaces.  A word of advice: give it a week or two to perfect your shaving technique with this device.  I&#x27;m still tweaking it after nearly a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is light and easy to handle.  The one hour charge lasts more than a week, and cleanup convenient... no fiddling with little brushes.  I like the display... it tells me I&#x27;m getting an excellent shave in under 3 minutes.  The only factor yet to be judged is the longevity of the blade system.  Pending that, I can say this purchase was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the world best shaver!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;겁나 잘됨ㅋ</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. This one is my second Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> First off, let me start off by saying I am new to electric shavers.  I have tried them in the past and they have always irritated my skin and did not get a close enough shave as seen with a razor.  Seeing my last attempts were rotary, I decided to give foil a chance to see if the results were any better.  It states that changing shaving methods should be given 30 days before making a decision.  I got this yesterday and used it twice and so far I have to give it 2 thumbs up. Overall closeness is comparable to my razor except around the neckline which is still pretty close.  No irritation what so ever which surprises me.  I was expecting at least some since I have not used electric in over 10 years. The only negative I have thus far is the size of the head makes it difficult to get under the nose area. On the upside I can shave in less then 2 minutes.  Tried both dry and with shaving gel.  Shaving gel gets a little closer shave.  I am not positive the difference in price is worth having this one versus the 4 blade since I have not used that one.  If price doesn&#x27;t matter, I think you will be happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a close shave with no irritation, which for me is a first.  I&#x27;ve been through several and this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Braun foil type shavers for 20 years.  I decided to try Panasonic based on complaints about the quality of the newest Braun replacement cutters.    Dry, the shave was not any better than my more than 6 year old Braun with worn cutter.  I tried shaving in the shower with soap, and the results were outstanding.  Shaving was much easier, and my skin was much smoother afterward, and stayed smooth for much longer into the day.  Initially I had some acne breakouts on my chin where it was difficult to shave and I had to take extra passes, but that went away after a month and a half.  Since then, it has been great.    At three months, shaving effectiveness decreased drastically.  Rather than gliding across my skin and taking the stubble off all in one pass, it dragged and skipped across my skin, pulling on but not cutting the stubble.  It did eventually provide a smooth shave, but not as smooth as it used to, and with more irritation of the skin.  Under close inspection, there were two breaks in the foil where the metal separating two holes was missing.  I was also concerned that the body was taking on water while I was shaving.  Panasonic replaced the unit under warranty, and the foil has been fine for the six months since then.  The replacement unit also takes on water.    While the Panasonic was being shipped to Texas for replacement, I purchased a Braun 340S-4 wet/dry shaver for the price of a replacement Panasonic foil assembly ([[ASIN:B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S 4 Wet Shaver]]  The wet shave on the Braun is just as close as the Panasonic, and the much more compact head cuts closer to features like the nose and ears, and works better in the concave area under the back corners of the jaw.    I recently decided to use the Braun for everyday use.  It works as well or better, the foil and cutter are 1/3 the cost, and Braun&#x27;s recommended replacement interval is 18 months vs 12 months for the Panasonic.    I don&#x27;t know what to do with the Panasonicnow.  I guess I&#x27;ll keep it as a backup in case the Braun breaks.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about six months ago and absolutely love it – it gives a wonderful shave but there is one major problem: The outer metal for oil gets little tiny brakes and it&#x27;s extremely easily and once that occurs this causes Nick&#x27;s on the face regularly – replacement for oils are $60 each – I have now gone through two and six months which equates to this razor costing me 250 additional dollars a year just to maintain which is outrageous</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He just started using it and says it gives him a nice close shave, even using dry. There hasn&#x27;t been any skin irratation issues with adjusting to an electric razor. It has a easy clean  clean up just running under water and no necessary cleaning solutions required like other razors. So far he is impressed with his new shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll caveat this review by saying when it comes to shaving I&#x27;m a fanatic and perhaps a bit too compulsive. A fan of wet shaving with shave brush, high quality creams and straight edge razors. However it&#x27;s incredibly time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m a head shaver as well using a straight blade is literally a \\&quot;Bloody mess\\&quot; not to mention impossible - unless I liked looking like a Zombie  from a George Romero Movie, not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All  high end electrics have their pros and cons and of course what works well for one has poor results for another - hence gentlemen, the seemingly endless search for a great, comfortable and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I dive into the Panasonic ES-LV61 here for whatever it&#x27;s worth is a quick run down on my electrics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun 790cc - Hands down was the best electric razor I ever used. What made the Pulsonic line rock was the cutter block and foil. The unique cutting foil had what seemed an arbitrary array of different punch outs, half moons, octagons, stars , triangles and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a method to the madness as it lifted virtually every hair no matter how short or how difficult. Add the crazy sharp blades and center \\&quot;lifting strip\\&quot; and you had yourself the best electric for head shaving - at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Proctor &amp; Gamble bought out Braun, they scrapped the patented cutting block and foil and replaced it with a genereic that&#x27;s awful -  just take a look at the reviews both on and off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES-LA63-S Nanotech 4-Blade -  Great for face shaving, the 30 degree \\&quot;Arc\\&quot; in the blades and foils work extremely well. My experience was this razor was terrible for head shaving. Because of the high center arch it&#x27;s impossible to get the foils to lay flat on your scalp you only get about an inch of contact, so you end up rocking the razor back and forth as you shave. It takes forever, leaves lot&#x27;s of stubble behind along with razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco SensoTouch 3D  -  Rotary shavers have long had poor reviews in relationship to their non rotary cousins. However as Consumer Reports was impressed with complete overhaul of the SensoTouch line I had high hopes for this shaver and purchased the 1250 with cleaning station. Good on the face, fair on the neck and as for head shaving let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s the most expensive \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; on the planet. The razor is gorgeous, the cleaning station a technological marvel. But it&#x27;s soap based and unlike the alcohol based Braun Clean &amp; renew it causes buildup and doesn&#x27;t strip the blades clean. Braun still has the best cleaning system bar none. Prior to purchasing the panny ES-LV61 I had considered upgrading to the SensoTouch 1280, however both models use the same replacement - scratch that idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5  blade Panasonic ES-LV61K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about this razor and still suffering through this review, let me assure you this is one spectacular machine. Right out of the box with a dry shave it&#x27;s cuts as close and as comfortable - not to mention crazy fast, as the Braun did before it&#x27;s fall from grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  Arch isn&#x27;t as dramatic  so head shaving  is not only comfortable as all the foils float - but it&#x27;s incredibly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The center lift foil must have been inspired by the original and now defunct Braun Smart Foil, it lifts every single whisker no matter where, no matter how difficult and really does cut below the skin line for a blade quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you have to stretch your skin a bit in troublesome areas to help the 5 blade system work, it pulls the hairs with lightening speed - it&#x27;s painless by the way there&#x27;s absolutely no sense of pulling or burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a cool, comfortable straight razor, Barber shop quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Specs And Observations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Just as German Engineering is most always top shelf, Japanese knives and blades are second to none.  Panasonic Nano blades are forged steel and surgical quality sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Multi Flex pivoting 360 degree patented head just does what it promises. It conforms to every single angle and curve with a definitive hug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult areas such as under my jaw line and throat where I would need multiple passes and often a blade touch up - are history. One pass, perhaps two and the shave is baby butt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Hands down the most powerful motor there is at a whopping 14,000 CPM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Patented 5 blade cutting system - really does an amazing job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 45 minutes to an hour of shave time per charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 5 minute quick charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Crazy fast 14,000 cycles per minute (cpm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Linear motor drive - surpasses rotary and pulse driven razors by miles. It&#x27;s rapid fire fast and incredibly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Micro thin foil is pretty amazing - but delicate and easy to tear. This is easy to avoid if you don&#x27;t add pressure. Much like a straight blade or safety razor, let the weight do most of the work. The inclination to press hard is natural but try to avoid undue pressure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Can be used wet or dry. With creams or gels, perfect for a shave in the shower as it&#x27;s 100% water proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Very good trimmer albeit hard to see due to the size of the head - but all electrics seem to have this issue to some degree. No sane person buys a razor for the trimmer, it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still reading this Novel my hunch is your deciding between this razor and the ES -V81. I know I was. The poor reviews of the cleaning station, the soap based cleaning cartridges are problematic in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both razors have an effortless sonic mode for manual cleaning. A little soap, press the button for sonic under warm water (never hot!) pop the foil off, rinse, viola it&#x27;s like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-VI is black and has a few, I&#x27;m too old to say it but \\&quot;cool\\&quot; LED bells and whistles. Is it worth the extra $100 bucks - not for me, cleaning systems come with their own set of problems and added expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a lighter note, the ES-LV61  has a gorgeous aesthetic. The razor is a deep Indigo blue with metallic  navy accents and a black rubber back grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly balanced and surprisingly light and quiet - it&#x27;s form meets function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s true that it takes between 3 and 4 weeks for your skin to get used to the razor, and the razors float system to get used to the contours of your face (and or noggin&#x27;) the first shave from this bad boy was quite remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was this impressive from the get go - it should get even better in time. The box comes with the razor of course, a manual, charger, nice quality soft carrying case and a plastic head protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is warranted for two years  -  make sure you register on line or mail in the registration card&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My past reviews of other electrics are somewhat more critical than complimentary. Not the case here. Elegant, efficient and powerful - this is the first electric I&#x27;ve used over the past 30 some odd years that does indeed deliver a comfortable, blade quality close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As both my skin and the float system of the head have gotten used to each other - the shave has improved. Cleaining is a snap and re-confirms how glad I am to have passed on the cleaning station. I have always thought of using an electric for a wet shave to be somewhat of a gimmick - well I&#x27;ve given it a few tries and the expperiance is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In tradional, old school wet shaving there&#x27;s a reason for the hot towels, the shaving brush and the rich dense creams. They all serve to break down and soften the whiskers which are made of Keratin which is quite dense and found in the enamel of our teeth as well. Soften the Keratin get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using King Of Shaves gel and the results have been outstanding. I still prefer the time saving elements of a dry shave but will tell you that a wet shave is even closer and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** A FEW TIPS THAT MAY HELP****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your going to spend this much on a shaver and wet shave, even once in a while. I would urge you to never buy a can of edge, or for that matter most any shave cream that&#x27;s sold in super markets and drug stores. An exception would be the before mentioned King of Shaves. An upgrade from KOS would be the British - Taylors Of Old Bond Street, one of the densist creams there are, the formula hasn&#x27;t changed in hundreds of years - it&#x27;s a remarkable product. It may seem expensive but a small tub will last you a year, the scents are superb and fade quickly. The best prices for either are big surprise, on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Cleaning you new Panny - To get all the oil build up off the tiny nano blades soapy water isn&#x27;t going to do it. So I figured if Dawn dishwashing liquid was good enough to clean up the horrific Valdez oil spill - not to mention save the lives of countless wild life it was worth a shot and it just so happened we had it in the house.

All you need is a drop, press for sonic clean (keep the foil on) rinse and viola it&#x27;s a brand new day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still hands down the best electric I have ever used it trumps my now defunct Porsche razor which was twice the price. Owch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.me, cleaning systems come with their own set of problems and added expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a lighter note, the ES-LV61  has a gorgeous aesthetic. The razor is a deep Indigo blue with metallic  navy accents and a black rubber back grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly balanced and surprisingly light and quiet - it&#x27;s form meets function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s true that it takes between 3 and 4 weeks for your skin to get used to the razor, and the razors float system to get used to the contours of your face (and or noggin&#x27;) the first shave from this bad boy was quite remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was this impressive from the get go - it should get even better in time. The box comes with the razor of course, a manual, charger, nice quality soft carrying case and a plastic head protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is warranted for two years  -  make sure you register on line or mail in the registration card&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My past reviews of other electrics are somewhat more critical than complimentary. Not the case here. Elegant, efficient and powerful - this is the first electric I&#x27;ve used over the past 30 some odd years that does indeed deliver a comfortable, blade quality close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As both my skin and the float system of the head have gotten used to each other - the shave has improved. Cleaining is a snap and re-confirms how glad I am to have passed on the cleaning station. I have always thought of using an electric for a wet shave to be somewhat of a gimmick - well I&#x27;ve given it a few tries and the expperiance is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In tradional, old school wet shaving there&#x27;s a reason for the hot towels, the shaving brush and the rich dense creams. They all serve to break down and soften the whiskers which are made of Keratin which is quite dense and found in the enamel of our teeth as well. Soften the Keratin get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using King Of Shaves gel and the results have been outstanding.

            <li> Purchased this about one-half year ago.  It replaced another Panasonic razor that was in need of new foil and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a great fan of Panasonic razors and have been one for several years.  I particularly like being able to shave in the shower.  The only lubricant I use is the water from the shower.  The shaves are always smooth and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best Panasonic I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s certainly the quietest.  Notwithstanding that it has 5 blades, it seems to have less drag, or certainly no more drag, the other Panasonics I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t bother getting the model with what Panasonic calls the \\&quot;vortex cleaning system.\\&quot;  I had a different model with this system and didn&#x27;t think much of it.  The base the system gets filled with gunk which must be cleaned.  It&#x27;s just as easy to clean the razor itself.  Just remove the foil blade cover after every few shaves and rinse the foil and blades.  When it looks like it needs it, clean the razor under running water using an old toothbrush for cleaning.  With the aforementioned said, I will say that the vortex system has one advantage.  It provides a docking station for the razor and the station also charges the razor.  That&#x27;s convenient and I wish Panasonic would provide a simple stand for the razor, without the cleaning mechanism but with the charging function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/06 2013 ( a problem with the shaver but great--no, make that outstanding--customer service).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after I wrote the above review the shaver quit working.  The battery showed a full charge but the motor would not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent Panasonic an email describing the problem.  The next day, I received a response by email.  I was assigned a case number and asked to return the shaver and related items, including the purchase invoice, to Panasonic.  Fortunately, I had purchased the shaver on Amazon and still had the purchase acknowledgment in my email files.  I sent the unit, related items and invoice toPanasonic&#x27;s Texas location via FedEx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after the shaver was received in Texas (I know the date from FedEx&#x27;s acknowledgment), I received a call from Panasonic.  The caller advised me that the shaver needed to be replaced but that they had no inventory and did not anticipate receiving any.  So, instead, they were going to send me a full refund of my purchase price.  Just a few days later, I received a refund check in the mail, for the full amount of the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a shame that the shaver broke.  As mentioned in my initial review, I really liked it.  The goods news is how Panasonic handled the problem.  Panasonic stands behind its products.  Their customer service is excellent--quick, responsive and straight-forward.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shaver after reading its excellent review. I had been using Philips SensoTouch 3D 1260X for about 2 years before, and was more or less satisfied with it. It would shave well, but never as close as a razor. I have a heavy beard and would always get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at around 4 pm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this has changed since I bought the Panasonic ES-LV61A. Although I&#x27;ve used it only for a month now, already it is giving me shave that Philips never did in 2 years. This is the first shaver about which I can safely say: yes, it DOES shave as close or closer than a Gillette. No questions. It handles all areas excellently.. neck, jowls, chin. Every place is baby smooth after shave. I tried shaving with gel at first, but then settled on dry. For me, dry gives better results. No hair falls out of the shaver.. which was an issue with Philips. All hair are contained within the head. Cleaning is very simple and effective, thanks to the hyper vibrate feature of the cutting blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short.. I&#x27;m getting the best shaves ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not many. My biggest gripe is the short shave time per charge. On a full charge, I get maybe 4-5 shaves only. My fully charged Philips gave me more than 10. Second problem is with flat lying hair. Inspite of 5 blades, the shave would occasionally leave out some hair which are lying flat against the skin. As this shaver is only 1 month old, I&#x27;m still trying out different angles to pick up that hair. Let&#x27;s see how it will be a couple of months from now.</li>
            <li> After waiting an eternity for the price of the Panasonic LV-61 to drop (it never really did!), I took the plunge and purchased one instead of replacing the expired foil and cutter of my trusty old Panasonic ES8249K. I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Panasonic Wet/Dry Shavers over the years as I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the ability to shave in the shower with their shavers. The LV61 is, hands down, the best of the Panasonics I&#x27;ve ever owned. (I&#x27;ve had an ES8249K, an ES8243A, an ES8109S and also an ES-LA63, which I returned after two weeks as it was just too bulky, heavy and caused my hand to cramp.) With the new LV-61, I get an even closer shave than any of the prior models and suffer absolutely no irritation whatsoever. I thought the large head on the LV-61 would be a problem, but the shaver is light, is very comfortable to hold and the head size actually feels good against my head, face and neck. That&#x27;s right, this shaver is great for head shaving too, and the larger head actually makes the shaver ideal for this purpose. I&#x27;m currently using this shaver with a single pump of Kiss My Face Moisture Shave mixed with a little water for the face, and a single pump for the head as well. I get a nice, smooth, irritation free shave with this combination of shaver and shave cream.  LONG-TERM UPDATE: After about a year and a half of owning this shaver, I noticed the screen completely stopped working. The rest of the shaver worked just fine, but I could no longer tell how much charge was left in the shaver. As I approached the two-year mark on the Panasonic warranty, I contacted Panasonic and sent them the shaver for repair/replacement. About a week-and-a-half later I received a brand spanking new ES-LV61 via UPS! Panasonics may be a bit pricey, but the warranty support more than enough makes up for it. Hmmm. . . I wonder if the replacement shaver is also covered by a fresh 2 year warranty? :- )I then turn on the shaver&#x27;s 20-second ultrasonic cleaning mode. Once the cleaning cycle has finished, I remove the shaver from the mug and allow any remaining shower cleaner to drain into the mug. I then remove the shaver head and give the shaver and head a few shakes to remove any excess cleaner. I then re-attach the shaver head and set the shaver down to air dry. (Alternatively, you could leave the head detached from the shaver to air dry if you have the space to do so.) When I go to shave again, I rinse the shaver under running water just to remove any residual shower cleaner immediately prior to shaving.  I&#x27;ve found that this method completely eliminates the formation of soap scum that would normally develop on the shaver parts over time from shaving cream and liquid soap. It also helps to keep the shaver in like new condition and smelling quite nice. I actually prefer this cleaning method to the Panasonic Vortex I&#x27;ve had with some of the older models I&#x27;ve owned. You&#x27;ll have to change your mug of shower cleaner every now and then, but a bottle of shower cleaner is a lot cheaper and will last a heck of a lot longer than those Vortex cleaning cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WET SHAVING PRODUCT ADVICE HERE: I&#x27;ve used a number of different shaving creams, gels, solutions over my years of wet shaving with Panasonic shavers. I&#x27;ve tried Billy Jealousy Hydroplane, Jack Black Beard Lube, Aveeno shaving gel, various Edge and Gillette shaving gels, Noxzema Sensitive Skin shaving foam, Barbasol, Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, etc. The one I&#x27;m using exclusively now is Bump Stopper Medicated Shaving Gel by a company called High Time, which I normally get at my local Walgreens but I&#x27;ve seen is available here on Amazon ([[ASIN:B003NGN3A2 Bump Stopper Shaving Gel w/Aloe Vera &amp; Tea Tree Oil, 5.3 oz]]). Once applied to the skin along with a little water, this shaving gel is clear and low foaming. It provides a very, very slick surface over which your shaver can glide. It also does not \\&quot;gumup\\&quot;/clog the shaver like most of the previously mentioned products, does not rinse/fall off of the surface of your skin, and gets even slicker with the application of a little water. Since it&#x27;s clear, you can also see the spots you may have missed while shaving. It also has aloe and tea tree oil which are supposed to be good at reducing irritation and preventing the formation of shaving bumps. This is a great product and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough for wet shaving with an electric shaver. It&#x27;s also a fraction of the price of many of the previously mentioned products. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> We were very impressed with this shaver. It is the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Its a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great razor, works like a manual shaver and looks great, the battery give me about ten days.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaver. Had a 2 year old Braun 760 cc. Matter of fact, the one before that one was a Braun too. This last one was good but it just caused way too much irritation. Had to go over the same spots a couple of times to get it smooth. I was thinking about going with the newer Braun model, but I saw the great reviews on this one and gave it a shot. It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it. After my first shave with this I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I was done shaving. I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same spot (not as many times anyway) as my old Braun did. Another great plus is that there are no more cleaner cartridges to buy. Just run it under water and it&#x27;s clean. Couldn&#x27;t be simpler. If your on the fence between this on and a Braun I&#x27;d definitely  go with this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver to date.  I have used other electric shavers for many years, but I never got a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after 3.5 years of great service from the earlier gen LA93 Arc4. That one still works, but the rechargeable battery went kaput. I did replace with an OEM battery, but it just didn&#x27;t hold charge like the original, so I finally had to retire it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Arc5 is great. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced more is better, but it has a few other minor improvements that make it nice. For example, the lock function is now a rotating ring lock around the power button, unlike the prev model where it was a simple slide up/down button. When I traveled with the old one, every so often it would get jostled and unlock and the power button would get pressed and use up all the battery. Another nice change is in cleaning. When you remove the outerfoil apparatus, the innards are all flat with the two inner blades protruding up. This makes cleaning A LOT easier as opposed to prev model where it was not a flat surface and instead filled with nooks and crannies for stuff to accummulate. The swivel head is still annoying to me, so I still keep it in locked mode permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2015-07-23, Well after a year of use, I finally replaced the inner blades. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m always surprised at how brand new it feels, and I&#x27;m not sure why I wait so long to replace blades, but yes, ultra clean, smooth shave. However, I only replaced the inner blades this time instead of the inner blades + outer foil. This decision was purely driven by cost. Inner blades only &#x3D; $20. Inner + outer foil &#x3D; $70. And the inner blades do the majority of the work anyway.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace a shaver tried this one and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. Beats the norelco 1250 I replaced hands down.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for 35 years and the Panasonic ES-LV61-A $268.00 gives a closer shave than any of the other 17 shavers I have tested. Even better than my ES-LA63-S $129.00. The difference is the new Lift-Tech foil. It rivals the shave of a blade without the potential abrasions. The trick is to use less pressure than one would normally think to use. I know this seems counter intuitive, however, I read this in the Panasonic Brochure and it works. The lighter the pressure on your face and neck, the closer the shave. Also, this is definitely the shaver to use if you are prone to razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the ES-LV61-A really does have 5 Blades. Two are attached directly to the shaver. Three more are driven by two clips that are attached directly to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I travel a lot, I have two of them. One is always charged and ready to go when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the Panasonic Wet\Dry Shavers are completely WaterProof. Yes, they work extremely well in the shower. Panasonic probably realizes people can make thoughtless mistakes while waking up and sooner or later someone is going to plug one in and attempt to use it while in the shower. The LV61 is designed to NOT operate while plugged into an electrical socket. I believe Panasonic wishes to keep people safe regardless of circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is simple. Pop off the cover, and just rinse everything with hot water. Because I use the shaver in the shower with a shave gel; once a month I soak the LV61 in Tilex Soap Scum Remover (now sold as a diluted Tilex Bathroom Cleaner) for 20 minutes. Rinses to look like new and is sanitized.  Yes, the Panasonic LV61 is COMPLETELY WATERPROOF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Aveeno Men&#x27;s Shave Gel, Fragrance Free, 7 oz available from Amazon. [[ASIN:B00B6A8JQA Aveeno Men&#x27;s Shave Gel, Fragrance Free, 7 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One CAUTION: Be careful when touching the foils when they are detached from the shaver and are not supported by the underlying blades. Even the slightest crease or dent in a foil can adversely affect the performance of the whole foil \ blade assembly.lying blades. Even the slightest crease or dent in a foil can adversely affect the performance of the whole foil \ blade assembly.</li>
            <li> I have had other Panasonic models before but this one is just incredible, it is almost as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> Considering this is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver, this is probably one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made when it comes to grooming needs! Will never go back to a regular, manual shaver ever again! I don&#x27;t get nicks, and it shaves just as close as a manual shaver. I could have gone for a much cheaper device, but this device got tons of great reviews, so I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product for a clean shave. Was using Panasonic ES-LA93K shaver a four blade. But the ES-LV61-A is definitely a superior over that model. This one has a five blade system thus giving a very close shave and also much quieter noise and vibration wise. I am loving it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor a few times now and have to say it does a decent job.  I really appreciate the overall battery life as I&#x27;m able to get about an hours worth of shaving time out of one charge and the recharge time is pretty quick.  The razor itself is quick and doesn&#x27;t yank hairs out of your face like some other electric razors will do.  It does have issues with certain spots, like around the neck and adams apple, like pretty much all electric razors do.  The display is really helpful as it gives you the percent of battery life remaining as well as how many minutes and seconds you most recently used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really aren&#x27;t many negative things that I can  say.  I guess I wish the razor came with a brush to help with cleaning, but luckily I had one from my previous razor that makes cleanup super quick.  Also, I wish the travel bag that was included was a little bigger.  The razor fits fine, but good luck with the power cord if you&#x27;re going on a long trip.  The replacement blades are a little pricey, but I haven&#x27;t had the razor long enough to have to purchase yet.  I can only hope that they go on sale before I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this is probably the best electric razor you can get if you&#x27;re willing to spend the money.  If you can buy it as a lightning deal like I did then buying  this razor is pretty much a no-brainer.  Yeah the replacement blades are pricey too, but at least I&#x27;m able to find replacement blades unlike some other brand razor that shall remain nameless.</li>
            <li> By far the most superior electric foil razor I have ever used. It was comfortable on my face from the first day of use. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have had it for 6 weeks now and It still irritates my face a bit and even make me bleed a tiny bit sometimes but other than that it is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I had the Panasonic ES8103S Wet/Dry for 5 years and never replaced the blades or anything -AWESOME Shaver!!! Loved it! But it finally died so I bought this one because I thought if it&#x27;s more expensive it might be better. It is a closer shave but still irritates my face a little bit, not bad, I can live with it. It&#x27;s worth the close shave. As close as a razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver did an excellent job on the sideburns but irritate the face under the eyes badly. It did a fair job on the neck but could not handle the jaw line. Te Braun Series 7 790 did a much better jobin these areas, but this shaver required repeated passes to do a complete job, one which was handled easily by the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and for the price it should excel in that department. It lacks in some areas, enough to take it down a star in terms of value for the money but rest assured that when it comes to the sole purpose of shaving, this is the shaver to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- This thing cuts way closer than my rotary shavers with less irritation and it cuts closer and faster than my Braun series 5 and 7 foil shaver&lt;br /&gt;- Many articulation points on the shaver head and the foils independently move as well, despite how oversized the head of the shaver is – I can still maneuver in on all of the tough problem areas like the chin, top lip under the nose, and jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;- Recharges quickly&lt;br /&gt;- LED screen is useful, keeping track of shave time and battery life&lt;br /&gt;- Nice rubbery grip, though I haven&#x27;t used it for wet shaving&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight and balanced, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and plasticky like some other shavers&lt;br /&gt;- travel lock – necessary since the case doesn&#x27;t provide space for the charger and I&#x27;ve been on trips where I&#x27;ve worn the battery down on the trip&lt;br /&gt;- fast, cut my shaving time down in half and come out with a closer shave&lt;br /&gt;- no ridiculous sanitizing stand, cleaning is simple and straightforward&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- No charging stand – for the cost, it should come with a charging stand. Having things lying around the counter just bugs me.&lt;br /&gt;- Bright blue LED light, stays on while charging – only a problem if you keep it in your room while you&#x27;re trying to sleep&lt;br /&gt;- the travel case is a bit cheap considering the cost of the razor – they could have thrown in a sturdier, more form fitting plushier case – it&#x27;s not bad but it isn&#x27;t great and for someone who travels a lot, a well cushioned case is a must&lt;br /&gt;- of the four other electric razors I own, this one is pretty loud and it has a different tone to the buzz that I find more noticeable... may acclimate to this in time&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer is an afterthought, it&#x27;s small and it doesn&#x27;t extend far enough away from the head of the razor – it works, but you&#x27;ll find better trimmer design in Braun 5-7 series razors&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t use the razor when it&#x27;s plugged in, kind of annoying when you aren&#x27;t paying attention and you run out of power – luckily it quick-charges in emergencies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is my first Panasonic electric shaver and I&#x27;m impressed, most of my cons are also problems with other razors – it&#x27;s a bit nit-picky, but considering the higher cost I hold it to a higher standard. If you&#x27;re in the market for a shaver that cuts close and quick, the Panasonic is easily the best in that area – only a razor blade will get you a closer shave but with the time I save in the morning from having to shave with a blade and irritating my skin, the cost of the Panasonic is worth it to me. You pay more for it and the extras aren&#x27;t all that impressive, but when it comes down to shaving your face – this easily beats out what I own from Braun, Norelco, and Wahl.</li>
            <li> Really close shave but not so good a difficult to reach areas due to the size of the head</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. Shaving everyday with a razor is completely torturous for me, therefore I turned to electric. My first electric shaver was an Arc 4 from Panasonic. Great shaver, but sometimes caused irritation. I then purchased a sensotouch 2D,and was very unimpressed. I upgraded from the Nerelco Sensotouch 2D to a Nerelco sensotouch 3D, again, very unimpressed. I became tired of wasting money and time on lesser shavers and spent top dollar for this Arc 5, and I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am. What a fantastic shaver. I&#x27;ll keep it simple, it&#x27;s expensive, but if you have any apprehensions about the quality of the shave, rest assured, it&#x27;s the best on the market. Buy with confidence. Ditch the cheap shavers, ditch the razors, get the Arc V.</li>
            <li> I have used every generation of Panasonic shaver for the past &amp;#62;20 years, and I upgraded to this model from their last generation Arc 4 model.  This ES-LV61 shaver is identical to the ES-LV81 shaver except for color and the Vortex Cleaning System, the stand which cleans and charges the razor.  I have used the previous generations of the cleaning stand, and grew tired of purchasing the detergent/cleaning cartridges.  Also, I found that I could clean the razor just as well myself by applying some liquid soap and running it under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting on to the shave - this shaver has 5 blades compared with the prior generation&#x27;s 4 blades.  There are two blades visible attached to the shaver body when you remove the foil, and three additional blades are contained within the foil assembly itself that are powered by prongs visible on the shaver on either side of the two blades attached to the shaver body.  Due to the additional blade, the head is larger than the prior generation of 4 blade shavers, but not so large that it can&#x27;t be maneuvered well under your nose and around the contours of your face due to the multidirectional swiveling head (not just side to side, but also forwards and backwards as well as in and out).  This shaver trims my facial hair more closely than my prior 4 blade Panasonic shaver, almost equal to a wet shave with a real blade.  It takes a few hours before my hair grows out to appear the way it did immediately after shaving with my prior 4 blade Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twist lock feature on the power switch prevents accidental operation when traveling (packed in a suitcase or your gym bag).  The charger plugs into the bottom of the shaver, 1 hour charge time.  I don&#x27;t miss the lack of a charging stand with this model.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very expensive, but I wanted the best and I love Panasonic equipment so I bought it. It was replacing my old Panasonic shaver ES8003, which I had for ten years and was excellent. I had to replace it because the motor finally died (not the batteries). I replaced the battery twice in it and it stood the test of time. Now for my review. Spending this much money I think you should at least get a stand up charger base! That&#x27;s what my old one had. With tis shaver you get a cheap plug that goes into the bottom. It&#x27;s ok, but like I said for this much money they should have a better system. As for the shaver itself, it does shave well. I have had it for a while now and really don&#x27;t have any complaints. The shaver head is very large and almost seems like overkill. The head is also a little awkward to remove in order to empty. I have dropped it in the garbage accidently a few times. The trimmer in the back does work well. If I had to purchase again I would definately look for a better charging set up and I don&#x27;t think there is a need for so many blades. Also I believe that the replacement blades and head are very expensive. Gave it a three star rating.</li>
            <li> Brought the Panasonic ES-LV61 a few days ago and the shave it gives is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 43 year old male with olive skin.  I have used normal packet razors and metal razors, have tried a Phillips but was too rough and still left small stubble.  For the last few years I have used the latest Braun Pulsonic&#x27;s and always updated.  The Braun was good but not perfect and was as good as I thought I could get UNTIL this Panasonic came along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it is running the Braun sounds a little raspier compared to the Panasonic which has a higher frequency vibration which is due to the higher frequency of razor movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some review sites have carried on with looks of the razors in comparisons etc but I reckon if it does the job well for which it was designed that should be the primary yardstick and this one certainly measures up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible improvements - The small cleaning brush needs a small compartment on the outside of the carrying case so it doesn&#x27;t get lost.  The power plug is a little wide so if you plug it into a duel socket wall plug it will need to go into the left side otherwise you will lose the ability to use the other socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - The shave is exceptionally close, with the Braun Pulsonic you could still feel the stubble beginning to come through and by lunch/evening you could feel it on your face and there was always patches that you could feel had not shaved as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LV61 seems to cut the stubble below the skin level and the result is a baby skin smooth shave which still feels smooth by lunch.  No rashes or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt in my mind after experiencing the shave that I now get from this Panasonic ES-LV61 that it is now undoubtably the current benchmark for Electric shavers in so far as the quality of shave that it provides.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition and 2 days early. I have had several Pannys but this shaves the closest by far. It&#x27;s over sized shaving head covers a lot of skin on the face and on my head. They are the best for head shaving that I&#x27;ve found.    [...]      I&#x27;m sold on them... However for an electric shaver with a $500 MSRP many customers would expect a leather case and a cleaning brush to be included...if they were included I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a very close shave.  Even though the head is large the front to back and side to side pivots track face contours will.  The shaver is quieter than the last Panasonic shaver I owned.  I have been using it for about 2 months and am glad I got it</li>
            <li> Bulky and razors do not last, a month tops. Difficult to get close shave,  I feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor!  I have a fairly thick beard and normally shave four or five times a week.  I use the Panasonic ES-LV61 wet with a shaving cream that I have been using for about 15 years (from the Body Shop...awesome!).  Prior to using this I would shave with a Gillette Fusion blade razor, but after three or four days of shaving I would find it difficult to get a smooth shave and my skin would start to get irritated.  My routine was to shave down, reapply shaving cream and shave up against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shot on this one and I have been pleasantly surprised by how close it gets everyday.  So even when shaving for 5 days in a row, it still gives me a very close shave with practically no irritation.  And, it saves me a few minutes somehow...it&#x27;s quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two shortcomings I see are: 1) the stubble on my neck can be a little difficult to remove and once the shaving cream is removed, I notice some spots I missed...but I think many guys have this issue; and 2) the battery needs charging every 10 shaves or so, which isn&#x27;t bad, but I wish it lasted longer.  This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you could use it with the charging cord plugged in...but you can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric razors have come a long way!  If you can afford it, I think this one is great</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned a Braun 3 series for 5 years and never really felt the shaving performance was that great, especially when compared to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally decided it was time for a new one... I spent a lot of time researching and found myself ultimately going back and forth between the Braun 7 series and the Panasonic LV61. What finally made me make the decision was the fact that the Panasonic was the #1 on virtually every list I came across and all of the stellar reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write this review having just shaved for the first time with the LV61 and let me tell you it is the smoothest shave I have ever had in my life (Including razor) !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I don&#x27;t grow anywhere near a &amp;#34;Grizzly Adams&amp;#34; style beard, but I do have thick-coarse hair that does grow into a fully noticeable beard and goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as for the shaving performance, It&#x27;s been 4 days since my last shave and my face is literally baby-butt smooth! under my jaw and neck could have been a bit better (Still very smooth), and would be, had I spent more time shaving those areas... But for a lazy Saturday it was good enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review will help make an easier choice for those who are looking to take the plunge for a GREAT shaving experience!</li>
            <li> It is broken inner holder so i send repair shop at McAllen exchange center.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, I&#x27;ve had many other shavers in the past but never really give too much thought with foil shaver but this one surprised me because it shave so much closer and better than all my previous shaver.  Worth the money and Panasonic makes quality products and not just relying on the name brand like the other famous Japanese company that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Everything &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; makes is junk with overpricing and betting people will buy based on branding.&lt;br /&gt;Be an informed shopper and consumer, buy quality and buy Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Great razor, bought it for my Dad and he loves it.  comfy shave</li>
            <li> Like it, much better than my previous Philips 2D, because the 2D never clean up my neck area.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shaver. I had a Braun series 7 and this one is much faster, smoother, and cuts deeper all kinds of hair since day 1. I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this shaver. Now to find the cheapest replacement inner blade and outer foil sets.I never have problems when I deal with Amazon</li>
            <li> Really nice, I had a previous model with 3 cutters, but this is much better.</li>
            <li> First Panasonic shaver purchased after Philips and Braun. So far, so good. Still getting use to foil (vs rotary) shaver again. Under jaw still tricky but following recommendations to try for a month to make definite comment. Washing is easy and they recommend a bit of liquid hand soap to clean. Makes a difference from Philips and Braun which recommend using their expensive cleaning modules and cleaning liquid. Soap does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Does shave closr then previous rotary shaver and happy so far.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of mostly electric shavers this is the best so far. My previous Panasonic was two years old and had one blade change but never worked this well.</li>
            <li> best shaver on the market bar none. easy use, easy to charge. I use it only with shaving cream and hot water, does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> I finally went for it. I hesitated due to its price. I now have one regret: not to have done it earlier. Saving 10 solid minutes (maybe more) of shaving every single day for a better result, is indeed worth the price I paid for it. It is a marvel of engineering and works wonder.</li>
            <li> my last Panasonic was good I had it for 8 years this one cuts better, the battery charge not as long but you can plug it in an use it if you need to.</li>
            <li> I reviewed many razors and this one is great.  Price is high.  I am considering using a signal edge razor to see if I can achieve the same close shave. My barber believes that to be the case.  You may want to tray a signal razor first as well and save some money.</li>
            <li> i love it. it&#x27;s perfect i like it.the price is good. This is a very good shopping experience. very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never given a gift like this before Christmas and all, but my honey hates shaving and let&#x27;s face it although my guy is handsome shaved or not even he must look his best and Adam loves it! That make me happy every time he uses it I hope he will always think of me as I always think of him, too!</li>
            <li> After near a month use, I would said this is best electric shavers I ever have! Wet shaving is very enjoyable. Price is higher then other shavers but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Me, being in the U.S. Navy, I have to shave daily no matter what or how, it needs to be done. I have tried many other products from safety razors, cheap electric razors and of course the pro glide, mach 3 etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and coarse hair. So shaving everyday with your typical razor felt like i was scraping the skin off of my face every morning and resulting in painful irritation. Using the cheaper electric shavers, with &amp;#34;Satisfaction Guarantee&amp;#34; on the box did the job, as shaving my face obviously, but they were still uncomfortable and gave me irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After experimenting with different shaving techniques and products, I figured, this isn&#x27;t getting any better with the less expensive stuff. I&#x27;ll go all out and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for me, paying this type of money for something to shave my face with seemed completely unreasonable and useless. BUT, after researching, this is one of the best electric shavers on the market in terms of affordability and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this about 2 months ago here at Naval Station Great Lakes, and I have to say that this is the most comfortable and reliable shaving device I have EVER used. It cuts as close as a razor does without the painful scraping skin feeling, it pivots to get a closer shave around my jawline and neck, its very easy to clean, it leaves absolutely no irritation from day 1. I can honestly say I never thought that increasing my pay out for a shaving device would actually help, but it really, really did. I don&#x27;t know if I will ever buy another shaving device because of how much I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone in the same boat as I am.&lt;br /&gt;If you can trust anyone, you can surely trust a Sailor about this.</li>
            <li> YES, Emphatically YES - I looked &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; of the &amp;#34;Others&amp;#34; who &amp;#34;rated&amp;#34; this &amp;#34;Panasonic ES-LV61-A&amp;#34;, THEN I &amp;#34;USED&amp;#34; IT an&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. All the &amp;#34;Good&amp;#34; ratings were &amp;#34;5***** on &amp;#34;My&amp;#34; Panasonic Shaver!&lt;br /&gt;2. All the &amp;#34;Bad&amp;#34; ratings were &amp;#34;NEVER&amp;#34; on &amp;#34;My&amp;#34; Shaver!&lt;br /&gt;3. All I can say is - NO &amp;#34;OTHER&amp;#34; SHAVER CAN COMPETE WITH &amp;#34;THIS&amp;#34; - as of this date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Old Mountain Goat</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty good! I would recommend it. Sometimes it does not shave 100% but it takes time to get use to your face. It takes less than 4 minutes to shave.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic ES8066 has lasted me for years, it still works, but has had a few falls, but it is built like a tank.  Instead of searching around for replacement parts, I decided to get a new one recently and went for this.  I pretty much keep my beard most of the year and just shave under the neck daily.  This thing does an outstanding job dry shaving and it feels as close as a blade.  I have a pretty think beard and the hair grows fast (though I swear, as the old Panasonic got older, some of the foil wore off and turned patches of hair grey).  It is a huge improvement over the ES8066.  As warm weather approaches, I will take the entire beard off for a while and post back.  I feel Panasonic shavers are the best available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one feels better in the hands than my old one.  Has a faster linear motor.  Is a little louder, but cleans up very easy.  I don&#x27;t know if it could survive a fall off the counter top so I will be a little more careful.  Much better shave than my dad&#x27;s expensive Norelco SensoTouch that I borrowed once.</li>
            <li> I used this with Jack Black Shave Lube (Over sink, not shower) and got a shave that was as close as the blade I usually use (Gilette Fusion). I was blown away. Also, the beard lube cleaned off easily under running water. My old Braun5775 is going to the trash.</li>
            <li> Whilst this is the first time I have used a foil shaver, I am amazed at how effective this shaver is. I have very sensitive skin and now I have no problems with shaving rash!</li>
            <li> it says it all above! It has saved me from soap and water, I had a battery powered shaver before but was to slow, not enough umph!&lt;br /&gt;This has it all.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Panasonic ES8092NC purchased 10 years ago.  While my old shaver still gave a close shave, it took several times going over the same place.  I shave my scalp and face about every two days, so it usually takes about 20 minutes a shave.  With the Arc5 I am able to cut the shaving time in half, it shaves just as close and no stray hairs are left.  The battery power is also good.  I can get about 4 scalp and face shaves on a single charge.  If you have an old shaver and you are curious if getting a new one is worth it, I can confirm that this one is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Pro: high-frequency seems to do a good job cutting whiskers without pulling: consistently clean, close shave&lt;br /&gt;Con: short battery life: drains down in a few days, even if not used; a little disappointing for the cost</li>
            <li> Great shaver, lousy accessories. If you can get it on sale it&#x27;s worth the price. Easy to operate, cleans up manually so you don&#x27;t need to blow $$$$ on extra cartridges, fast charge and enough battery life to easily last 5-6 long, thorough shaves at a minimum. The battery counter is reasonably accurate, cleaning is simple enough. It was difficult to come from a Norelco, which I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years. Philips has taken the brand down a notch and you&#x27;ll need to spend more than I did for this shaver to get something comparable and it takes longer to shave with the rotary.  On the negative - comes with zero accessories other than the AC adapter and the bag, which is only large enough for the shaver. That&#x27;s rather pathetic for a shaver whose sale price is usually no less than $200 cut rate. You&#x27;d expect at least a cleaning brush or a stand for the shaver. Nothing. Bare box. At least the replacement blades are supposed to be reasonably priced ($50 for an entire set of replacement foils and blades) and I&#x27;m glad that shaving is a better experience.  It doesn&#x27;t do a great job with longer hair. The Norelco was slightly better. But if I shaved after a 2-3 period, this shaver did a very good job at nailing down the growth to a smooth shave with minimal burn, better than the norelco. The trimmer is mediocre and short but it does work. I do like the ability to lock and open the head so it will move up and down or stay locked in one position.  The charging cord has a bit of a base that is a few inches. Nothing too huge but it&#x27;s not just a small cord that can be rolled up and put in a bag. It is also proprietary and can only be replaced with a Panasonic part.  Why five stars? Because it&#x27;s a great shaver. 4.5 if there was a 1/2 star rating but the fact that it does a great job is what matters most.  EDIT: It&#x27;s a year later. Paying almost $200 for this shaver makes me realize how foolish it was. Fool me once Panasonic, shame on you. Not going to happen again. When a $200+ shaver can&#x27;t even come with a proper accessories bag for the contents.... run. The shaver still does an OK job but needs to be recharged every 3-4 shaves. A full shave takes at least 5-10 minutes to go over spots several times. I don&#x27;t have a very dense beard. Panasonic is selling a good shaver as a luxury high end and it isn&#x27;t. And the blade replacement kit I saw costs half as much as what the entire shaver appears to sell new. Think twice about spending more than $100 on a shaver these days. They aren&#x27;t built to last, mostly for profit and early replacement.  EDIT: The replacement blades are $75 &amp;#60;--- NOT $50. Be warned. I couldn&#x27;t believe it but the $50 replacement that looks the same are for the cheaper model although there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a tremendous difference. You&#x27;re almost better off buying a new, cheaper shaver every year.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Shaves quickly and cleanly; long time between charges. I had not realized that a good quality shver could be so much better than mid-range</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. It&#x27;s really nice shaver</li>
            <li> When I began considering this purchase I thought with that price it must be an awesome shaver. How wrong I was. I used it all year and have finally gone back to the Norelcos I have used all my life. The Panasonic is just gives a very poor shave, will not cut whiskers that are not standing up straight and the blades last barely 4 months. Also a set of blades cost more than a brand new Norelco shaver One star is overrated!</li>
            <li> I received this razor last week. Had 3 shaves with it so far. This is the best electric razor I have ever used without a shred of doubt. I had been using Braun 7 series for the last few years, wanted a change, not that Braun is bad. This is the best substitute I could ever get. Easy to clean, does not require a cleaning station. Its pricy but worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;High price.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a mini turbine near your face when it runs (acceptable decibel levels)</li>
            <li> Good product. Will never be the same as a razor blade shave, but comes close. Handy when one is in a rush.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver at a good time, my old one was starting to nick and show signs of wear. I was excited to use another Panasonic shaver as the previous one was portable, efficient and quite accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly it was not the same, the 5 blade design is a testament to \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; as it seems like the blades fight each other more than help. The head construction is also not ideal and very flimsy overall. The overall construction of the shaver is quite good and sturdy (accidentally dropped it once in the sink) though overall i&#x27;m just not that impressed. Its also quite loud compared to comparable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may sound like i&#x27;m not recommending it at all, but thats not true. It works well in the shower is very portable and does its job.. just hoped for a bit more based on previous products. I&#x27;d give this razor a 3 out of 5 as it misses the mark (literally) on some aspects.</li>
            <li> The last electric razor I had was 40 years ago, it tore-up my face and never shaved as close as I desired. I recently lost 75% usage from my right arm, which made regular shaving extremely difficult, my wife suggested an electric razor. After doing much research on Amazon and other websites, I decided to order the razor from Amazon, plus Amazon had it on sale with  50.00 instant coupon. After trying the razor I noticed such an improvement from the electric razors from 40 years ago. It is a whole lot easier to shave with this razor than regular lather, brush and safety razor, due to my arm. The shave is pretty smooth for an electric razor, The brush and safety razor is a little closer and smoother, but I am satisfied with this Panasonic Electric Razor, I use a pre electric shave lotion, so my face is not irritated. After each shave I clean the razor by taking the head off and using an air can to clean out all of the shavings, it has worked pretty good for me this way, however I don&#x27;t know if it is an approved way, but it works for me. I love the fact that it only takes 1 hour to recharge. The only negative thing I have noticed is the high pitch sound from the motor.</li>
            <li> Without question, the Panasonic ES-LV61-A Wet/Dry shaver is the absolute best shaver on the market!  Incredible!  I have used electric shavers for the past 15 years and always have been a fan of Panasonic due to its wet/dry versatility.  Recently, I tried a Braun 790cc because the price of the shaver was much lower then the Panasonic.  I figured, &amp;#34;If I can purchase a Braun 790cc at a lower cost and still get a great shave, why not?&amp;#34;  Well, needless to say, after several weeks of being disappointed every day that I shaved with the Braun, I can to my senses, returned the Braun and purchased the Panasonic ES-LV61-A.  It should be noted that the ES-LV61-A is the exact shame shaver as the ES-LV81-K.  The only difference is that the ES-LV81-K has the cleaning station with the shaver, which, in my opinion, is not an accessory that is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does the Panasonic ES-LV61-A shave?  Incredible!  This shaver far exceeds any product Panasonic has ever put out. The Braun 790cc is not even in the same league with the Panasonic.  The Panasonic gives the absolute closest shave I have ever had in my life, the shave process feels more like you are merely wiping your face with a cloth.  Seriously!  No razor pull!  No irritation!  No negatives at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always shave wet and use a product called Shave Secret instead of cream or gel.  A few drops of Shave Secret (a blend of natural oils that does not clog the pores) with only a few drops of water and you are ready for the closest shave you have ever had in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be afraid or intimidated by the higher cost of the Panasonic.  The extra cost is well worth the investment for the no hassle, trouble free, non-irritating, absolutely closest shave you will ever experience in your life. The size of the head is larger but is a non-issue.  I found no difficulty shaving right up under the nasal area on the upper lip.  In fact, the larger head, due to the five blades, actually makes the shave quicker, closer, and even more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Panasonic ES-LV61-A or the ES-LV81-K.  The cost of either shaver is well worth the price and the investment.  I have tried every shaver on the market:  Braun, Norelco, Remington.  Panasonic far exceeds the quality of every other shaver on the market, hands down.  Once you try the Panasonic, you will understand why every other company vastly reduces the price of their shavers during the Holidays.  Because they are trying to trick you into purchasing an inferior product.  Do not be fooled by the &amp;#34;lower price&amp;#34; scam.  Purchase the Panasonic and you will never look back!</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a few months, and then I had to go over same spot on my face several times more than normal. I&#x27;m done with electric shavers. I heard this was a good shaver because razor blades irritate my face, but I need to be clean shaven, so I guess I have to go with irritation over random face stubble.</li>
            <li> Giving this shaver a five-star rating after trying a Philips norelco 3D with not much of satisfaction. This shaver works great for everyday use. Dry shave is easy and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning is very easy with the 20-second cleaning frequency.&lt;br /&gt;- Shaver feels good in your hand with its nice finish and grip&lt;br /&gt;- the display on the shaver shows the charge you have and time you spent shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- just a little noisy</li>
            <li> The Panasonic 5 blade electric razor is the best I have ever tried, and in that group I include the Norelco 3D  and the Braun 7.&lt;br /&gt;I found the Panasonic smoother, quicker and a much better wet shaver then the Norelco. To my surprise it is also effective on those tangly neck hairs.  The build is solid, better than the Norelco; same level as the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Much quieter than my previous Panasonic Arc 4.  The shave is great, not much better than the Arc 4, but better.  The look and feel of the razor is very good.  The trimming tool is much narrower compared to the Arc 4.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin specifically on my neck but it is working perfect for me. With one charge works for 5 time shaving. Good quality, well built and very easy to clean. NO need to buy a self cleaning kit. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave! I was skeptical when I first read the other reviews here but it does shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> Decided that for once I&#x27;d splurge on an item of personal grooming. Was not disappointed, this razor is like driving a luxury automobile.</li>
            <li> Shaves nice and close with no irritation, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  I shave dry with a shave stick so I can&#x27;t really comment on the wet shaving capabilities but it certainly does an awesome job dry.  I&#x27;d say the shave is probably not quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s certainly close enough for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t really have a heavy beard.  Replacement blades and foil are a bit expensive but those don&#x27;t need to be change all that often (at least not for me).  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I normally use blades (Mach 3), which are comfortable and shave close.  But such shaving takes time.  When traveling or when I&#x27;m in a rush, I use this electric shaver.  It shaves as close as the blade, no, closer!  Use it in the shower, use it dry - works well either way.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is easily the very best.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent results, very smooth with no irritation, and does it every other day in three minutes or a bit less, although not as close under the chin  initially as a Norelco rotary.  But I get much smoother results on my face than the Norelco.  Takes a little practice stretching the skin to get the best shave, but overall, excellent shaver.  Works well with LectricShave.</li>
            <li> husband loves it. Said it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; like others he had tried. Smooth shaving. Might make him shave more than 1 or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. I have had several brands of foil electric shavers. This works well dry and if I want a truly razor clean shave, I use it with a little gel or shaving cream. The head and multi blade system do my neck area well (always difficult with electrics) and I am very pleased with this. Great quality, battery life and ease of cleaning and use. This is my last electric shaver! Well done, Panasonic! I am hapy to pay more for the quality shave I get.</li>
            <li> Product better than advertised. Good quality , clean shave , easy to clean and long battery live makes it a pleasure to use</li>
            <li> Shaves barely any better than my ES8259. What really shocked me was the meanness of the accessories included for the calibre of shaver this is...very cheap feeling soft case which is totally unsuitable for travel, no cleaning brush (guys! seriously?!), no oil for regular maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - get an ES8259 or equivalent at a run-out price if you can.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as I have tried several cheaper versions, but one thing I had read over and over again after very much research was that with electric razors, you really do get what you pay for.  Works better then the cheap ones that you get from Walmart</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of electric shavers. Rotary shavers would not give me&lt;br /&gt;a clean/close shave. I tried a Braun and got a better, but, not a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Next got a Panasonic ARC4 with 4-Blades; and,it was the best of all. Came time for replacement  blades and screen, I decided to move up to the Panasonic ES-LV61-A, with 5-Blades. THIS is the one, better wet than dry for me.</li>
            <li> Have been using the LV61 for several weeks and the results have been great.  I have used it primarily wet shaving and twice dry.  Dry it gives a very good shave.  Better than than my Braun 9595.  Wet the shave is so close.  It is like using a regular blade shaver.  A full charge is good for 5 or 6 shaves.  I always use the liquid hand soap to give it a final cleaning after use.  So far the performance has far exceeded my expectations.  For your information, I am using the Art of Shaving Preshave (Kelp Gel) and shaving cream with brush.  I am very satisfied with the LV61 so far.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic, as I owned a ES8026 (induction).&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that it does a great job at shaving and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;But it looks cheap (compared to my previous one)and does not recharge by induction (too expensive to produce apparently).&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommand it? Yes.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in failure of the unit within 2 1/2 months of purchase.  Won&#x27;t charge.  And left high and dry by Amazon since we are 2 1/2 months(!) from purchase, get to return on my own to manufacturer (for $10 mailing charge) and take my chances.  Not what I expect from a $200 purchase or from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I stopped using my shaving cream and razor completely. This is a very nice electric and simplifies shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun Series 7 for years and it is still a very good shaver. The new Panasonic with five blades is easier to shave with than the Braun, but not by a huge margin. It is certainly far easier to clean, I would now rank Panasonic No. 1 and Braun a close second.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old which equals an awful lot of shaves over those years using a very diverse range of whisker cutting devices....this Panasonic is &amp;#34;simply the best&amp;#34; of all those devices and I totally recommend it. 3 day growth? Not a problem for this beauty, all the power and speed you would ever need. Haven&#x27;t tried it as a wet shaver yet,  but with a humid summer approaching, and the way it is currently performing I foresee no problems on this front. Occasionally I will use the &amp;#34;Williams Lectic Shave&amp;#34; I purchased at the sametime - excellent product paring, a smooth as silk combination. All round? Love it...has it all.</li>
            <li> Till age 37 I was only using disposable razors as all my tries for electric shavers failed miserably: red skin, cuts, random uncut hairs here and there and so on. Everything I gave a try I had to return and get back to old school razors. But not with this one!&lt;br /&gt;First I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the shaver ever as it still gave me some of red skin. Trying to figure out why this item was reviewed that high by other people I tried some tricks from comments. And it works like magic for more then 2 years now!&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I do and what works the best for me: only shave in shower, put some liquid soap on your face and then shave with slow moves touching your skin very lightly. And this is it! It won&#x27;t look that perfect from very close look as if you shaved with good disposable razor so you may need just check-shave with razor very quickly and no foam needs to be applied. Then just put after shave gel and done!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Previously used 2 LA63 ARC4&lt;br /&gt;To be short... Could not be better!</li>
            <li> Used Norelco Triple in past but mostly Braun for past 20 years. Panasonic ES-LV61-A BLOWS them away! Just got it and used it twice and best shave ever. And does such a good job that my shaves take less than half the time. My face feels smooth and had no tugging or scraping. Yes, it&#x27;s pricy but my face deserves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic wet/dry for over thirty years and they&#x27;re the best. I have a four blade, 1300 speed Panasonic, but decided  to buy the new five blade wet/dry 1400 speed. I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but it&#x27;s great!! I never liked the big cleaning mechanism that came with the four blade, so I threw it away. Some complain about no stand. I just lay it in a safe place and that&#x27;s fine. The way this shaver adjusts to facial contours is great and the shave is so gentle.</li>
            <li> It shaves extremly clean and clear. Makes my skin smoother then with a calssic razor and takes less time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if it would save money comparing to expencive razor blocks, but i sure it saves my time. Average time displayed is 3 minutes. Actualy, I use LV61 model for more than two years and this one i bought as a present for my father. So I have an expireince using this product and very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever. Period.</li>
            <li> I started shaving in my teens with a corded Norelco given to my by my parents that lasted for 20-some years. That finally broke and for the past 8 years or so I tried various battery-powered electric shavers but was getting discouraged at how soon they would break/fail and how expensive they were becoming.  A couple years ago I decided to switch completely and went to blades.  It seemed like the blades could only give me a close shave if I went over my face 3 times in different directions and when doing so, I usually ended up with raw skin.  The prior electrics never seemed to give me as close a shave over my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to a week ago.  I started looking at the current shaver selections to see what was out there.  I began comparing the LV61 and the Braun 790cc.  Another reviewer said that the LV61 gave him a better shave than the 790cc.  That, and the $50 off coupon from Amazon made me decide to purchase the LV61.  My previous cordless electrics had either NiCd or NiMH batteries and had mediocre lifetimes.  I was happy to see that today&#x27;s generation has Li-Ion batteries to keep up with current technology!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging the shaver, I let it sit for a day since I just had oral surgery and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about running this thing over my tender jaw.  The next day my mouth was less tender and I had 2 day&#x27;s worth of stubble to deal with.  I fired this bad boy up and immediately noticed that it&#x27;s loud.  Not completely annoying, but if you shave in the same room that the wife/girlfriend is sleeping in, they will most likely get woken up by the sound.  Disregarding that detail, I was very pleasantly surprised at how fast it took to get a very close shave, comparable I think to what I could get from a blade.  It only took a single pass with a couple touch-ups in the problem areas (parts of my neck and side of my jaw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, I think the shaver is great.  Now comes the test of time to see if it stays that way....</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it is quite noisy while shaving.  Cleaning it is a pleasure.  Overall, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for last few weeks, daily beard and few times rest of my head per week. Dry shaving and no razor burns, usually takes 2-3 minutes for beard and 6-8 minutes for head and beard..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to go through few passes to get it all shaved but is closest to a razor. Hold charge well and charges fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy, little hand soap and run it through water, that&#x27;s all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first electric razor and Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this expensive shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I waited too long to use this product enough to make a real judgement weather or not to keep it or return it. So I am stuck with a inferior and expensive shaver. The shaver doesn&#x27;t get the thicker whiskers off when I shave. It also doesn&#x27;t do a clean job if you want to trim around your beard or sideburns. I bought it for the mornings when I am in a hurry and need a quick shave and I don&#x27;t want to go through the ritual of the shaving cream, razor, and the clean up of a wet shave. I don&#x27;t care what the advertisers say about comparing this to a wet razor shave. This electric shaver doesn&#x27;t even come close. I actually spend more time jamming this electric into my skin over and over to get the remaining whiskers than I would with the ritual wet razor shave. Oh and if you take it in the shower thinking you can just run over your wet face and get a good clean shave you&#x27;ll be disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t work at all when your face is wet. This may work fine on peach fuzz or if you have fine frog hair and you shave every morning. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great Electric Razor, the best i have ever had.  Replaced a previous Panasonic electric razor that i had for years.  Battery life is great too.</li>
            <li> These Panasonic razors are the best. Wet/dry are a must try. I use it wet with shaving foam and the results and comfort are extraordinary.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Specially if you have a rough/hard beard.  Great for everyday use and works perfectly in the shower.  You can also use shaving cream and it will not degrade the results.  The lithium ion battery last for me approximately about 2 weeks with the razor being used every other day.  Shaving time is less than 5 min, as shown on the LCD display.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d buy an electric razor that would be better than a normal disposable safety razor. But for some reason normal razors now require a small mortgage to pay for. So I decided to bite the bullet a pay a ton of money for a really good electric razor. So far, this has been great.</li>
            <li> Since the day I started shaving with this, I&#x27;ve been waiting to get a better experience. In the user manual, it says the skin needs about 3 months to adapt shaving with electric shaver. Although, I&#x27;ve been using different electric shavers for about 20 years (braun mostly), I gave it the time manual says. Sadly, there were no visible improvements.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there are 2 main cutter blades. 2 blades on outer sides are just trimmers and acting as tools to shape up and trim the beard to improve main cutters performance. There is 1 in the middle to put things in order and make better final cuts by 2nd main blade.&lt;br /&gt;For me, that only works in theory. In real world, Arc5 leaves about %20-30 of the beard. It just trims it but do NOT perform a clean and close shave. In result, I had to re-shave with razor. Other electric shavers does a better job. Yes, they are not RAZOR SHARP and does not perform as good as a razor but the results are really consistent and even... unlike Arc5, that randomly leaves some of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I really wanted to like it. However, after more than 6 months, I hate it. IF I was still in US, I&#x27;d send it back and I would ONLY accept getting my money back. I have read all the positive comments and I respect your opinions. Mine could be just faulty but I&#x27;m really tired of thinking about what is wrong with an electric shaver i paid more than 200 bucks....&lt;br /&gt;If you have chance, try it first. Yes, the results will improve in time but first shaves will give an idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted Panasonic to return it. They said, I&#x27;ll have to ship it to them. I told them, shipping it internationally (from where I am now) would cost about same price as the shaver. They said, I NEED to pay for shipping and it&#x27;s also written in manual and they are sorry. Well, I&#x27;m sorry too, I won&#x27;t buy anything from Panasonic again and warn others about laughable shipping policy.</li>
            <li> was very convenient for my husband to use. His hands were to shaky for using a blade. It was also good to be able to use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Phillips rotary I had - smooth shave, fast and comfortable</li>
            <li> Before this razor, I had a similiar Panasonic one that was two years old.  It was almost the same except for the fifth blade.  In all honesty I lost the cord during a recent trip and it was difficult to find a replacement.  I hesitated to spend as much as I did ($250.00) on this but the reviews were incredible and I had great results with my prior razor.  Well, let me tell you this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I get a nice clean shave in faster time then the last one.  The best part is the charge lasts a lot longer then the last one, so I don&#x27;t need to risk losing the cord when I travel for a few days.  This is an excellent razor and worth the price point.  I now others paid more and I probably would as well.</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations for a quick and great shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been oscillating between barely satisfied and not satisfied for the last few years when using a number of Norelco rotary shavers (mid-range to top-of-the-line).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a top-of-the-line Braun last year and returned it as it was too loud and pulled my hair when the hair was a bit long.&lt;br /&gt;Last week I got this Panasonic shaver after doing a little bit of fresh research. And I am quite surprised how big of a difference it has made. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but I can already tell it&#x27;s much better than the last Norelco. And my wife confirmed the quality of the shave too!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be better to have a stand, but if I only need to charge for 1hr every 10days or so, it might be actually simpler to keep the cords in the drawer. Time will tell if this is an annoyance, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;The display and the lock work exactly as expected - the lock is actually very useful during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;My first shave took a little bit longer (~5min) as I was getting used to the foil, but the consequtive ones are getting better.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the noise is comparable to my old Norelco, which is a concern I had from the last time I tried a Braun foil.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning method as described in so many of the comments for this shaver is as everyone says: very simple, very quick: in 30s both the outside and the inside are clean like new - that is easier even than cleaning my dry/wet Norelco as the sonic motion and liquid soap made it simpler.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.  Faster than the other shavers (Braun &amp; Panasonic) that I have owned. Easy to clean and to take care of.</li>
            <li> If you need a close shave buy this model.  I used this model for over a year and it works great. I have a tough fast growing bread and I  use it as a wet shaver in the shower.  The quality has been great and digital display is nice feature to tell the amount of charge remaining.  I switched to Pansonic years ago  because of the high speed. Would never go back to a regular electric shaver.  This is the closest you can come to a blade close shave.  The replacement screen and blades are expensive however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2015 just received my new shaver. The other quit after 3 yrs and it was beginning to slow down. I have a tough beard so it gets a work out. Still the best close shave I have ever gotten with an electric wet/dry shaver. I ordered the same model now reduced to $199 which is only a net $99 because the outer and inner blades are $100 alone.  The inner and outer blades have to be replaced at least every two years. I have used Panasonic shavers for at least 25 years. In my opinion it is not necessary to buy the insurance since I have never gotten past three years with their shavers. This model is a little big for travel so I have the three blade Panasonic which I reviewed on Amazon and loved.  They are international adaptable for local electricity. It&#x27;s worth the extra money for a close shave. I hope this helps you in your decision.</li>
            <li> This is a very poor and expensive shave.  Can I return it?</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.  Shave is the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and notably better than the Brauns (Series 5) I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> My face has some \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; hair shaving needs and that shaver meet expectation if not perfectly than close enough..</li>
            <li> Expensive, but a great shave! I have used this electric shaver for several days and would recommend this razor without reservation.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Trims nice and close without roughing up your skin.  Hubby loves it.</li>
            <li> I had it for a while now.  It is a good Razor and it does better than my Norelco the only problem is that is noisy.  It sound like my neighbor is using his chainsaw.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the noise is an excellent razor, it feels good in my hand and is easy to to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Best electric on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a great Shaver. As one would expect it is not as close as a blade,  but it is very close.  I shave my face and my head with it and it works great on both. Its one of the best electric Shavers I have ever had. I alternate between this and a razor blade and there is only a slight difference.  It&#x27;s pricey,  but you get your money&#x27;s worth.  If you are looking for a quality shave this is the Shaver to go for.  If you want a shave on a cheap budget you  will probably be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is a great upgrade to the Arc 4. I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for some time. It is always a rush when you get a new set of blades in, but this definitely feels like an upgrade to my Arc 4. Not sure if the fifth blade has anything to do with it, but it is quieter, lighter, better balanced, and gives a smoother shave than I ever remember any other Panasonic giving. It is as if they took the Arc 4 and kept the basic design while working the kinks out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprise to me was that this model does not come with the cleaning system... but also comes without the contacts at the back to connect to an existing cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the cleaning system, it is a complete waste on all levels:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Too expensive, like $70. Maybe worth $20-25.&lt;br /&gt;  2. If you wanted to clean something, would you keep a cup of hairy soapy water to rinse it with for a month? No? Then move on.&lt;br /&gt;  3. Cheap soap costs too much.&lt;br /&gt;  4. Poorly made. Mine broke like everyone else&#x27;s did.&lt;br /&gt;  5. Cleaning with hand soap ( I use Method Lavender) works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as surprised as I am to admit it, if you upgrade from an Arc 4 you are going to love this shaver.</li>
            <li> My three year old Panasonic electric shaver finally gave up and I started a new search for a great wet/dry shaver.  I prefer to shave in the shower and I want something that can endure the slightly harsher environment.  I was considering moving on to a new brand.  I had no particular reason, other than to try something different.  I looked at Braun and Norelco, but finally realized I was pretty darn happy with my previous Panasonic, so why change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 4-5 days of not shaving, the new razor arrived and I charged it up for first use.  After apply my gel shaving cream, I started the new Panasonic up and WOW.  This thing was so much smoother and quieter compared to my old Panasonic.  The five new blades cut like a dream and I think it took my well under half the time it normally takes to shave one day growth with the old Panasonic.  Even hours later, I can tell this razor was far superior compared to the old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this new unit and will highly recommend it to anyone wanting a top-notch wet/dry shaver.  You will not go wrong!</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic Electric Razor.  My last an Arc4 was over 5 years old and needed repair, so I decided to purchase the Arc5.  It took about a week for me to get the hang of the new razor. Now it takes me half the time my old razor did, and it is quiet, and comfortable.  I have used it wet and dry, the wet shave is unbelievable.  The charging time is very quick also.  I looked at the Braun which is well made, but the Arc5, technologically is way ahead.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver, very smooth and still adjusting to reaching all areas on my face. Would recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor i have ever used.  Got it for an insane price of $149.99 usually $399.99  so lovin it</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for over 30yrs. Some have been good and others not. I used supplement with a razor. This shaver is by far the best I have ever used, (rotary or straight). I hardly ever use a razor any more. I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but this is one fine shaver. I went from a rotary to this one, (I&#x27;ve had straights before too.). They say it takes time to adapt to the change. No way, I had an almost perfect shave on the first try. I reviewed shavers on the web, and this was the top rated, so I gave it a try. If you are considering this one, (or the self cleaning model), go ahead, you will not be disappointed. I got this one over the self cleaning one for several reasons. The first hundred being the cost. The second, I&#x27;ve had the self cleaning ones, and they take up a lot of counter, and the chemicals cost money. This unit is very easy to clean, rinse it out about once a week, and use soap once a month. Use a scented soap, it smells good for a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, and I have sensitive skin which is a horribly unfortunate combination. For the past 10 years or so I&#x27;ve been using a routine of alternating every other day between a Norelco 3 head pivoting razor and using a manual razor, either a Gilette Fusion Proglide power and a Schick Hydro 5 sensitive series. I was tired of replacing expensive razor blades so often and my Norelco was almost 10 years old so it was definitely past its prime. I began looking for a new razor and was worried at first as I had used a rotary style unit my entire life but the Panasonic foil units got some really good reviews. After a lot of research and youtube videos I decided upon the Panasonic LV81 or LV61 - for all intents and purposes they are the same unit aside from one coming with a cleaning kit as well. The cleaning kit adds almost $120 so I opted to go with the model that didn&#x27;t include it and just wash the heads off in the sink after each use. As soon as I got it I charged it up and gave it a test run with a dry shave and I was amazed with how good of a job it did and how quickly it did. The next day I tried with the shaving gel which I used for my manual razor before and it felt even better (to be fair I never used gel with my Norelco unit before, I didn&#x27;t even know that was a thing that could be done so I can&#x27;t compare it in that aspect). I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my sensitive skin or any breakouts on my neck which were fairly common with my Norelco. I have actually completely stopped using my manual razor now which is great because the entire shaving process before took almost 10 minutes when using a manual razor. The pivoting head and built in trimmer is a nice added benefit as well. I would recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;-Fast, smooth, and comfortable shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Accommodates both wet and dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be cleaned quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Pivoting head and built in trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;-COST&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life isn&#x27;t very impressive, I find myself charging it every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very solid choice in a razor, and if you can swallow the large up front cost it should provide you many years of a great shaving experience!</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a close shave ... the plastics feel somewhat fragile but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic electric shavers for some time and this is by far the best; making it the #1 wet/dry shaver on the market.  My last shaver was good but this one is quieter, faster,cleaner and holds a charge twice as long as it&#x27;s predecessor. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but look for discounts and think of making up the cost in blades,gel and avoided nicks.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of things can surprise these days. This shaving system is one of those things for sure. Anyone who owns it will agre. Ones who does not yet would want to be owners</li>
            <li> It is one of the best shavers I ever have had.You have to shave with one of them in order to know what I am talking about.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco electric shavers for quite awhile but they would not provide a close enough shave. Decided to try the newest Panasonic and it gives a very close shave. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> AMAZING RAZOR.  This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wish I could give it 6 stars.  battery lasts 2 weeks and shaves in a minute or less and my beard is really thick.  good job guys.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND GOOD PRICE!</li>
            <li> Panasonic has always been an excellent razor! I had the last one for four years. This razor actually shaves closer than a four or five bladed razor!</li>
            <li> Having used various electric shavers, I&#x27;ve only been 90% satisfied. Mostly because I&#x27;ve always had to use a regular razor to tidy up the neck, since there was always hair and stubble left there.  This puppy shaves EVERYTHING nice and close. Got it on sale for $150--and worth it. Dual voltage, wet/dry, easy to clean, built-in display to tell you how much of a charge is left.</li>
            <li> Better than 4 of other brands I tried. Still conditioning my face  to this great Panasonic Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Two cutters with 5 piece foil. Not 5 bladed cutter. Easy to hold and use either wet or dry with easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaves faster than my previous Panasonic 3-blade model but like my previous model it leaves some hair that grows parallel to my skin. Norelco 3D takes care of that so that was an obvious choice for me. If not for left over hair that it couldn&#x27;t get no matter how many passes I made I would go with this product. So I put 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t really work for me but for someone else this could be a real good product.</li>
            <li> Nice follow up to the older model.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever had with an electric razor. So remarkable I told a friend who used mine once and ordered his own that day.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve tried yet! 25% better than Braun 7 Series. Very light feel and close smooth shave.. I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
            <li> works well, but doesn&#x27;t like longer hairs. cleans easy, fast to recharge, last long on one charge, waterproof, works well dry also.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer than my old Norelco, which did not survive a bathtub drop.  The Panasonic is quiet enough and basically cuts at blade level.  It&#x27;s smooth and fast.  If you push hard you can irritate your skin a little but not much.  It glides comfortably and is not too noisy.  The charge level LED is helpful.  High quality in or out of the shower.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product was previously using a Braun &amp; Philips Arcitec shaver. The panasonic leaves them both for dead in terms of shave tiime &amp; closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> Bye Bye Braun, Hello Panasonic. Finally fed up with the challenge of cleaning top of the line Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Took a chance on Panasonic...... a winner,easy clean and a close shave.....no looking back.</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I had a braun prior to this one.  There wasn&#x27;t much wrong with it until the battery started to die and it&#x27;s not user serviceable.  So I went ahead and bit the bullet on this one when it was a gold box deal.  I wouldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  It gives me the closest shave of any electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever used, and the power button lock is a great thought for traveling.  Battery life isn&#x27;t so hot in comparison to my old braun, but admittedly it&#x27;s running at a MUCH higher RPM, and I use the cleaning mode every shave.  I get about 5 to 7 shaves out of it per charge before it&#x27;s on the last bar, then I plug it in.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, for 5 blades but my 8243 - 4 blade shaves just as good</li>
            <li> Wet or Dry it works. Very clean shave but I am facing little difficulty when cleaning hairs from chin and neck. Its not helping there. I need to use razor to clean that area. May be I am not using it well.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever posted. I liked the shave I got from the this shaver. However, the foil ripped within a month of first purchasing it, and Panasonic refused to replace it under warranty, after first telling me they would. That was one year ago. Recently and after the shaver was out of warranty, I have had electrical problems with the shaver. The on-off switch is erratic. The shaver turns on and off at will - it even woke me up in the middle of the night! One time, I was using it and I was unable to shut the shaver off until I plugged in the charger, which automatically shuts down the shaver. Fortunately, I took out a Square Trade warranty when I purchased the shaver, and they are reimbursing me for the cost of the item without any hassle at all. I decided to purchase BRAUN SERIES 7 799CC-6WD CC4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver to replace the Panasonic. I just don&#x27;t want to chance getting another defective product with such poor customer service.</li>
            <li> great item, use it everyday, in our household!</li>
            <li> Purchased for oldest son for Christmas. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used quality rotary electric shavers for about 20 years. During the last years, I realized that the shave was not satisfactory any more, even though I replaced the rotary blades as recommended. I developed a habit of also using a manual triple-blade wet shaver to take off the remaining stubbles and longer hairs in problematic facial and neck areas. When I got the new Panasonic ES-LV61-A, I conducted a first test and used it after the rotary shave: It took off ALL the unwanted hair that was left after the first shave. The skin felt smooth afterwards and was not irritated. Shaving results have always been great, and I have no need any more for a backup shaver. Compared to the rotary shaver, the Panasonic produces some more noise, but it is not annoying. I also like the grip of the Panasonic. As mentioned in previous reviews, the Panasonic has a very efficient cleaning procedure that does not require a bulky external tank system and the ongoing purchase of cleaning solutions. Only required are a few drops of liquid hand soap, tap water, and the engagement of a 20-sec vibration cycle. With the box come a charger, a black leatherette soft case, and a brief instruction booklet. I have used the new shaver for a month and recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Best shave of any product ever used period -  any blade, any electric. Great Razor.  Smooth and close with no irritation.  Quick and easy shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product, shaves very close, takes me about 3 minutes. Much closer and better then my older Braun and I really liked my Braun. Much closer shave, the only thing is you have little worning when it&#x27;s going to run out of power, still very pleased with it , glade I bought it worth every penny. Like having a Japanese Rolls Royce and you will have it for years so why not buy the best</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shaver for about 20 years, but this is by far the best Panasonic electric shaver I have ever had. Flawless when shaving &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, and almost as good when shaving &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My second Panasonic.  Over the years I have had different models of the Remington,  Norelco, Braun and others that I don&#x27;t recall.  This Panasonic is by far the best I have ever used.  Bought it through RichardHokie via Amazon for just under $210 delivered.  No complaints at all.  I&#x27;m reviewing this as I read the reviews others write on products that I plan to purchase and appreciate their opinions.  First of all the plastic cap used to protect the blades actually STAYS on.  As you know if you have used electric shavers before, this may be a first.  It&#x27;s the quietest shaver I have ever used.  Again, maybe a first.  I don&#x27;t find it a problem shaving my neck or chin as I note some others do.  Granted, I have a light beard.  This provides a very close shave in five minutes.  The pop up trimmer does its job.  It may be considered a bit heavy by some but not uncomfortably so.  Judging its weight would fall under the heading of nit picking I would think.  Cleaning is easily done.  A squirt of hand soap and water over the sink.  No brushing and whiskers covering the sink and floor.  Check out the other reviews and make up your own mind.  I think it&#x27;s a bit pricy but you get what you pay for most times and I&#x27;m well satisfied with this model and expect to have if for some time.  Blades last twice a long as the $75 shavers so all things considered I&#x27;d say spend the money. After all you use it every day so why be annoyed with something used that often.</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers for over 25 years. This is the best model I&#x27;ve owned so far and easily beats out shavers I&#x27;ve tried from other manufacturers. My prior favorite was the Panasonic Vortex ES 8109 and its nondocking relatives. Those are better at touching up hair around the ears and curly whiskers close to sideburns where the whole head can&#x27;t pass over them. This razor takes far fewer passes to leave a smooth face. I&#x27;m finicky about not feeling any whiskers which is why I&#x27;ve always come back to Panasonic and this razor gets me there the fastest. Would be nice if the timer kept accumulated time across longer breaks, but only because I&#x27;m that curious about how much less time this model takes. The head on this model feels like it pivots better than the models with fewer blades: maybe it is the larger surface. I wondered if the large head would make shaving more difficult, but I find it helps smooth out the face to get a closer more complete shave. No ingrown whiskers or razor burn so far either.  If money is tight, go with another Panasonic model.  If you can afford it, this model is worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> So far i have been using this shaver for the last few weeks and i must say that the prices is ok and the shave gotten from both dry and wet shave (even in the shower with me) is awesome and am quite happy with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a shaver and have been using Remington for years at the $60 range which has been working great...then i tried the series 3 Braun and it could not get me the shave that it says it can and took me twice as long to shave and it still did not get all of it and had to revert to my 4 year old Remington (which i replaced internal battery) to finish the job and did well so i returned the Braun and they are refunding me the monies, good customer support with Braun and have to give them a heads up for that! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is worth the monies i paid for it and am &amp;#34;VERY&amp;#34; happy with this and would recommend this shaver for all those with difficult thick hair and hard to shave areas like under the chin where the hairs also go in different directions like mine, this shaver does a great job! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, easy to clean! ;)</li>
            <li> Excelent shaver, practical and stable.</li>
            <li> It was like what I expect</li>
            <li> Shaves close and fast, I like it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the money I spent purchasing the Arc 5 was worth every penny. For the last 30 days after arriving in the mail from Amazon, I have been getting unbelievably close shaves with very little or no irritation and/or hair bumps and it gets better everyday as my hair and skin adjusts to the routine. I am a black male in the military with very coarse beard hair and I could never find an electric razor that was powerful enough to shave my beard without having to press hard on my face and make several passes resulting in irritation and eventually razor bumps. I finally gave up on the electric razor and started using a Gillette Mach 5, only shaving with the grain. This method kept most of the irritation and razor bumps away, but I could never achieve that smooth, close shave I desired. 8 years have passed and out of nowhere, I started researching electric shavers again. It came down to the Braun 7 series and the Arc 5. After reading up on the Arc 5 shaver, I was convinced this was the shaver for me due to the wet/dry capabilities. I&#x27;ve tried both wet and dry methods and I must say that everything I read about this shaver is true and I am really enjoying the close, smooth shaves I get everyday.</li>
