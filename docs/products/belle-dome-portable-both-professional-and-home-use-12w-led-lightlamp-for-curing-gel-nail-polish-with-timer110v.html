            <li>I was quite pleased with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I just received my light yesterday and did my nails last night using harmony Gelish Polish and the result was salon perfect nails.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time today with Harmony Gelish Rose Garden color polish.  </li>
            <li>I did time the 30s and 60s timers and they were accurate with the stopwatch on my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did have to prop up the light a bit so that my hand could be comfortably placed in it with my thumb over my index finger so that the light reaches it.</li>
            <li>short, this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>I wish I had gone with an LED light to start.</li>
            <li>I will be saving so much money at the salon by doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li>Very fast LED light, love the individual timed buttons, compact, all 5 fingers can fit, great sleek design</li>
            <li>This lamp was super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love having a time choice, fits whole hand easily</li>
            <li>No more lifting and a perfect manicure like before.  </li>
            <li>I love that my whole hand fits in at one time.  </li>
            <li>I was having peeling of the nails (in full sheets).  </li>
            <li>I love that my whole hand fits in at one time.</li>
            <li>The polish cured well, I did not have any issues with bubbling (which I&#x27;ve had with certain polish brands in my UV light), and I didn&#x27;t mind the beeping of the light to turn on or off.</li>
            <li>I love the individual time buttons on the top.  </li>
            <li>I could fit my whole hand and thumb in without any problems and I have fat hands/fingers!  </li>
            <li>I got this particular LED UV lamp because it got good reviews at a decent price and so far I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
            <li>can still fit my whole hand.</li>
            <li>This is so much quicker than my UV light.</li>
            <li>Timer makes it more professional and saves my time.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to replace the 30 m button with a simple on/off feature for curing at a customized time.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much my sister purchased the same one.</li>
            <li>I took a chance with this lamp and it was totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the high pitched beep sound when you set the timer and again when it goes off.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you can&#x27;t fit all 10 fingers at the same time, but smaller size makes it perfect for travels.</li>
            <li>It is great for me because I usually do my nails while watching TV.  </li>
            <li>The LED dries the polish very fast.  </li>
            <li>Next time maybe I&#x27;ll try the 30 seconds each coat &amp; see if it does okay with the shorter time period also.  </li>
            <li>It is my first time doing my on Gel nails</li>
            <li>Great little product with clear operating instructions.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m quite certain</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool to obtain a lasting gel manicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold so thumb is flat.</li>
            <li>The dryer is a really nice sleek round shape and it is easy to dry the whole hand, including thumbs!  </li>
            <li>I really like the led lights rather than the UV lights.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I cured my whole hand at ones.</li>
            <li>It does fit my entire hand, though I do my thumbs separately.  </li>
            <li>This LED light will hold all 5 fingers at the same time.</li>
            <li>I watched very closely when the women who did my nails</li>
            <li>Nice little surprise!</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure your thumb nail is turned a little more more flat, rather than off to the side, so the outside edge can get dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Very modest packaging, and mine came with a nice little buffer block.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that LED cures faster than the regular UV lamps, the bulbs last a very long time and LED&#x27;s use less power consumption (without sacrificing the light output) and are therefore better for the environment.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was put to use the next day after receiving it with no operating problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used LED gel polish and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Gelish instructions say to dry the polish for 30 seconds, but I usually do 60 seconds to make sure they are good and dry.  </li>
            <li>This is normal.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is so small &amp; compact but</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been working well!</li>
            <li>I found that if I raise my wrist up a little bit, this is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Convenience of doing your nails at home as frequently as you want, with the beauty of a salon experience.</li>
            <li>Thus far everything is as they advertised.  </li>
            <li>I usually still do an extra time with my two thumbs to make sure.  </li>
            <li>Gelish says you can cure the color for only 30 seconds with LED, but since this was my first time, I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances with it possibly not curing all the way, so I cured it for 60 seconds each coat.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless I like the timer and it works great when doing a single, thin coat, but requires longer when drying thicker polishes like my Oh Splat!</li>
            <li>My polish seems to stay on much longer when I dry it with this lamp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done one manicure with it, I used Red carpet polish, and my mani is now five days old and still looks shiny and new.</li>
            <li>My old lamp had a 45 second setting on it whereas this one has 30, 60, 90 seconds and 60 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Put two thin coats of color, along with the Foundation &amp; Top it off coat.  </li>
            <li>It does not mean that it isn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to dry your thumb at the same time as your fingers, which saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li>BUT after only only two months it developed a crack where the power cord plugs in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put in a little glue, but it certainly shouldn&#x27;t have cracked after so short of a time!  </li>
            <li>The thumb is a little tricky, but I can easily do my whole hand at one time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I think LED are in the near future for other types of lighting as well.  </li>
            <li> This definitely not a professional grade lamp.  </li>
            <li> Because it is only 12W (and I wear dark colors)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the 30 m (minute) button as it can be confused with 30s</li>
            <li> The high pitched sound scares the crap out of her each time I use it!</li>
            <li> you are done drying the Gelish polish, it will still be a little tacky.  </li>
            <li> The only bummer is that it takes a little bit longer (60 seconds x 6 thin coats</li>
            <li> Not only was this an issue, but the device makes a horrible beeping sound when it turns off/on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, yet cures all nails on one hand or foot at a time.  </li>
            <li> That put me past the return date</li>
            <li> I cured the base at 30 seconds, both of the color coats at 60 seconds, and finally the topcoat at 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> YOU DON&#x27;T NEED THE EXPENSIVE LAMP!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this nail dryer for about a month now.  I am very pleased with it.  I use it with the Harmony Gelish polish.  The LED dries the polish very fast.  I love the individual time buttons on the top.  It gives the perfect amount of time without having to watch the clock or set a timer.  It is great for me because I usually do my nails while watching TV.  Gelish instructions say to dry the polish for 30 seconds, but I usually do 60 seconds to make sure they are good and dry.  The dryer is a really nice sleek round shape and it is easy to dry the whole hand, including thumbs!  You just have to make sure your thumb nail is turned a little more more flat, rather than off to the side, so the outside edge can get dry.  I found that if I raise my wrist up a little bit, this is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are done drying the Gelish polish, it will still be a little tacky.  It does not mean that it isn&#x27;t dry.  This is normal.  The instructions for the polish say to wipe off the tacky last layer with their cleaner product (or just use rubbing alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Very fast LED light, love the individual timed buttons, compact, all 5 fingers can fit, great sleek design&lt;br /&gt;CONS: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I love that my whole hand fits in at one time.  I usually still do an extra time with my two thumbs to make sure.  So far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product. The only downside is that you can&#x27;t fit all 10 fingers at the same time, but smaller size makes it perfect for travels.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Just used it for the first time today with Harmony Gelish Rose Garden color polish.  Gelish says you can cure the color for only 30 seconds with LED, but since this was my first time, I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances with it possibly not curing all the way, so I cured it for 60 seconds each coat.  Put two thin coats of color, along with the Foundation &amp; Top it off coat.  Worked great!  Next time maybe I&#x27;ll try the 30 seconds each coat &amp; see if it does okay with the shorter time period also.  I could fit my whole hand and thumb in without any problems and I have fat hands/fingers!  Love that it is so small &amp; compact but can still fit my whole hand. Don&#x27;t like the high pitched beep sound when you set the timer and again when it goes off. My dog HATES it! The high pitched sound scares the crap out of her each time I use it! Wish I could disconnect the sound somehow!</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp to replace my red carpet manicure lamp that I had for over three years.  My old lamp had a 45 second setting on it whereas this one has 30, 60, 90 seconds and 60 minutes.  All of my brands of gel are supposed to cure in 30 seconds but I found with this lamp I was having peeling of the nails (in full sheets).  Finally it dawned on me to try the 60 second setting.  Perfection!  No more lifting and a perfect manicure like before.  The only bummer is that it takes a little bit longer (60 seconds x 6 thin coats x 3 - two hands and thumbs).</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool to obtain a lasting gel manicure. I really like the led lights rather than the UV lights. The timer buttons are very easy to operate. The price was reasonable. It arrived quickly and was put to use the next day after receiving it with no operating problems. Great little product with clear operating instructions.</li>
            <li> This is a great lamp. Easy to use. Works perfectly. Timer makes it more professional and saves my time. Priced right. I will definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just got my LED lamp and I love it. I cured my whole hand at ones. I used the gel products from KISS. It is my first time doing my on Gel nails and it was amazing. This lamp was super easy to use. With Kiss gel you only cure for 30s and 60s. The lamp worked perfect.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been working well! The thumb is a little tricky, but I can easily do my whole hand at one time. Overall happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 4 times now and it works well.  It does fit my entire hand, though I do my thumbs separately.  Because it is only 12W (and I wear dark colors) I cure for 60 seconds. Overall it is not very big, so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> This is so much quicker than my UV light. I wish I had gone with an LED light to start. I&#x27;ve only done one manicure with it, I used Red carpet polish, and my mani is now five days old and still looks shiny and new. The polish cured well, I did not have any issues with bubbling (which I&#x27;ve had with certain polish brands in my UV light), and I didn&#x27;t mind the beeping of the light to turn on or off. I did time the 30s and 60s timers and they were accurate with the stopwatch on my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very modest packaging, and mine came with a nice little buffer block.</li>
            <li> Good product and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> This LED Nail dryer is amazing.  I&#x27;ve only used LED gel polish and it dries quickly.  The cost of the machine has already paid for itself in manis!</li>
            <li> The product is great, but it&#x27;s a LED UV lamp. I&#x27;m not sure, as this is my first time owning a curing lamp, but I thought LED lamps were just suppose to be that and not UV. Nevertheless I like the timer and it works great when doing a single, thin coat, but requires longer when drying thicker polishes like my Oh Splat! polish.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the buffing block mine came with though! Nice little surprise!</li>
            <li> Great nail dryer.  I love it!  My polish seems to stay on much longer when I dry it with this lamp.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for approximately two weeks and three light bulbs are flickering already. Not only was this an issue, but the device makes a horrible beeping sound when it turns off/on and there is no way to turn it off. I will be returning- there are much better products for comparable prices</li>
            <li> This LED light will hold all 5 fingers at the same time. No need to cure the thumbs separately. I like the timer options. Perfect size without spending too much. I thought it was a good value and performed well.</li>
            <li> I just received my light yesterday and did my nails last night using harmony Gelish Polish and the result was salon perfect nails. I cured the base at 30 seconds, both of the color coats at 60 seconds, and finally the topcoat at 90 seconds. The light works great. I did have to prop up the light a bit so that my hand could be comfortably placed in it with my thumb over my index finger so that the light reaches it. I will be saving so much money at the salon by doing my own nails.  The manufacturer even emailed me this morning with a list of tips and polish brands to use. That is great company customer service.</li>
            <li> This lamp is sturdy and came nicely packaged with protection film in its own box.  The unit has a nice design and color, with pre-set timer buttons, as described.  It&#x27;s small, yet cures all nails on one hand or foot at a time.  The only thing I&#x27;m not too fond of is that I wish the timer buttons would have been 30, 45, 60 and I guess 90- which I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll use, but you never know.  I don&#x27;t really like the 30 m (minute) button as it can be confused with 30s and I doubt it would be used for curing nails, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  It would have been nice to replace the 30 m button with a simple on/off feature for curing at a customized time.  However you can always press the buttons again to turn off the lamp.  I love the fact that LED cures faster than the regular UV lamps, the bulbs last a very long time and LED&#x27;s use less power consumption (without sacrificing the light output) and are therefore better for the environment.  I think LED are in the near future for other types of lighting as well.  I got this particular LED UV lamp because it got good reviews at a decent price and so far I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and is easy to use. I love that my whole hand fits in at one time. I loved it so much my sister purchased the same one.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I bought this lamp.  I used to get my nails done and paid $40 including tip every 2-3 weeks.  I have been painting my nails for years and thought I would try the gel nails this time.  I got them done 4 times and decided to do it myself.  I watched very closely when the women who did my nails so I could do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered buying the OPI lamp, but for $180?  NO WAY!  I took a chance with this lamp and it was totally worth it.  YOU DON&#x27;T NEED THE EXPENSIVE LAMP!  This one works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Works great! Love having a time choice, fits whole hand easily but I still do thumbs separately. It&#x27;s easy to hold so thumb is flat. Love it!</li>
            <li> Convenience of doing your nails at home as frequently as you want, with the beauty of a salon experience. I do my thumbs separately to insure a good cure.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of this product.  Thus far everything is as they advertised.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with this dryer.  It&#x27;s large enough to dry your thumb at the same time as your fingers, which saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> This definitely not a professional grade lamp.  It does not cure the gels evenly and you will definitely need to cure the thumbs separately.  So I tossed this in the trash.. you do get what you pay for .</li>
            <li> This gel light works great BUT after only only two months it developed a crack where the power cord plugs in.  The crack keeps getting larger.  I&#x27;ll put in a little glue, but it certainly shouldn&#x27;t have cracked after so short of a time!  That put me past the return date or I would have returned it! (I&#x27;m quite certain I could guess where it was made!) It is a great size and does the job!</li>
