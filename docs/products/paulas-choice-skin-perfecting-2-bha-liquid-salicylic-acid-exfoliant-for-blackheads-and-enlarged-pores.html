            <li>I&#x27;ve had this a week and my acne is clearing up so nicely!</li>
            <li>We now both have flawless, smooth, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>Also it exfoliates nicely and diminishes my blackheads and breakouts!</li>
            <li>Delivered on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I do follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>i use 2x a day with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My sign to stop should have been the tingling feeling, which I thought was a good thing-obviously not.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to wear a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Good product...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39, Caucasian, and have fair, combination-type skin.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind having to use cotton pads to apply it and don&#x27;t mind the price this is good.</li>

            <li>Truly amazing and worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li>I read many great reviews about this product</li>
            <li>A great combo for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is great for some people, but not for all.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>As always Paula&#x27;s choice is fantastic !!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Skins never been better!</li>
            <li>Every day it kept getting better until I went to the beach with makeup on!</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic!</li>
            <li>I will continue using this, for sure!</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Tried this amazing liauid exfoliant as a bzzagent....</li>
            <li>Truly amazing product.</li>
            <li>Paula&#x27;s Choice does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and the redness has greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>and i honestly havent has a breakout since i started using it.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>This is really the best exfoliant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and it was actually effective</li>
            <li>I started using this but then switched to Stridex pads which are just as effective and way easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Murad stopped selling its highly effective Acne Treatment Gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m behond thrilled.</li>
            <li>Really nice product .</li>
            <li>Two stars goes to Amazon for quick delivery and great service as always.</li>
            <li>Depending on your needs though I would highly recommend the product, it smells great and packaging is good.</li>
            <li>I now own a ton of her products and love them all.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want perfect skin which Paula&#x27;s Choice offers.</li>
            <li>They told me it&#x27;s the best stuff so far they&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I wish I could like this because I was so excited to try it after reading all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I went to Amazon and discovered that although there weren&#x27;t many reviews, the reviews were excellent, and the product was within reason as far as cost.</li>
            <li>I experienced an immediate soothing quality from the treatment upon my first application.</li>
            <li>I also know that if you are on the fence, the manufacturer of this product sends free samples of many of their products if you want to give it a try!</li>
            <li>but me thinks it could be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be checking into more Paula&#x27;s Choice products.</li>
            <li>Having said that don&#x27;t expect to get flawless skin only by using this (although in my opinion it can get you quite close to you desired goals).</li>
            <li>/&gt;To check for clogs or acne----The area in which you experience this the most.</li>
            <li>That is not part of the purging process and it is clogging your pores which will invariably lead to more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having said that, my skin is DRAMATICALLY better since using this.</li>
            <li>Already, my skin looks smooth and acne has cleared up!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that after so many years of struggling with cystic acne that I am almost all the way cleared up.  </li>
            <li>(here, the price is so much better) and started using it on my son&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I gave it a shot and was so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>this totally restructures my skin to brilliance use after cleansing and toning for best results</li>
            <li>this is an even better than my 3 year use of exposed tonic.</li>
            <li>I reccomend using finger tips of index or ring finger allows more liberal distribution and also saving product and money plus since product is weightless there is no shine from oily t zone areas because of the thorough pore wall cleansing</li>
            <li>Yes, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am currently on my second bottle of this stuff and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Like this better than lotions/cleansers with salicylic acid as, for whatever reason, it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I am going to try the 2% BHA Lotion and see how that goes :)</li>
            <li>I now know that some people switched from Stridex to this one and got better luck, so</li>
            <li>Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding liquid exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it works well without stinging.</li>
            <li>I used this many years ago when Paula was door to door</li>
            <li>Glad to see the quality has changed since then.&lt;br /&gt;Following</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I used it over a month but wasn&#x27;t sure if it made difference or not.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and hope pc never goes out of business!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works best when I only apply it to my forehead, nose, and chin.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love every product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>My skin became so smooth and literally started to glow!</li>
            <li>I started to receive so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>Fabulous...makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beyond believable.</li>
            <li>Paula, if youre reading this, I want you to know that I love you.</li>
            <li>Its making my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have had so many blemishes on my skin...</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many products.  </li>
            <li>My face looks healthier and more youthful than it has in 20 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many products designed to shrink pores or their appearance and not one worked until I tried Paula&#x27;s Choice.  </li>
            <li>Of the several BHA products I have tried, it appears to be the best.</li>
            <li>My skin still is and will always be a bit oily, but the brightness and clarity is striking</li>
            <li>I really am in love with this quality product.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it lightens my skin tone.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I just received my product and I am questioning the quality and if it&#x27;s even safe to use.</li>
            <li>Being a BHA, which should cut through oil and seabum, it made my skin much more oily than before.</li>
            <li>but i got some more on my face :</li>
            <li>but when i stop my face was getting better.</li>
            <li>and they helped me pick a better one for my skin type.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try it!  </li>
            <li>All of Paula&#x27;s Choice products are good, but this is my favorite because it targets my particular skin problems, and it is the most hypo-allergenic for me.</li>
            <li>This is a safe and most effective way to clean your pores out and to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>two weeks i have been using it and it has teansformed my skin into glowing healthy blemish free even toned skin ....</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely incredible, and I would recommend it to anybody who wishes to resolve problems such as blackheads, acne or redness because this truly does work.</li>
            <li>This is the one most important step in my skincare now.</li>
            <li>Enjoy :) http://goo.gl/J5uNbc﻿</li>
            <li>received a sample of this with another purchase and loved it so much that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I received this product as a freebie originally.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the idea of wasting so many hand towels invest in washable face towels so you have a clean one</li>
            <li>I recommend going easy on the application.  </li>
            <li>It is easily aggravated, prone to pimples and lots of blackheads.</li>
            <li>However, I think it was too strong for my skin...</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing, and this product works FAST!</li>
            <li>I honestly noticed smother skin after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I honestly could not recommend a product any higher.</li>
            <li>For all of those who want to start an affordable and effective face routine here is a link for $10OFF your first Paula&#x27;s Choice online order.(http://goo.gl/J5uNbc﻿)</li>
            <li>Here is a good way to patch test a new product:&lt;br /&gt;Where to test:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s good to try new products because you just never know what might be your &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I used to use the Exposed skincare product line but after switching to this which is a higher %, it worked better and was much more affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the best way to control the application is to put a little in the palm of one hand and use your finger tip to lightly dab it on your face.  </li>
            <li>is HUGE.</li>
            <li>I heard such great things I was dying to try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I have recommended this product to close friends and my sister which is why I am comfortable giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to remember that nothing works miracles and it is still an over the counter, mom prescription item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy work its performance and have now bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li>Great product, I would definitely recommend anyone to try it out.</li>
            <li>On her site, they also give free samples and have some discount codes.</li>
            <li>Fabulous results, even after years of sunbathing with no sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>The one thing I found absolutely amazing about this product is that it really does unclogs pores.  </li>
            <li>Note to buyers: make sure to buy cotton pads if you don&#x27;t already have them so that you can apply this in the most effective way possible.</li>
            <li>It is certainly light weight like water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s and still have nice skin, thanks partly to Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li>Keep my skin smooth, reduces breakouts.</li>
            <li>It honestly didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>I heard great things about this specific BHA Liquid exfoliant, but a bit nervous about the quality.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about using a BHA liquid since my skin is pretty sensitive, but this product has been fabulous and great complement to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>Apply BHA lightly with a clean cotton ball.</li>
            <li>Leaving your skin clean and smooth with the ability to penetrate and dissolve the oil sebum inside your pores before turning into blackheads.</li>
            <li>Love this product - it will really brighten up your skin!</li>
            <li>I order mine through Amazon, because I love the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Also noticed after continued use a great decrease in minor breakouts</li>
            <li>My pores were significantly reduced after the first use and my makeup now goes on and  looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it that I used it twice a day which ended up drying my skin out,</li>
            <li>The best part is not even advertised....if you have small raised bumps around your hairline, they will be gone after using this.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry</li>
            <li>I also sleep in a clean shirt each night and wash my sheets once a week.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin and does not leave my face feeling dry or flaky afterwards.</li>
            <li>My face has became much more clear still clogged pores on my nose and chin but MUCH better.</li>
            <li>My face looked and felt so clean.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it will clean up my acne</li>
            <li>I decided to try this on a whim after reading all the positive reviews and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>This has a great consistency, it really sticks to your skin and feels like it&#x27;s soaking in, feels almost nourishing, not tight.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for who suffer from large pores due to oily face or clogged by makeup</li>
            <li>So far I love this product!</li>
            <li>love love love this product .You will see dry flaky skin intially but stick with it for 2-3 days</li>
            <li>Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% BHA Skin Perfection Liquid has completely changed my skin (in the best way possible) and I feel so lucky to have discovered this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and it works just great</li>
            <li>After just a couple of weeks&#x27; use, my 68-year-old skin is much brighter and more evenly-toned.  </li>
            <li>So I bought the full size version</li>
            <li>I really had hoped it would be my miracle cure:)</li>
            <li>It is a true miracle for me.</li>
            <li>So, I bought this because heard it&#x27;s really effective to clear your skin from my buddies.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any complaints using this - no bad skin reactions, seemed to be helping my complexion, etc.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different products for my skin and this it magic.</li>
            <li>, Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many many oil control products from the basic to makeup products but NOTHING compares to this product.</li>
            <li>I dont have to worry about my face being super oily when im out.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this product, and I most definitely will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>What I notice most from using this product (still two times daily) is that I have a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked as quickly as this in changing how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super oily with a lot of post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation, and acne-prone around my jawline.</li>
            <li>The product is a good value for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite line.</li>
            <li>Most products don&#x27;t live up to their claims.</li>
            <li>This product has not caused any new breakouts or increased my oil production at all, and it&#x27;s made my face SO SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>This stuff has been a dream come true on getting started back on the road to having nice skin again.  </li>
            <li>I started using this about 2 weeks ago - and noticed an improvement the first day!</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as shown, no complaints!</li>
            <li>I have only had amazing experiences with all their products.</li>
            <li>You will be glowing with fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth 5 stars to me.</li>
            <li>The area where you&#x27;re most sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try for anyone who is looking to improve their skin situation.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two months, and my skin has never looked better in my adult life.</li>
            <li>is clear and smooth and product is lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think there was such a thing.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with the results (1 week use).</li>
            <li>You skin will clear up for sure.  </li>
            <li>However, it is worth every dime</li>
            <li>Works great but is expensive and kind of a hassle to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and am still thrilled by this stuff.</li>
            <li>and you MUST use sunscreen since BHA makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I only wish it were more accessible in my country.. to get it shipped from PC&#x27;s website</li>
            <li>My skin has finally started clearing up even more significantly.</li>
            <li>Paua&#x27;s Choice has other BHA products that have more ingredients and probably do more for your skin, but they  don&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;m allergic to some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Seems to be clearing up my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product - it leaves the skin clearer, brighter and smoother after a single use.</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer that you use during the day or every other night can help combat this.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days I could already see a drastic improvement in the blackheads on my nose and the cheek areas right beside the nose.</li>
            <li>It really does clean out pores, and evens out skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time today and after the first use I could see a difference!</li>
            <li>This is the first Paula&#x27;s Choice product I have used and am impressed enough that I plan on trying other ones as well.</li>
            <li>My clinque intense moisture surge doesnt even do the full job anymore.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, laugh lines (not deep ones) have disappeared, and my skin looks a lot more luminous.</li>
            <li>The pores are diminishing, my complexion is more clear and fresher looking, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I did notice that my skin was significantly tighter the first couple of days, so if you&#x27;re naturally prone to dryness be prepared to moisturize more frequently.</li>
            <li>I am over 40, have very fair sensitive skin, and have suffered from acne, and rosacea for 20+ years, as well as having large unsightly pores and embarrassing black heads.  </li>
            <li>Since starting this product, my skin tone has evened out and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this product every other day and is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This product came highly recommended via the subreddit &amp;#34;skincareaddiction.&amp;#34; I have experienced the so-called &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; with this product, but it has not been harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first product which has ever worked on my 20 y o son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li>Bought this on Amazon for my first experience using this brand.</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you a bit about my skin.  </li>
            <li>Really helps my Acne!</li>
            <li>I will explain BHAs in a more basic way:&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are allergic to a product you would know pretty instantaneously.</li>
            <li>Favorite product from Paula&#x27;s - Starting using the line about two months ago</li>
            <li>THIS product, however, has done exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product and may consider trying the higher percentage solution for my next bottle.</li>
            <li>product is going to make his 8th grade year SO much easier!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!  </li>
            <li>THAT was what a BHA was supposed to do, evidently.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>I notice I get a lot fewer bumps on my face when I use it consistently.</li>
            <li>and I actually find this BHA liquid works just as well for a much better value.</li>
            <li>But you must stay consistent with application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Ive struggled with acne for the last 8 years of my life, and this (and a better skincare routine) has made my face smooth and completely cleared me of my acne.</li>
            <li>My skin appeared almost bleached in blotches after the first week.</li>
            <li>After the first time using this, I could see a difference in the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a radical difference in my skin texture and pesky hormonal cystic acne after the first use.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it I woke up</li>
            <li>It has only gotten better with each use.</li>
            <li>I use this as a toner, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a product that does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Thanks Paula!</li>
            <li>When I received the product there was no safety seal as most of the reviews stated before I purchased which I thought wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I applied it before going to bed.</li>
            <li>I had read the good reviews on this product and was very hopeful that it would get rid of my black heads.  </li>
            <li>After just 2 nights using this, the redness was significantly reduced and acne nearly gone.</li>
            <li>After a few more days it appeared to me that this BHA Liquid had also made a HUGE improvement in my pores.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin clear and pores clean.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a cleanser -- it&#x27;s a clear liquid you apply to your skin by a cotton ball after you clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so grateful she developed her own line, and, while I haven&#x27;t used every product, I can definitely vouch for this one-</li>
            <li>I am allergic to fragrances, one common preservative (phenoxyethanol) and many or perhaps most aromatic plant extracts.</li>
            <li>I use it at night, and it does feel a little tacky when it dries, but other than that, absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>Have been using for about a week and already have see positive results.</li>
            <li>if you find other products don&#x27;t work or hurt your skin, as this has been good to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>On special nights out, I scrub my face and put this stuff on, leaving my skin fresh, but not red.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have a medium/olive complexion with large pores and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>in all your product has been great at making my skin feel a lot cleaner, however it has an effect where my skin becomes either slightly irritated or red.</li>
            <li>It irritated my skin and my skin became super sensitive and it really burned my skin.</li>
            <li>This is simple and easy to use and it really works.</li>
            <li>Nice product, seems to work  for me a little.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be a little drying when used twice a day, so I just cut it back to night only and it was perfect for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and really clogged pores.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and pores look smaller!</li>
            <li>But this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it on the backs of my hands and am seeing much improvement there too.  </li>
            <li>it made my skin glowing and minimizes the pores so much.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin look smooth and it definitely helps with enlarged pores and hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li>This is not all in one product (but really.. which one is).</li>
            <li>screen: Neutrogena Ultra sheer sun screen (Can&#x27;t stress how important sun screen is for you.</li>
            <li>One practice that improved my acne ten fold is washing my hands with an antibacterial soap before touching my face and using a clean towel to dry my face each time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m two months in, and haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absolutely vanished.  </li>
            <li>So, this might work for some people; as for me, though, this will be going in the trash very soon.</li>
            <li>and I really think it helped with that.  </li>
            <li>It will not make you a different person in my experience, but it does help you stay relevant.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin really looks a lot brighter and one tone</li>
            <li>Really clears skin and clarifies.</li>
            <li>If someone wants 10$ discount, use link [...]</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>We were very close to getting chemical peels and botox...</li>
            <li>Even my hubby said he wants to get a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>product made my skin smooth and my pores much smaller...</li>
            <li>After much research and reading hundreds of reviews I chose to try this 2 percent salacylic acid gel.</li>
            <li>She REALLY loves this whole line of products.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of whiteheads on my forehead and chin - it really helps my forehead but my chin, not so much.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it is real.</li>
            <li>My face is so much softer and visibly smoother.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what I did before PC, tried the exfoliator and have since ordered about 5 other products and have been pleased with them all.</li>
            <li>Actually keeps my pores clean.</li>
            <li>Most acne products dry me out, this really keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it and its cruelty free, that is the BIG bonus for me</li>
            <li>My skin is combination oily, acne prone, and pretty sensitive, but reacts well to salicylic acid products.</li>
            <li>Most of the acne products I have experimented with dried my skin out way too much, and didn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has no smell, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out, is quick and easy to use, and relatively affordable.</li>
            <li>It could take more time for you,or less.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin - this nips breakouts in the bud and keeps my skin smooth and glowing without ever making my skin irritated or red.</li>
            <li>I am a super skeptic about all things beauty related.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone as a starter BHA -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I use this only once a day in the evening as i think any more often would dry out my skin too much.  </li>
            <li>thats gentle enough to work on sensitive skin and resurface pores, the liquid dries quickly still on your skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited because this product isn&#x27;t loaded with alcohol and didn&#x27;t leave my face dry after using it, like a lot of Salicylic acid products.</li>
            <li>My skin flakes a little more than normal -- a result of the BHA.</li>
            <li>Splash face with lukewarm water, pat dry with a clean towel&lt;br</li>
            <li>dry with clean towel</li>
            <li>I have VERY acne prone, sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve really been liking it.</li>
            <li>and it really helps to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>, my skin is really sensitive to pillowcases and this has really helped with my breakouts from that.</li>
            <li>This product does not treat skin spots as far as I know, but it made my skin so much healthier that I started using my treatment again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a tube with a hole in the top, which makes for messy application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a cotton ball because most of the product gets wasted, so I just put some on my hands and pat it on my face.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I am a skincare junkie and never stick with one product always looking for something new to try ...</li>
            <li>I am a new fan of Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li>Caused breakouts...wasted money and left with a huge cyst on my left jaw.</li>
            <li>I wasnt really expecting much when I ordered this, as I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar products over the years.  </li>
            <li>Once this bottle is empty I will most definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>I have literally tried EVERY face product out there and the results were either completely unnoticeable or they would cause my face to break out (in rashes that were basically little water filled bumps) as a reaction to certain ingredients found in some of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that any little open lesion will heal better if I start out treating with straight hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>But this treatment has helped clear out pores and extracting clogged pores has been easier!</li>
            <li>It has now been not even 2 weeks and all I can say is wow!  </li>
            <li>However, sensitive skin users BEWARE!</li>
            <li>Plus, the price is so much better than any other similar product and the bottle</li>
            <li>I had on my chin, forehead and nose were completely gone!</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t love about this product is the consistency - it is extremely watery</li>
            <li>I have used this for a little over a week, and it has already made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I used it before bed, fell asleep with little bumps scattered across my forehead, and awakened with SMOOTH SKIN.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is fine or normal, but I&#x27;ve continued use, because it fades over an hour.</li>
            <li>Your skin will flake a bit for the first few days of use, which is great because you will then know it is exfoliating and removing dead skin cells, leaving your skin prepped for your other treatment products.</li>
            <li>It does clear blackheads to an extent and will exfoliate and give you clearer skin.  </li>
            <li>and I can clearly see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Paula&#x27;s choice clear mattifying spf 30</li>
            <li>It is just a clear liquid that exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li>After using it or a month, my pores appear about 50% smaller and my complexion, which, thanks to the oiliness is prone to break-outs, is clear and seems brighter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes my skin so soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll finish up the bottle and update if anything changes but based on what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I would NOT repurchase.</li>
            <li>Personally this has done so much for my skin</li>
            <li>The purging process lasted around 2 weeks for me before I noticed a considerable improvement.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I am still getting the occasional breakout (hormonal), but they are going away much faster than they used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I at least gave this product</li>
            <li>i have combination sensitive skin type with oily problematic cheek areas  </li>
            <li>I purchased again directly from Paula&#x27;s choice website because it was cheaper with a coupon code.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this frequently, maybe once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and that is about all I need or want to do.</li>
            <li>The redness in my face has almost gone away completely.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate.</li>
            <li>acne-prone, 27 years old, hyper pigmentation from acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>face with water&lt;br /&gt;-boots sensitive skin toner</li>
            <li>If the hydrogen peroxide feels like too much, probably one of the BPO facial washes would work as well.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear of clogged pores, prevents zits, even soothes sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The BHA liquid really goes the extra mile to even out skin tone.</li>
            <li>I put a mist sprayer on the bottle and now spray directly on my face.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone including those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that used to be oily.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have tried almost everything from natural solutions to chemical peels.</li>
            <li>When introducing any new product ALWAYS do a patch test and only introduce 1 new product into your routine at a time so that way if you do have a reaction you will know what is causing it.</li>
            <li>You rarely want to try both for a negative adverse effect and if positive it wont sustain long for consistent results.</li>
            <li>so I avoided that area for a few days at first, but I am convinced this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with oily, acne-prone skin, younger or older, esp.</li>
            <li>I experienced some dryness in the beginning and fixed that by cutting back on the amount of product used.</li>
            <li>I noticed this product working when I first got it, but now that I am almost done not much else has changed.</li>
            <li>directions and applying it before bed normally leaves solid results.</li>
            <li>(Be careful to not use too much or use every day!  </li>
            <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t hurt it, but I actually saw my pores get more clogged and bigger than the previous product I was using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 25, and have average combination skin with pretty frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>My complaint is, like most facial skin care products,  IT IS OVERPRICED!.</li>
            <li>The small bumps on my forehead have also significantly improved.</li>
            <li>The uneven skin texture on my skin is smoother and I rarely have hormonal breakouts anymore - a huge accomplishment since I&#x27;ve tried everything for the last few years.</li>
            <li>This product has literally transformed our old, sun damaged, dried, large pored skin to that of a 30 year old.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR PART OF YOUR DAILY FACIAL CARE ROUTINE.</li>
            <li>Now, 2 weeks later, my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li>I barely use it now, and would return if I could.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have acne aside from occasional breakouts, but I do have enlarged pores and discoloration and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>i barely see them.</li>
            <li>However on a whim I tried the red Stridex pads and wow -</li>
            <li>I will be writing directly to the company to get my money back.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and I am being asked if I am using different moisturizer if I have had Botox.</li>
            <li>i heard it will get worse before it get better.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well on nose black heads (acne) which is notoriously hard to combat.</li>
            <li>I will use this as long as I live.</li>
            <li>I did experience some excessive dryness, but now I moisturize about 15 minutes after applying the BHA, and it seems to help it tremendously.</li>
            <li>I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s absorb quite fast due to its liquid form, again it&#x27;s liquid, no color, I don&#x27;t even smell anything.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product as I am in desperate need of skin resurfacing...</li>
            <li>My face is never dry from this.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin or sting at all.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>Its meant for those with combination oily or mostly normal skin and sensitive types.. as bha is for that aha is for those with dry skin of some sort with dry patches.  </li>
            <li>After one week of use 2 times a day, I can see old red spots have really faded and all the little bumps I had on my temples are gone.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference the first few days  </li>
            <li>The pore normalizing cleanser is great for sensitive combo skin with t zone pores, the skin balancing pore reducing toner are all i use now with q couple of exposed products and maybe an additional rellacement or added spot treatment and the acne treatment serum for the base outside of my face</li>
            <li>Oh right before bed, I use a bit of Nutiva coconut oil on my face, just a small amount, it helps keep my skin balanced.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive,  dry allergy prone skin and had been having lots of problems for awhile now, like hormonal breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it on a large Seborrheic Keratosis (benign, raised wart-like lesion) on my chest -- after two weeks the growth has flattened and become much less obvious.</li>
            <li>i have extremely finicky combination (dry, break-out-prone, sensitive to anything new) skin, and this has cleared my skin up and does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li>In less than a week my skin was back to normal, without a single new flare up.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love Paula&#x27;s choice products and this is one of the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a week and my acne is clearing up so nicely!</li>
            <li> We now both have flawless, smooth, beautiful skin.</li>

            <li> I do follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i use 2x a day with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My sign to stop should have been the tingling feeling, which I thought was a good thing-obviously not.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to wear a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Good product...  </li>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind having to use cotton pads to apply it and don&#x27;t mind the price this is good.</li>

            <li> Truly amazing and worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> I read many great reviews about this product</li>
            <li> A great combo for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is great for some people, but not for all.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> As always Paula&#x27;s choice is fantastic !!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Skins never been better!</li>
            <li> Every day it kept getting better until I went to the beach with makeup on!</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic!</li>
            <li> I will continue using this, for sure!</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Tried this amazing liauid exfoliant as a bzzagent....</li>
            <li> Truly amazing product.</li>
            <li> Paula&#x27;s Choice does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and the redness has greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> and i honestly havent has a breakout since i started using it.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> This is really the best exfoliant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and it was actually effective</li>
            <li> I started using this but then switched to Stridex pads which are just as effective and way easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Murad stopped selling its highly effective Acne Treatment Gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m behond thrilled.</li>
            <li> Really nice product .</li>
            <li> Two stars goes to Amazon for quick delivery and great service as always.</li>
            <li> Depending on your needs though I would highly recommend the product, it smells great and packaging is good.</li>
            <li> I now own a ton of her products and love them all.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want perfect skin which Paula&#x27;s Choice offers.</li>
            <li> They told me it&#x27;s the best stuff so far they&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I wish I could like this because I was so excited to try it after reading all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I went to Amazon and discovered that although there weren&#x27;t many reviews, the reviews were excellent, and the product was within reason as far as cost.</li>
            <li> I experienced an immediate soothing quality from the treatment upon my first application.</li>
            <li> I also know that if you are on the fence, the manufacturer of this product sends free samples of many of their products if you want to give it a try!</li>
            <li> but me thinks it could be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be checking into more Paula&#x27;s Choice products.</li>
            <li> Having said that don&#x27;t expect to get flawless skin only by using this (although in my opinion it can get you quite close to you desired goals).</li>
            <li> /&gt;To check for clogs or acne----The area in which you experience this the most.</li>
            <li> That is not part of the purging process and it is clogging your pores which will invariably lead to more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having said that, my skin is DRAMATICALLY better since using this.</li>
            <li> Already, my skin looks smooth and acne has cleared up!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that after so many years of struggling with cystic acne that I am almost all the way cleared up.  </li>
            <li> (here, the price is so much better) and started using it on my son&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I gave it a shot and was so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> this totally restructures my skin to brilliance use after cleansing and toning for best results</li>
            <li> this is an even better than my 3 year use of exposed tonic.</li>
            <li> I reccomend using finger tips of index or ring finger allows more liberal distribution and also saving product and money plus since product is weightless there is no shine from oily t zone areas because of the thorough pore wall cleansing</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am currently on my second bottle of this stuff and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Like this better than lotions/cleansers with salicylic acid as, for whatever reason, it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I am going to try the 2% BHA Lotion and see how that goes :)</li>
            <li> I now know that some people switched from Stridex to this one and got better luck, so</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding liquid exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it works well without stinging.</li>
            <li> I used this many years ago when Paula was door to door</li>
            <li> Glad to see the quality has changed since then.&lt;br /&gt;Following</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I used it over a month but wasn&#x27;t sure if it made difference or not.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and hope pc never goes out of business!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works best when I only apply it to my forehead, nose, and chin.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love every product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin became so smooth and literally started to glow!</li>
            <li> I started to receive so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous...makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beyond believable.</li>
            <li> Paula, if youre reading this, I want you to know that I love you.</li>
            <li> Its making my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have had so many blemishes on my skin...</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many products.  </li>
            <li> My face looks healthier and more youthful than it has in 20 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many products designed to shrink pores or their appearance and not one worked until I tried Paula&#x27;s Choice.  </li>
            <li> Of the several BHA products I have tried, it appears to be the best.</li>
            <li> My skin still is and will always be a bit oily, but the brightness and clarity is striking</li>
            <li> I really am in love with this quality product.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it lightens my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and I am questioning the quality and if it&#x27;s even safe to use.</li>
            <li> Being a BHA, which should cut through oil and seabum, it made my skin much more oily than before.</li>
            <li> but i got some more on my face :</li>
            <li> but when i stop my face was getting better.</li>
            <li> and they helped me pick a better one for my skin type.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try it!  </li>
            <li> All of Paula&#x27;s Choice products are good, but this is my favorite because it targets my particular skin problems, and it is the most hypo-allergenic for me.</li>
            <li> This is a safe and most effective way to clean your pores out and to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> two weeks i have been using it and it has teansformed my skin into glowing healthy blemish free even toned skin ....</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely incredible, and I would recommend it to anybody who wishes to resolve problems such as blackheads, acne or redness because this truly does work.</li>
            <li> This is the one most important step in my skincare now.</li>
            <li> Enjoy :) http://goo.gl/J5uNbc﻿</li>
            <li> received a sample of this with another purchase and loved it so much that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I received this product as a freebie originally.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the idea of wasting so many hand towels invest in washable face towels so you have a clean one</li>
            <li> I recommend going easy on the application.  </li>
            <li> It is easily aggravated, prone to pimples and lots of blackheads.</li>
            <li> However, I think it was too strong for my skin...</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing, and this product works FAST!</li>
            <li> I honestly noticed smother skin after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I honestly could not recommend a product any higher.</li>
            <li> For all of those who want to start an affordable and effective face routine here is a link for $10OFF your first Paula&#x27;s Choice online order.(http://goo.gl/J5uNbc﻿)</li>
            <li> Here is a good way to patch test a new product:&lt;br /&gt;Where to test:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s good to try new products because you just never know what might be your &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I used to use the Exposed skincare product line but after switching to this which is a higher %, it worked better and was much more affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the best way to control the application is to put a little in the palm of one hand and use your finger tip to lightly dab it on your face.  </li>
            <li> is HUGE.</li>
            <li> I heard such great things I was dying to try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I have recommended this product to close friends and my sister which is why I am comfortable giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to remember that nothing works miracles and it is still an over the counter, mom prescription item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy work its performance and have now bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product, I would definitely recommend anyone to try it out.</li>
            <li> On her site, they also give free samples and have some discount codes.</li>
            <li> Fabulous results, even after years of sunbathing with no sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> The one thing I found absolutely amazing about this product is that it really does unclogs pores.  </li>
            <li> Note to buyers: make sure to buy cotton pads if you don&#x27;t already have them so that you can apply this in the most effective way possible.</li>
            <li> It is certainly light weight like water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and still have nice skin, thanks partly to Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> Keep my skin smooth, reduces breakouts.</li>
            <li> It honestly didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this specific BHA Liquid exfoliant, but a bit nervous about the quality.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using a BHA liquid since my skin is pretty sensitive, but this product has been fabulous and great complement to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Apply BHA lightly with a clean cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Leaving your skin clean and smooth with the ability to penetrate and dissolve the oil sebum inside your pores before turning into blackheads.</li>
            <li> Love this product - it will really brighten up your skin!</li>
            <li> I order mine through Amazon, because I love the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Also noticed after continued use a great decrease in minor breakouts</li>
            <li> My pores were significantly reduced after the first use and my makeup now goes on and  looks so much better.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it that I used it twice a day which ended up drying my skin out,</li>
            <li> The best part is not even advertised....if you have small raised bumps around your hairline, they will be gone after using this.</li>
            <li> It is great for dry</li>
            <li> I also sleep in a clean shirt each night and wash my sheets once a week.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and does not leave my face feeling dry or flaky afterwards.</li>
            <li> My face has became much more clear still clogged pores on my nose and chin but MUCH better.</li>
            <li> My face looked and felt so clean.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will clean up my acne</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on a whim after reading all the positive reviews and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> This has a great consistency, it really sticks to your skin and feels like it&#x27;s soaking in, feels almost nourishing, not tight.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for who suffer from large pores due to oily face or clogged by makeup</li>
            <li> So far I love this product!</li>
            <li> love love love this product .You will see dry flaky skin intially but stick with it for 2-3 days</li>
            <li> Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% BHA Skin Perfection Liquid has completely changed my skin (in the best way possible) and I feel so lucky to have discovered this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and it works just great</li>
            <li> After just a couple of weeks&#x27; use, my 68-year-old skin is much brighter and more evenly-toned.  </li>
            <li> So I bought the full size version</li>
            <li> I really had hoped it would be my miracle cure:)</li>
            <li> It is a true miracle for me.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this because heard it&#x27;s really effective to clear your skin from my buddies.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any complaints using this - no bad skin reactions, seemed to be helping my complexion, etc.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different products for my skin and this it magic.</li>
            <li> , Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many many oil control products from the basic to makeup products but NOTHING compares to this product.</li>
            <li> I dont have to worry about my face being super oily when im out.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product, and I most definitely will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> What I notice most from using this product (still two times daily) is that I have a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked as quickly as this in changing how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super oily with a lot of post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation, and acne-prone around my jawline.</li>
            <li> The product is a good value for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite line.</li>
            <li> Most products don&#x27;t live up to their claims.</li>
            <li> This product has not caused any new breakouts or increased my oil production at all, and it&#x27;s made my face SO SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> This stuff has been a dream come true on getting started back on the road to having nice skin again.  </li>
            <li> I started using this about 2 weeks ago - and noticed an improvement the first day!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as shown, no complaints!</li>
            <li> I have only had amazing experiences with all their products.</li>
            <li> You will be glowing with fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth 5 stars to me.</li>
            <li> The area where you&#x27;re most sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try for anyone who is looking to improve their skin situation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months, and my skin has never looked better in my adult life.</li>
            <li> is clear and smooth and product is lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think there was such a thing.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with the results (1 week use).</li>
            <li> You skin will clear up for sure.  </li>
            <li> However, it is worth every dime</li>
            <li> Works great but is expensive and kind of a hassle to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and am still thrilled by this stuff.</li>
            <li> and you MUST use sunscreen since BHA makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I only wish it were more accessible in my country.. to get it shipped from PC&#x27;s website</li>
            <li> My skin has finally started clearing up even more significantly.</li>
            <li> Paua&#x27;s Choice has other BHA products that have more ingredients and probably do more for your skin, but they  don&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;m allergic to some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Seems to be clearing up my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product - it leaves the skin clearer, brighter and smoother after a single use.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer that you use during the day or every other night can help combat this.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days I could already see a drastic improvement in the blackheads on my nose and the cheek areas right beside the nose.</li>
            <li> It really does clean out pores, and evens out skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time today and after the first use I could see a difference!</li>
            <li> This is the first Paula&#x27;s Choice product I have used and am impressed enough that I plan on trying other ones as well.</li>
            <li> My clinque intense moisture surge doesnt even do the full job anymore.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, laugh lines (not deep ones) have disappeared, and my skin looks a lot more luminous.</li>
            <li> The pores are diminishing, my complexion is more clear and fresher looking, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I did notice that my skin was significantly tighter the first couple of days, so if you&#x27;re naturally prone to dryness be prepared to moisturize more frequently.</li>
            <li> I am over 40, have very fair sensitive skin, and have suffered from acne, and rosacea for 20+ years, as well as having large unsightly pores and embarrassing black heads.  </li>
            <li> Since starting this product, my skin tone has evened out and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product every other day and is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended via the subreddit &amp;#34;skincareaddiction.&amp;#34; I have experienced the so-called &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; with this product, but it has not been harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first product which has ever worked on my 20 y o son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> Bought this on Amazon for my first experience using this brand.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you a bit about my skin.  </li>
            <li> Really helps my Acne!</li>
            <li> I will explain BHAs in a more basic way:&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are allergic to a product you would know pretty instantaneously.</li>
            <li> Favorite product from Paula&#x27;s - Starting using the line about two months ago</li>
            <li> THIS product, however, has done exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product and may consider trying the higher percentage solution for my next bottle.</li>
            <li> product is going to make his 8th grade year SO much easier!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work!  </li>
            <li> THAT was what a BHA was supposed to do, evidently.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I notice I get a lot fewer bumps on my face when I use it consistently.</li>
            <li> and I actually find this BHA liquid works just as well for a much better value.</li>
            <li> But you must stay consistent with application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Ive struggled with acne for the last 8 years of my life, and this (and a better skincare routine) has made my face smooth and completely cleared me of my acne.</li>
            <li> My skin appeared almost bleached in blotches after the first week.</li>
            <li> After the first time using this, I could see a difference in the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a radical difference in my skin texture and pesky hormonal cystic acne after the first use.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it I woke up</li>
            <li> It has only gotten better with each use.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a product that does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Thanks Paula!</li>
            <li> When I received the product there was no safety seal as most of the reviews stated before I purchased which I thought wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I applied it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I had read the good reviews on this product and was very hopeful that it would get rid of my black heads.  </li>
            <li> After just 2 nights using this, the redness was significantly reduced and acne nearly gone.</li>
            <li> After a few more days it appeared to me that this BHA Liquid had also made a HUGE improvement in my pores.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin clear and pores clean.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a cleanser -- it&#x27;s a clear liquid you apply to your skin by a cotton ball after you clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful she developed her own line, and, while I haven&#x27;t used every product, I can definitely vouch for this one-</li>
            <li> I am allergic to fragrances, one common preservative (phenoxyethanol) and many or perhaps most aromatic plant extracts.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, and it does feel a little tacky when it dries, but other than that, absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about a week and already have see positive results.</li>
            <li> if you find other products don&#x27;t work or hurt your skin, as this has been good to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> On special nights out, I scrub my face and put this stuff on, leaving my skin fresh, but not red.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/olive complexion with large pores and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> in all your product has been great at making my skin feel a lot cleaner, however it has an effect where my skin becomes either slightly irritated or red.</li>
            <li> It irritated my skin and my skin became super sensitive and it really burned my skin.</li>
            <li> This is simple and easy to use and it really works.</li>
            <li> Nice product, seems to work  for me a little.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a little drying when used twice a day, so I just cut it back to night only and it was perfect for my skin type.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and really clogged pores.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and pores look smaller!</li>
            <li> But this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it on the backs of my hands and am seeing much improvement there too.  </li>
            <li> it made my skin glowing and minimizes the pores so much.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look smooth and it definitely helps with enlarged pores and hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> This is not all in one product (but really.. which one is).</li>
            <li> screen: Neutrogena Ultra sheer sun screen (Can&#x27;t stress how important sun screen is for you.</li>
            <li> One practice that improved my acne ten fold is washing my hands with an antibacterial soap before touching my face and using a clean towel to dry my face each time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two months in, and haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absolutely vanished.  </li>
            <li> So, this might work for some people; as for me, though, this will be going in the trash very soon.</li>
            <li> and I really think it helped with that.  </li>
            <li> It will not make you a different person in my experience, but it does help you stay relevant.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin really looks a lot brighter and one tone</li>
            <li> Really clears skin and clarifies.</li>
            <li> If someone wants 10$ discount, use link [...]</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> We were very close to getting chemical peels and botox...</li>
            <li> Even my hubby said he wants to get a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> product made my skin smooth and my pores much smaller...</li>
            <li> After much research and reading hundreds of reviews I chose to try this 2 percent salacylic acid gel.</li>
            <li> She REALLY loves this whole line of products.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of whiteheads on my forehead and chin - it really helps my forehead but my chin, not so much.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is real.</li>
            <li> My face is so much softer and visibly smoother.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I did before PC, tried the exfoliator and have since ordered about 5 other products and have been pleased with them all.</li>
            <li> Actually keeps my pores clean.</li>
            <li> Most acne products dry me out, this really keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it and its cruelty free, that is the BIG bonus for me</li>
            <li> My skin is combination oily, acne prone, and pretty sensitive, but reacts well to salicylic acid products.</li>
            <li> Most of the acne products I have experimented with dried my skin out way too much, and didn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has no smell, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out, is quick and easy to use, and relatively affordable.</li>
            <li> It could take more time for you,or less.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin - this nips breakouts in the bud and keeps my skin smooth and glowing without ever making my skin irritated or red.</li>
            <li> I am a super skeptic about all things beauty related.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone as a starter BHA -</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I use this only once a day in the evening as i think any more often would dry out my skin too much.  </li>
            <li> thats gentle enough to work on sensitive skin and resurface pores, the liquid dries quickly still on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited because this product isn&#x27;t loaded with alcohol and didn&#x27;t leave my face dry after using it, like a lot of Salicylic acid products.</li>
            <li> My skin flakes a little more than normal -- a result of the BHA.</li>
            <li> Splash face with lukewarm water, pat dry with a clean towel&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry with clean towel</li>
            <li> I have VERY acne prone, sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve really been liking it.</li>
            <li> and it really helps to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> , my skin is really sensitive to pillowcases and this has really helped with my breakouts from that.</li>
            <li> This product does not treat skin spots as far as I know, but it made my skin so much healthier that I started using my treatment again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a tube with a hole in the top, which makes for messy application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a cotton ball because most of the product gets wasted, so I just put some on my hands and pat it on my face.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I am a skincare junkie and never stick with one product always looking for something new to try ...</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> Caused breakouts...wasted money and left with a huge cyst on my left jaw.</li>
            <li> I wasnt really expecting much when I ordered this, as I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar products over the years.  </li>
            <li> Once this bottle is empty I will most definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I have literally tried EVERY face product out there and the results were either completely unnoticeable or they would cause my face to break out (in rashes that were basically little water filled bumps) as a reaction to certain ingredients found in some of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that any little open lesion will heal better if I start out treating with straight hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> But this treatment has helped clear out pores and extracting clogged pores has been easier!</li>
            <li> It has now been not even 2 weeks and all I can say is wow!  </li>
            <li> However, sensitive skin users BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Plus, the price is so much better than any other similar product and the bottle</li>
            <li> I had on my chin, forehead and nose were completely gone!</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t love about this product is the consistency - it is extremely watery</li>
            <li> I have used this for a little over a week, and it has already made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it before bed, fell asleep with little bumps scattered across my forehead, and awakened with SMOOTH SKIN.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is fine or normal, but I&#x27;ve continued use, because it fades over an hour.</li>
            <li> Your skin will flake a bit for the first few days of use, which is great because you will then know it is exfoliating and removing dead skin cells, leaving your skin prepped for your other treatment products.</li>
            <li> It does clear blackheads to an extent and will exfoliate and give you clearer skin.  </li>
            <li> and I can clearly see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Paula&#x27;s choice clear mattifying spf 30</li>
            <li> It is just a clear liquid that exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li> After using it or a month, my pores appear about 50% smaller and my complexion, which, thanks to the oiliness is prone to break-outs, is clear and seems brighter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes my skin so soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish up the bottle and update if anything changes but based on what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I would NOT repurchase.</li>
            <li> Personally this has done so much for my skin</li>
            <li> The purging process lasted around 2 weeks for me before I noticed a considerable improvement.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I am still getting the occasional breakout (hormonal), but they are going away much faster than they used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I at least gave this product</li>
            <li> i have combination sensitive skin type with oily problematic cheek areas  </li>
            <li> I purchased again directly from Paula&#x27;s choice website because it was cheaper with a coupon code.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this frequently, maybe once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and that is about all I need or want to do.</li>
            <li> The redness in my face has almost gone away completely.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate.</li>
            <li> acne-prone, 27 years old, hyper pigmentation from acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> face with water&lt;br /&gt;-boots sensitive skin toner</li>
            <li> If the hydrogen peroxide feels like too much, probably one of the BPO facial washes would work as well.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin clear of clogged pores, prevents zits, even soothes sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The BHA liquid really goes the extra mile to even out skin tone.</li>
            <li> I put a mist sprayer on the bottle and now spray directly on my face.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone including those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that used to be oily.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have tried almost everything from natural solutions to chemical peels.</li>
            <li> When introducing any new product ALWAYS do a patch test and only introduce 1 new product into your routine at a time so that way if you do have a reaction you will know what is causing it.</li>
            <li> You rarely want to try both for a negative adverse effect and if positive it wont sustain long for consistent results.</li>
            <li> so I avoided that area for a few days at first, but I am convinced this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with oily, acne-prone skin, younger or older, esp.</li>
            <li> I experienced some dryness in the beginning and fixed that by cutting back on the amount of product used.</li>
            <li> I noticed this product working when I first got it, but now that I am almost done not much else has changed.</li>
            <li> directions and applying it before bed normally leaves solid results.</li>
            <li> (Be careful to not use too much or use every day!  </li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t hurt it, but I actually saw my pores get more clogged and bigger than the previous product I was using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 25, and have average combination skin with pretty frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> My complaint is, like most facial skin care products,  IT IS OVERPRICED!.</li>
            <li> The small bumps on my forehead have also significantly improved.</li>
            <li> The uneven skin texture on my skin is smoother and I rarely have hormonal breakouts anymore - a huge accomplishment since I&#x27;ve tried everything for the last few years.</li>
            <li> This product has literally transformed our old, sun damaged, dried, large pored skin to that of a 30 year old.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR PART OF YOUR DAILY FACIAL CARE ROUTINE.</li>
            <li> Now, 2 weeks later, my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> I barely use it now, and would return if I could.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne aside from occasional breakouts, but I do have enlarged pores and discoloration and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> i barely see them.</li>
            <li> However on a whim I tried the red Stridex pads and wow -</li>
            <li> I will be writing directly to the company to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and I am being asked if I am using different moisturizer if I have had Botox.</li>
            <li> i heard it will get worse before it get better.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well on nose black heads (acne) which is notoriously hard to combat.</li>
            <li> I will use this as long as I live.</li>
            <li> I did experience some excessive dryness, but now I moisturize about 15 minutes after applying the BHA, and it seems to help it tremendously.</li>
            <li> I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s absorb quite fast due to its liquid form, again it&#x27;s liquid, no color, I don&#x27;t even smell anything.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product as I am in desperate need of skin resurfacing...</li>
            <li> My face is never dry from this.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin or sting at all.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Its meant for those with combination oily or mostly normal skin and sensitive types.. as bha is for that aha is for those with dry skin of some sort with dry patches.  </li>
            <li> After one week of use 2 times a day, I can see old red spots have really faded and all the little bumps I had on my temples are gone.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference the first few days  </li>
            <li> The pore normalizing cleanser is great for sensitive combo skin with t zone pores, the skin balancing pore reducing toner are all i use now with q couple of exposed products and maybe an additional rellacement or added spot treatment and the acne treatment serum for the base outside of my face</li>
            <li> Oh right before bed, I use a bit of Nutiva coconut oil on my face, just a small amount, it helps keep my skin balanced.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive,  dry allergy prone skin and had been having lots of problems for awhile now, like hormonal breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on a large Seborrheic Keratosis (benign, raised wart-like lesion) on my chest -- after two weeks the growth has flattened and become much less obvious.</li>
            <li> i have extremely finicky combination (dry, break-out-prone, sensitive to anything new) skin, and this has cleared my skin up and does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> In less than a week my skin was back to normal, without a single new flare up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After three weeks of daily application (after showering, occasionally throughout the day if necessary, and after washing my face before bed) my skin is less irritated and many of my blemishes have lessened greatly if not disappeared all together.</li>
            <li> I only use a little, as too much tends to dry out my skin</li>
            <li> otherwise I feel toners (esp this one) in general are too harsh for my sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 72 years old and although my skin isn&#x27;t in terrible shape, time has created less then perfect completion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strong and gave me a small dry skin patch at the bottom corner of my mouth</li>
            <li> Initially my skin felt extra dry around my jaw</li>
            <li> /&gt;BHA exfoliates the skin very well and usually causes dryness</li>
            <li> Also, my bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed which was strange, especially since it&#x27;s being shipped, but from the reviews it seems it never is.</li>
            <li> Long story short....</li>
            <li> The price is a little much, but if I can stop buying all the other crap I have tried on my face and replace it with this, I am pretty sure I am still saving money.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a week along with sebamed clear face gel.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be working well.&lt;br /&gt;The redness of my acne seems to went down, I think it&#x27;s because of this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do your patch test, start using this product and after a few days notice NEW break outs in area</li>
            <li> They are not super soft</li>
            <li> I have had extremely dry, scaly patches on my cheeks with red, irritated skin underneath for years.  </li>
            <li> My skin was soft and less bumpy.</li>
            <li> I truely wish that I had taken a before picture because there is that dramatic of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin a little sensitive</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical because it feels kinda oily/sticky at first.</li>
            <li> Also these pimples took an abnormally long time to heal.</li>
            <li> Same results minus dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wrote a review not that long ago, before I gave this product a chance.</li>
            <li> I carefully researched the condition, purchased The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin</li>
            <li> I can’t tell you how long I have lived with this thinking these bumps are permanent or I needed to see a dermatologist to remove them.  </li>
            <li> I wish I knew this product LONG ago.</li>
            <li> It is not drying (tho my skin is not particularly sensitive), but did cause purging in my oily T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a short time, I feel a slight warmth in the skin which doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Also after daily/ twice a day use for so long my skin has became SO dry.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt my face (just a little sting with the BHA Liquid but nothing like the harsh &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; the doctor prescribed) and my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying several other treatments for post acne marks and inflammation.</li>
            <li> Paula&#x27;s Choice has replaced my use of ProActiv and other commercial skin cleansers.</li>
            <li> I had tried several other suggestions, like BPO alone, sulfur lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> I went through the entire day extremely oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my poor son, 13 years old, had very fair skin and HORRIBLE cystic acne like the giant craters that just lump on his face, and make it red all over too.</li>
            <li> it dose not leave my skin dry or oily.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin though, so it still gets 2 stars.</li>
            <li> but I just pat my skin dry with them versus rubbing.</li>
            <li> side is that it does dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> This product does dry out my face if I use 2times a day</li>
            <li> but I found that when I use once at night it doesnt dry out my face.</li>
            <li> It never feels over dry.  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t dry my face out even though it has salycylic acid in it.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;towels&amp;#34; I use are Kleenex brand single use hand towels.</li>
            <li> and I have not had a single break out.</li>
            <li> Have been using this every single night.</li>
            <li> Pores are smaller and dark spots seem to be lighter too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry, it feels only slightly sticky.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering this again, hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less oily, my red spots have gone down, and my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something that would be less abrasive than physical exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I feel my acne become less and smaller.</li>
            <li> As proof, after cleansing and toning your face, use a regular white cotton round to cleanse again with this product and see the color of what comes off your skin!</li>
            <li> The next morning my cysts were less inflamed.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it already seemed like it had been opened and the bottle was only 3/4 of the way full, so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Good.i use every 5 days but makes very dry skin for me.</li>
            <li> product may be just great for dry skin, but it was awful on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It works by penetrating the pore and essentially &amp;#34;degunking.&amp;#34; This purging process can be a little grueling as the gunk in your face gets pushed out before you see improvements in your skin.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of scars on my face and they are starting to lighten up a little bit.</li>
            <li> Those can be left on the skin a little while, like a mask.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and peely like other BHAs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry at all</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I get deep cysts and pimples about 2 days later, which are hard to get rid of..</li>
            <li> Not much peeling or change in skin tone, should have gotten stronger strength</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would help even things out, but it really just made the dryness worse and the oil countered as well.</li>
            <li> Not very often that I feel like I can see a visible difference when using face products...</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks and my pores are noticeably (to me) smaller.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> The purging can be frustrating because it is almost as if your skin gets worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller in appearance and my black heads are all but gone!  </li>
            <li> Since then, my oily face breaks out way less and looks younger and less irritated.</li>
            <li> my skin felt RAW and I had several pimples on my forehead (an area where I never break out).</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new bottle and plan to use it on the thin round cotton face pads this time instead of just regular cotton balls.</li>
            <li> me, this product performed nothing short of a small miracle (literally).</li>
            <li> It has cleared my skin dramatically and convinced me to try other Paula&#x27;s Choice products.</li>
            <li> Usually if I get a smaller breakout, it will form a head, pop, and be gone within 2-3 days..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Found this product due to a ton of people recommending it on reddit</li>
            <li> I only apply on my t-zone because I started developing small bumps underneath my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> Some of my buddies were suffered from acne or minor skin trouble.</li>
            <li> At that point I was grateful I didn&#x27;t use on any other part of my body yet hopeful this would pass and eventually work.</li>
            <li> so I use every other day</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if there is even anything left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Sadly, if this is your first time using this product, as it was for me, I would not order it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, I wanted this product to work as trusted sources on other products said this is there one go to.</li>
            <li> My skin got a little dry using it once a day, so I&#x27;ve switched to every other day and my skin has never been clearer.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel dry, but with a little bit of moisturizer it is no issue.</li>
            <li> My complexion was looking very rough and muddy.  </li>
            <li> Im in my late 20&#x27;s and have have very oily thick skin.</li>
            <li> It reducing dark spot on my skin after a week.</li>
            <li> not worth the price for me, seeing as how it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using a cotton ball saturated with the liquid because then it is difficult to know how much you&#x27;re using and where it&#x27;s going.  </li>
            <li> I still have bumps and blackheads, however they have gone down and people have noticed that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what our skin would look like if we used any other Paulas Choice products with this!</li>
            <li> This together with the other Balance Line&#x3D; awesomeness!</li>
            <li> I have had these little tiny hard bumps on my forehead for years.  </li>
            <li> While using this product I noticed that those bumps were being pushed up to the surface of my skin and a little hard white mass came out.  </li>
            <li> it has become much less so after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also seems to even out my skin tone and has helped with scarring from previous acne episodes.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t break out often but this made it even less so)</li>
            <li> I bought it, in desperation, because I&#x27;ve struggled with chin cystic acne for three and a half years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used significantly less coverup since discovering this product.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried Proactiv, Rodan &amp; Fields, Philosophy, Clinique...</li>
            <li> Skin tone is evening out and lines are less noticable.</li>
            <li> My pores are significantly less pronounced</li>
            <li> and I have less black heads/ acne after using Paula&#x27;s Choice for 3 months now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is prone to making a mess.</li>
            <li> It feels slightly oily when applied, but it dries after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I use this at night since it stays looking a little shiny.</li>
            <li> know the chemical names and percents can be a little off-putting so</li>
            <li> Sometimes it makes my face a little tacky</li>
            <li> After about a week I noticed that the little bumps and whiteheads</li>
            <li> it left very heavy oily residue on my skin and it actually feels really uncomfortable on my skin</li>
            <li> my opinion, this stuff is fantastic and I would hate to be without it from now on.</li>
            <li> (I know, impatient), and was already discouraged but stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> They stand by their product and their website can help make recommendations for trouble areas.</li>
            <li> I used this for 2 weeks everyday and as the instructions on the label said, and didn&#x27;t see any results....</li>
            <li> This dried out my face like nothing else...</li>
            <li> few ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly viscous texture</li>
            <li> harsh fragrances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being 61 and far from my troubled skin years, I would never have tried something with salicylic acid, but I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> After it dries a few moments I proceed with my routine.</li>
            <li> Using cotton rounds as recommended wastes product, but using fingers is fiddly.</li>
            <li> Less weight onto our skin!</li>
            <li> However, I bought this and the AHA gel together and one of them leaked a little in the package, not sure which one, so when buying liquid products with screw caps over the Internet always proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling for a few years now with clogged pores that have hardened into small bumps all over my skin.</li>
            <li> bottle.&lt;br /&gt;-too expensive to apply with a cotton round (as mentioned above)</li>
            <li> unfortunately the only change I noticed was dried out, flakey, discolored skin.</li>
            <li> , I imagine this is why hydrating agents were placed in this toner, but these agents may cause excessive shine on oily skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paula&#x27;s products are not sexy, but they work.</li>
            <li> No more wasting product in cotton balls.</li>
            <li> I bought this to combat the cystic acne on my chin and cheeks that I&#x27;d been dealing with for the past seven months.</li>
            <li> I use it only at night as I find it to be a weird texture on my skin.</li>
            <li> As a first time purchaser of the product, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, be careful with what you subject your skin to.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t fit my skin, it makes is greasy</li>
            <li> I use a cotton ball and can hardly believe how well it cleanes my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At 40 years old...having both these issues it&#x27;s hard to find a product that works for both.</li>
            <li> Now, about 2 weeks in, I&#x27;m seeing progress on the big lumps, which I was really afraid would pop and scar, but it&#x27;s just slowly disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has reduced my breakouts by at least 50%.</li>
            <li> i will give it a try for at least 2 or 3 months</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really thick</li>
            <li> and it seemed very thin and watery, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Over the past two weeks, it immediately started to dissolve the pesky bumps I was dealing with!</li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> I had a break out of sebaceous acne on my chin and neck and black heads in random spots before I started using it 4 days ago.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves an oily residue afterwards which is not good for me as I have oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> so I was afraid it would make those dry patches worse if I used it.  </li>
            <li> Behind your ear&lt;br</li>
            <li> She prescribed mirvaso ($90.00 cream) that hurt my face and made the condition worse.</li>
            <li> Helped me switch up my routine once I realized what ingredients were possibly irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Seal was broken when I got it</li>
            <li> I had terrible acne skin these days but it changed only in 3 times try!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been on medication that did nothing, and tried proactive and Swiss just, both with temporary, mediocre results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 days of adding this product to my sons cleaning routine (still using the proactive system)</li>
            <li> it can peel and be nasty oily all at the same time.</li>
            <li> But for what is advertised, I am slightly sad that my skin still has these problems.</li>
            <li> Unable to use rest of product.</li>
            <li> I am just about 70, and have had &#x27;difficult&#x27; skin forever.</li>
            <li> and I find it difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I have always had terrible problem skin, some parts being too dry, some too oily.</li>
            <li> This product broke me out like crazy.</li>
            <li> ponds cold cream to take off makeup</li>
            <li> The bad news after a month of using this product I can&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> really bad...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> so I decide to return it. :(</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> smells nasty and been using for a week, doesn&#x27;t have any effect.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s makes my skin so soft and clear. I have combination acne prone skin. Most acne products dry me out, this really keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I get deep cysts and pimples about 2 days later, which are hard to get rid of..I really wanted to love this product as I am in desperate need of skin resurfacing...but me thinks it could be better. I barely use it now, and would return if I could. I basically mix it now with my face wash to deep cleanse once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It did reduce my under eye millia about 20% so the acids do help.</li>
            <li> This is the first product which has ever worked on my 20 y o son&#x27;s acne. I have this product on order constantly....wish the bottle was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Love this product - it will really brighten up your skin! You will be glowing with fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant cause I didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react. I have oily skin and really clogged pores. I tried it for the first time today and after the first use I could see a difference! My face feels smooth and pores look smaller! Don&#x27;t hesitate, it&#x27;s amazing! I wish I had this years ago. I will use this as long as I live. And it&#x27;s so cheap compared to other products. Do your skin a favor, and try this</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no help for me</li>
            <li> I wasnt really expecting much when I ordered this, as I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar products over the years.  But this stuff really works.  After just a couple of weeks&#x27; use, my 68-year-old skin is much brighter and more evenly-toned.  Pores are smaller and dark spots seem to be lighter too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it on the backs of my hands and am seeing much improvement there too.  I&#x27;ve also been using it on a large Seborrheic Keratosis (benign, raised wart-like lesion) on my chest -- after two weeks the growth has flattened and become much less obvious.</li>
            <li> Bought this on Mar 5 (about 2 months ago) and have used almost every day and almost 2x daily (morning and night). I don&#x27;t have acne aside from occasional breakouts, but I do have enlarged pores and discoloration and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. This didn&#x27;t cause any reaction to my skin and it wasn&#x27;t drying for me but I also can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s actually helping in any way. I&#x27;ll finish up the bottle and update if anything changes but based on what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I would NOT repurchase. Also, my bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed which was strange, especially since it&#x27;s being shipped, but from the reviews it seems it never is.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with blackheads on my nose. I Googled it and this product was on one of those &amp;#34;Best 10&amp;#34; lists. I went to Amazon and discovered that although there weren&#x27;t many reviews, the reviews were excellent, and the product was within reason as far as cost. I have never used anything from Paula&#x27;s Choice, but I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product performed nothing short of a small miracle (literally). Within 2 days I could already see a drastic improvement in the blackheads on my nose and the cheek areas right beside the nose. After a few more days it appeared to me that this BHA Liquid had also made a HUGE improvement in my pores. When my daughter came to visit I showed her this product and raved about what it had done for my blackheads, because she also has a problem with that. She said, &amp;#34;Where the biggest different jumps out at me, Mom, is the pores on your face.&amp;#34; I replied that I had thought that too but figured maybe it was just wishful thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this stuff is fantastic and I would hate to be without it from now on. I&#x27;m going to be checking into more Paula&#x27;s Choice products.</li>
            <li> Not much peeling or change in skin tone, should have gotten stronger strength</li>
            <li> As always Paula&#x27;s choice is fantastic !!</li>
            <li> Bought this on Amazon for my first experience using this brand. It has cleared my skin dramatically and convinced me to try other Paula&#x27;s Choice products. Since then, my oily face breaks out way less and looks younger and less irritated. I use this at night since it stays looking a little shiny. Highly recommend it if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had flesh coloured bumps on my cheeks that didn&#x27;t seem to go away. It has helped with that but I am not a big fan of using toners on the regular. I will definitely keep this in my cabinet for those emergency times my skin needs saving from a breakout otherwise I feel toners (esp this one) in general are too harsh for my sensitive, combination skin. Depending on your needs though I would highly recommend the product, it smells great and packaging is good. Delivered on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you a bit about my skin.  I am over 40, have very fair sensitive skin, and have suffered from acne, and rosacea for 20+ years, as well as having large unsightly pores and embarrassing black heads.  I had read the good reviews on this product and was very hopeful that it would get rid of my black heads.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference the first few days  (I know, impatient), and was already discouraged but stuck with it.  It has now been not even 2 weeks and all I can say is wow!  My pores are smaller in appearance and my black heads are all but gone!  I truely wish that I had taken a before picture because there is that dramatic of a difference.  The only reason that I am not giving this 5 stars is that it is drying out my skin a bit.  I  have combination skin, so I don&#x27;t know if everyone would have this issue.  I use this only once a day in the evening as i think any more often would dry out my skin too much.  I do follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this stuff works. i have extremely finicky combination (dry, break-out-prone, sensitive to anything new) skin, and this has cleared my skin up and does not cause irritation. i use 2x a day with a good moisturizer. i won&#x27;t be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is very effective but takes Time</li>
            <li> Really helps my Acne! Noticed a big difference. I can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> the perfect product ever. I&#x27;ve used so many different products for my skin and this it magic. it is the best among so many brands. i use it twice a day under my makeup in the morning and under my BP lotion before i go o sleep. it made my skin glowing and minimizes the pores so much. i barely see them. it dose not leave my skin dry or oily. its just perfect.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I had terrible acne skin these days but it changed only in 3 times try! Seriously... I gotta use paula&#x27;s product only</li>
            <li> It is about the product itself, not anything related to the seller.  It irritated my skin and my skin became super sensitive and it really burned my skin.</li>
            <li> No. I hate it. It burns my face. I heard such great things I was dying to try it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a product that will stay in my skincare routine for a while. This makes my skin look smooth and it definitely helps with enlarged pores and hyperpigmentation.  If you have problems with blackheads this is a must! .. Having said that don&#x27;t expect to get flawless skin only by using this (although in my opinion it can get you quite close to you desired goals). You have to build an affective routine to nourish your skin. This is not all in one product (but really.. which one is). If you do not suffer from the symptoms given in the description this product will not be for you. I am stressing this because a lot of the time we read these incredible reviews and we get carried away and don&#x27;t think about if this could be beneficial given the skin problems we are trying to address. Assess your skin and give it what it needs. Personally this has done so much for my skin I only wish it were more accessible in my country.. to get it shipped from PC&#x27;s website I have to pay 50USD for shipping alone.. which is quite a bummer.</li>
            <li> My skin got a little dry using it once a day, so I&#x27;ve switched to every other day and my skin has never been clearer. It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> Since I use my skin looks beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Love Paula&#x27;s choice products and this is one of the best!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination oily, acne prone, and pretty sensitive, but reacts well to salicylic acid products. I read many great reviews about this product so I was excited to try it!  However, I think it was too strong for my skin... after about a week of using it (once a day) my skin felt RAW and I had several pimples on my forehead (an area where I never break out). Also these pimples took an abnormally long time to heal. Usually if I get a smaller breakout, it will form a head, pop, and be gone within 2-3 days.. these took over a week to even minimize. After 2 weeks of trial, I had to give up on this. It didn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin though, so it still gets 2 stars. However, sensitive skin users BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on a whim after reading all the positive reviews and I am so glad that I did. This product is definitely worth 5 stars to me. I was hesitant about chemical exfoliation but I wanted something that would be less abrasive than physical exfoliation. This product delivered that. It has evened out my skin tone, improved the size of my pores and did not irritate my acne in the process. Another plus that I was not expecting is that where my T-Zone would be oily halfway through my workday it has become much less so after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I know the chemical names and percents can be a little off-putting so I will explain BHAs in a more basic way:&lt;br /&gt;BHA is an acronym for Beta Hydroxy acid. It works by penetrating the pore and essentially &amp;#34;degunking.&amp;#34; This purging process can be a little grueling as the gunk in your face gets pushed out before you see improvements in your skin. The purging process lasted around 2 weeks for me before I noticed a considerable improvement. It could take more time for you,or less. My skincare routine for my combination skin goes as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.M.&lt;br /&gt;Wash hands with anti-bacterial soap&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse: Splash face with lukewarm water, pat dry with a clean towel&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation: BHA, wait 10-20 minutes for it to dry&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize: Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel (Miracle moisturizer for my combination skin. Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff!)&lt;br /&gt;Sun screen: Neutrogena Ultra sheer sun screen (Can&#x27;t stress how important sun screen is for you. Please, please use it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.M.&lt;br /&gt;After shower so I don&#x27;t wash my hands&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse: CereVe Hydrating facial cleanser, pat dry with clean towel&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation: Apply BHA lightly with a clean cotton ball. Wait 10-20 minutes to dry&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize: Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel&lt;br /&gt;Spot treatment: Body Shop tea tree oil spot treatment for any acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important things to remember:&lt;br /&gt;1. When introducing any new product ALWAYS do a patch test and only introduce 1 new product into your routine at a time so that way if you do have a reaction you will know what is causing it. Here is a good way to patch test a new product:&lt;br /&gt;Where to test:&lt;br /&gt;To see if you&#x27;re allergic---- Behind your ear&lt;br /&gt;To check for irritation---The area where you&#x27;re most sensitive.  For me this is around my mouth&lt;br /&gt;To check for clogs or acne----The area in which you experience this the most. For me this was around my hair line and cheeks&lt;br /&gt;If you are allergic to a product you would know pretty instantaneously. Irritation and clogged pores can sometime take up to a month. You know your skin best so always do your patch test and follow your instincts. You can always stop use if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Everyone has different skin and don&#x27;t be discouraged if this product does not work for you. If BHA does not work for you try AHA. It is great for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. I experienced some dryness in the beginning and fixed that by cutting back on the amount of product used. Same results minus dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The purging can be frustrating because it is almost as if your skin gets worse before it gets better. If you do your patch test, start using this product and after a few days notice NEW break outs in area you never had them before I would discontinue use immediately. That is not part of the purging process and it is clogging your pores which will invariably lead to more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. One practice that improved my acne ten fold is washing my hands with an antibacterial soap before touching my face and using a clean towel to dry my face each time. I also sleep in a clean shirt each night and wash my sheets once a week. The &amp;#34;towels&amp;#34; I use are Kleenex brand single use hand towels. They are not super soft but I just pat my skin dry with them versus rubbing. If you don&#x27;t like the idea of wasting so many hand towels invest in washable face towels so you have a clean one eachtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have recommended this product to close friends and my sister which is why I am comfortable giving it 5 stars. Once this bottle is empty I will most definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review not that long ago, before I gave this product a chance. I was excited because this product isn&#x27;t loaded with alcohol and didn&#x27;t leave my face dry after using it, like a lot of Salicylic acid products. That is the great news. The bad news after a month of using this product I can&#x27;t anymore. This product broke me out like crazy. I went from a pimple here and there, to massive cystic like bumps all over my face (I am talking the size of m&amp;ms).i went to my dermatologist and she told me to discontinue this liquid. My sign to stop should have been the tingling feeling, which I thought was a good thing-obviously not.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and saw my dermatologist. She prescribed mirvaso ($90.00 cream) that hurt my face and made the condition worse. I carefully researched the condition, purchased The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid, Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream. It didn&#x27;t hurt my face (just a little sting with the BHA Liquid but nothing like the harsh &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; the doctor prescribed) and my skin is much improved. I use the Blueberry Soy as a day moisturizer too and add MD Solar Sciences Tinted Mineral Beauty Balm SPF 50. I was not paid for this review and I don&#x27;t write them often but the products made such a difference I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li> Favorite product from Paula&#x27;s - Starting using the line about two months ago and I have not had a single break out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying several other treatments for post acne marks and inflammation. I think it&#x27;s important to remember that nothing works miracles and it is still an over the counter, mom prescription item. Having said that, my skin is DRAMATICALLY better since using this. I used it twice daily after cleaning and befofe moisturizing and there is a noticeable difference in not only the pigmentation, but also the number of breakouts I get as well as the overall tone and clarity of my skin. I&#x27;m really happy work its performance and have now bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li> It reducing dark spot on my skin after a week. This is awesome! Definitely will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and does not leave my face feeling dry or flaky afterwards. Would reccommend to anybody looking for an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended via the subreddit &amp;#34;skincareaddiction.&amp;#34; I have experienced the so-called &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; with this product, but it has not been harsh on my skin. My skin feels great after using, and I am already noticing a difference in my face! (I combine this product with CerAve&#x27;s face cleanser and moisturizing lotion.)</li>
            <li> I was so happy with  &amp;#34;Paula&#x27;s Choice Clinical Scar Treatment Gel with Quercetin &amp; Vitamin C&amp;#34; that I wanted to try this BHA skin perfecting exfoliant. I was very disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t fit my skin, it makes is greasy and I shine like as if I had dumped my face in oil with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BHA exfoliates the skin very well and usually causes dryness, I imagine this is why hydrating agents were placed in this toner, but these agents may cause excessive shine on oily skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may be just great for dry skin, but it was awful on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product! I have VERY acne prone, sensitive, combination skin. I had a break out of sebaceous acne on my chin and neck and black heads in random spots before I started using it 4 days ago. Already, my skin looks smooth and acne has cleared up! My skin is getting smoother everyday and it really helps with wrinkles too. This will be a mainstay in my skincare regimen. I always wear an SPF 50, and have no issues with sun sensitivity. I use this product every a.m. and p.m. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I did before PC, tried the exfoliator and have since ordered about 5 other products and have been pleased with them all. They stand by their product and their website can help make recommendations for trouble areas.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have extremely sensitive,  dry allergy prone skin and had been having lots of problems for awhile now, like hormonal breakouts.  My complexion was looking very rough and muddy.  This stuff has been a dream come true on getting started back on the road to having nice skin again.  The texture and clarity I have after using one bottle is impressive.  Worth a try for anyone who is looking to improve their skin situation.</li>
            <li> One of the best skin care products I have ever purchased! I have been struggling for a few years now with clogged pores that have hardened into small bumps all over my skin. I have been to several dermatologists and multiple prescriptions have done nothing to help except peel my skin and make me break out into cysts. THIS product, however, has done exactly what it advertises. I apply it every evening after I wash my face with cleanser and use a toner. I just use my hand to save product and by morning, my face is brighter and I can visibly see a reduction in my pore size. Over the past two weeks, it immediately started to dissolve the pesky bumps I was dealing with! It also seems to even out my skin tone and has helped with scarring from previous acne episodes. It feels slightly oily when applied, but it dries after a few minutes. I am starting to apply it along with my regular morning routine and have noticed that throughout the day, my skin looks vibrant and actually less oily despite the way it may feel when applying. Great product, I would definitely recommend anyone to try it out. I also know that if you are on the fence, the manufacturer of this product sends free samples of many of their products if you want to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it and its cruelty free, that is the BIG bonus for me</li>
            <li> This product has changed my skin.  I cannot believe that after so many years of struggling with cystic acne that I am almost all the way cleared up.  I am so in love with this product and may consider trying the higher percentage solution for my next bottle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say wnough about this product. My daughter received a sample in her birchbox, and within days the acne she&#x27;s had on her chin for a year was GONE. So I bought the full size version (here, the price is so much better) and started using it on my son&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my poor son, 13 years old, had very fair skin and HORRIBLE cystic acne like the giant craters that just lump on his face, and make it red all over too. He&#x27;s been on medication that did nothing, and tried proactive and Swiss just, both with temporary, mediocre results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 days of adding this product to my sons cleaning routine (still using the proactive system) ALL of the blackheads and tiny red pimples had disappeared.  Now, about 2 weeks in, I&#x27;m seeing progress on the big lumps, which I was really afraid would pop and scar, but it&#x27;s just slowly disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is going to make his 8th grade year SO much easier! Thank you!</li>
            <li> AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the best word to describe this product.  I used it before bed, fell asleep with little bumps scattered across my forehead, and awakened with SMOOTH SKIN.  No lie here.  Anyone with distressed skin should give this product a whirl.  Paula&#x27;s Choice has replaced my use of ProActiv and other commercial skin cleansers.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product. It has greatly reduced my pore size. However, it leaves an oily residue afterwards which is not good for me as I have oily and acne prone skin. In the future, I will probably try a formula for my specific skin concerns. I would highly recommend this to anyone as a starter BHA - it&#x27;s amazing! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m almost 25, and have average combination skin with pretty frequent breakouts. Most of the acne products I have experimented with dried my skin out way too much, and didn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin regimen has changed to a very basic cleanser (currently using Cerave), the 2% BHA liquid and Cerave PM moisturizer. I only use the 2% BHA liquid at night. I have been using this product for about two months, and my skin has never looked better in my adult life. I am still getting the occasional breakout (hormonal), but they are going away much faster than they used to. The product is a good value for how long it lasts. I&#x27;m two months in, and haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product for those who are struggling to find a skin product that can help with blemishes without drying skin out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: You can go on the Paula&#x27;s Choice website, and they have a Beautypedia with plenty of reviews on different products. Helped me switch up my routine once I realized what ingredients were possibly irritating my skin. On her site, they also give free samples and have some discount codes. I order mine through Amazon, because I love the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a week along with sebamed clear face gel.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be working well.&lt;br /&gt;The redness of my acne seems to went down, I think it&#x27;s because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this product due to a ton of people recommending it on reddit</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon paulas website looking for a review and eventually decided to try something from her line. This was my first purchase. Its been probably 3-4 months and i honestly havent has a breakout since i started using it. Its done all it claims to do! I now own a ton of her products and love them all. Skins never been better!</li>
            <li> I have had extremely dry, scaly patches on my cheeks with red, irritated skin underneath for years.  It has been a constant battle.  I had tried countless moisturizers on these patches and nothing ever worked.  I ended up getting the Paula&#x27;s choice BHA liquid as a sample in my Birchbox shipment and I noticed that it had salicylic acid in it so I was afraid it would make those dry patches worse if I used it.  Nonetheless, I gave it a shot and was so glad I did.  Two days later - scaly patches and red irritated skin was GONE!  It absolutely vanished.  A bonus is that my pores truly do look smaller and my skin seems firmer.  I&#x27;m 45 years old and I&#x27;ll take the firming effect, thank you!  LOL  Anyway, it&#x27;s good to try new products because you just never know what might be your &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Tried this amazing liauid exfoliant as a bzzagent....two weeks i have been using it and it has teansformed my skin into glowing healthy blemish free even toned skin ....love love love this product .You will see dry flaky skin intially but stick with it for 2-3 days and you will see the difference . I am a skincare junkie and never stick with one product always looking for something new to try ...but this i will stick to ...best part is you can layer products on it like moisturizers and even makeup ....A must try if you dont have aspirin allergy.</li>
            <li> I used this for 2 weeks everyday and as the instructions on the label said, and didn&#x27;t see any results....not worth the price for me, seeing as how it didn&#x27;t work out. Then again, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you&#x27;ve got to try some things. So, this might work for some people; as for me, though, this will be going in the trash very soon.</li>
            <li> This dried out my face like nothing else... I really had hoped it would be my miracle cure:) But don&#x27;t we always want miracle cures. I have combination skin... it can peel and be nasty oily all at the same time. I&#x27;m glad I at least gave this product a chance- I was hoping it would help even things out, but it really just made the dryness worse and the oil countered as well.</li>
            <li> i have combination sensitive skin type with oily problematic cheek areas  this totally restructures my skin to brilliance use after cleansing and toning for best results this is an even better than my 3 year use of exposed tonic. Its meant for those with combination oily or mostly normal skin and sensitive types.. as bha is for that aha is for those with dry skin of some sort with dry patches.  You rarely want to try both for a negative adverse effect and if positive it wont sustain long for consistent results. I reccomend using finger tips of index or ring finger allows more liberal distribution and also saving product and money plus since product is weightless there is no shine from oily t zone areas because of the thorough pore wall cleansing this is the only product i know thats gentle enough to work on sensitive skin and resurface pores, the liquid dries quickly still on your skin. The pore normalizing cleanser is great for sensitive combo skin with t zone pores, the skin balancing pore reducing toner are all i use now with q couple of exposed products and maybe an additional rellacement or added spot treatment and the acne treatment serum for the base outside of my face</li>
            <li> Nice product, seems to work  for me a little.</li>
            <li> It is working like a miracle on my skin. I also like it as this never irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Changes your skin after one use. The pores shrink overnight. However the results are not permanent you have to continue using it. I purchased again directly from Paula&#x27;s choice website because it was cheaper with a coupon code.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it.  This stuff really does work!  I have rosacea and I really think it helped with that.  I have used prescription products that did not work as well.  It does clear blackheads to an extent and will exfoliate and give you clearer skin.  I recommend going easy on the application.  I have accidentally over-applied it and ended up a bit red the next day or two.  I think the best way to control the application is to put a little in the palm of one hand and use your finger tip to lightly dab it on your face.  I don&#x27;t recommend using a cotton ball saturated with the liquid because then it is difficult to know how much you&#x27;re using and where it&#x27;s going.  I don&#x27;t use this frequently, maybe once or twice a month.  I have sensitive skin and that is about all I need or want to do.</li>
            <li> I am currently on my second bottle of this stuff and it&#x27;s awesome. There&#x27;s just one drawback in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very few ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly viscous texture&lt;br /&gt;-non-drying, non-irritating&lt;br /&gt;-no harsh fragrances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-not a fan of the packaging. It&#x27;s just a tube with a hole in the top, which makes for messy application. I don&#x27;t use a cotton ball because most of the product gets wasted, so I just put some on my hands and pat it on my face. This stuff is prone to making a mess. I wish it would come in a pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;-too expensive to apply with a cotton round (as mentioned above)</li>
            <li> Started using this after I wash my face and within a week the --always been there--blackheads on my nose improved immensely. Also noticed after continued use a great decrease in minor breakouts (I don&#x27;t break out often but this made it even less so) Very nice. Like this better than lotions/cleansers with salicylic acid as, for whatever reason, it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin. Haven&#x27;t seen a great decrease in age spots/freckles/skin discoloration yet but....</li>
            <li> GREAT! I feel my acne become less and smaller.</li>
            <li> I noticed this product working when I first got it, but now that I am almost done not much else has changed. I still have bumps and blackheads, however they have gone down and people have noticed that. But for what is advertised, I am slightly sad that my skin still has these problems. Also after daily/ twice a day use for so long my skin has became SO dry. My clinque intense moisture surge doesnt even do the full job anymore. :( I am going to try the 2% BHA Lotion and see how that goes :)</li>
            <li> I think this stuff did a lot for me. I am a guy pushing 60. This is simple and easy to use and it really works. It will not make you a different person in my experience, but it does help you stay relevant.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any complaints using this - no bad skin reactions, seemed to be helping my complexion, etc. However on a whim I tried the red Stridex pads and wow - THAT was what a BHA was supposed to do, evidently. I now know that some people switched from Stridex to this one and got better luck, so who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, this gets a &amp;#34;Meh.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Seems to be clearing up my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin. I have sensitive skin - this nips breakouts in the bud and keeps my skin smooth and glowing without ever making my skin irritated or red.</li>
            <li> Have been using this every single night. My face is clearer, smoother, no breakouts. I absolutely recommend this product. I cleanse with Neutrogena anti-wrinkle, then use this, and then Roc multi correxion...have been doing this same routine for about 1 year. Fabulous results, even after years of sunbathing with no sunscreen. I think I look younger than my 49 years. Highly recommend. Oh right before bed, I use a bit of Nutiva coconut oil on my face, just a small amount, it helps keep my skin balanced.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and peely like other BHAs I&#x27;ve tried. So far I&#x27;ve really been liking it.</li>
            <li> This product reduces pores, blackheads, and pimples. Sometimes it makes my face a little tacky so I only use it in my evening routine.</li>
            <li> Im in my late 20&#x27;s and have have very oily thick skin. My face has became much more clear still clogged pores on my nose and chin but MUCH better. The redness in my face has almost gone away completely. I will not go without this product. *I also started using Glytone face wash and Skyroad exfoliating bath mitten at the same time. Those products are great too.</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;All in all your product has been great at making my skin feel a lot cleaner, however it has an effect where my skin becomes either slightly irritated or red. I&#x27;m not sure if this is fine or normal, but I&#x27;ve continued use, because it fades over an hour.</li>
            <li> Not very often that I feel like I can see a visible difference when using face products...but with this stuff, I definitely did!!! My skin is smoother, laugh lines (not deep ones) have disappeared, and my skin looks a lot more luminous. It&#x27;s a little strong and gave me a small dry skin patch at the bottom corner of my mouth so I avoided that area for a few days at first, but I am convinced this stuff is the real deal. I will definitely be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Incredible product! I am on my 3rd bottle now and I can clearly see the difference in my skin. Brighter and fresher complexion. As proof, after cleansing and toning your face, use a regular white cotton round to cleanse again with this product and see the color of what comes off your skin! Pretty amazing! Your skin will flake a bit for the first few days of use, which is great because you will then know it is exfoliating and removing dead skin cells, leaving your skin prepped for your other treatment products. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and still have issues with acne. I started using this about 2 weeks ago - and noticed an improvement the first day! Now, 2 weeks later, my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a week and my acne is clearing up so nicely! I have a lot of scars on my face and they are starting to lighten up a little bit. My face is never dry from this.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding liquid exfoliant.  Very effective and does not irritate my skin. This was my second bottle.  Will repurchase. Again and again.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it but not something I will incorporate into my daily skincare route.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.  It isn&#x27;t really thick and it really helps to keep my skin clear.  I love, love, love it.  Plus, the price is so much better than any other similar product and the bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> I notice I get a lot fewer bumps on my face when I use it consistently. Actually keeps my pores clean. Lasts forever too.</li>
            <li> After one week of use 2 times a day, I can see old red spots have really faded and all the little bumps I had on my temples are gone.  My skin really looks a lot brighter and one tone</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Paula&#x27;s products are not sexy, but they work. This has a great consistency, it really sticks to your skin and feels like it&#x27;s soaking in, feels almost nourishing, not tight. I also use Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic and retinol serum and I actually find this BHA liquid works just as well for a much better value. It can be drying if you use it day and night so I started using it just at night, my skin is really sensitive to pillowcases and this has really helped with my breakouts from that. Will definitely buy again. However, I bought this and the AHA gel together and one of them leaked a little in the package, not sure which one, so when buying liquid products with screw caps over the Internet always proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works well without stinging. My skin is very dry and it works just great</li>
            <li> I used this many years ago when Paula was door to door and you couldn&#x27;t get it online. Glad to see the quality has changed since then.&lt;br /&gt;Following directions and applying it before bed normally leaves solid results. Works amazingly well on nose black heads (acne) which is notoriously hard to combat. But you must stay consistent with application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side is that it does dry your skin out. A good moisturizer that you use during the day or every other night can help combat this.</li>
            <li> Caused breakouts...wasted money and left with a huge cyst on my left jaw. Unable to use rest of product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 weeks now.  I only use it at night before I go to bed.  I found this product to be a little drying when used twice a day, so I just cut it back to night only and it was perfect for my skin type.  The one thing I found absolutely amazing about this product is that it really does unclogs pores.  I have had these little tiny hard bumps on my forehead for years.  I have tried everything to get rid of them and nothing seemed to work.  While using this product I noticed that those bumps were being pushed up to the surface of my skin and a little hard white mass came out.  Now my bumps are gone.  I can’t tell you how long I have lived with this thinking these bumps are permanent or I needed to see a dermatologist to remove them.  Truly amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely incredible, and I would recommend it to anybody who wishes to resolve problems such as blackheads, acne or redness because this truly does work. Note to buyers: make sure to buy cotton pads if you don&#x27;t already have them so that you can apply this in the most effective way possible.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Exposed skincare product line but after switching to this which is a higher %, it worked better and was much more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;This I apply once a day during the start of my day and then follow up with the 5% Benzoyl Peroxide from PC. A great combo for sure.</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of Paula&#x27;s Choice. This makes my face glow like back when I was 20.</li>
            <li> BHA works great for my skin. I only use a little, as too much tends to dry out my skin but that is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is clear and smooth and product is lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping. Keeps your skin clear and pores clean.</li>
            <li> Great toner for a couple times a week. Really clears skin and clarifies. Don&#x27;t forget to wear a good sunscreen. I use Cerave, you can get it at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Paula Begoun since she wrote her Beauty Bible books.  I&#x27;m so grateful she developed her own line, and, while I haven&#x27;t used every product, I can definitely vouch for this one- it&#x27;s terrific.  It does exactly what it claims on the bottle.  I no longer have to squeeze the junk out of my blackheads.  The sebum is simply gone.  Way to go, Paula!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Ive always had problems with blackheads and whiteheads concentrated on my nose and around nose area. It was bumpy where even when I wore makeup it didnt cover it but accentuated the areas... really bad... I would have to constantly wipe my nose with oil paper or something because even after an hour or so either washing my face or putting makeup, the area would be shiny as a sun..Ive tried many many oil control products from the basic to makeup products but NOTHING compares to this product. It is a true miracle for me. I dont have to worry about my face being super oily when im out. I still have to blot once or twice when im out  but thats not a problem compare to before where i was blotting 20 times a day. This product does dry out my face if I use 2times a day but I found that when I use once at night it doesnt dry out my face. Also it says pore minimizing but for me it doesnt seem to do it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product, and I most definitely will continue to use it! I am just about 70, and have had &#x27;difficult&#x27; skin forever. I have been using this for a couple of months, and my skin continues to improve. The pores are diminishing, my complexion is more clear and fresher looking, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is certainly light weight like water and you won&#x27;t feel something is applied to your face. I used it over a month but wasn&#x27;t sure if it made difference or not. I may buy again and use it for longer time or may buy 4% bha bottle. I would certainly recommend it. If someone wants 10$ discount, use link [...]</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT! HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR PART OF YOUR DAILY FACIAL CARE ROUTINE.</li>
            <li> Good product...  Does what it says.</li>
            <li> I am blown away by the efficacy of this product. I bought it, in desperation, because I&#x27;ve struggled with chin cystic acne for three and a half years now. I finally found something that works! I experienced an immediate soothing quality from the treatment upon my first application. The next morning my cysts were less inflamed. Every day it kept getting better until I went to the beach with makeup on! Needless to say, be careful with what you subject your skin to. After my post beach breakout, I faithfully applied this morning and night. Two weeks later I have three tiny pimples that are on the brink of fully healing. I only apply on my t-zone because I started developing small bumps underneath my cheekbones. But this treatment has helped clear out pores and extracting clogged pores has been easier! The small bumps on my forehead have also significantly improved. Every morning I wake up with a glow. I love this stuff and hope pc never goes out of business!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type: combo, acne-prone, 27 years old, hyper pigmentation from acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My am routine is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Wash face with water&lt;br /&gt;-boots sensitive skin toner&lt;br /&gt;-bha 2% on t-zone (apply w fingers and pat in)&lt;br /&gt;- vitamin c serum&lt;br /&gt;-Paula&#x27;s choice clear mattifying spf 30 lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Pm routine is this:&lt;br /&gt;- ponds cold cream to take off makeup (w washcloth)&lt;br /&gt;-Boscia face wash&lt;br /&gt;-bha 2% on t-zone&lt;br /&gt;-neutrogena on the spot acne treatment on forehead&lt;br /&gt;-vitamin c serum&lt;br /&gt;- jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-*****update 9/25/15******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost been three months since using this. My skin has finally started clearing up even more significantly. The uneven skin texture on my skin is smoother and I rarely have hormonal breakouts anymore - a huge accomplishment since I&#x27;ve tried everything for the last few years. I stopped applying this to my entire face. Every time I did I would break out on my cheeks and upper lip. It works best when I only apply it to my forehead, nose, and chin. This stuff is great. I love it and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite line. Love every product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Since starting this product, my skin tone has evened out and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the fine lines on my forehead. I will definitely be ordering this again, hands down.</li>
            <li> This product really works. It took about 6 weeks to see the results, now I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> Literally shrinks your pores. One of my all time favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> Have been using for about a week and already have see positive results. My skin looks and feels younger.</li>
            <li> Paula&#x27;s Choice does an amazing job. I use a cotton ball and can hardly believe how well it cleanes my face.&lt;br /&gt;It lives up to its name Skin Perfecting! Who doesn&#x27;t want perfect skin which Paula&#x27;s Choice offers.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product! I honestly didn&#x27;t think there was such a thing. I have literally tried EVERY face product out there and the results were either completely unnoticeable or they would cause my face to break out (in rashes that were basically little water filled bumps) as a reaction to certain ingredients found in some of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually won this product in a Birchbox contest. I had never even heard of Paula&#x27;s Choice products before. I started using this product in the morning and at night. After about a week I noticed that the little bumps and whiteheads I had on my chin, forehead and nose were completely gone! My skin became so smooth and literally started to glow! I started to receive so many compliments on my skin. My mother even asked me if I had gotten Botox! Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lasted me around 2 months. I just purchased a new bottle and plan to use it on the thin round cotton face pads this time instead of just regular cotton balls. I think it will last even longer using it that way. Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% BHA Skin Perfection Liquid has completely changed my skin (in the best way possible) and I feel so lucky to have discovered this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I saw results almost immediately!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical because it feels kinda oily/sticky at first. But it dries well. When it&#x27;s dry, it feels only slightly sticky. I like the texture of it, because I can massage it into my skin for several minutes without it drying out. I add BPO 2.5% and massage that over it. With that combination, there is enough moisture in my skin that it facilitates healing, and it feels alright to the touch. In a short time, I feel a slight warmth in the skin which doesn&#x27;t last long. My tiny acne wounds are healing a lot faster with this combination. I had tried several other suggestions, like BPO alone, sulfur lotions, etc. I&#x27;ve found that any little open lesion will heal better if I start out treating with straight hydrogen peroxide. It burns, but I think it does a lot to prevent infection. Then I follow with this BHA and the BPO 2.5%. If the hydrogen peroxide feels like too much, probably one of the BPO facial washes would work as well. Those can be left on the skin a little while, like a mask. This Paula&#x27;s BHA 2% really is making my skin look healthier, and it&#x27;s only been a few days.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin clear of clogged pores, prevents zits, even soothes sensitive skin. It makes my skin look fresh and clean. All of Paula&#x27;s Choice products are good, but this is my favorite because it targets my particular skin problems, and it is the most hypo-allergenic for me. I am allergic to fragrances, one common preservative (phenoxyethanol) and many or perhaps most aromatic plant extracts. 2% BHA Liquid has a short list of ingredients and does what is claims to do. Paua&#x27;s Choice has other BHA products that have more ingredients and probably do more for your skin, but they  don&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;m allergic to some of the ingredients. This one is great. I even use it at the same time as prescription Retin-A cream, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. (If you want to try that, I suggest trying it on a small spot of skin first to see if your skin can take both at once.) I&#x27;m in my 50s and still have nice skin, thanks partly to Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> Fabulous...makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> I am a super skeptic about all things beauty related. Most products don&#x27;t live up to their claims. This product is not one of those products. This products works well, and within days. I have had bothersome acne/redness on my chin for weeks. After just 2 nights using this, the redness was significantly reduced and acne nearly gone. I&#x27;m stupefied.    Here are the details of my experience:    I&#x27;m 39, Caucasian, and have fair, combination-type skin. Used this product at night after cleansing/toner. It is somewhat tacky but there&#x27;s virtually no scent. When I wake, there is reduced redness and inflammation (from acne) and virtually no emerging acne bumps. My skin flakes a little more than normal -- a result of the BHA. Nothing unmanageable. I&#x27;ve used significantly less coverup since discovering this product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of my milia( sp?) yet. That was the claim and why I got it. I&#x27;ve been using it about 4 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I put on my skin. There are a lot of harmful chemicals in products that we buy. And this product contains great chemicals that are great for your skin.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product after trying literally every product on the market for acne and wrinkles. At 40 years old...having both these issues it&#x27;s hard to find a product that works for both. Long story short....this is a miracle in a bottle for both my husband and I! In a two week period...we both look 10 years younger. I can&#x27;t even explain what this has done for us. We now both have flawless, smooth, beautiful skin. The best part is the radiant glow that&#x27;s achieved by this product! It&#x27;s beyond believable. We were very close to getting chemical peels and botox...no need for that now. This product has literally transformed our old, sun damaged, dried, large pored skin to that of a 30 year old. Even my hubby said he wants to get a lifetime supply. I can&#x27;t imagine what our skin would look like if we used any other Paulas Choice products with this! Truly amazing and worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to to.  Refine pores.  My complaint is, like most facial skin care products,  IT IS OVERPRICED!.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a cleanser -- it&#x27;s a clear liquid you apply to your skin by a cotton ball after you clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this 4 times now -- I use it twice daily, once in the morning and once at night. Already I can tell a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s less oily, my red spots have gone down, and my pores are getting smaller. If you have problem skin, you owe it to yourself to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now September 8, 2014, almost 30 days later after purchase. What I notice most from using this product (still two times daily) is that I have a more even skin tone. My pores are smaller, but I still need to do the twice-weekly mask thing with a pore-minimizing product. The BHA liquid really goes the extra mile to even out skin tone. It&#x27;s too bad I can&#x27;t use it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully at combating my hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> smells nasty and been using for a week, doesn&#x27;t have any effect.</li>
            <li> I honestly noticed smother skin after the first use.  My pores were significantly reduced after the first use and my makeup now goes on and  looks so much better.  I put a mist sprayer on the bottle and now spray directly on my face.  No more wasting product in cotton balls.</li>
            <li> My skin looks shinny. Gives me the impression it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> It is great for retexturizing and smoothing the skin. Also it exfoliates nicely and diminishes my blackheads and breakouts!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to try for keratosis pilaris on my arms.  So far I am pleased with the results (1 week use).</li>
            <li> I have used this for a little over a week, and it has already made a huge difference in my skin. It is smooth and the redness has greatly diminished. It even helped a stubborn papule go away that Finacea did not touch. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This has gotten rid of my tiny bumps under my skin. The ones that aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; but they are skin colored, clogged pores. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3weeks and I like it. Doesn&#x27;t burn...I have cystic acne, combination skin...and this is aiding in clearing my skin. Will probably purchase again. PC products are very good.</li>
            <li> Unlike grocery story salicylic acid formulas (think of the pre-moistened pads targeted at teenagers) this formula is not at all abrasive.  It does not irritate or sting.  I am thrilled with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> my one and only go to acne or any facial issue product.&lt;br /&gt;I always recommend this to people.</li>
            <li> Seal was broken when I got it and it seemed very thin and watery, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> ive been using this for one week&amp; my skin looks great. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I posted an earlier review, but I was not putting enough on the cotton ball.  This stuff has done a great job for my complexion!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a godsend. Paula, if youre reading this, I want you to know that I love you. Seriously. Ive struggled with acne for the last 8 years of my life, and this (and a better skincare routine) has made my face smooth and completely cleared me of my acne. I did experience some excessive dryness, but now I moisturize about 15 minutes after applying the BHA, and it seems to help it tremendously. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this stuff!!!  It is an acid, but it decreases redness.  On special nights out, I scrub my face and put this stuff on, leaving my skin fresh, but not red.  My teenage son loves it too.  It works miracles.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for who suffer from large pores due to oily face or clogged by makeup</li>
            <li> Must have for my breakout prone skin. This is the best stuff to have. It is just a clear liquid that exfoliates the skin. Amazing!</li>
            <li> When I got it, it already seemed like it had been opened and the bottle was only 3/4 of the way full, so that was disappointing. Then I used it and my face broke out. I&#x27;m sure this is great for some people, but not for all. Spot test, people. Don&#x27;t forget.</li>
            <li> The description says that this is the liquid, but the photo shows lotion?</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks and my pores are noticeably (to me) smaller. I was so excited to try it that I used it twice a day which ended up drying my skin out, but now I use it once a day and the dryness is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> I like it but I cannot use it 2x per day all over my face. 2x on my oily areas and 1x everywhere else. Its making my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 10 years. I like the liquid in the summer or daytime and the lotion in the winter or nighttime. Keep my skin smooth, reduces breakouts. It actually works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic! With one use I saw refined pores and overall clarity. Does not dry my skin or sting at all. I am applying 2x per day as part of my PC skincare routine. My face loves PC skincare! I have previously tried Proactiv, Rodan &amp; Fields, Philosophy, Clinique...you name it. I will never go back.</li>
            <li> DOES A GREAT JOB IN REDUCING PORE SIZE</li>
            <li> Well what can I say.. I have had so many blemishes on my skin...Breakouts and pimples.  This stuff really works.  Just wash with a quality non drying face soap and use this for pimple areas.  You skin will clear up for sure.  (Be careful to not use too much or use every day!  Your face will start to feel &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I bought this to combat the cystic acne on my chin and cheeks that I&#x27;d been dealing with for the past seven months. In less than a week my skin was back to normal, without a single new flare up. I did notice that my skin was significantly tighter the first couple of days, so if you&#x27;re naturally prone to dryness be prepared to moisturize more frequently.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew this product LONG ago. It is great for my skin type. I noticed the change immediately. My skin does not get red or irritated anymore. This is really the best exfoliant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I received this product as a freebie originally.  I am a BzzAgent and as part of a promotion, I got this magnificent liquid delivered to my door at no charge. However, it is worth every dime and I have already purchased my next bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been fighting skin spots for years now.  I have tried SO many products.  This product does not treat skin spots as far as I know, but it made my skin so much healthier that I started using my treatment again and it was actually effective this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product made my skin smooth and my pores much smaller... I am hooked!</li>
            <li> So, I bought this because heard it&#x27;s really effective to clear your skin from my buddies. Some of my buddies were suffered from acne or minor skin trouble. They told me it&#x27;s the best stuff so far they&#x27;ve used before. I bought it and I&#x27;ve been using this for the last couple days, and I could tell I can see the differences. Unlike the other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry at all (of course I put some moisturizer after this though), and my acne and some red spots on my skin are getting disappeared. Best Cosmetic Ever !!!! Thank you !!!!</li>
            <li> Works great but is expensive and kind of a hassle to apply. I started using this but then switched to Stridex pads which are just as effective and way easier to apply. If you don&#x27;t mind having to use cotton pads to apply it and don&#x27;t mind the price this is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, after reading reviews, believing it would help subside the redness on my arms caused by Keritosis Pilaris. Three weeks later I can attest this product does nothing to help. I applied twice a day as directed and unfortunately the only change I noticed was dried out, flakey, discolored skin. My skin appeared almost bleached in blotches after the first week. At that point I was grateful I didn&#x27;t use on any other part of my body yet hopeful this would pass and eventually work. Well here I am another two weeks later and still see no results. I will be writing directly to the company to get my money back. Two stars goes to Amazon for quick delivery and great service as always.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 72 years old and although my skin isn&#x27;t in terrible shape, time has created less then perfect completion.  This liquid is absolutely amazing!  It really does clean out pores, and evens out skin tone.  The best part is not even advertised....if you have small raised bumps around your hairline, they will be gone after using this.</li>
            <li> Murad stopped selling its highly effective Acne Treatment Gel. After much research and reading hundreds of reviews I chose to try this 2 percent salacylic acid gel. My face looks healthier and more youthful than it has in 20 years. I am 44 years old and I am being asked if I am using different moisturizer if I have had Botox. I recommend this product for anyone including those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Just as I would buy in store!</li>
            <li> I have always had terrible problem skin, some parts being too dry, some too oily. I am 25 and have had acne since I was 11. This seems to help heal any acne marks and my skin has not looked this good in literally years. It is clearing up and I do not have the breakouts that I used to or the scabs and marks that would last for weeks afterward. I had read a separate review from another buyer who said something similar and I was hoping I would see the same results. I am very glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> I really help from BHA liquid for my trouble skins.</li>
            <li> received a sample of this with another purchase and loved it so much that I purchased it. I will continue to buy this. my skin is clearer and smoother and feels great. I use it prior to my moisturizer morning and night. have had no issues with redness or sensitivity. highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/olive complexion with large pores and oily skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many products designed to shrink pores or their appearance and not one worked until I tried Paula&#x27;s Choice.  I frankly had low expectations, but after a week of using this product, I could already see a noticeable difference.  After using it or a month, my pores appear about 50% smaller and my complexion, which, thanks to the oiliness is prone to break-outs, is clear and seems brighter.  As for the claim that this product encourages collagen production, I don&#x27;t know if my experience supports that or how I&#x27;d tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product and feel it is a good value for the money.  I will continue using this, for sure!</li>
            <li> I wish I could like this because I was so excited to try it after reading all of the good reviews. I applied it with a cotton pad after I washed my face,  it left very heavy oily residue on my skin and it actually feels really uncomfortable on my skin so I decide to return it. :(</li>
            <li> Use it on my nose, still have deep pore</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Birchbox. Being 61 and far from my troubled skin years, I would never have tried something with salicylic acid, but I gave it a shot. This is the one most important step in my skincare now. I have sensitive skin that used to be oily. After the first time using this, I could see a difference in the appearance of my pores. My face looked and felt so clean. It never feels over dry.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and am still thrilled by this stuff. Using it twice a day, the bottle lasts about a month. I honestly could not recommend a product any higher.</li>
            <li> Works wonders to soften my skin texture and at the same time works wonders on my daughters teen acne. This exfoliator is a great addition to any skin care regimen. Truly impressed.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product every other day and is very pleased with the results. She REALLY loves this whole line of products.</li>
            <li> It does appear somewhat drying to the skin - but I guess that is part of the process.  Of the several BHA products I have tried, it appears to be the best.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! My skin looks amazing, and this product works FAST!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! I have had oily, congested skin all my life. It is easily aggravated, prone to pimples and lots of blackheads. This product has cleared my pores up within days of use! My skin still is and will always be a bit oily, but the brightness and clarity is striking and I&#x27;m starting to notice, about three weeks into using, that my blemishes are minimizing too. It does not dry out my skin and you MUST use sunscreen since BHA makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight. I really am in love with this quality product. I suspect this bottle will last a while too, making it an even wiser choice. I use cotton rounds and apply it twice a day after washing my face. After it dries a few moments I proceed with my routine. I would recommend this to anyone with oily, acne-prone skin, younger or older, esp. if you find other products don&#x27;t work or hurt your skin, as this has been good to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This has reduced my breakouts by at least 50%. BHA is oil-soluble so it can actually get into the pore and exfoliate. I get a lot of whiteheads on my forehead and chin - it really helps my forehead but my chin, not so much. It has no smell, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out, is quick and easy to use, and relatively affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a radical difference in my skin texture and pesky hormonal cystic acne after the first use. I&#x27;m behond thrilled. Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with blackheads and clogged skin for ages. I feel like I have tried almost everything from natural solutions to chemical peels. Nothing has worked as quickly as this in changing how my skin looks and feels. The first night I used it I woke up and my pores looked soo much smaller. My skin was soft and less bumpy. It has only gotten better with each use. I use it only at night as I find it to be a weird texture on my skin. I have not had any issues with the product causing breakouts.  This is the first Paula&#x27;s Choice product I have used and am impressed enough that I plan on trying other ones as well. The price is a little much, but if I can stop buying all the other crap I have tried on my face and replace it with this, I am pretty sure I am still saving money. 30/f/oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> there is no packing box of it. I do not know if it is real.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it reduced pore size and blackheads!</li>
            <li> It honestly didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin. It definitely didn&#x27;t hurt it, but I actually saw my pores get more clogged and bigger than the previous product I was using.</li>
            <li> Works sooooooo well!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product - it leaves the skin clearer, brighter and smoother after a single use. It is not drying (tho my skin is not particularly sensitive), but did cause purging in my oily T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this product is the consistency - it is extremely watery and I find it difficult to apply. Using cotton rounds as recommended wastes product, but using fingers is fiddly. Next time I&#x27;&#x27;ll try the gel/lotion versions.</li>
            <li> Less weight onto our skin! And it&#x27;s absorb quite fast due to its liquid form, again it&#x27;s liquid, no color, I don&#x27;t even smell anything. But it does dries out the skin so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as shown, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin a little sensitive so I use every other day but I love the way it lightens my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> My face is so much softer and visibly smoother. Skin tone is evening out and lines are less noticable. The product doesn&#x27;t dry my face out even though it has salycylic acid in it. The price was reasonable and well worth every penny. I will be purchasing this product again as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and I am questioning the quality and if it&#x27;s even safe to use. It wasn&#x27;t sealed or wrapped in anything, just bouncing around in a box with the rest of the products I ordered. It leaked all over the box and I am not sure if there is even anything left in the bottle. I heard great things about this specific BHA Liquid exfoliant, but a bit nervous about the quality.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any results after using for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a product that does exactly what it says it does. Leaving your skin clean and smooth with the ability to penetrate and dissolve the oil sebum inside your pores before turning into blackheads. This is a safe and most effective way to clean your pores out and to keep them clean. Thanks Paula!</li>
            <li> As a first time purchaser of the product, I was disappointed. Knowing that AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) which is water soluble, I decided to give this BHA(beta hydroxy acid) a shot since it had great reviews from amazon as well as YouTube. Being a BHA, which should cut through oil and seabum, it made my skin much more oily than before. It felt like I was using a moisturizer that contained oil. I thought it may work like a toner drying up so I left it on without adding my Cetaphil Moisturizer/Suncreen. I went through the entire day extremely oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skin Perfecting Liquid was not for me. When I received the product there was no safety seal as most of the reviews stated before I purchased which I thought wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal. Sadly, if this is your first time using this product, as it was for me, I would not order it. If you purchase a product without a safety seal you can never know who has tampered with the product, especially if you have never had it before. Like someone selling grapes that are actually bananas and you wondering why grapes are so yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I wanted this product to work as trusted sources on other products said this is there one go to. Not knowing if its Paula&#x27;s Choice that made an oily oil-killer.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using a BHA liquid since my skin is pretty sensitive, but this product has been fabulous and great complement to my skincare routine. I&#x27;m super oily with a lot of post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation, and acne-prone around my jawline. This product has not caused any new breakouts or increased my oil production at all, and it&#x27;s made my face SO SMOOTH! I use it at night, and it does feel a little tacky when it dries, but other than that, absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Good.i use every 5 days but makes very dry skin for me.Also if i skip one time,it is same before i used this one.keep use.</li>
            <li> got it and hopefully it will clean up my acne but i got some more on my face :(&lt;br /&gt;but i heard it will get worse before it get better. i will give it a try for at least 2 or 3 months let see how it works because actually i just try only 2 weeks. I will come back and update my review&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Whenever i use it, i got some pimples on my face. but when i stop my face was getting better. I decide to GIVE UP</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I applied it before going to bed. The very next morning, the red spots were calmer and smaller, my pores looked tighter, and I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of daily application (after showering, occasionally throughout the day if necessary, and after washing my face before bed) my skin is less irritated and many of my blemishes have lessened greatly if not disappeared all together. It does make my skin feel dry, but with a little bit of moisturizer it is no issue.</li>
            <li> Very good results. My pores are significantly less pronounced and I have less black heads/ acne after using Paula&#x27;s Choice for 3 months now. I will keep using this product. Initially my skin felt extra dry around my jaw and I had to use a lot of my daily face cream.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> it seems working as i started peeling after using it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any change to my skin</li>
            <li> Really nice product . 👍</li>
            <li> This together with the other Balance Line&#x3D; awesomeness! For all of those who want to start an affordable and effective face routine here is a link for $10OFF your first Paula&#x27;s Choice online order.(http://goo.gl/J5uNbc﻿) I have only had amazing experiences with all their products. I had a bit of an issue with the moisturizer with sunscreen but wrote to CS and they helped me pick a better one for my skin type. Enjoy :) http://goo.gl/J5uNbc﻿</li>
