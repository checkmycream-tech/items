            <li> First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed with a product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Not good quality at all.</li>
            <li> The stereotypical slow boat but from not to.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> From the picture it looks to me like fabric, but the case is ugly.</li>
            <li> I hate the brushes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> the bristles fall out of the larger brushes when using them.</li>
            <li> Ordered two sets, one for myself and one as a gift. They arrived very quickly and seem to be good quality, I did notice the smell some people mentioned but I washed them and they are drying. If the smell doesn&#x27;t come out I&#x27;ll update my review. Only problem but not worth removing stars is the sets don&#x27;t match? Mine has some blue brushes while hers has black? Seemed odd but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister for Christmas and let me tell ya, she loves these brushes. They seem to be pretty nice quality, and you get a cute floral case with them too! I am really happy with my purchase! Would buy from these guys again! :)</li>
            <li> This is such a cute brush roll! I honestly bought it just for that. It is a bit short for my longer brushes so you almost need to use the brushes in the set. If you aren&#x27;t a big make up person or new to the whole thing, these brushes would be great for you. They work in a pinch or as a compliment to my higher end brushes. Surprisingly, they don&#x27;t shed and are pretty soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received many compliments on the roll and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They even work great after you have cleaned them.</li>
            <li> Ordered for teacher gifts.</li>
            <li> Finally got this 1 day short of a month after ordering. First, clearly I didn&#x27;t read that it was coming from China. The stereotypical slow boat but from not to. Second, it says leather look. Try cheap plastic look. From the picture it looks to me like fabric, but the case is ugly. The brushes look nice, but this is a Christmas present so I hope the brushes are of good quality. Never again will I buy from this seller, &amp; I&#x27;m going to read the descriptions more than once. First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed with a product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! The big white ones are extremely soft! I&#x27;m really glad I bought these!</li>
            <li> About what I had expected but had hoped for better textured brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these! I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and they got here a lot quicker than I expected them to</li>
            <li> This is pretty, and fairly good quality. Would make a nice gift, especially for a teen.</li>
            <li> Only lasted two weeks, before the handles started to come apart. Not a big fan. Best thing I received out of this, was the cute brush bag.</li>
            <li> Very soft and complete kit I really enjoy using them</li>
            <li> This brush pouch is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made! The quality of the product is above standard, and is extremely durable, and the brushes themselves are wonderful. I only use a few of the brushes it came with, but there are enough slots that I can keep my mascara and eyeliners in the pouch as well. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new brush pouch, or new brushes, look no further! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase; I know I don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> Love it. Cute, elegant, high quality, fast shipping, soooooooft. ❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Ordered this and found a big slash on the top part of the product , very disappointed and I can&#x27;t return this since its been shipped over seas</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this set! This set doesn&#x27;t just look cute it does the job and then some!</li>
            <li> Well made, love the brush holder</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price, quality is alright. Some of the brushes aren&#x27;t very dense</li>
            <li> Soft, so easy to blend- holds makeup well-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is perfect and so so so so pretty! I do a lot of runway/photoshoot work and this is just the kind of portable and affordable set I would recommend</li>
            <li> It meets the quality expected</li>
            <li> Not good quality at all. Save your money and buy something better.</li>
            <li> Love the softness of the brushes. These do come from China and shipping time was a month but they came 1 week before that. Brushes don&#x27;t fall apart like most sets.</li>
            <li> Love it, very nice and excellent product., love the colors too</li>
            <li> perfect for travel, just throw it in your make up bag and go.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for-thank you!</li>
            <li> Soft brushes. Case is not fabric it is vinyl/ plastic. I wish the fan brush was more sturdy but the other brushes are good</li>
            <li> Love the case. I hate the brushes. Shed easily and don&#x27;t work well. My ELF brushes work better.</li>
            <li> These brushes didn&#x27;t take long to arrive. I love the soft feeling of them. There perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I use the bigger fluffy brush the most for my powders and it does the job well! Great product!</li>
            <li> It perfect for any type of makeup people beginners or experts. I love the case and the brushed are just perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it, very feminine</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very cute and super soft. The case is a vinyl material, so it&#x27;s water resistant. The brushes might shed a tiny bit, but after you wash them they are perfect. It&#x27;s a great size for travel while still having full sized brushes. They even arrived a day early. Great job DragonPad! I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from this company again!</li>
            <li> Granddaughters over the edge with brush set. Nicely presented</li>
            <li> These brushes are good, but definitely not great. Too be honest I was a little disappointed. All of the brushed have been shedding every time that I use them. The only one that I haven&#x27;t had too much trouble with is the foundation brush. I would not repurchase these brushes.</li>
