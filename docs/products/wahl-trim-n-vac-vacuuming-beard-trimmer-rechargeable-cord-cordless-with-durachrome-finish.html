    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for any occasion too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works perfectly.    </li>
            <li>This trimmer trims my goatee excellently!</li>
            <li>I have lots of curly hairs in my beard, and this thing just cuts them all perfectly.</li>
            <li>of that aside, this is the best TRIMMING device I have used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It works perfect and I recommend it to anyone that has a problem with razor bumps.</li>
            <li>the trimmer part works great but!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;vac\\&quot; part does not do a very good job, maybe collecting 50% of the trimmings at best.  </li>
            <li>Incredible.          </li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s a great beard and mustach trimmer.</li>
            <li>I can say is, by holding the trimmer vertically, according to the instructions, you can get a great trim, and the unit almost never lets any whiskers fall into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>Everything great.</li>
            <li>It does the basics and it does a GREAT job of it.  </li>
            <li>These are great</li>
            <li>I thought this was a great idea and, for a week</li>
            <li>It does a good job otherwise, and he&#x27;s had no complaints.</li>
            <li>I saw the ads for the Trim-N-Vac trimmer and thought it was a good idea.</li>
            <li>I THINK MOST WILL BE HAPPY WITH THIS</li>
            <li>(he&#x27;s bald) and is very satisfied with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>But, I have to say, our daughter in law loves it even better!  </li>
            <li>The battery life is nice, I&#x27;ve taken it with me travelling</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this trimmer, because it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The stand that comes with it tips over very easily.</li>
            <li>To give the folks at Wahl some credit, the whole &amp;quot;trimmer and vacuum&amp;quot; idea was brilliant.  </li>
            <li>It also does a fine job trimming!</li>
            <li>When used as recommended, it does a fine job of catching the hair in its trap.</li>
            <li>It takes too many passes to get the job done and it doesn&#x27;t trim that evenly.    </li>
            <li>How many electronic gadgets can you name that don&#x27;t get redesigned every year?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll concede that the trim guard (the plastic length-adjustable thingie on the top of the shaver) can get knocked off from time to time, maybe once a month.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on the job it does on my beard.</li>
            <li>the most part, the Trim-n-Vac delivers on its promise.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Of the hair that does wind up in the trimmer&#x27;s container, I suspect gravity is more to thank than the vacuum.&lt;BR&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>This is the second version of the Wahl Trim N Vac that I&#x27;ve owned, and for the most part this is an excellent upgrade.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t catch everything, but it does get most of the hair, so it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>But 5 stars would probably cost fairly more...</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Had it held up better</li>
            <li>Oh, the vacuum is excellent.</li>
            <li>Trims beard with a nice clean cut and there are many incriments to adjust the thinkness of your beard.</li>
            <li>I dropped it in the trash and purchased a new one, which works great.</li>
            <li>, the trimmer guard can come off rather easily -- Wahl probably needs to reengineer this piece to solve the problem -- but I&#x27;ve never had it pop off while I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li>I own MANY others, which shave equally well, but the vacuum feature on this one makes it best.</li>
            <li>He also said it vaccums fine if you shave &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; with it.</li>
            <li>I have been quite impressed at the percentage of stubble this little trimmer picks up.</li>
            <li>Overall I find the product works great and is thoughtfully designed.</li>
            <li>-IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>I use my trimmer constantly and it works great.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is too bulky to allow precise trimming.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t cheap either....).</li>
            <li>My old one did about as good a job as this thing.</li>
            <li>I had to figure out how to orient the trimmer relative to my face, but once I did it worked very nicely.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 5 years until the battery didn&#x27;t fully recharge any more.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works okay, and some vacuuming action is better than none.  </li>
            <li>The color has changed to a cool black/grey, but the trim guard and hair chamber are interchangeable between my two models.</li>
            <li>THE GOOD THINGS VASTLY OUT</li>
            <li>The concept sounds good: the Trim-n-Vac vacuums up your beard/moustache hairs as you trim them, instead of having them fall onto the sink or counter causing a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I thought the vacuum was a good idea, but it&#x27;s not as effective as I would have liked; there&#x27;s still a mess in the sink to clean up.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like a good idea -- the vacuum feature and the adjustable trim height,  </li>
            <li>The vacuum system works fairly well.</li>
            <li>This product should be appreciated for the excellent trim that it gives you and the mess that is avoided.  </li>
            <li>It worked well, ran fine and the vacuum did a pretty fair job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite aware of fine trimmings from my electric shaver I use for supplemental grooming, but</li>
            <li>It vacuumed most (but most definitely not ALL)</li>
            <li>The vacuum works adequately and makes this product leaps and bounds more superior than similar products.  </li>
            <li>The amazing thing is, the newer trimmer&#x27;s design appears to be the same.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product it cuts very well and close to the skin.</li>
            <li>It has been well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>For the money it&#x27;s definitely worth what you get.    </li>
            <li>And more importantly he can up after himself with the help of the vacuum in the clippers</li>
            <li>Surprisingly effective vacuum feature saves time as cleanup is almost, if not quite, eliminated.  </li>
            <li>If a clean, whisker-free sink appeals to you, you might want to try the Wahl Trim-n-Vac -- but make sure the store will take it back if you&#x27;re not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>You can trim your moustache very easily and obviously your beard, too.</li>
            <li>The blade edges are also a bit more dull which makes this product more comfortable if using w/out the guard.</li>
            <li>I get an excellent full beard and mustache trim, and very little hair escapes the vacuum.           </li>
            <li>While it does not successfully vacuum 100% of the hair being trimmed, it gets most of it, making post-trim clean up a much quicker and easier process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery on the old model still works fine, too.    </li>
            <li>I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>The one critical thing to pay attention to when buying is... be sure you get the model that has both a rechargeable battery and an optional cord.</li>
            <li>My husband has a thick beard and this trimmer does a great job.</li>
            <li>I glad that I got on of the last 2 in stock.</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the vacume does not have enough suction to catch 1/4 of the hair</li>
            <li>My husband loves this trimmer and I love the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum feature that reduces clipping cleanup</li>
            <li>If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li>The vacuuming part is great, and it is no big deal to empty it.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and cheap feeling (more plastic, less metal),</li>
            <li>What is especially handy is that it can be recharged instead of having to use batteries, and this makes the earlier delicate battery door nonexistent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, is non-abrasive, and the vacuum leaves the area pretty free of hair as it grabs most of it.  </li>
            <li>No mess for her to clean up.</li>
            <li>There was hair all over the sink with the other models, and the trim wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as good.           </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the variable length attachment once, but it&#x27;s easy to adjust and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>The thing is large and it obscures your face.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s &amp;quot;toy-like&amp;quot; construction, it&#x27;s lack of power, the fact that the tray falls out and the length guard came off too easy, and the lack of power of the vacuum, I eventually chose to return the unit.  </li>
            <li>The idea of a \\&quot;Trim-N-Vac\\&quot; sounded great to me, but this trimmer is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S VERY DURABLE.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t miss it nearly as much.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re still going to have to wipe the whole counter off either way.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the reduced price that Amazon offers.</li>
            <li>I have to recharge this thing every two or three days, which also means I need to carry the charger along with the trimmer whenever I travel -- and the charger is too big to fit in the travel pouch.&lt;BR&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>But it works really well</li>
            <li>As for any noise that might wake the whole household, or pain while using the trimmer, I don&#x27;t know what the heck</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; very well.  </li>
            <li>also, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li>Really like this brand.</li>
            <li>However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch much hair: I suggest you trim by 1/8\\&quot; at a time as directed in the manual so that the cut hair isn&#x27;t too long to get easily vacuumed.</li>
            <li>Second, it is not user friendly.</li>
            <li>Makes clean up simple.</li>
            <li>Really easy to empty</li>
            <li>I know I am particular about the shaving device I use, so I guess I can understand why some don&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it trims my goatee tight and neat, better than anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This stops virtually most of the stubble and vacuums it up in the little container for emptying.</li>
            <li>I find that about 80% to 90% of the hair I trim is caught by the vacuum, even though I&#x27;m not that careful about using the trimmer as directed, which is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO SEE WHERE THE BLADE IS WHEN HOLDING IN CERTAIN POSITIONS (LIKE THE TOP OF THE MUSTACHE).   </li>
            <li>AT THE MOUTH OF THE VACUUM, but the hair stayed right where it was and didn&#x27;t get vacuumed.  </li>
            <li>I am in search of a new adapter</li>
            <li>I considered either ordering a new charger from Wahl or purchasing a new Trim n Vac from the Wahl outlet store.  </li>
            <li>That is, until I found that Amazon sells a new Trim n Vac for $19.99.  </li>
            <li>and it still works like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at the new Norelco vac unit and will probably buy</li>
            <li>Such a pity the product is not manufactured any more.</li>
            <li>This product was very well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>It is VERY loud and wakes up everone whom is still sleeping in the morning.  </li>
            <li>If Wahl came out with a new, solidly constructed version of this trimmer, I&#x27;d be the first in line to trade mine in.  </li>
            <li>My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li>As far as this review is concerned!  </li>
            <li>No more hair all over the sink and counter top.</li>
            <li>I received one for Christmas the first year it was made (a blue/grey model) and recently replaced it (after 10 years -- a guess)</li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t vacuum like it says it does.</li>
            <li>During this portion of the beard trimming process I really begin to long for my much-smaller, non-vacuuming beard trimmer, which made it much easier for me to see what I was doing.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is NOT that loud, and if you want a trimmer that is totally quiet try to invent one.  </li>
            <li>Slowing down a tad helps the vacuum pick up more of the trimmings, reducing the maverick whisker count that otherwise will escape into the sink.  </li>
            <li>It cleans up most of the mess with the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been browsing for a more satisfactory replacement and can hardly wait for this to stop working completely.</li>
            <li>I puchased this a couple of years ago to replace my old Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li>As far as trimming goes, it&#x27;s not a winner there either.  </li>
            <li>When I went to replace it, I absolutely was going to buy the next generation of this model.    </li>
            <li>; IT&#x27;S UNUSUALLY LOUD</li>
            <li>/&gt;The solution, of course, is to let the trimmer discharge completely between recharge cycles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>he loves it but misses the swivel feature of the head on his old Wahl.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products where I almost wish I had waited a few product generations to get one, assuming that eventually the size of this product will more closely resemble that of a standard moustache/beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Then the vacuum doesn&#x27;t work all that well,  and much of the shaved hair bits end up on my face, on my shirt, and on the floor.   </li>
            <li>Be prepared to still do some sink cleanup, but maybe not as much as without the vacuum.</li>
            <li>The vacuum picks up about 90% of the hair, but really, what the difference between SOME of the hair on the counter, and ALL of the hair...</li>
            <li>While this one doesn&#x27;t have the swivel head with two sizes of trimmer, the vacuum function is what I really bought it for.</li>
            <li>I keep my beard trimmed tight, and this trimmer gives me a clean, trimmed look.</li>
            <li>no mess.  </li>
            <li>it is the smaller trim blade,  which is super handy, but I have to give this a bad rating simply because it&#x27;s unexpectedly mowed down parts of my beard so many times.  </li>
            <li>I would have thought this product was a slamdunk it works so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at other reviews here, though, I can see that many other users have had problems with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d even lay down a few more bucks for the new one.</li>
            <li>the motor is really strong and the blades are a thick metal.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly what it is expected to do!</li>
            <li>The previously reported problem with the cutter guard comming off started right away.  </li>
            <li>The collection chamber is not very large, but the vacuum does a good job of keeping the trimmer from making a mess as long as you empty it out frequently.</li>
            <li>Then I realize I have barely any clean-up to do</li>
            <li>But a month of daily use so far</li>
            <li>It really does the job well, and its blades seem to stay sharp forever.</li>
            <li>the hair won&#x27;t fall near enough to the vacuum opening</li>
            <li>Be careful about using too much oil as that seems to stop the vacuum from picking up stubble.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this product for me, probably as much of a gift for herself as for me, as I&#x27;m sure she grew tired of seeing little hairs in and around the sink</li>
            <li>There is no other product on the market that provides the quality trim and vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get 5 stars only because I wish it trimmed a bit closer like a Remington I used to own, as well as the vacuum doing an decent(but not excellent) job.</li>
            <li>The blades oscillate fast enough (and are currently sharp enough) that I can trim even lengthy stubble without it getting caught and ripped out - something I was not expecting in a unit so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The only major difference is that the power plug (the block that connects to your electrical socket) is now smaller (same voltage though).</li>
            <li>It was a small light grey flat piece of plastic (no larger than a nickel)</li>
            <li>Stubble seems to be like oil on water, a little makes a huge mess.</li>
            <li>Still half the mess on the sink from trimmins that dont get sucked up...still have to clean up afterwords..</li>

            <li> Of the hair that does wind up in the trimmer&#x27;s container, I suspect gravity is more to thank than the vacuum.&lt;BR&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> This is the second version of the Wahl Trim N Vac that I&#x27;ve owned, and for the most part this is an excellent upgrade.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t catch everything, but it does get most of the hair, so it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> But 5 stars would probably cost fairly more...</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Had it held up better</li>
            <li> Oh, the vacuum is excellent.</li>
            <li> Trims beard with a nice clean cut and there are many incriments to adjust the thinkness of your beard.</li>
            <li> I dropped it in the trash and purchased a new one, which works great.</li>
            <li> , the trimmer guard can come off rather easily -- Wahl probably needs to reengineer this piece to solve the problem -- but I&#x27;ve never had it pop off while I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li> I own MANY others, which shave equally well, but the vacuum feature on this one makes it best.</li>
            <li> He also said it vaccums fine if you shave &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; with it.</li>
            <li> I have been quite impressed at the percentage of stubble this little trimmer picks up.</li>
            <li> Overall I find the product works great and is thoughtfully designed.</li>
            <li> -IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> I use my trimmer constantly and it works great.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is too bulky to allow precise trimming.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t cheap either....).</li>
            <li> My old one did about as good a job as this thing.</li>
            <li> I had to figure out how to orient the trimmer relative to my face, but once I did it worked very nicely.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 5 years until the battery didn&#x27;t fully recharge any more.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works okay, and some vacuuming action is better than none.  </li>
            <li> The color has changed to a cool black/grey, but the trim guard and hair chamber are interchangeable between my two models.</li>
            <li> THE GOOD THINGS VASTLY OUT</li>
            <li> The concept sounds good: the Trim-n-Vac vacuums up your beard/moustache hairs as you trim them, instead of having them fall onto the sink or counter causing a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I thought the vacuum was a good idea, but it&#x27;s not as effective as I would have liked; there&#x27;s still a mess in the sink to clean up.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a good idea -- the vacuum feature and the adjustable trim height,  </li>
            <li> The vacuum system works fairly well.</li>
            <li> This product should be appreciated for the excellent trim that it gives you and the mess that is avoided.  </li>
            <li> It worked well, ran fine and the vacuum did a pretty fair job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite aware of fine trimmings from my electric shaver I use for supplemental grooming, but</li>
            <li> It vacuumed most (but most definitely not ALL)</li>
            <li> The vacuum works adequately and makes this product leaps and bounds more superior than similar products.  </li>
            <li> The amazing thing is, the newer trimmer&#x27;s design appears to be the same.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product it cuts very well and close to the skin.</li>
            <li> It has been well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s definitely worth what you get.    </li>
            <li> And more importantly he can up after himself with the help of the vacuum in the clippers</li>
            <li> Surprisingly effective vacuum feature saves time as cleanup is almost, if not quite, eliminated.  </li>
            <li> If a clean, whisker-free sink appeals to you, you might want to try the Wahl Trim-n-Vac -- but make sure the store will take it back if you&#x27;re not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> You can trim your moustache very easily and obviously your beard, too.</li>
            <li> The blade edges are also a bit more dull which makes this product more comfortable if using w/out the guard.</li>
            <li> I get an excellent full beard and mustache trim, and very little hair escapes the vacuum.           </li>
            <li> While it does not successfully vacuum 100% of the hair being trimmed, it gets most of it, making post-trim clean up a much quicker and easier process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery on the old model still works fine, too.    </li>
            <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> The one critical thing to pay attention to when buying is... be sure you get the model that has both a rechargeable battery and an optional cord.</li>
            <li> My husband has a thick beard and this trimmer does a great job.</li>
            <li> I glad that I got on of the last 2 in stock.</li>
            <li> On top of all that, the vacume does not have enough suction to catch 1/4 of the hair</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer and I love the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum feature that reduces clipping cleanup</li>
            <li> If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li> The vacuuming part is great, and it is no big deal to empty it.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and cheap feeling (more plastic, less metal),</li>
            <li> What is especially handy is that it can be recharged instead of having to use batteries, and this makes the earlier delicate battery door nonexistent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, is non-abrasive, and the vacuum leaves the area pretty free of hair as it grabs most of it.  </li>
            <li> No mess for her to clean up.</li>
            <li> There was hair all over the sink with the other models, and the trim wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as good.           </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the variable length attachment once, but it&#x27;s easy to adjust and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> The thing is large and it obscures your face.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s &amp;quot;toy-like&amp;quot; construction, it&#x27;s lack of power, the fact that the tray falls out and the length guard came off too easy, and the lack of power of the vacuum, I eventually chose to return the unit.  </li>
            <li> The idea of a \\&quot;Trim-N-Vac\\&quot; sounded great to me, but this trimmer is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S VERY DURABLE.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t miss it nearly as much.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re still going to have to wipe the whole counter off either way.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the reduced price that Amazon offers.</li>
            <li> I have to recharge this thing every two or three days, which also means I need to carry the charger along with the trimmer whenever I travel -- and the charger is too big to fit in the travel pouch.&lt;BR&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> But it works really well</li>
            <li> As for any noise that might wake the whole household, or pain while using the trimmer, I don&#x27;t know what the heck</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; very well.  </li>
            <li> also, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li> Really like this brand.</li>
            <li> However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch much hair: I suggest you trim by 1/8\\&quot; at a time as directed in the manual so that the cut hair isn&#x27;t too long to get easily vacuumed.</li>
            <li> Second, it is not user friendly.</li>
            <li> Makes clean up simple.</li>
            <li> Really easy to empty</li>
            <li> I know I am particular about the shaving device I use, so I guess I can understand why some don&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it trims my goatee tight and neat, better than anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> This stops virtually most of the stubble and vacuums it up in the little container for emptying.</li>
            <li> I find that about 80% to 90% of the hair I trim is caught by the vacuum, even though I&#x27;m not that careful about using the trimmer as directed, which is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO SEE WHERE THE BLADE IS WHEN HOLDING IN CERTAIN POSITIONS (LIKE THE TOP OF THE MUSTACHE).   </li>
            <li> AT THE MOUTH OF THE VACUUM, but the hair stayed right where it was and didn&#x27;t get vacuumed.  </li>
            <li> I am in search of a new adapter</li>
            <li> I considered either ordering a new charger from Wahl or purchasing a new Trim n Vac from the Wahl outlet store.  </li>
            <li> That is, until I found that Amazon sells a new Trim n Vac for $19.99.  </li>
            <li> and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking at the new Norelco vac unit and will probably buy</li>
            <li> Such a pity the product is not manufactured any more.</li>
            <li> This product was very well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> It is VERY loud and wakes up everone whom is still sleeping in the morning.  </li>
            <li> If Wahl came out with a new, solidly constructed version of this trimmer, I&#x27;d be the first in line to trade mine in.  </li>
            <li> My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li> As far as this review is concerned!  </li>
            <li> No more hair all over the sink and counter top.</li>
            <li> I received one for Christmas the first year it was made (a blue/grey model) and recently replaced it (after 10 years -- a guess)</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t vacuum like it says it does.</li>
            <li> During this portion of the beard trimming process I really begin to long for my much-smaller, non-vacuuming beard trimmer, which made it much easier for me to see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is NOT that loud, and if you want a trimmer that is totally quiet try to invent one.  </li>
            <li> Slowing down a tad helps the vacuum pick up more of the trimmings, reducing the maverick whisker count that otherwise will escape into the sink.  </li>
            <li> It cleans up most of the mess with the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been browsing for a more satisfactory replacement and can hardly wait for this to stop working completely.</li>
            <li> I puchased this a couple of years ago to replace my old Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li> As far as trimming goes, it&#x27;s not a winner there either.  </li>
            <li> When I went to replace it, I absolutely was going to buy the next generation of this model.    </li>
            <li> ; IT&#x27;S UNUSUALLY LOUD</li>
            <li> /&gt;The solution, of course, is to let the trimmer discharge completely between recharge cycles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> he loves it but misses the swivel feature of the head on his old Wahl.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products where I almost wish I had waited a few product generations to get one, assuming that eventually the size of this product will more closely resemble that of a standard moustache/beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Then the vacuum doesn&#x27;t work all that well,  and much of the shaved hair bits end up on my face, on my shirt, and on the floor.   </li>
            <li> Be prepared to still do some sink cleanup, but maybe not as much as without the vacuum.</li>
            <li> The vacuum picks up about 90% of the hair, but really, what the difference between SOME of the hair on the counter, and ALL of the hair...</li>
            <li> While this one doesn&#x27;t have the swivel head with two sizes of trimmer, the vacuum function is what I really bought it for.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard trimmed tight, and this trimmer gives me a clean, trimmed look.</li>
            <li> no mess.  </li>
            <li> it is the smaller trim blade,  which is super handy, but I have to give this a bad rating simply because it&#x27;s unexpectedly mowed down parts of my beard so many times.  </li>
            <li> I would have thought this product was a slamdunk it works so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at other reviews here, though, I can see that many other users have had problems with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d even lay down a few more bucks for the new one.</li>
            <li> the motor is really strong and the blades are a thick metal.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what it is expected to do!</li>
            <li> The previously reported problem with the cutter guard comming off started right away.  </li>
            <li> The collection chamber is not very large, but the vacuum does a good job of keeping the trimmer from making a mess as long as you empty it out frequently.</li>
            <li> Then I realize I have barely any clean-up to do</li>
            <li> But a month of daily use so far</li>
            <li> It really does the job well, and its blades seem to stay sharp forever.</li>
            <li> the hair won&#x27;t fall near enough to the vacuum opening</li>
            <li> Be careful about using too much oil as that seems to stop the vacuum from picking up stubble.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product for me, probably as much of a gift for herself as for me, as I&#x27;m sure she grew tired of seeing little hairs in and around the sink</li>
            <li> There is no other product on the market that provides the quality trim and vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get 5 stars only because I wish it trimmed a bit closer like a Remington I used to own, as well as the vacuum doing an decent(but not excellent) job.</li>
            <li> The blades oscillate fast enough (and are currently sharp enough) that I can trim even lengthy stubble without it getting caught and ripped out - something I was not expecting in a unit so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The only major difference is that the power plug (the block that connects to your electrical socket) is now smaller (same voltage though).</li>
            <li> It was a small light grey flat piece of plastic (no larger than a nickel)</li>
            <li> Stubble seems to be like oil on water, a little makes a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Still half the mess on the sink from trimmins that dont get sucked up...still have to clean up afterwords..</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s technique, but not all of the beard trimmings are caught in the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Even the slightest tilt will cause shavings to miss the vacuum receptacle and litter your sink.  </li>
            <li> I bought this solely for trimming facial hair down to a five o&#x27;clock shadow (I have sensitive skin and my face hates razors).</li>
            <li> Overall, this trims much better(especially for stubble look) and less bulkier than the other brands(norelco, remington)for</li>
            <li> Especially for sideburns, it&#x27;s difficult to trim accurately because the thing is so damn big and bulky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> how long it&#x27;d last.</li>
            <li> sum up, I personally give this unit five stars, but clearly, it&#x27;s not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> The Vacuum works well as long as you stay within what the manufacturer recommendations of the product.</li>
            <li> I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    </li>
            <li> Take it from me, a long time user.  </li>
            <li> yet it would not clip on the the in/off switch...upon careful looking it had two tiny plastic stems which should have clipped on to the mechanism.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only real major complaint I have about this product is its sheer bulk.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is not powerful enough to pick up shavings.  </li>
            <li> (no matter how hard one tries to clean them up a few stray hairs always seem to stick around).</li>
            <li> I simply take off the guide and expose the blades to trim my mustache and any other stray hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> However, I found the product itself disappointing for the following primary reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> As a test, I placed a small piece of hair DIRECTLY</li>
            <li> Since so much of my face is obstructed by the Trim-n-Vac it is very difficult to insure that I&#x27;m trimming everything straight and evenly.</li>
            <li> The product in its current form is simply so large that it is difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> You slide out a compartment, open a little lid, and empty it.</li>
            <li> On just my chin alone, it seems to take 5 minutes of going back and forth, and it still seems to miss a few dozen hairs.  </li>
            <li> This Wahl trimmer was a big waste of money(it</li>
            <li> The vacuum does catch some of the hair, so I suppose my sink is not quite as messy as it would otherwise be.  </li>
            <li> The one on mine just sits precariously in its slot, and if you tilt the trimmer the wrong way, it just falls right out.  </li>
            <li> It vacuums a little more hair trimmings than my earlier model, but it didn&#x27;t have the swivel head with the small blade at the other end, so that was a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> : It seems to take extraordinarily long to trim facial hair, if you&#x27;ve got thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews and seen the complaints.  </li>
            <li> All my comments have already been listed in the other reviews online.  </li>
            <li> those other reviewers are talking about.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it does not get quite as close as I&#x27;d like, but again this is a trimmer, not an electronic razor</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical at first as to</li>
            <li> As long as you hold it in the upright and don&#x27;t turn it from side to side the hair fall down into the vac space but turn just a little and it falls everywhere.</li>
            <li> It is quite large and bulky, difficult to manuver.   </li>
            <li> I tryed to pull mine off and it wouldn&#x27;t budge unless i pulled hard enough to break it!  </li>
            <li> The adjustable head covering the clippers does snap on and off, but only very weakly, so it can also go flying, if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> I had to epoxy the guard in a fixed position and unfortunately I epoxied it way too long.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE A COARSE OR THICK BEARD.</li>
            <li> but it mows my beard down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault.</li>
            <li> but when I use this thing,  the adjustable head comes loose,  which usually results in the blades going directly down to my face.  </li>
            <li> However, in my opinion the performance is not adequate to justify the price tag on this device.</li>
            <li> I already owned a previous version of this trimmer, but could not find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally write reviews but my repeated frustrating experiences with this thing compels me to do so.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> The handle was a bit awkward at first</li>
            <li> This makes holding it while you are trimming a little tricky, but one can learn to carry it</li>
            <li> The vacuum is way too weak.  </li>
            <li> This was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> It is bulky and not comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks now and can heartily recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer for a product design firm -</li>
            <li> The wisker bin started to fall out, the detent buttons wore down and for the past year</li>
            <li> less money!</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that other people do!  </li>
            <li> SAY THE BAD FIRST</li>
            <li> The battery failed to hold a charge after just a few months so I can only use it with the cord.      </li>
            <li> But in summary, I took a chance on this trimmer because my wife and I were both tired of cleaning up all the little hairs left behind on the sink.  </li>
            <li> I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings.</li>
            <li> The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE A TINY TRIMMER TO GET THE BLIND SPOTS...</li>
            <li> - even when taking off a small amount of hair at a time.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> I design products for a living - this is easily in my top 5 of worst products I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> The device is no louder than an ordinary electric shaver -- perhaps quieter -- and the blades never touch your face or pull any hair, so I don&#x27;t see how using it could be in any way</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding this one.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of negative reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> As for another of the users&#x27; comments that he had to recharge the trimmer every two or three days, I suspect that his unit is suffering from the memory effect so common with nicad batteries.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have been using this for at least 6 months now.</li>
            <li> If this was a movie I would give it two thumbs down!!!</li>
            <li> I am highly uncomfortable using my other trimmer b/c</li>
            <li> The cutting guard is of a strange design and does not trim as closely as I would like.  </li>
            <li> Not only painful</li>
            <li> The complaint that it is difficult to empty is absurd.</li>

            <li> One stem looked like it was broken and would not stay attached to the switch.  </li>
            <li> which is very inconvenient and odd to me.</li>
            <li> Because where the inlet of the vaccuum is located, it forces you to hold the trimmer at a weird angle to your face.&lt;BR&gt;Cheap construction as well.&lt;BR&gt;</li>

            <li> My husband loves it! And more importantly he can up after himself with the help of the vacuum in the clippers and it doesn&#x27;t get in the sink anymore. I would recommend it for the men in the women&#x27;s lives that have pet peeves like I do of the hair in the sink issue. It&#x27;s perfect for any occasion too.</li>
            <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer. My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years. I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings. I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    Deciding to give Wahl one last chance. I purchased the \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer Kit,\\&quot; given that it had a 5-year warranty. The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage. Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault. However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own. If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later. If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally write reviews but my repeated frustrating experiences with this thing compels me to do so.&lt;BR&gt;It seemed like a good idea -- the vacuum feature and the adjustable trim height,  but when I use this thing,  the adjustable head comes loose,  which usually results in the blades going directly down to my face.  Not only painful but it mows my beard down to the skin.  Ouch and ugly!!   Then the vacuum doesn&#x27;t work all that well,  and much of the shaved hair bits end up on my face, on my shirt, and on the floor.   &lt;BR&gt;The one thing I do like about it is the smaller trim blade,  which is super handy, but I have to give this a bad rating simply because it&#x27;s unexpectedly mowed down parts of my beard so many times.  &lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;d avoid this one if I were you.</li>
            <li> As far as this review is concerned!  This trimmer does exactly what it is expected to do! I have had NO problem with the regulator falling off or the noise!  I find it hard to believe that other people do!  First of all, it is NOT that loud, and if you want a trimmer that is totally quiet try to invent one.  Second, the only way i can see the regulator falling off is if it is either defective or you are pushing the button by accident!  There is NO way otherwise!  I tryed to pull mine off and it wouldn&#x27;t budge unless i pulled hard enough to break it!  Overall, this trims much better(especially for stubble look) and less bulkier than the other brands(norelco, remington)for less money!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer and I love the vacuum feature. No more hair all over the sink and counter top.</li>
            <li> I puchased this a couple of years ago to replace my old Wahl trimmer.  I thought the vacuum was a good idea, but it&#x27;s not as effective as I would have liked; there&#x27;s still a mess in the sink to clean up.  It is bulky and not comfortable to use.  It&#x27;s difficult to clean.  The depth adjuster has come off a couple of times while in use.  The battery failed to hold a charge after just a few months so I can only use it with the cord.      As far as trimming goes, it&#x27;s not a winner there either.  It takes too many passes to get the job done and it doesn&#x27;t trim that evenly.    I&#x27;ve been browsing for a more satisfactory replacement and can hardly wait for this to stop working completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled by the reviewers saying the Wahl Trim N Vac doesn&#x27;t work. I received one for Christmas the first year it was made (a blue/grey model) and recently replaced it (after 10 years -- a guess) when she-who-must-not-be-named tried to help me by oiling the blades with not-shaver-oil. The shaver still worked; I just couldn&#x27;t stand the odor.    When I went to replace it, I absolutely was going to buy the next generation of this model.    The amazing thing is, the newer trimmer&#x27;s design appears to be the same. The color has changed to a cool black/grey, but the trim guard and hair chamber are interchangeable between my two models. The only major difference is that the power plug (the block that connects to your electrical socket) is now smaller (same voltage though). How many electronic gadgets can you name that don&#x27;t get redesigned every year? The battery on the old model still works fine, too.    I&#x27;ll concede that the trim guard (the plastic length-adjustable thingie on the top of the shaver) can get knocked off from time to time, maybe once a month. No biggie. Just stick it back on.    In all of this time, beard trimmings have been eliminated from my bathroom. I&#x27;m quite aware of fine trimmings from my electric shaver I use for supplemental grooming, but not beard clippings cut by the Wahl. It&#x27;s works perfectly.    The one critical thing to pay attention to when buying is... be sure you get the model that has both a rechargeable battery and an optional cord. There are also models that only use a battery or only use a cord.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s technique, but not all of the beard trimmings are caught in the vacuum. Be prepared to still do some sink cleanup, but maybe not as much as without the vacuum. It does a good job otherwise, and he&#x27;s had no complaints.</li>
            <li> HAD IT FOR TWO YEARS NOW. I&#x27;VE BEEN MEANING TO WRITE A REVIEW BUT KEPT PUTTING IT OFF.  THERE IS HOWEVER AND ADDED BENEFIT FROM A REVIEW OF A PRODUCT THATS BEEN USED FOR A WHILE.  I&#x27;LL SAY THE BAD FIRST; IT&#x27;S UNUSUALLY LOUD AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO SEE WHERE THE BLADE IS WHEN HOLDING IN CERTAIN POSITIONS (LIKE THE TOP OF THE MUSTACHE).   THE GOOD THINGS VASTLY OUT NUMBER THE BAD.  IT SHAVES CLOSER THAN THE FIVE OR SIX I&#x27;VE HAD BEFORE.  IT&#x27;S VERY DURABLE.  THE BATTERY STILL HOLDS A CHARGE. IT CAN BE USED PLUGGED IN (I&#x27;VE HAD TO TOSS OUT OTHERS WHEN THE BATTERIES STOPPED HOLDING A CHARGE) AND IT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE BUMPS.  -IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE A COARSE OR THICK BEARD. I THINK MOST WILL BE HAPPY WITH THIS IF YOU HAVE A TINY TRIMMER TO GET THE BLIND SPOTS...AND MAYBE A SET OF EAR PLUGS.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s day 2008. The trimmer and its battery (for cordless use) still work well. The collection chamber is not very large, but the vacuum does a good job of keeping the trimmer from making a mess as long as you empty it out frequently. My husband has a thick beard and this trimmer does a great job. He also uses it without the guide comb for shaving his head (he&#x27;s bald) and is very satisfied with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it! He says it&#x27;s a great beard and mustach trimmer. He also said it vaccums fine if you shave &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; with it. I am going to buy one for my son now, who loves the one my husband has!</li>
            <li> I still miss my rechargeable Norelco, but I needed something neater (I got sick of unclogging my drain!). I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks now and can heartily recommend it. When used as recommended, it does a fine job of catching the hair in its trap. It also does a fine job trimming! I have received many compliments on the job it does on my beard.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of negative reviews of this product.  BUT, have you tried similar products from your pharmacy?  The vacuum works adequately and makes this product leaps and bounds more superior than similar products.  The blade edges are also a bit more dull which makes this product more comfortable if using w/out the guard.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the worst case of false advertising ever! First of all, it doesn&#x27;t vacuum like it says it does. Hair everywhere!. Second, it is not user friendly. The thing is large and it obscures your face. The stand that comes with it tips over very easily. If this was a movie I would give it two thumbs down!!!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product for me, probably as much of a gift for herself as for me, as I&#x27;m sure she grew tired of seeing little hairs in and around the sink everytime I trimmed my goatee (no matter how hard one tries to clean them up a few stray hairs always seem to stick around). The concept sounds good: the Trim-n-Vac vacuums up your beard/moustache hairs as you trim them, instead of having them fall onto the sink or counter causing a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, the Trim-n-Vac delivers on its promise. While it does not successfully vacuum 100% of the hair being trimmed, it gets most of it, making post-trim clean up a much quicker and easier process.&lt;br /&gt;The only real major complaint I have about this product is its sheer bulk. This is one of those products where I almost wish I had waited a few product generations to get one, assuming that eventually the size of this product will more closely resemble that of a standard moustache/beard trimmer. The product in its current form is simply so large that it is difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing. This is especially a problem when I&#x27;m shaping/edging my goatee. Since so much of my face is obstructed by the Trim-n-Vac it is very difficult to insure that I&#x27;m trimming everything straight and evenly. During this portion of the beard trimming process I really begin to long for my much-smaller, non-vacuuming beard trimmer, which made it much easier for me to see what I was doing. Then I realize I have barely any clean-up to do and I don&#x27;t miss it nearly as much.</li>
            <li> I would have thought this product was a slamdunk it works so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at other reviews here, though, I can see that many other users have had problems with the product.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, by holding the trimmer vertically, according to the instructions, you can get a great trim, and the unit almost never lets any whiskers fall into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the trimmer guard can come off rather easily -- Wahl probably needs to reengineer this piece to solve the problem -- but I&#x27;ve never had it pop off while I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard.  As for another of the users&#x27; comments that he had to recharge the trimmer every two or three days, I suspect that his unit is suffering from the memory effect so common with nicad batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The solution, of course, is to let the trimmer discharge completely between recharge cycles.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, I personally give this unit five stars, but clearly, it&#x27;s not for everyone.  If a clean, whisker-free sink appeals to you, you might want to try the Wahl Trim-n-Vac -- but make sure the store will take it back if you&#x27;re not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;And for heaven&#x27;s sake, read the instructions!</li>
            <li> Pros: The battery life is nice, I&#x27;ve taken it with me travelling andit has never felt like the battery was running out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It seems to take extraordinarily long to trim facial hair, if you&#x27;ve got thick hair.  On just my chin alone, it seems to take 5 minutes of going back and forth, and it still seems to miss a few dozen hairs.  The vacuum picks up about 90% of the hair, but really, what the difference between SOME of the hair on the counter, and ALL of the hair... you&#x27;re still going to have to wipe the whole counter off either way.</li>
            <li> Everything great. Such a pity the product is not manufactured any more.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly effective vacuum feature saves time as cleanup is almost, if not quite, eliminated.  Slowing down a tad helps the vacuum pick up more of the trimmings, reducing the maverick whisker count that otherwise will escape into the sink.  Would prefer a wider cutter head but after a couple uses got the hang of proper use of narrower business end.  You might want to spend the extra bucks for the model that comes with both cutters.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is not powerful enough to pick up shavings.  Even the slightest tilt will cause shavings to miss the vacuum receptacle and litter your sink.  Very disappointing product from leading trimmer maker Wahl.  Brought mine back and got a Norelco T860, which I recommend for its Acu-Control system.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the poor ratings for this device. It all seems like petty objections. I know I am particular about the shaving device I use, so I guess I can understand why some don&#x27;t like this. However, I lost my AC adapter, and had to resort to a Norelco. I am in agony. Forget the vacuuming portion of all of this. This trimmer trims my goatee excellently! I have lots of curly hairs in my beard, and this thing just cuts them all perfectly. I keep my beard trimmed tight, and this trimmer gives me a clean, trimmed look. The vacuuming part is great, and it is no big deal to empty it. You slide out a compartment, open a little lid, and empty it. The complaint that it is difficult to empty is absurd. &lt;br /&gt;All of that aside, this is the best TRIMMING device I have used. Like I said, it trims my goatee tight and neat, better than anything else I have ever used. I simply take off the guide and expose the blades to trim my mustache and any other stray hairs. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. I am in search of a new adapter so I can continue using it. I am highly uncomfortable using my other trimmer b/c it simply cannot match my Wahl in accuracy and neatness.</li>
            <li> For over 5 years I&#x27;ve owned a Wahl Trim n Vac.  I bought mine at WalMart for $49.95 back then.  It has been well worth the price.  I get an excellent full beard and mustache trim, and very little hair escapes the vacuum.           Prior to my Trim n Vac, I owned beard trimmers from Schick and Norelco.  The difference is like night and day.  There was hair all over the sink with the other models, and the trim wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as good.           After 5 years of being shuttled between my home and hotels or apartments, the charger now has stopped working.  I considered either ordering a new charger from Wahl or purchasing a new Trim n Vac from the Wahl outlet store.  That is, until I found that Amazon sells a new Trim n Vac for $19.99.  Incredible.          I highly recommend this product.  I have read the other reviews and seen the complaints.  Take it from me, a long time user.  This product should be appreciated for the excellent trim that it gives you and the mess that is avoided.  There is no other product on the market that provides the quality trim and vacuum feature.  It is well worth the reduced price that Amazon offers.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews for this product made me hesitant in purchasing this trimmer, but I bought it anyway and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. I find that about 80% to 90% of the hair I trim is caught by the vacuum, even though I&#x27;m not that careful about using the trimmer as directed, which is good enough for me. Overall I find the product works great and is thoughtfully designed. All of the complaints I&#x27;ve read (except for one that makes no sense to me) seem resolvable through reading the manual or applying common sense.  Here are my responses to some of the negative reviews for this trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch much hair: I suggest you trim by 1/8\\&quot; at a time as directed in the manual so that the cut hair isn&#x27;t too long to get easily vacuumed. Also, you have to hold the trimmer right-side-up otherwise the hair won&#x27;t fall near enough to the vacuum opening&lt;BR&gt;Patchy shave: In the manual it addresses that issue directly&lt;BR&gt;Guard comes off: Don&#x27;t push the guard release while shaving</li>
            <li> I use my trimmer constantly and it works great. I have had it about a year and it still works like new. It cleans up most of the mess with the vacuum feature. Trims beard with a nice clean cut and there are many incriments to adjust the thinkness of your beard.</li>
            <li> Does not vaccuum well - even when taking off a small amount of hair at a time.&lt;BR&gt;Because where the inlet of the vaccuum is located, it forces you to hold the trimmer at a weird angle to your face.&lt;BR&gt;Cheap construction as well.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer for a product design firm - I design products for a living - this is easily in my top 5 of worst products I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> It vacuums all the hair that is trimmed from my mustache and beard. I glad that I got on of the last 2 in stock.</li>
            <li> To give the folks at Wahl some credit, the whole &amp;quot;trimmer and vacuum&amp;quot; idea was brilliant.  However, I found the product itself disappointing for the following primary reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.  The vacuum is way too weak.  As a test, I placed a small piece of hair DIRECTLY AT THE MOUTH OF THE VACUUM, but the hair stayed right where it was and didn&#x27;t get vacuumed.  The vacuum does catch some of the hair, so I suppose my sink is not quite as messy as it would otherwise be.  Of the hair that does wind up in the trimmer&#x27;s container, I suspect gravity is more to thank than the vacuum.&lt;BR&gt;2.  The charge does not last.  I have to recharge this thing every two or three days, which also means I need to carry the charger along with the trimmer whenever I travel -- and the charger is too big to fit in the travel pouch.&lt;BR&gt;3.  The trimmer is too bulky to allow precise trimming.  Especially for sideburns, it&#x27;s difficult to trim accurately because the thing is so damn big and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;Basic conclusion: The trimmer works okay, and some vacuuming action is better than none.  However, in my opinion the performance is not adequate to justify the price tag on this device.</li>
            <li> All my comments have already been listed in the other reviews online.  But in summary, I took a chance on this trimmer because my wife and I were both tired of cleaning up all the little hairs left behind on the sink.  However, it&#x27;s &amp;quot;toy-like&amp;quot; construction, it&#x27;s lack of power, the fact that the tray falls out and the length guard came off too easy, and the lack of power of the vacuum, I eventually chose to return the unit.  Maybe I will reconsider with version 2.0 or 3.0 of the unit, but for now Wahl needs to listen to all the responses and get back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> This is is my second Wahl Trim N Vac. My first one lasted 5 years until the battery didn&#x27;t fully recharge any more. I dropped it in the trash and purchased a new one, which works great. It vacuums a little more hair trimmings than my earlier model, but it didn&#x27;t have the swivel head with the small blade at the other end, so that was a bit of a disappointment. But it works really well and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I don&#x27;t find it too bulky at all.</li>
            <li> I have found the product to work as represented. The Vacuum works well as long as you stay within what the manufacturer recommendations of the product. The rechargeable feature works well also.</li>
            <li> I have been quite impressed at the percentage of stubble this little trimmer picks up. My wife (no surprise) hates stubble from the trimmers. Stubble seems to be like oil on water, a little makes a huge mess. This stops virtually most of the stubble and vacuums it up in the little container for emptying. Be careful about using too much oil as that seems to stop the vacuum from picking up stubble. I have been using this for at least 6 months now. I own MANY others, which shave equally well, but the vacuum feature on this one makes it best.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this trimmer, because it does a good job.  However, there are some problems with its poor construction.  &lt;BR&gt;  The collection tray for the whiskers is something you imagine should snap in and out of the body of the trimmer, so that it would hold itself in and you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it.  The one on mine just sits precariously in its slot, and if you tilt the trimmer the wrong way, it just falls right out.  This makes holding it while you are trimming a little tricky, but one can learn to carry it off.&lt;BR&gt;  The adjustable head covering the clippers does snap on and off, but only very weakly, so it can also go flying, if you&#x27;re not careful.  But it will stay on if you don&#x27;t give the trimmer a even moderate jarring.&lt;BR&gt;  As for any noise that might wake the whole household, or pain while using the trimmer, I don&#x27;t know what the heck those other reviewers are talking about.  The device is no louder than an ordinary electric shaver -- perhaps quieter -- and the blades never touch your face or pull any hair, so I don&#x27;t see how using it could be in any way painful.&lt;BR&gt;  If Wahl came out with a new, solidly constructed version of this trimmer, I&#x27;d be the first in line to trade mine in.  I&#x27;d even lay down a few more bucks for the new one.</li>
            <li> Get it while it&#x27;s available--they&#x27;ve been discontinued.  While this one doesn&#x27;t have the swivel head with two sizes of trimmer, the vacuum function is what I really bought it for.</li>
            <li> This is the second version of the Wahl Trim N Vac that I&#x27;ve owned, and for the most part this is an excellent upgrade. What is especially handy is that it can be recharged instead of having to use batteries, and this makes the earlier delicate battery door nonexistent. You can trim your moustache very easily and obviously your beard, too.</li>
            <li> If you want to trim hair and don&#x27;t need anything fancy and don&#x27;t want to spend $50+, then this trimmer rocks!  It does the basics and it does a GREAT job of it.  This is my second one in 8 years.  It&#x27;s simple, is non-abrasive, and the vacuum leaves the area pretty free of hair as it grabs most of it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I saw the ads for the Trim-N-Vac trimmer and thought it was a good idea. But that is all it was an idea. The trim guard pops off in the middle of trimming(oops there&#x27;s a bald spot), then when you put the guard back on, thinking that the guard is at the same trim length that it was set at when you started, suprise it is back to a number 1 while the lever says 4. On top of all that, the vacume does not have enough suction to catch 1/4 of the hair so you might as well be using a trimmer that does not have this feature and will trim even. This was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> The idea of a \\&quot;Trim-N-Vac\\&quot; sounded great to me, but this trimmer is a huge disappointment.  It is VERY loud and wakes up everone whom is still sleeping in the morning.  The \\&quot;vac\\&quot; part does not do a very good job, maybe collecting 50% of the trimmings at best.  It is quite large and bulky, difficult to manuver.   Feels awkward to use.  The cutting guard is of a strange design and does not trim as closely as I would like.  I&#x27;m going back to my trusty Norelco and cleaning up after myself.  This Wahl trimmer was a big waste of money(it wasn&#x27;t cheap either....).</li>
            <li> Item was defective!  the on/off switch was separated and lying inside the package.  It was a small light grey flat piece of plastic (no larger than a nickel) yet it would not clip on the the in/off switch...upon careful looking it had two tiny plastic stems which should have clipped on to the mechanism.  One stem looked like it was broken and would not stay attached to the switch.  I paid to have the item sent, then paid $10 to UPS to have it returned to the seller....Bad experience!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product it cuts very well and close to the skin. the motor is really strong and the blades are a thick metal. the only problem with this Wahl is the angle you have to cut at. the way the blade is positioned, you almost have to have the shaver at a 20 degree angle to your body. which is very inconvenient and odd to me. I guess it has to get some taken used to, to get over this issue.    Oh, the vacuum is excellent. no mess.  BTW, the chrome on the outside is painted plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely for trimming facial hair down to a five o&#x27;clock shadow (I have sensitive skin and my face hates razors). For the money it&#x27;s definitely worth what you get.    I&#x27;ve only used the variable length attachment once, but it&#x27;s easy to adjust and seems to work well. The blades oscillate fast enough (and are currently sharp enough) that I can trim even lengthy stubble without it getting caught and ripped out - something I was not expecting in a unit so inexpensive. On the other hand, it does not get quite as close as I&#x27;d like, but again this is a trimmer, not an electronic razor so I can&#x27;t complain.    The vacuum system works fairly well. It doesn&#x27;t catch everything, but it does get most of the hair, so it&#x27;s better than nothing. Really easy to empty, no hassle.    I leave it plugged in except for when I use it, so I can&#x27;t speak to the battery life.    Very lightweight and cheap feeling (more plastic, less metal), so I was skeptical at first as to how long it&#x27;d last. But a month of daily use so far and it&#x27;s gained my confidence.    Definitely recommend. Didn&#x27;t get 5 stars only because I wish it trimmed a bit closer like a Remington I used to own, as well as the vacuum doing an decent(but not excellent) job. But 5 stars would probably cost fairly more...</li>
            <li> he loves it but misses the swivel feature of the head on his old Wahl. I love the vacuum feature that reduces clipping cleanup</li>
            <li> I bought this unit about 15 months ago.  It worked well, ran fine and the vacuum did a pretty fair job.  The handle was a bit awkward at first but I got used to it after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;Then things started to break.  The wisker bin started to fall out, the detent buttons wore down and for the past year or so I&#x27;ve had to hold the handle in a specific way to keep it in.  The previously reported problem with the cutter guard comming off started right away.  Then the length adjustment broke.  I had to epoxy the guard in a fixed position and unfortunately I epoxied it way too long.  I&#x27;m looking at the new Norelco vac unit and will probably buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Had it held up better I&#x27;d have given it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I had to figure out how to orient the trimmer relative to my face, but once I did it worked very nicely.</li>
            <li> This product was very well worth the money I spent on it. It works perfect and I recommend it to anyone that has a problem with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas present for our son, and he loves it!  But, I have to say, our daughter in law loves it even better!  No mess for her to clean up.</li>
            <li> the trimmer part works great but! Still half the mess on the sink from trimmins that dont get sucked up...still have to clean up afterwords..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband years ago and he still uses it. We have had no problems any what so ever.</li>
            <li> I already owned a previous version of this trimmer, but could not find it anywhere. Thus, I purchased this one. I ONLY use it plugged in, so I can&#x27;t vouch for any unplugged operation. It really does the job well, and its blades seem to stay sharp forever.</li>
            <li> Replaced the one I&#x27;ve had for years with this one. These are great but I think they are going away. Had a hard time finding this one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the worst thing I have every had. As long as you hold it in the upright and don&#x27;t turn it from side to side the hair fall down into the vac space but turn just a little and it falls everywhere. No power in the vac system. So I would tell people not to count on it like you see on the TV stations. My old one did about as good a job as this thing.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great idea and, for a week or so it was. It vacuumed most (but most definitely not ALL) the hair trimmed. However, after a couple of weeks, I could not get the battery to hold a charge and the battery can&#x27;t be replaced on the thing! And cleaning out the vacuumed trimmings is not a simple process.</li>
            <li> it trims.  it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.      it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; very well.  i&#x27;d say about 60% of the trimmings make it into the vacuumed compartment.      also, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Really like this brand. Makes clean up simple.</li>
