            <li>Always good to have a bottle in the house just in case</li>
            <li>It was good in providing relief from insect bites.</li>
            <li>This Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion was a good find for me.  </li>
            <li>and it smells good...</li>
            <li>The aveeno lotion smells good and seems to relieve pain from itches and rashes almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I love this.. great for skin...</li>
            <li>I just love Aveeno products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I&#x27;ve found this product, it works immediately, giving releaf after an itching rash, caused by some kind of allergie.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s refreshing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>taking a warm-</li>
            <li>Effective for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This is a gift to my mother-in-law, which she liked.</li>
            <li>Aveeno makes a nice cost effective product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If baths were too warm, they caused a flare.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works effectively for what it says it does.</li>
            <li>So I do not recommend using it before wearing nice clothes as they may get stained.</li>
            <li>Somewhat effective.  </li>
            <li>Also has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to be living a more itch free life.</li>
            <li>Best anti-itch product I have found so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to have on hand for insect bites and that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>I will use this as needed and it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing, but I probably would not buy it again.</li>
            <li>Aveeno is a great brand, and this lotion is really soothing.</li>
            <li>This is more of a cream than a lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but doesn&#x27;t do a lot to help my chronic, itchy hives.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many bug bite creams before.</li>
            <li>for a \\&quot;famous, albeit affordable\\&quot; poison-ivy wash - that may have caused the poison to spread&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it ok</li>
            <li>So refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I tried many different anti itch and this seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>I find it relieves itching better than hydrocortisone.</li>
            <li>safe to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK product, but it&#x27;s just calamine with some added lotion inactives.</li>
            <li>I sure hope I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Other Aveeno product like skin relief ones has been a great product for their own purpose though</li>
            <li>This had great reviews and I saw several mentions of people using it for Eczema</li>
            <li>It might be because of the kind of itching I am experiencing, but I was really hoping this would do the trick.</li>
            <li>After putting some on the crotch, I&#x27;m itch free all night.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell of menthol / medicine.</li>
            <li>I was concerned the bottle was going to be too small but its a perfect size for traveling</li>
            <li>I started using this a day ago and noticed a significant decrease in the itch and the bumps fading.</li>
            <li>Although, it has some unique smell</li>
            <li>Dry winter, Itchy legs works great.</li>
            <li>All I have to remember is to keep my hands clean after applying and not get the lotion in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this seems like a decent product and it will be nice to have on hand, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my itch; the effect was very mild.</li>
            <li>Like many people with diabetes I have to deal with itchy skin much of the year.  </li>
            <li>It works good after several minutes.</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno products and this lotion is really combating itch on my ankles.  </li>
            <li>Oh, It does have a strong menthol scent, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I often recommend mixing a great lotion with a topical steroid  to my patients to cover a large area of itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve become pregnant my legs are tortureously itchy.</li>
            <li>However the smell fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Asked a pharmacist about relieving the itch and was recommended of this mild aveeno itch relief.  </li>
            <li>Also it arrived quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m super allergic person.</li>
            <li>Gave a bottle to my pregnant friend suffering from PUPPP -</li>
            <li>The scent is probable the ingredient that makes it so good for dry skin</li>
            <li>This anti-itch lotion contains no cortisone, which can actually cause more itching!  </li>
            <li>It helps to calm the itch and soothe the skin...which aids in healing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed once applied.</li>
            <li>The relief is worth it and</li>
            <li>Although the bites feel awesome to scratch, I get tired of scratching them every couple minutes, so I put this on and it stops right away.</li>
            <li>and this stuff kept me from ripping my skin right off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this product contains a mild local anesthetic, so it may be more helpful for some things.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the scent that much, but is really really good for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>First time using this vendor and all went well.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I will definitely repurchase soon! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fully aware this review will be maligned as going on tangents, but I don&#x27;t care, because I don&#x27;t want others with poison ivy to get worsened (or uninformed) as I&#x27;d endured via the med.system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I was in doubt but my mom finally got some relief using this (had tried many products and even some itch relief medication).  </li>
            <li>these is a bigger quantity than most anti-itch products.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>have worked better for a different problem.</li>
            <li>I put a cold pack on my Shingles right after I apply this cream and that has worked best for my relief.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty sticky too so try not to use it on your whole limb.</li>
            <li>Everything went well, thanks</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t care much for the medicinal scent and the pasty texture.</li>
            <li>I used this for eczema is working very well.</li>
            <li>It soothes, seems to offer some moisture and stays put very well.  </li>
            <li>I have crotch itch in the evening and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>But this one really works wonder.</li>
            <li>really thought  iwas getting the reglar  lotion  </li>
            <li>Was very hopeful with this product.  </li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>Yard work often leaves me with itchy skin, and this Aveeno lotion is a real help.  </li>
            <li>Very relieving.</li>
            <li>I also use a TENS device, which I highly recommend for pain!</li>
            <li>i use it for the whole family..</li>
            <li>The calamine lotion does make the application appear a bit pink but rubbing it in well disguises this and helps the lotion work even better.  </li>
            <li>I had itching and this worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>High Recommend!</li>
            <li>Plus, since it&#x27;s concentrated you don&#x27;t need to use much of it each time.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really wish I started using this 2 weeks sooner.</li>
            <li>were really bothering me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK product, but certainly not the best.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even better, make an anti itch bath by putting 3 black tea bags and a quarter cup oatmeal in cheese cloth and tie it hanging below the faucet as the water runs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Nothing stops the symptoms completely, but I&#x27;ve bought every different kind of topicality ointment for my symptoms, and I was amazed this worked better than any of those usually recommended brands, including Cortaid, Lanacane, Benadryl cream, Cortizone 10, Domeboro powder, regular Calamine, and  Solarcaine.</li>
            <li>product helped a lot in the short run, which was worth quite a bit.</li>
            <li>it worked better than plain calamine lotion to relieve her itching</li>
            <li>I had a allergic reaction to a new detergent</li>
            <li>It really works very well on insect bites and such.  </li>
            <li>My daughter swims 10 hours a week but has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After buying bottles from local stores at higher prices, it makes it easier and cheaper to purchase it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and absorbs easily into the skin with little or no residue.</li>
            <li>I keep my skin moisturized, and I use gentle, moisturizing shampoo, so my skin and scalp are not dry or flaky.  </li>
            <li>Not all Aveeno products have the same ingredients, and the main ingredient I looked for was Pramoxine HCI, and that&#x27;s in this particular lotion.</li>
            <li>My cute little 8-year-old cousin had hives and an allergic reaction to something, so I ended up applying it regularly to his hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a rash all over my pregnant belly due to hormones.</li>
            <li>I had a stubborn allergy that nothing else would clear up, then I found Aveeno Concentrate.</li>
            <li>Aveeno is &amp;#34;MY Brand&amp;#34; in that it is made for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to him because it was the only cream that really helped him.  </li>
            <li>Beware of smell if you are sensitive.</li>
            <li>This lotion really does the trick as it has Calamine (3%) and Pramoxine HCl (1%) in it which seems to be the key.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is not available at most local stores, and it works well.</li>
            <li>It is my first stop for dry, chaffed or irritated skin</li>
            <li>Slight tingling and cooling brings sweet relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are going to use it for your entire body,&lt;br /&gt;this 4 ounce bottle won&#x27;t last long and it will be better to get bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>So far, on the rare occasions that anybody in the family would have itchiness caused by insect bites or other causes indicated in the bottle, it has worked!</li>
            <li>No other lotion or treatment I have tried (including products with Hydrocortisone, zinc oxide &amp; ferric oxide, diphenhydramine hydrochloride)has worked as fast nor lasted as long as this to stop the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works well, has that smell but doesn&#x27;t last long, too bad amazon don&#x27;t carry it any more, would have been nice subscribing every 3 months on it.</li>
            <li>It also rubs in, so no pink stuff to stain your clothing.</li>
            <li>This product is different from other anti-itch creams and lotions that I have used in that it is a very thick and creamy lotion which contains calamine and some kind of oats formula that is in the Aveeno products I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I have bouts with eczema, and the over-the-counter product I&#x27;d had success with in the past was discontinued.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty messy to put on my scalp because I have about an inch of hair now.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this seems like a decent product and it will be nice to have on hand, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my itch; the effect was very mild.</li>
            <li> Like many people with diabetes I have to deal with itchy skin much of the year.  </li>
            <li> It works good after several minutes.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products and this lotion is really combating itch on my ankles.  </li>
            <li> Oh, It does have a strong menthol scent, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I often recommend mixing a great lotion with a topical steroid  to my patients to cover a large area of itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve become pregnant my legs are tortureously itchy.</li>
            <li> However the smell fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Asked a pharmacist about relieving the itch and was recommended of this mild aveeno itch relief.  </li>
            <li> Also it arrived quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m super allergic person.</li>
            <li> Gave a bottle to my pregnant friend suffering from PUPPP -</li>
            <li> The scent is probable the ingredient that makes it so good for dry skin</li>
            <li> This anti-itch lotion contains no cortisone, which can actually cause more itching!  </li>
            <li> It helps to calm the itch and soothe the skin...which aids in healing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed once applied.</li>
            <li> The relief is worth it and</li>
            <li> Although the bites feel awesome to scratch, I get tired of scratching them every couple minutes, so I put this on and it stops right away.</li>
            <li> and this stuff kept me from ripping my skin right off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this product contains a mild local anesthetic, so it may be more helpful for some things.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent that much, but is really really good for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> First time using this vendor and all went well.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase soon! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully aware this review will be maligned as going on tangents, but I don&#x27;t care, because I don&#x27;t want others with poison ivy to get worsened (or uninformed) as I&#x27;d endured via the med.system.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I was in doubt but my mom finally got some relief using this (had tried many products and even some itch relief medication).  </li>
            <li> these is a bigger quantity than most anti-itch products.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> have worked better for a different problem.</li>
            <li> I put a cold pack on my Shingles right after I apply this cream and that has worked best for my relief.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty sticky too so try not to use it on your whole limb.</li>
            <li> Everything went well, thanks</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t care much for the medicinal scent and the pasty texture.</li>
            <li> I used this for eczema is working very well.</li>
            <li> It soothes, seems to offer some moisture and stays put very well.  </li>
            <li> I have crotch itch in the evening and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> But this one really works wonder.</li>
            <li> really thought  iwas getting the reglar  lotion  </li>
            <li> Was very hopeful with this product.  </li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> Yard work often leaves me with itchy skin, and this Aveeno lotion is a real help.  </li>
            <li> Very relieving.</li>
            <li> I also use a TENS device, which I highly recommend for pain!</li>
            <li> i use it for the whole family..</li>
            <li> The calamine lotion does make the application appear a bit pink but rubbing it in well disguises this and helps the lotion work even better.  </li>
            <li> I had itching and this worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> High Recommend!</li>
            <li> Plus, since it&#x27;s concentrated you don&#x27;t need to use much of it each time.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really wish I started using this 2 weeks sooner.</li>
            <li> were really bothering me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK product, but certainly not the best.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even better, make an anti itch bath by putting 3 black tea bags and a quarter cup oatmeal in cheese cloth and tie it hanging below the faucet as the water runs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Nothing stops the symptoms completely, but I&#x27;ve bought every different kind of topicality ointment for my symptoms, and I was amazed this worked better than any of those usually recommended brands, including Cortaid, Lanacane, Benadryl cream, Cortizone 10, Domeboro powder, regular Calamine, and  Solarcaine.</li>
            <li> product helped a lot in the short run, which was worth quite a bit.</li>
            <li> it worked better than plain calamine lotion to relieve her itching</li>
            <li> I had a allergic reaction to a new detergent</li>
            <li> It really works very well on insect bites and such.  </li>
            <li> My daughter swims 10 hours a week but has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After buying bottles from local stores at higher prices, it makes it easier and cheaper to purchase it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and absorbs easily into the skin with little or no residue.</li>
            <li> I keep my skin moisturized, and I use gentle, moisturizing shampoo, so my skin and scalp are not dry or flaky.  </li>
            <li> Not all Aveeno products have the same ingredients, and the main ingredient I looked for was Pramoxine HCI, and that&#x27;s in this particular lotion.</li>
            <li> My cute little 8-year-old cousin had hives and an allergic reaction to something, so I ended up applying it regularly to his hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a rash all over my pregnant belly due to hormones.</li>
            <li> I had a stubborn allergy that nothing else would clear up, then I found Aveeno Concentrate.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is &amp;#34;MY Brand&amp;#34; in that it is made for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to him because it was the only cream that really helped him.  </li>
            <li> Beware of smell if you are sensitive.</li>
            <li> This lotion really does the trick as it has Calamine (3%) and Pramoxine HCl (1%) in it which seems to be the key.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not available at most local stores, and it works well.</li>
            <li> It is my first stop for dry, chaffed or irritated skin</li>
            <li> Slight tingling and cooling brings sweet relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are going to use it for your entire body,&lt;br /&gt;this 4 ounce bottle won&#x27;t last long and it will be better to get bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> So far, on the rare occasions that anybody in the family would have itchiness caused by insect bites or other causes indicated in the bottle, it has worked!</li>
            <li> No other lotion or treatment I have tried (including products with Hydrocortisone, zinc oxide &amp; ferric oxide, diphenhydramine hydrochloride)has worked as fast nor lasted as long as this to stop the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works well, has that smell but doesn&#x27;t last long, too bad amazon don&#x27;t carry it any more, would have been nice subscribing every 3 months on it.</li>
            <li> It also rubs in, so no pink stuff to stain your clothing.</li>
            <li> This product is different from other anti-itch creams and lotions that I have used in that it is a very thick and creamy lotion which contains calamine and some kind of oats formula that is in the Aveeno products I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I have bouts with eczema, and the over-the-counter product I&#x27;d had success with in the past was discontinued.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty messy to put on my scalp because I have about an inch of hair now.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty thick stuff, so it could even be diluted some.  </li>
            <li> By using this product and her other topical medications, she finally restored her eczema-free skin!</li>
            <li> I have two little ones 4year and 6 year old and they are not scared of bug bites now.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a Dermatologist for minor itches.</li>
            <li> However, I found that after a couple of applications over the course of half a day or so, the product buildup became an irritant in itself, and I had to shower and remove it, which I didn&#x27;t necessarily feel well enough to want to do.</li>
            <li> If you stumble upon this item GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a white residue due to the calamine portion.</li>
            <li> I had dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It worked for me when my skin got dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I use this for everything, even a preventative to dry skin itch.</li>
            <li> It does dry your skin out, so when your rash seals and stops weeping, there is a two day window or so where you have to switch off of this and to a moisturizer to prevent skin from cracking which will cause rash to go in re-mission</li>
            <li> It also helps with dry skin brought on by winter weather.  </li>
            <li> Aveeno anti-itch lotion has helped ease an area of dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> The product material responds very well in relieving itching, but the overall product is frustrating.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to help my 8 year old granddaughter with itchy allergies that seem to appear as a small rash on her skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using Hydrocortisone willy-nilly on mild/moderate dermatitis/rash/eczema is a scam promoted by dermatologists that causes &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; by thinning the skin which causes it to dry out faster!</li>
            <li> The doctors prescribed me medicine and all it did was dry out the rash and made it more painful than it already was.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, I put it away after a few uses and thought to review it today when I took it back out to use for a bug bite.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pink color.  </li>
            <li> It is not easily obtainable at our regular retailers and pharmacies.  </li>
            <li> It soothes the discomfort irritated skin, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> not hot- bath.</li>
            <li> i buy this for my kids for their bug bites and other itchy things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this could work for everyone, but it has helped me on a number of times when I feel my shingles acting up.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything--coconut oil, baby lotion, other soothing lotions--</li>
            <li> After having some skin issues I have tried plenty of other products.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for you, try some other products.</li>
            <li> I was trying to wait it out since my baby is due any day</li>
            <li> I tried at least 10 different products on my rash caused by solvents used at work.</li>
            <li> This is thick enough to stay where you put it, not running all over the place.</li>
            <li> The AVEENO Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion, is thick and soothing, and has an external analgesic for pain, and Calamine for itching.  </li>
            <li> and it went away faster and hurt less than going to the doctors and getting something prescribed.</li>
            <li> Easier than the typical applicant tube</li>
            <li> but if you mess with the rash no amount of lotion is gonna help.</li>
            <li> Smells a little bit like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> and I have been using them for a few years.</li>
            <li> and if the baths were plain (without oil), I ran the faucets even Cooler than</li>
            <li> someone who has dealt with the worst itches out there, here&#x27;s some more tips:&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> and it works just as well if not better than calamine lotion</li>
            <li> ...note that I&#x27;m not sure they offer fragrance-free zinc-oxide</li>
            <li> For the past year I have been covering my skin from hives.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit expensive then regular lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of reading on Eczema and medicated products like this aren&#x27;t generally recommended for the record, but when you get desperate you&#x27;ll try anything to stop an itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t walk outside in South Carolina without seeing a bug the size of a small cat, or something biting me and leaving a fist size bump that itches like crazy.</li>
            <li> But it was not effective for my rashes.</li>
            <li> It felt a bit thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> Using a thin lotion is so messy.</li>
            <li> the consistency is thick, creamy</li>
            <li> Lotion is thick and pinkish colored.</li>
            <li> I have a condition which makes my arms itch intensly and nothing, I mean nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also very small, so don&#x27;t expect a normal-sized aveeno bottle to be coming your way.</li>
            <li> I read that Hydrocortisone cream is actually bad to use on a regular basis as it thins the skin membranes and make you itchier with prolonged use, so I wanted something to replace that.</li>
            <li> I recently had a bad case of hives from an allergic reaction to a medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Fluticasone propionate had an irritating after-effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only problem is that it has this really terrible mentholy smell that makes you want to throw up.</li>
            <li> But I was looking for a treatment lotion or ointment to use on specific itchy areas that were especially bad.</li>
            <li> I am having a terrible time with an itchy scalp and back after completing chemotherapy and radiation treatments.  </li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job but smells weird</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not provide any cooling effect for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes it expensive compared to just calamine with gets the job done</li>
            <li> Also the consistency is very thin.</li>
            <li> The bed bug bites didn&#x27;t show up until about a week after, but I bought this lotion as soon as the bites appeared and started to itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a terrible shingles outbreak.</li>
            <li> Since shingles is a virus from having the chicken pox</li>
            <li> I trust Aveeno &amp; the description mentioned that soothed chicken pox itch.  </li>
            <li> Helps with chicken pox itch immensley.</li>
            <li> Our five children had Chicken Pox and this lotion worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Below is a hopefully informative, constructive itemization of stuff I&#x27;ve tried for my bodywide painful poison ivy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Still, I don&#x27;t think it hurt and it didn&#x27;t smell bad, so 2 Stars for &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; rather than 1 Star for &amp;#34;I hated it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> your itching is worst at night and falling asleep is impossible,</li>
            <li> I hated the sight of the patchy itchy redness that would appear on my skin.</li>
            <li> My hands were itching very badly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re itchin&#x27; real bad, this is what you want.</li>
            <li> Ugh, it smells dreadful.</li>
            <li> worst inflammations, I&#x27;d put wound-honey atop the calamine, and protect that with duct-tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been bitten up by insects ever since I can remember. I bought this after coming home from a bed bug infested hotel room. The bed bug bites didn&#x27;t show up until about a week after, but I bought this lotion as soon as the bites appeared and started to itch like crazy. Although it doesn&#x27;t entirely get rid of the itch it does sooth the bites enough to where they don&#x27;t bother me and I can go on with whatever I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;ve used this on bed bug bites, flea bites, and mosquito bites, and it&#x27;s done the job of soothing the itch.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is &amp;#34;MY Brand&amp;#34; in that it is made for people with sensitive skin.  This anti-itch lotion contains no cortisone, which can actually cause more itching!  I can only find it at Amazon.  Thank you for stocking it.</li>
            <li> Lotion works well on itches. Recommended by a Dermatologist for minor itches.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re itchin&#x27; real bad, this is what you want. I came home from working in an Asian orpnanage unknowingly bringing scabies back with me as a reminder. This is the best at stopping you from tearing your skin apart.  Slight tingling and cooling brings sweet relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it has this really terrible mentholy smell that makes you want to throw up. Trust me though- it&#x27;s worth it. I now keep it in the medicine cabinet at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has dealt with the worst itches out there, here&#x27;s some more tips:&lt;br /&gt;Try taking a warm- not hot- bath. Even better, make an anti itch bath by putting 3 black tea bags and a quarter cup oatmeal in cheese cloth and tie it hanging below the faucet as the water runs.&lt;br /&gt;To moisturize itchy skin and help with the healing process as well as helping to prevent scarring, use coconut oil as an allover moisturizer and the anti-itch lotion only where you&#x27;re itching&lt;br /&gt;If your itching is worst at night and falling asleep is impossible, sometimes taking a Tylenol PM is the best solution around. Don&#x27;t forget to wear gloves to bed to keep you from clawing during sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck with the scratching!</li>
            <li> This was purchased to help my 8 year old granddaughter with itchy allergies that seem to appear as a small rash on her skin.</li>
            <li> i buy this for my kids for their bug bites and other itchy things and it works just as well if not better than calamine lotion</li>
            <li> The Aveeno Anti-Itch concentrated lotion arrived two hours ago. My hands were itching very badly. I applied the lotion and within minutes the itching stopped. No other lotion or treatment I have tried (including products with Hydrocortisone, zinc oxide &amp; ferric oxide, diphenhydramine hydrochloride)has worked as fast nor lasted as long as this to stop the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY something that works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is not available at most local stores, and it works well.</li>
            <li> So far, on the rare occasions that anybody in the family would have itchiness caused by insect bites or other causes indicated in the bottle, it has worked!</li>
            <li> The packaging and delivery time were excellent. But it was not effective for my rashes. Other Aveeno product like skin relief ones has been a great product for their own purpose though and I have been using them for a few years.</li>
            <li> I tried at least 10 different products on my rash caused by solvents used at work. My hands and wrists will get an itchy, burning rash  and this is the only product that HEALS and stops the itching over night. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This did stop my skin from itching, but I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my skin.  It felt a bit thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> Everything went well, thanks</li>
            <li> Works within 15 to 30 minutes of usage. A must have, household item. Effective for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. First time using this vendor and all went well. No delays.</li>
            <li> I have Eczema and use a body lotion constantly during the winter months. But I was looking for a treatment lotion or ointment to use on specific itchy areas that were especially bad. I read that Hydrocortisone cream is actually bad to use on a regular basis as it thins the skin membranes and make you itchier with prolonged use, so I wanted something to replace that. This had great reviews and I saw several mentions of people using it for Eczema so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of reading on Eczema and medicated products like this aren&#x27;t generally recommended for the record, but when you get desperate you&#x27;ll try anything to stop an itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this seems like a decent product and it will be nice to have on hand, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my itch; the effect was very mild. It&#x27;s better to have on hand for insect bites and that sort of thing. Incidentally, I put it away after a few uses and thought to review it today when I took it back out to use for a bug bite. It &amp;#34;helps&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t stop the itch, both on the eczema and the bug bite. I will use this as needed and it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing, but I probably would not buy it again. Oh, It does have a strong menthol scent, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me. It might be because of the kind of itching I am experiencing, but I was really hoping this would do the trick. Ever since I&#x27;ve become pregnant my legs are tortureously itchy. The bottle is also very small, so don&#x27;t expect a normal-sized aveeno bottle to be coming your way. I also didn&#x27;t care much for the medicinal scent and the pasty texture.</li>
            <li> I used this for eczema is working very well.</li>
            <li> I have bouts with eczema, and the over-the-counter product I&#x27;d had success with in the past was discontinued. After researching the ingredients, the Aveeno Anti-itch concentrate was the closest thing I could find. It helps to calm the itch and soothe the skin...which aids in healing. Not all Aveeno products have the same ingredients, and the main ingredient I looked for was Pramoxine HCI, and that&#x27;s in this particular lotion. I use this along with a mixture of glycerine and aloe, and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is a great brand, and this lotion is really soothing. It isn&#x27;t the BEST at stopping the itching, but no lotion is perfect. This is close though</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a terrible shingles outbreak. The doctors prescribed me medicine and all it did was dry out the rash and made it more painful than it already was. Since shingles is a virus from having the chicken pox I thought I would give this aveeno cream a shot. A couple of months later I was stressed and felt I was going to have another shingles outbreak so I immediately put the aveeno on the area I felt it coming in and it went away faster and hurt less than going to the doctors and getting something prescribed. I&#x27;m not sure if this could work for everyone, but it has helped me on a number of times when I feel my shingles acting up.</li>
            <li> It really works! The best anti-itch I have used before. This is my second order.</li>
            <li> Worked when nothing else would work on itchy allergies.  I had a stubborn allergy that nothing else would clear up, then I found Aveeno Concentrate.</li>
            <li> This is a gift to my mother-in-law, which she liked. She use it in her rushes.  which help her relief from the itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> Ugh, it smells dreadful. it works but I don;t like the medicinal smell at all. I would not purchase this again and I tend to like Aveeno products. Also the consistency is very thin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I brought it with me when I traveled to Europe, just in case I had dry skin.  It worked for me when my skin got dry and itchy.  My cute little 8-year-old cousin had hives and an allergic reaction to something, so I ended up applying it regularly to his hand.  Immediately, he would stop complaining about the itching.  I ended up giving it to him because it was the only cream that really helped him.  I will definitely repurchase soon! :)</li>
            <li> Works great! Smells a little bit like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Dry winter, Itchy legs works great. Beware of smell if you are sensitive. However the smell fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Mosquitoes bite me all the time, so having this was a relief</li>
            <li> This is more of a cream than a lotion. Using a thin lotion is so messy. This is thick enough to stay where you put it, not running all over the place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but doesn&#x27;t do a lot to help my chronic, itchy hives.</li>
            <li> I just discovered this product earlier this year.  Like many people with diabetes I have to deal with itchy skin much of the year.  This product is different from other anti-itch creams and lotions that I have used in that it is a very thick and creamy lotion which contains calamine and some kind of oats formula that is in the Aveeno products I have tried so far.  It soothes, seems to offer some moisture and stays put very well.  All I have to remember is to keep my hands clean after applying and not get the lotion in my eyes.  It is definitely a product I will continue to buy and use.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> works well, has that smell but doesn&#x27;t last long, too bad amazon don&#x27;t carry it any more, would have been nice subscribing every 3 months on it. the consistency is thick, creamy like but i prefer it that way instead of watery-like. easy to blend.</li>
            <li> I have crotch itch in the evening and nothing really worked. I tried this because its concentrated and works quite well. After putting some on the crotch, I&#x27;m itch free all night.</li>
            <li> I love this.. great for skin...</li>
            <li> I am having a terrible time with an itchy scalp and back after completing chemotherapy and radiation treatments.  I keep my skin moisturized, and I use gentle, moisturizing shampoo, so my skin and scalp are not dry or flaky.  But I wake up in the middle of the night with uncontrollable itching in both places.  I have tried everything--coconut oil, baby lotion, other soothing lotions--nothing worked.  But this actually works!  It&#x27;s pretty messy to put on my scalp because I have about an inch of hair now.  But it&#x27;s so worth it.  The itch goes away instantly.  I am so grateful that I found this, and I won&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many bug bite creams before. But this one really works wonder. I have two little ones 4year and 6 year old and they are not scared of bug bites now.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job but smells weird</li>
            <li> I just love Aveeno products!</li>
            <li> I use this for everything, even a preventative to dry skin itch. Aveeno makes a nice cost effective product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully aware this review will be maligned as going on tangents, but I don&#x27;t care, because I don&#x27;t want others with poison ivy to get worsened (or uninformed) as I&#x27;d endured via the med.system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a hopefully informative, constructive itemization of stuff I&#x27;ve tried for my bodywide painful poison ivy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both this Aveeno lotion and Caladryl offered me relief (after bathing in peppermint-oil baths)&lt;br /&gt;If baths were too warm, they caused a flare.&lt;br /&gt;So I stuck to lukewarm for the peppermint baths&lt;br /&gt;...and if the baths were plain (without oil), I ran the faucets even Cooler than lukewarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveeno lotion felt similar to Caladryl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also good for me were Calamine lotion and fragrance-free zinc-oxide ointment.&lt;br /&gt;...note that I&#x27;m not sure they offer fragrance-free zinc-oxide anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On worst inflammations, I&#x27;d put wound-honey atop the calamine, and protect that with duct-tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On less-bad inflammations I&#x27;d smear calamine plus a drop of Aveeno lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Then into that I&#x27;d mix aloe (from fresh-sliced aloe) plus flax-oil plus licorice extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for doctors&#x27; creams:&lt;br /&gt;Fluocinonide cream BURNED (avoid!!&lt;br /&gt;Triamcinolone cream was useless&lt;br /&gt;Fluticasone propionate had an irritating after-effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MethylPrednisolone pills (6,5,4,3,2,1) had no effect&lt;br /&gt;HCL pills, ditto&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for a \\&quot;famous, albeit affordable\\&quot; poison-ivy wash - that may have caused the poison to spread&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for a homeopathic \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; anti-itch cream from health food store - that irritated my skin</li>
            <li> Learned about this product through a friend. My toddler actually don&#x27;t mind me putting this on her for insect bites or rash.</li>
            <li> Works well on the itch!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom who had open heart surgery.  The area where she had sewn back the skin has been itching non stop (found out an animal skin was added to sew back together).  Asked a pharmacist about relieving the itch and was recommended of this mild aveeno itch relief.  At first, I was in doubt but my mom finally got some relief using this (had tried many products and even some itch relief medication).  She put this on whenever there is a need over a year.</li>
            <li> Works effectively for what it says it does. It does have a bit of an odor to it, presumably the calamine; however, it&#x27;s tolerable and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Great cream and a good price. Also it arrived quickly</li>
            <li> As soon as the mosquitos come out to bite, I reach for my Aveeno Anti-Itch; it works every time for me.</li>
            <li> Great for eczema! Trust me.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, and this works the best for my eczema. If I use it every day it prevents it from coming back.</li>
            <li> did not work for me in control of itchs as well as I hoped.  Worth a try though if you are needing itch control</li>
            <li> really thought  iwas getting the reglar  lotion  but it ok</li>
            <li> This lotion has helped relieve the itch from stubborn rashes that nothing has helped!  After buying bottles from local stores at higher prices, it makes it easier and cheaper to purchase it through Amazon.  I like keeping it on hand, we never know when poison ivy rashes are going to strike again!!</li>
            <li> Was very hopeful with this product.  Unfortunately, it did not provide any cooling effect for my skin.  Did not help my itchy skin that I get at night.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, removing the inching sensation within a minute or so. Just use as directed.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like smell and color of calamine, it works equally well.  I like the cap so it will never pump out</li>
            <li> Loved the smell. So refreshing. I had some itchiness in my legs and arms and thought of giving it a try. It worked! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> these is a bigger quantity than most anti-itch products.  works very well.</li>
            <li> My Fiance has had Skeeters Syndrome since she was a child. Aveeno&#x27;s anti itch creams is the only thing that works for her itch(IE mosquito&#x27;s, fleas, chiggers,etc.) Even over \\&quot;Experts\\&quot; prescriptions. These prices are a STEAL!!</li>
            <li> For the past year I have been covering my skin from hives. I hated the sight of the patchy itchy redness that would appear on my skin. Since I purchased Aveeno&#x27;s Anti-Itch concentrated lotion, the hives have minimized and even disappear faster. I started applying the lotion after every bath. Within two days, the hives have been under control. I&#x27;m happy to be living a more itch free life.</li>
            <li> I got into some poison something, sumac or ivy and this stuff kept me from ripping my skin right off. A must have for anyone that loves the outdoors.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for skill rashes, bites, etc.</li>
            <li> After having some skin issues I have tried plenty of other products. AVENO seems to beat them all. If you stumble upon this item GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li> Fav anti-itch, doesn&#x27;t smell, works.</li>
            <li> Works great to seal up a rash or dermatitis that is weeping. It does dry your skin out, so when your rash seals and stops weeping, there is a two day window or so where you have to switch off of this and to a moisturizer to prevent skin from cracking which will cause rash to go in re-mission (I used metaderm hyper moisturizer with success).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Hydrocortisone willy-nilly on mild/moderate dermatitis/rash/eczema is a scam promoted by dermatologists that causes &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; by thinning the skin which causes it to dry out faster! Do not use it unless you truly have severe dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is known for soothing lotions and this is no exception. For sunburn, insect bites, poison ivy, oak, etc. this product is number one. Always good to have a bottle in the house just in case</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super allergic person. So I need something&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s non-allergic. This one seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takako Masuda</li>
            <li> Itch did not reduce at all</li>
            <li> Yard work often leaves me with itchy skin, and this Aveeno lotion is a real help.  It soothes the discomfort irritated skin, and a little goes a long way.  It also helps with dry skin brought on by winter weather.  It is my first stop for dry, chaffed or irritated skin</li>
            <li> Very relieving. In five days relieving my son&#x27;s eczema. Highly recommend this product. Works well with the eczema therapy cream!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Finally some relief from the Mosquito bites. I tried many different anti itch and this seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> Works for me. Using it to help relieve itches, burning, and pain of Shingles. Nothing stops the symptoms completely, but I&#x27;ve bought every different kind of topicality ointment for my symptoms, and I was amazed this worked better than any of those usually recommended brands, including Cortaid, Lanacane, Benadryl cream, Cortizone 10, Domeboro powder, regular Calamine, and  Solarcaine. The AVEENO Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion, is thick and soothing, and has an external analgesic for pain, and Calamine for itching.  It also rubs in, so no pink stuff to stain your clothing. I put a cold pack on my Shingles right after I apply this cream and that has worked best for my relief. I also use a TENS device, which I highly recommend for pain!</li>
            <li> I guess this does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s not moisturizing and it&#x27;s a pink color.  So I do not recommend using it before wearing nice clothes as they may get stained.</li>
            <li> Winter and summer transition weather beats up my skin, Aveeno does the job of lessening the discomfort and itch!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> works great.. i use it for the whole family.. even me and my husband.</li>
            <li> Somewhat effective.  But I had a severe skin reaction to an ointment to kill precancer damaged skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;Might have worked better for a different problem.</li>
            <li> It was good in providing relief from insect bites. We didn&#x27;t use it for anything else. Easily absorbed once applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK product, but certainly not the best.&lt;br /&gt;I would say to my friends:  try it, maybe you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, try some other products.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service, great price.  This Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion was a good find for me.  It is not easily obtainable at our regular retailers and pharmacies.  This is a product that does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I&#x27;ve found this product, it works immediately, giving releaf after an itching rash, caused by some kind of allergie.</li>
            <li> Rash cleared up before I used this lotion, so I haven&#x27;t tried it but from what I can tell it is going to work great!</li>
            <li> Love it, awesome cream and it smells good...not too stong of a smell and it&#x27;s refreshing! I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I often recommend mixing a great lotion with a topical steroid  to my patients to cover a large area of itchy skin.  This is pretty thick stuff, so it could even be diluted some.  Not fragrant.</li>
            <li> Aveeno anti-itch lotion has helped ease an area of dry itchy skin.  I have tried others, but Aveeno seems to help the best</li>
            <li> Works with insect bites too. And heat rashes.</li>
            <li> Travel size cream. I don&#x27;t like the scent that much, but is really really good for very dry skin. The scent is probable the ingredient that makes it so good for dry skin</li>
            <li> Easier than the typical applicant tube</li>
            <li> I trust Aveeno &amp; the description mentioned that soothed chicken pox itch.  I had itch from shingles.  It worked so well that my comfort level went way up.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I have a condition which makes my arms itch intensly and nothing, I mean nothing has worked. Finally, I have found something that helps! This lotion really does the trick as it has Calamine (3%) and Pramoxine HCl (1%) in it which seems to be the key.  The calamine lotion does make the application appear a bit pink but rubbing it in well disguises this and helps the lotion work even better.  I would recommend this for all itching, but if you have itching that nothing has helped, give this a try. It&#x27;s not greasy and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The product material responds very well in relieving itching, but the overall product is frustrating. It needs a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this product because it works. I don&#x27;t want to keep \\&quot;reviewing it\\&quot; Doesn&#x27;t repeat sales speak for itself? I think so.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great on insect bites.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims 10 hours a week but has very sensitive skin. She had eczema all the time, scratching makes the skin never heal. By using this product and her other topical medications, she finally restored her eczema-free skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years. It really works very well on insect bites and such.  I usually try aloe gel first, and then use this if the aloe doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Helps with chicken pox itch immensley.</li>
            <li> I had itching and this worked very well for me. I may have applied 2-3 times and it has done its job.</li>
            <li> Works well for areas (my back) that have ongoing itchiness; soothes  and seems to dissipate the need to scratch. Also has a nice smell.  Gave a bottle to my pregnant friend suffering from PUPPP - it worked better than plain calamine lotion to relieve her itching</li>
            <li> I had a allergic reaction to a new detergent and i bought this to use on my rashes. it helps stop the itches but if you mess with the rash no amount of lotion is gonna help. This stuff is pretty sticky too so try not to use it on your whole limb.</li>
            <li> Lotion is thick and pinkish colored. It has a light smell of menthol / medicine. It works good after several minutes.</li>
            <li> This product worked for my itchy rash when nothing else touched it.  This product cleared up my itchy rash within 48 hours.  The product soothes the itchy, burning sensation and clears up the problem.  High Recommend!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I was still just as itchy after as before I put it on. Still, I don&#x27;t think it hurt and it didn&#x27;t smell bad, so 2 Stars for &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; rather than 1 Star for &amp;#34;I hated it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-itch cream I have ever used. I won&#x27;t be going back to regular hydro-cortisone any time soon. The aveeno lotion smells good and seems to relieve pain from itches and rashes almost immediately. I was concerned the bottle was going to be too small but its a perfect size for traveling and there&#x27;s a lot of lotion packed into the bottle. Plus, since it&#x27;s concentrated you don&#x27;t need to use much of it each time.</li>
            <li> Best anti-itch product I have found so far. I can&#x27;t walk outside in South Carolina without seeing a bug the size of a small cat, or something biting me and leaving a fist size bump that itches like crazy. Although the bites feel awesome to scratch, I get tired of scratching them every couple minutes, so I put this on and it stops right away.</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a white residue due to the calamine portion. Otherwise, this product works great. I find it relieves itching better than hydrocortisone. My suggestion would be to include some menthol or camphor to help soothe the affected area.</li>
            <li> I also like this product but somewhat pricey.  Aside from that it works well enough.  I keep this bottle in my office for sudden itching.</li>
            <li> Our five children had Chicken Pox and this lotion worked wonders.  They had no issues recovering and they have no scaring.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for relieving itch. Not greasy and absorbs easily into the skin with little or no residue.</li>
            <li> Received item. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a rash all over my pregnant belly due to hormones. I was trying to wait it out since my baby is due any day and it goes away after labor. Ive had the rash for 2 weeks and could not take the itch anymore. I started using this a day ago and noticed a significant decrease in the itch and the bumps fading. The bumps are still red in color but its only been 24 hours. I really wish I started using this 2 weeks sooner. The relief is worth it and safe to use.</li>
            <li> works great but does have an odor</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products and this lotion is really combating itch on my ankles.  I had back surgery and the nerve endings in my ankles were really bothering me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK product, but it&#x27;s just calamine with some added lotion inactives. Makes it expensive compared to just calamine with gets the job done just as well I have found.</li>
            <li> It greatly relived my itch skin.  Although, it has some unique smell though.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive then regular lotion.  If you are going to use it for your entire body,&lt;br /&gt;this 4 ounce bottle won&#x27;t last long and it will be better to get bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I recently had a bad case of hives from an allergic reaction to a medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helped a lot in the short run, which was worth quite a bit. Cooling and soothing. However, I found that after a couple of applications over the course of half a day or so, the product buildup became an irritant in itself, and I had to shower and remove it, which I didn&#x27;t necessarily feel well enough to want to do. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with aloe vera gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product contains a mild local anesthetic, so it may be more helpful for some things. I didn&#x27;t think of the aloe vera gel until the hives had improved somewhat, so it may not have compared as well in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again, but I sure hope I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
