            <li>I guess its ok...</li>
            <li>I love the electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>BUT this one is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It is now so quick &amp; easy to shave my legs!</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to manipulate and light weight.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job so far!</li>
            <li>It shaves you smoothly but seems like it takes a while to do it.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;ll take off the hair, but it won&#x27;t be quite as smooth as a razor shave would be.</li>
            <li>and I do not think that I will feel comfortable using another type.</li>
            <li>I used it only as a dry shaver for now, but it did a very good job, was easy to clean, and easy to charge!!  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>Smooth quick shave.</li>
            <li>Shaves close - as good as using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I even feel confident that if I used this in the shower, I&#x27;d be able to comfortably press more firmly for a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It replaced an old Remington that was pretty awesome; sadly the Panasonic has just never been that good.</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t bothered to unpack this from the box it came in that she was given at Christmas, so, no rating of any worth can be provided.</li>
            <li>Like it very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to clean and has it&#x27;s own little brush.</li>
            <li>Given as gift, feedback totally positive</li>
            <li>I have to run it over my legs many times to get them shaved, taking a very long time.</li>
            <li>This takes care of my legs and bikini area very well.</li>
            <li>She is pleased with that and that she can use it wet too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than shaving my legs with cream and razor blades all the time, but no, it does not get a close shave.</li>
            <li>It was more than I expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty loud.</li>
            <li>My wife has only been able to use the shaver once, dry.</li>
            <li>Wife wanted a new shaver to replace a Conair with a fried motor.  </li>
            <li>Love the little trimmer on it as well!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic brand is one that we have been able to depend on in the past.</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t care about how your legs feel but are only concerned that hair is not visible then this electric razor is much easier that shaving with a razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>No mess and no running the water for 15 min</li>
            <li>Have only used it dry and it does not shave as closely as a regular razor but so much faster and no mess.  </li>
            <li>Blades go dull really quickly</li>

            <li> Charge last long.</li>
            <li> i prefer using it dry outside of the shower</li>
            <li> I will try it wet later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shave wet with lathering lotion the next time I use it.</li>
            <li> I just do not like doing it on dry legs.</li>
            <li> Used it both dry and wet</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super difficult to shave in it.</li>
            <li> Never used it wet - if I could shave in the shower, I would just use a blade.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get a closer &amp; smoother shave doing a wet shave.</li>
            <li> All shavers I&#x27;ve ever tried leave a small amount of stubble that you can feel by hand, and this shaver is the same, but only slightly so.</li>
            <li> Not real impressed with performance so far.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> You have to align the little holes with the prongs and push it together.</li>
            <li> You will still have little stubbles.</li>
            <li> I did cut myself a few times with it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it is difficult to put back on the charger.</li>
            <li> The adjustable head comes loose, the attachment comb is worthless (didn&#x27;t stay on and pulled hairs - ouch), now after several years, the unit doesn&#x27;t keep a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> I have a small stall shower</li>
            <li> Sorry that I invested in replacement blades/foil last year.</li>
            <li> This is not a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use the product!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Like it very much.  Does what it said it does and I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this razor! It shaves you smoothly but seems like it takes a while to do it. I did cut myself a few times with it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife and she just loves it!  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver and after three shaves it no longer turns on. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this BC I have a small stall shower and it&#x27;s super difficult to shave in it. This takes care of my legs and bikini area very well. There&#x27;s a bikini attachment that trims everything without shaving it to the skin which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I could use it on my underarms, but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as a regular razor does, so I shave my underarms with a disposable razor. So it&#x27;ll take off the hair, but it won&#x27;t be quite as smooth as a razor shave would be.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Have only used it dry and it does not shave as closely as a regular razor but so much faster and no mess.  Great when we travel in our 5th wheel. No mess and no running the water for 15 min like I used to do.  I put it back on the charger as soon as I&#x27;m finished and have cleaned</li>
            <li> This is a great product . Very glad that I bought . Works great!</li>
            <li> The screen was damaged on receipt.  I was afraid to use the product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  I have another one just like it but lost the charging station and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere to buy one.</li>
            <li> Have had this razor for quite some time. It replaced an old Remington that was pretty awesome; sadly the Panasonic has just never been that good. The adjustable head comes loose, the attachment comb is worthless (didn&#x27;t stay on and pulled hairs - ouch), now after several years, the unit doesn&#x27;t keep a charge for very long. Sorry that I invested in replacement blades/foil last year. It&#x27;s also pretty loud. Never used it wet - if I could shave in the shower, I would just use a blade.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for years now and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;The blade and shape are just perfect and I do not think that I will feel comfortable using another type.</li>
            <li> A very good shaver.  I used it only as a dry shaver for now, but it did a very good job, was easy to clean, and easy to charge!!  I will try it wet later.</li>
            <li> This is a really good electric razor. It is now so quick &amp; easy to shave my legs! I just do not like doing it on dry legs. It does not give a close shave, &amp; my legs burn after use. I&#x27;ll shave wet with lathering lotion the next time I use it. The directions do state you&#x27;ll get a closer &amp; smoother shave doing a wet shave.</li>
            <li> Great product and no cutting.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother in law for Xmas. all i know is she using it periodically &amp; she says she likes it.</li>
            <li> You would be better off using a razor.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, couldn&#x27;t find in the local stores</li>
            <li> I love the shaver, what else can I say!.</li>
            <li> Blades go dull really quickly but you get what you pay for, I suppose.</li>
            <li> this is a nice product.  as others have stated, you will never get a super-smooth-close-as-razor shave with an electric razor BUT this one is pretty good.  your legs will feel like &#x27;the day after you shaved.&#x27;  so if you don&#x27;t care about how your legs feel but are only concerned that hair is not visible then this electric razor is much easier that shaving with a razor in the shower.  i prefer using it dry outside of the shower and I have been very happy with it.  i don&#x27;t quite understand the bikini attachment - this part doesn&#x27;t work for me - but it works on legs and underarms nicely</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to hold. Charge last long.</li>
            <li> Really nice electric shaver.  Best I have ever had.  Shaves close - as good as using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;The charger is a bit goofy tho works fine.&lt;br /&gt;I like it alot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a razor person, but this product is fantastic for touch-ups! I&#x27;ve only used it dry, and after using it, my leg hair is invisible to the naked eye, which is my intention. I always seem to forget I have something going on at the last minute, and I don&#x27;t want visible hair on display. All shavers I&#x27;ve ever tried leave a small amount of stubble that you can feel by hand, and this shaver is the same, but only slightly so. And again, no visible hair. It&#x27;s easy enough to clean and has it&#x27;s own little brush. I haven&#x27;t had any pinching or hair tugging, in part I think because I always pull my skin taught so the blades can do their job making precision cuts. I even feel confident that if I used this in the shower, I&#x27;d be able to comfortably press more firmly for a very close shave. I&#x27;ll update my review if that&#x27;s not the case!</li>
            <li> This does what I wanted it to do. Love the little trimmer on it as well!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easy to manipulate and light weight.  Smooth quick shave.</li>
            <li> My wife has only been able to use the shaver once, dry. She is pleased with that and that she can use it wet too.&lt;br /&gt;It is what was advertised. The Panasonic brand is one that we have been able to depend on in the past.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it is difficult to put back on the charger. You have to align the little holes with the prongs and push it together. It works great.</li>
            <li> Does not cut. Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Bought this figuring I could get a close shave quicker and wouldn&#x27;t have to replace (and spend money on blades) as often. Used it both dry and wet and it seemed like it was doing nothing. Returned the item and will continue using my regular razor.</li>
            <li> Not real impressed with performance so far. I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, not as close as a razor but what is.</li>
            <li> This is not a great shaver. I have to run it over my legs many times to get them shaved, taking a very long time. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Does a good job so far!</li>
            <li> Wonderful device. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> this was a gift mother in law loves it</li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works very well.</li>
            <li> It was more than I expected!</li>
            <li> I guess its ok...maybe I am not use to electric shavers..</li>
            <li> Given as gift, feedback totally positive</li>
            <li> I love the electric shaver.  It accomplishes everything I was looking for it to do. It makes life easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than shaving my legs with cream and razor blades all the time, but no, it does not get a close shave. You will still have little stubbles.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and the battery stays charged. I like it.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive and well designed product.  It works as well as any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and the wet/dry capability is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver according to my wife. She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted a new shaver to replace a Conair with a fried motor.  She hasn&#x27;t bothered to unpack this from the box it came in that she was given at Christmas, so, no rating of any worth can be provided.</li>
