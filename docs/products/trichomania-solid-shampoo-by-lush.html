    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>it smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li>The best part about this shampoo is that it has not interfered with the color.</li>
            <li>In fact, this shampoo is so amazing I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner anymore!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lathered well with any water, &amp; I think the person who didn&#x27;t get good lather probably needs their water treated.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself is good, though.</li>
            <li>I have to confess, sometimes I use it as body soap because it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for travel.  </li>
            <li>which I consider a good thing considering the state of my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a rich creamy lather and wonderful scent that feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this one!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, all of you short-haired people will love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I really liked Godiva and I like this one too</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, full of coconutty goodness.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I Love Juicy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>BUT you have to make sure you leave it in a well ventilated soap dish with a drain.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Trichomania.  </li>
            <li>I felt like it was more of like a lotion/conditioner type of shampoo.  </li>
            <li>was that if I had short hair, then it would work beautifully!</li>
            <li>I am insanely happy with this product and will be gifting it frequently.</li>
            <li>This is a great item from LUSH.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo bar leaves my hair shiny and the cuticle smooth.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li>The smell was really good at first, very coconuty.</li>
            <li>After a couple days you will realize how beautiful LUSH scents really are..</li>
            <li>This is the first ever shampoo that I am thoroughly in love with.</li>
            <li>Using this shampoo makes it really soft and shiny and I even find that styling products work better on my hair because it is so healthy now.  </li>
            <li>it at least once, if it doesn&#x27;t work for your hair... it&#x27;s also great to shave with!</li>
            <li>In fact, my color has lasted a LOT longer and is SO much more vibrant than when I used drugstore and even SALON shampoos specifically for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I worked my hair into a good lather and the next day my hair was super-cute, curly and defined.</li>
            <li>It is dead-on fresh coconut.  </li>
            <li>Most coconut scents today are the synthetic ones...not LUSH.</li>
            <li>I have never used a solid shampoo bar before, but LUSH has a great product here.  </li>
            <li>It was also a little more frizzy!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if its the best idea, but I also run it all over my body because it makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It cleasnes really well and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>It took care of the dry fly away feel the cheap stuff in my hotel had left.</li>
            <li>shampoo is amazing because it cleans my hair gently and does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>It leaves my husband&#x27;s coarse, short hair soft and smelling delightful.  </li>
            <li>I have very long naturally curly hair, and I find if I wash my hair more than once or twice a week with it, my hair dries out very quickly, but the smell is divine!  </li>
            <li>Also, your hair WILL be kind of dry</li>
            <li>But this is one of my absolute favorite LUSH products of all time...</li>
            <li>First off the scent.  </li>
            <li>Overall my hair feels soooooo much more healthier than when I used pantene.</li>
            <li>Instantly I fell in love with the scent of this.</li>
            <li>The price is so great and mine lasts over a month (though I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day...only every other day or every third day because of my dyed hair) &lt;br</li>
            <li>Most shampoos leave my hair extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>Make sure it is dry after use.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your hair healthy over time but your hair will feel dry until you use conditioner.</li>
            <li>I know that all the dirty-hippies say you don&#x27;t really need to wash your hair, it just needs to be massaged and conditioned and I bought into that for awhile, but</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny, and it is fun to use.</li>
            <li>Since now all liquids have to fit into a tiny ziplock bag, you do not have to include your shampoo and cond in this bag.  </li>
            <li>my hotel shampoo was very drying.   </li>
            <li>and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>However, if you have really oily hair, this is the thing for you.</li>
            <li>I really do like the way this stuff smells, but I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all...</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, oily hair, and I received Trichomania as a gift.</li>
            <li>After 3 uses, my dry frizzy locks were transformed into glossy smooth &#x27;movie star&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, but when I first used it, it left my hair very dry</li>
            <li>the Lush in NW Portland retains the soul &amp; spirit of Lush when I first started going there, much like the one in Victoria, BC)</li>
            <li>It is VERY SOFT, and if you leave it in the shower, sitting in a bit of water, it will disintegrate.  </li>
            <li>When I do that, I don&#x27;t even have to condition my super super thick hair.</li>
            <li>It works so well, lasts a very long time and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>then it will take your nose a little while (not too long though) to warm up to LUSH.</li>
            <li>but I need something that bubbles and cleans the scalp since I live in a dry and hot place.</li>
            <li>it feeling soft, yet clean and not weighted down.</li>
            <li>That being said, it smells great and isn&#x27;t bad to just use for its conditioning, but you need a real shampoo.</li>
            <li>All of Lush&#x27;s solid haircare lasts much longer than bottled stuff and contains no silicones.</li>
            <li>the truth is I&#x27;d rather have slightly stripped hair that is clean, than soft, grimy, grody, oily hair.</li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ll need to find a Lush store...</li>
            <li>LUSH product I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li>Use something natural for a change.</li>
            <li>First of all, it had a strange synthetic coconut smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to LUSH&#x27;s products but had never tried their hair products before.</li>
            <li>I got this tip off of the LUSH forums.</li>
            <li>I would buy it for my husband (and everytime we are near a LUSH shop, we do), but I wouldn&#x27;t get it just for me.</li>
            <li>for some reason this shampoo isn&#x27;t working for youafter giving it a fair shot (and I&#x27;m so sorry if it doesn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>I am 29 years old and I have wavy hair that gets both really dry and really oily.</li>
            <li>brought several different sized chunks back to friends who all thought it was fun.</li>
            <li>I usually use LUSH&#x27;s Rehab or Big shampoo, but got a free sample of this</li>
            <li>And I thought the shipping from the Lush website is a total ripoff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LUSH will give your hair a total makeover if you just give it a chance.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a tip: try leaving it on for a few minutes and not just rinsing it out right away.</li>
            <li>shampoo is weird to use the first time, I lathered it in my hands like soap and then worked it through my fine long hair.</li>
            <li>Trich is a true coconut scent, but there are also other ingredients so you might pick up a little on those too.</li>
            <li>However, the solid shampoo does not suds very well and the conditioner leaves a slight film.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I stuck with it, and now my hair is sooo soft, it hasn&#x27;t been so soft since I was a little kid...</li>
            <li>It dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage.</li>

            <li> It dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage.</li>
            <li> And third, it left my hair feeling really dry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my most recent bar has turned to mush, but thanks to a tip on the Lush Facebook page, I&#x27;ll try scooping it into a mold, &amp; put it in the fridge, &amp; see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;However, $9.95 for a 3.5 oz bar is crazy!!</li>
            <li> By the third time of using this, though, even though I worked my hair into a very good lather and massaged and rinsed, a build-up of oil made my hair look disgusting.</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly hair that is dyed black.  </li>
            <li> the first few times you use this if you are used to using other shampoos with silicone and lots of other chemicals.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review.</li>
            <li> all \\&quot;soaped-up\\&quot; I have really long hair &amp; all</li>
            <li> ....which is thick &amp; mostly straight.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble getting it to lather, but if you&#x27;re new to Lush products, give them a few tries before giving up.</li>
            <li> At first my hair felt a little drier than usual.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, Trichomania is for you.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and frizzy and color treated.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s left in water, say goodbye to it in a couple of days, as you will be left with a mushy mess half the size of when you left it.</li>
            <li> I have hair that goes way past my shoulders and have moved on to Lush&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an oily scalp, however I noticed that after using Trichomania Solid Shampoo, my hair felt really oily (as weird as that sounds) later in the day.  </li>
            <li> And this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess.</li>
            <li> So, if you have long, thick hair, then save yourself a whole lot of time &amp; trouble by sticking with conventional shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am a huge LUSH fan but was a little disappointed with this shampoo bar.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but am disappointed that the smell does not linger after the shower.</li>
            <li> For years my hair had been living off a diet of silicone and other crappy stuff.</li>
            <li> For me, there was no residue left behind, only softness.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have silicones and other products to weigh your hair down, so you will see some changes in your hair as it is getting healthier.</li>
            <li> It makes a TON of creamy, thick lather with only a few swipes through (soaking) wet hair.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It smells like real coconuts, not that synthetic crap in suntan lotions, and works wonders on my dry, colored, and generally abused hair.</li>
            <li> It has even made it shinier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I was using Pantene on my super thick, colored hair for a long time, and was constantly frustrated.  </li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair, and this leaves</li>

            <li> ....which is thick &amp; mostly straight. It&#x27;s lathered well with any water, &amp; I think the person who didn&#x27;t get good lather probably needs their water treated. Unfortunately, my most recent bar has turned to mush, but thanks to a tip on the Lush Facebook page, I&#x27;ll try scooping it into a mold, &amp; put it in the fridge, &amp; see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;However, $9.95 for a 3.5 oz bar is crazy!! And I thought the shipping from the Lush website is a total ripoff.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll need to find a Lush store...I just wish Lush&#x27;s newest stores aren&#x27;t almost all in these ugly \\&quot;upscale\\&quot; shopping malls, at least in the Northwest US.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve revised that last line, the Lush in NW Portland retains the soul &amp; spirit of Lush when I first started going there, much like the one in Victoria, BC)</li>
            <li> After 3 uses, my dry frizzy locks were transformed into glossy smooth &#x27;movie star&#x27; hair.  I am now officially a LUSHie.  I am insanely happy with this product and will be gifting it frequently.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I have thick, dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp. And this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess. It dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage. The smell was really good at first, very coconuty. But then after a few uses it developed a weird scent, like playdoh and pepper. So I just used up the rest of it as regular soap. It has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars.</li>
            <li> Unless you have about and extra half-hour to spend in the shower, skip the solid shampoo. This stuff does work but it takes forever to get a lather going. I have hair that goes way past my shoulders and have moved on to Lush&#x27;s \\&quot;I Love Juicy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, Trichomania is for you.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It smells like real coconuts, not that synthetic crap in suntan lotions, and works wonders on my dry, colored, and generally abused hair. Plus, it lasts forever. All of Lush&#x27;s solid haircare lasts much longer than bottled stuff and contains no silicones. They do take some getting used to but once you adjust, everything else will smell so chemical and you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever used them.</li>
            <li> I am a huge LUSH fan but was a little disappointed with this shampoo bar.  The smell wasn&#x27;t too bad once you use it, so that didn&#x27;t bother me at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and coarse below-the-shoulder hair.  I don&#x27;t have an oily scalp, however I noticed that after using Trichomania Solid Shampoo, my hair felt really oily (as weird as that sounds) later in the day.  It was also a little more frizzy!! I usually use LUSH&#x27;s Rehab or Big shampoo, but got a free sample of this so I wanted to try it out.  I did have a hard time lathering this up, even though I rubbed it down my hair AND melted a little between my hands and ran my hands through my hair.  I did follow with a conditioner, but that either made my hair worse or didn&#x27;t help at all.  I ended up giving the rest of the bar to a friend who loves coconuts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One LUSH product I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is a great item from LUSH.  It works so well, lasts a very long time and is worth every penny.  First off the scent.  It is dead-on fresh coconut.  Not the fake sun tan oil/beach smell you&#x27;d expect.  It makes a TON of creamy, thick lather with only a few swipes through (soaking) wet hair.  It cleasnes really well and rinses clean.  For me, there was no residue left behind, only softness.  As I said, it does last for ages BUT you have to make sure you leave it in a well ventilated soap dish with a drain.  If it&#x27;s left in water, say goodbye to it in a couple of days, as you will be left with a mushy mess half the size of when you left it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Try it at least once, if it doesn&#x27;t work for your hair... it&#x27;s also great to shave with!</li>
            <li> I was using Pantene on my super thick, colored hair for a long time, and was constantly frustrated.  Using this shampoo makes it really soft and shiny and I even find that styling products work better on my hair because it is so healthy now.  My stylist recommended this product and warned me against Pantene, which uses floor wax to flatten the hair follicle.  FLOOR WAX! Do you want that in your hair?  Use something natural for a change.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Trichomania.  I have very long naturally curly hair that is dyed black.  I have tried just about every shampoo and hair product out there.  Most shampoos leave my hair extremely dry.  This shampoo bar leaves my hair shiny and the cuticle smooth.  It has a rich creamy lather and wonderful scent that feels luxurious.  If you have difficult to please hair like mine, definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I worked my hair into a good lather and the next day my hair was super-cute, curly and defined. By the third time of using this, though, even though I worked my hair into a very good lather and massaged and rinsed, a build-up of oil made my hair look disgusting. I know that all the dirty-hippies say you don&#x27;t really need to wash your hair, it just needs to be massaged and conditioned and I bought into that for awhile, but the truth is I&#x27;d rather have slightly stripped hair that is clean, than soft, grimy, grody, oily hair. That being said, it smells great and isn&#x27;t bad to just use for its conditioning, but you need a real shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the first ever shampoo that I am thoroughly in love with. I am 29 years old and I have wavy hair that gets both really dry and really oily. I also have premature gray which makes my hair difficult to manage because some of it is rather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is amazing because it cleans my hair gently and does not dry it out. In fact, this shampoo is so amazing I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner anymore! I wash my hair every other day. Any longer than that and it gets too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra plus... it smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to lather enough.  I felt like it was more of like a lotion/conditioner type of shampoo.  I enjoy the smell but I need something that bubbles and cleans the scalp since I live in a dry and hot place.</li>
            <li> I really liked Godiva and I like this one too but it melts in the shower, so always keep it in some some of container. I love the smell but am disappointed that the smell does not linger after the shower. It really makes your hair healthy over time but your hair will feel dry until you use conditioner. Overall my hair feels soooooo much more healthier than when I used pantene.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this shampoo.  First of all, it had a strange synthetic coconut smell.  Second, it didn&#x27;t lather at all. And third, it left my hair feeling really dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really excited about the coconut scent. I can take it or leave it. The shampoo itself is good, though. I have very long thick hair, and this leaves it feeling soft, yet clean and not weighted down. I&#x27;m left with a lot of body afterward. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble getting it to lather, but if you&#x27;re new to Lush products, give them a few tries before giving up. They don&#x27;t have silicones and other products to weigh your hair down, so you will see some changes in your hair as it is getting healthier.</li>
            <li> Most coconut scents today are the synthetic ones...not LUSH. If you&#x27;re used to synthetic stuff (and we ALL are) then it will take your nose a little while (not too long though) to warm up to LUSH. After a couple days you will realize how beautiful LUSH scents really are.. Trich is a true coconut scent, but there are also other ingredients so you might pick up a little on those too. Also, your hair WILL be kind of dry the first few times you use this if you are used to using other shampoos with silicone and lots of other chemicals. LUSH will give your hair a total makeover if you just give it a chance. My hair was dry and frizzy and color treated. I was afraid it would ruin my hair, but nothing else was working so I gave Trich a shot. I&#x27;m used to LUSH&#x27;s products but had never tried their hair products before. Instantly I fell in love with the scent of this. At first my hair felt a little drier than usual. I was told that there would be an adjustment period. For years my hair had been living off a diet of silicone and other crappy stuff. Anyway, I stuck with it, and now my hair is sooo soft, it hasn&#x27;t been so soft since I was a little kid...way before I started dying my hair. It has even made it shinier and less frizzy. Here&#x27;s a tip: try leaving it on for a few minutes and not just rinsing it out right away. Leave it on while you do everything else you need to do in the shower and then rinse. It helps a LOT. When I do that, I don&#x27;t even have to condition my super super thick hair. The best part about this shampoo is that it has not interfered with the color. In fact, my color has lasted a LOT longer and is SO much more vibrant than when I used drugstore and even SALON shampoos specifically for color treated hair. I am so thrilled with this product. The price is so great and mine lasts over a month (though I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day...only every other day or every third day because of my dyed hair) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If for some reason this shampoo isn&#x27;t working for youafter giving it a fair shot (and I&#x27;m so sorry if it doesn&#x27;t) you can use it for shaving. I got this tip off of the LUSH forums. My legs are sooo moisturized after shaving with Trich. None of the shaving creams I&#x27;ve ever tried have given me such results. I&#x27;m not sure if its the best idea, but I also run it all over my body because it makes my skin super soft. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review. But this is one of my absolute favorite LUSH products of all time...I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this wonderful product. I strongly recommend this one!!</li>
            <li> It smells so good, full of coconutty goodness.  It doesn&#x27;t lather up well, but little lather doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it isn&#x27;t working.  It leaves my husband&#x27;s coarse, short hair soft and smelling delightful.  I have very long naturally curly hair, and I find if I wash my hair more than once or twice a week with it, my hair dries out very quickly, but the smell is divine!  I have to confess, sometimes I use it as body soap because it smells so good.  It is VERY SOFT, and if you leave it in the shower, sitting in a bit of water, it will disintegrate.  Make sure it is dry after use.  I would buy it for my husband (and everytime we are near a LUSH shop, we do), but I wouldn&#x27;t get it just for me.</li>
            <li> I have never used a solid shampoo bar before, but LUSH has a great product here.  It makes my hair soft and shiny, and it is fun to use.</li>
            <li> This product is good for travel.  Since now all liquids have to fit into a tiny ziplock bag, you do not have to include your shampoo and cond in this bag.  However, the solid shampoo does not suds very well and the conditioner leaves a slight film.  The feeling I got was why can&#x27;t I just use soap if this is all it does?</li>
            <li> I bought this on a trip to Canada ... my hotel shampoo was very drying.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is weird to use the first time, I lathered it in my hands like soap and then worked it through my fine long hair. Not too oily for me and I really like the smell. It took care of the dry fly away feel the cheap stuff in my hotel had left. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I brought several different sized chunks back to friends who all thought it was fun.</li>
            <li> but it definitally did not work as it was intended. It is intended to moisturize hair. I have long, fine, oily hair, and I received Trichomania as a gift. I love the smell, but when I first used it, it left my hair very dry which I consider a good thing considering the state of my hair. It just didnt do what it was supposed to. However, if you have really oily hair, this is the thing for you. No problems with lathering either, especally if you rub the bar in your hair, not in your hands. Doesnt leave white flakes either.</li>
            <li> I really do like the way this stuff smells, but I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all...It took me quite some time to get my hair all \\&quot;soaped-up\\&quot; I have really long hair &amp; all I could think of while I was useing this shampoo bar was that if I had short hair, then it would work beautifully! So, if you have long, thick hair, then save yourself a whole lot of time &amp; trouble by sticking with conventional shampoo. Otherwise, all of you short-haired people will love this stuff!</li>
