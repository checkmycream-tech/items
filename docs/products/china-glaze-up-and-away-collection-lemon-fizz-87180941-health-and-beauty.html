            <li>I was scouting for the perfect yellow nail polish and came across this shade, and I FELL INLOVE WITH IT!</li>
            <li>but I will still use this just cause of the color! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the color would appeal to some.</li>
            <li>Yeah, looks faded and like this seller just had these lying around someplace--trying to get rid of some merchandise that didn&#x27;t sell when it was &amp;#34;hot.&amp;#34;  Never again from this seller for sure.  </li>
            <li>the price was even better.</li>
            <li>Glad to have gotten it.</li>
            <li>what a price  better than all the stores around my neighborhood  </li>
            <li>and they many colors to choose from my customers love it</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a fan of that, but overall I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this polish during Spring and Summer.</li>

            <li>Perfect pastel yellow, like a baby chick.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect yellow!</li>
            <li>This yellow is perfect.</li>
            <li>you get a wonderful pastel yellow.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right, smooth as glass with great opacity and no streaking or chalky look, one of the easiest paler yellows I have ever used - this is going to blow my Zoya one out of the water</li>
            <li>Every color I&#x27;ve ordered has been great and vibrant, will be ordering even more colors.</li>
            <li>great product, as expected, high quality, very cheery and springy, will do business again!</li>
            <li>I love the colour yellow and was trying to find a nice shade that wasn&#x27;t too bright and appropriate to wear for work.</li>
            <li>Love the color and quick shipping!</li>
            <li>It is very bright and very YELLOW!</li>
            <li>China glaze is an amazing company and is always consistent with the quality of their products</li>
            <li>Very nice color of Yellow dries very fast nice color for the summer.</li>
            <li>While this color is beautiful on its own it is also a great background color for nail art, (not as stark as white) and the formula is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lemon Fizz fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It is the absolute perfect pastel yellow.</li>
            <li>This polish arrived early, and was in good shape.</li>
            <li>Lemon Fizz is a very nice pastel yellow.</li>
            <li>I have many colors from this brand and they are all really pretty.</li>
            <li>It is a very light yellow color and looks pretty good on nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really cute color, a nice pastel yellow.</li>
            <li>The color is a bright creme yellow that is a spring/ summer color -</li>
            <li>Very cute light, pastel yellow color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a true, opaque cream finish that needs 2-3 coats for full opacity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;China Glaze is becoming a fast favourite of mine too!</li>
            <li>It is even more vibrant in person.</li>
            <li>Nice light springy yellow color.</li>
            <li>This is a great nail polish, you might have to put on more than one coat depending on how thick you put it on to begin with.</li>
            <li>Three coats is the maximum needed, and two is adequate if you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This polish was one that my daughter went through quickly</li>
            <li>It was well packaged and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It needs a few coats, but otherwise is great quality.</li>
            <li>I do not use very often but is good for when I do want yellow.</li>
            <li>really nice yellow pastel color.</li>
            <li>and this color is super pretty</li>
            <li>It wears off easily, but for me it is not a problem since I like to change colors frequently.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and all of their cool colors.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be more of a softer buttercup yellow based on the online pics.</li>
            <li>Shows up on nails exactly as it is in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love yellow polish during summer months!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too bright and not too pale, it&#x27;s the prefect mix.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite yellow polishes that I own by far - definitely recommended.</li>
            <li>I like China Glaze polis as it goes on so nice and smooth and last a long time without chipping.  </li>
            <li>The color is lovely but kind of a waste if it doesn&#x27;t actually stick longer than 10 minutes on my nails.</li>
            <li>My husband loves all my fun new nail colors.</li>
            <li>I used three coats to cover really well, but I&#x27;m happy that it didn&#x27;t dry a darker shade due to having too much on.  </li>
            <li>This color is great and it is one of the few lighter yellow shades I have seen.</li>
            <li>and I think it suits my skintone very well.</li>
            <li>Formula was good- not too streaky or too thick.</li>
            <li>; that I&#x27;m used to, it was a softer but still proud pale yellow.</li>
            <li>Went on like glue and didn&#x27;t dry smooth.</li>
            <li>The nail polish consistency is great if you apply two coats with top and bottom base, it lasts for about 5 days for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to explain, but overall it&#x27;s a very nice polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not orangy or to neon yellow or anything, just a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>So many colors but so little time.</li>
            <li>colour itself is very cute, I&#x27;ve not often seen pale yellow nail polish</li>
            <li>Not the first issue I&#x27;ve had with China Glaze, chips constantly.</li>
            <li>Pretty pastel yellow.</li>
            <li>I got this colour today and love it, especially combined with other pastel colours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pleasantly surprised me!</li>
            <li>i suppose if you have a lot of time to do a few coats, it would be fine.</li>
            <li>Also a pro is the fact that it is a nail hardener and I have soft nails.</li>
            <li>I loved the color, especially for spring, but the only thing i noticed was that it kind of dried slow compared to my other nail polishes, and would be clumpy/smushy at times, after I had put it on and waited a while.</li>
            <li>As with other China Glaze products it goes on easily and lasts pretty well with top and base coats.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty pale yellow, even with the three coats.  </li>
            <li>A lovely pale yellow without any of that metallic or brassy sheen that other yellow polishes have.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure if the same goes for everyone, but a good yellow seems hard to come by in the nailpolish world.</li>
            <li>However, the consistency of the polish is kind of funny--it&#x27;s thin when you&#x27;re applying it and can be extremely runny, and then becomes goopy as soon as it is on the nail.</li>

            <li> As with other China Glaze products it goes on easily and lasts pretty well with top and base coats.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty pale yellow, even with the three coats.  </li>
            <li> A lovely pale yellow without any of that metallic or brassy sheen that other yellow polishes have.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if the same goes for everyone, but a good yellow seems hard to come by in the nailpolish world.</li>
            <li> However, the consistency of the polish is kind of funny--it&#x27;s thin when you&#x27;re applying it and can be extremely runny, and then becomes goopy as soon as it is on the nail.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting a pale yellow shade for a while and really dug this shade.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and usually done in 1-2 coats, typical China Glaze</li>
            <li> By just looking at this subtle yellow for my collection makes me smile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick and peeled off really easy too, but it might have been just my batch.</li>
            <li> I had bought 4 other brand&#x27;s &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; nail polish and the colors all dried really funny.</li>
            <li> They either looked like a gross dark mustard yellow</li>
            <li> but I will probably wear it all year long</li>
            <li> This nail polish had me worried that it would be like a lot of other yellow polishes that I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very subtle color that stays feminine even though it&#x27;s not a traditional shade, and China Glaze polishes always last a long time and are high quality.</li>
            <li> It is on the thicker side, and if you stroke over the polish to much it becomes thick and harder to work with.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you&#x27;re applying.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a pale lemon yellow nail polish and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Pale yellow at</li>
            <li> I believe this is due to the &#x27;hardener&#x27; in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other China Glaze reviews.  </li>
            <li> I love china glaze and was a bit disappointed by this color.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with other china glaze colors.</li>
            <li> Got here faster than expected!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the polish to be a little thicker, bit</li>
            <li> A little transparent but two coats corrects that.</li>
            <li> al i needed and it dried within 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Too bad it took a base, 2 coats, and a top coat to actually achieve uniformity.</li>
            <li> I recommend using white as a base before applying 2-3 coats of this yellow.</li>
            <li> However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the polish is quite hard to work with.</li>
            <li> BEWARE PURCHASING LIMITED EDITION ITEMS!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> wayyy too thin and streaky.</li>
            <li> Very subtle.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t as bored.....</li>
            <li> Its very very thin.</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5, but when I applied it on my nails, it was so streaky!!! :(</li>
            <li> But every time I put it on I&#x27;m always disappointed.</li>
            <li> Polish goes on terribly, need 2</li>
            <li> Like painting with watery goo!&lt;br /&gt;Looks terrible on!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible formula.</li>

            <li> By just looking at this subtle yellow for my collection makes me smile. I wanted a bright but pastel yell and I got it in this bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this color. It is so eye catching. It is even more vibrant in person. I have many colors from this brand and they are all really pretty. Some of the colors only need one coat. My husband loves all my fun new nail colors. He says they look like house paint-he meant that as a compliment. Now that I have found this brand I will be buying all my nail polish from them. They have so many awesome colors. I highly recommend this brand and all of their cool colors.</li>
            <li> Love it and the packaging.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great. It is a solid color so one coat is al i needed and it dried within 2 minutes. perfect i say GO GET IT!!</li>
            <li> i just recently broke my finger and while waiting for it to heal i was doing all sorts of designs with this. im so glad it came ahead of time(5 days!)so i wasn&#x27;t as bored.....over all a great product!</li>
            <li> I was scouting for the perfect yellow nail polish and came across this shade, and I FELL INLOVE WITH IT! love the color and of course the brand, but it was very streaky! :( I would give it a 5, but when I applied it on my nails, it was so streaky!!! :( but I will still use this just cause of the color! :)</li>
            <li> The nail polish consistency is great if you apply two coats with top and bottom base, it lasts for about 5 days for me. The product came off the brush evenly on my nail bed and everyone complemented the color. The color is a bright creme yellow that is a spring/ summer color - but I will probably wear it all year long it&#x27;s so cute! China glaze is an amazing company and is always consistent with the quality of their products</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be more of a softer buttercup yellow based on the online pics. It is very bright and very YELLOW! Not what I was expecting. It&#x27;s always a gamble when buying nail polish online so it&#x27;s not a fault of the product itself. I&#x27;m sure the color would appeal to some. Just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Yeah, looks faded and like this seller just had these lying around someplace--trying to get rid of some merchandise that didn&#x27;t sell when it was &amp;#34;hot.&amp;#34;  Never again from this seller for sure.  BEWARE PURCHASING LIMITED EDITION ITEMS!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color...not to bright just right and the price was even better. Just remember to use a basecoat under it...</li>
            <li> Love the color and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> This is another great color for the Spring/Summer. Very subtle. You will need to coats in order for the color to be opaque.</li>
            <li> Very cute light, pastel yellow color. I always get compliments whenever I wear it. I have medium tan asian skin and I think it suits my skintone very well. The color is opaque after 2 coats.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a pale lemon yellow nail polish and this fits the bill. Glad to have gotten it.</li>
            <li> what a price  better than all the stores around my neighborhood  and they many colors to choose from my customers love it</li>
            <li> I love love love the color of this polish and got so many compliments! However, the consistency of the polish is kind of funny--it&#x27;s thin when you&#x27;re applying it and can be extremely runny, and then becomes goopy as soon as it is on the nail. I believe this is due to the &#x27;hardener&#x27; in the ingredients. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a fan of that, but overall I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I like China Glaze polis as it goes on so nice and smooth and last a long time without chipping.  Every color I&#x27;ve ordered has been great and vibrant, will be ordering even more colors.</li>
            <li> Pale yellow at it&#x27;s best! Sunny without the burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a true, opaque cream finish that needs 2-3 coats for full opacity. While this color is beautiful on its own it is also a great background color for nail art, (not as stark as white) and the formula is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze is one of the &amp;#34;top 3&amp;#34; companies that I gravitate to when I look for polish.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right, smooth as glass with great opacity and no streaking or chalky look, one of the easiest paler yellows I have ever used - this is going to blow my Zoya one out of the water</li>
            <li> Very nice color of Yellow dries very fast nice color for the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really cute color, a nice pastel yellow. But every time I put it on I&#x27;m always disappointed. I think I just don&#x27;t handle yellow well as a stand alone color for my nails. It&#x27;s a little thick and peeled off really easy too, but it might have been just my batch.</li>
            <li> Did not like it. It would be a nice pastel color if the formula was not soooo streaky. Two coats are not enough, but the third one looks bulky. Since i got it anyway, I am thinking of using it under a glitter - may help.</li>
            <li> Polish goes on terribly, need 2+ coats (I went with 3 and it STILL chipped instantly, w/ topcoat and basecoat). Not the first issue I&#x27;ve had with China Glaze, chips constantly. The color is lovely but kind of a waste if it doesn&#x27;t actually stick longer than 10 minutes on my nails.</li>
            <li> Lemon Fizz is a beautiful pastel yellow that looks great on my nails. I absolutely love this polish during Spring and Summer. It&#x27;s a very subtle color that stays feminine even though it&#x27;s not a traditional shade, and China Glaze polishes always last a long time and are high quality. This is one of my favorite yellow polishes that I own by far - definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> China Glaze -Best colors I&#x27;ve ever used and I have  been doing nails&lt;br /&gt;for over 20 years. Best coverage, richest and unusual colors.</li>
            <li> Perfect summer color! It needs a few coats, but otherwise is great quality.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting a pale yellow shade for a while and really dug this shade. Too bad it took a base, 2 coats, and a top coat to actually achieve uniformity. Then the edges started peeling almost immediately. It gets stars only for the color choices.</li>
            <li> I love this color. It is the absolute perfect pastel yellow. Great for spring manis. As with other China Glaze products it goes on easily and lasts pretty well with top and base coats. Overall, very pleased with this purchase. Quick shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> Streaky!  Like painting with watery goo!&lt;br /&gt;Looks terrible on!&lt;br /&gt;Color is great.....they just need to work on the texture.&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other China Glaze reviews.  I was expecting the polish to be a little thicker, bit it&#x27;s still nice.  I used three coats to cover really well, but I&#x27;m happy that it didn&#x27;t dry a darker shade due to having too much on.  It&#x27;s a very pretty pale yellow, even with the three coats.  It&#x27;s not orangy or to neon yellow or anything, just a very pretty color.  If you have the time to use a couple of coats this will be a good addition to your collection.</li>
            <li> Love China Glaze!  This color is great and it is one of the few lighter yellow shades I have seen.</li>
            <li> I loved the color, especially for spring, but the only thing i noticed was that it kind of dried slow compared to my other nail polishes, and would be clumpy/smushy at times, after I had put it on and waited a while. It was still a great deal, so I would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I love this color! Shows up on nails exactly as it is in the bottle. Also a pro is the fact that it is a nail hardener and I have soft nails. It lasted a couple of days through work; but I use a lot of water.  Think this will be my go to brand in the future. So many colors but so little time.</li>
            <li> I did not have any yellow nail colors so I bought this one. It is a very light yellow color and looks pretty good on nails. I do not use very often but is good for when I do want yellow. Formula was good- not too streaky or too thick.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Great pastel. Not too bright and not too pasty! I wouldn&#x27;t wear as one color on my nails but it&#x27;s really great when used with nail designs.</li>
            <li> really nice yellow pastel color. I like it. It wears off easily, but for me it is not a problem since I like to change colors frequently.</li>
            <li> I love china glaze and was a bit disappointed by this color.  it is a tad watery.  i suppose if you have a lot of time to do a few coats, it would be fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect pastel yellow, like a baby chick.</li>
            <li> Pretty pastel yellow. Great for Easter or summer! I recommend using white as a base before applying 2-3 coats of this yellow.</li>
            <li> I love the colour yellow and was trying to find a nice shade that wasn&#x27;t too bright and appropriate to wear for work. Lemon Fizz fit the bill. It&#x27;s a lighter shade, but still noticeable as yellow.  It looked great under a yellow&amp;red glitter polish I added on top as well. I will definitely be using this colour a lot during the summer.</li>
            <li> Nice light springy yellow color. Almost like lemon pudding color. Goes on smoothly and usually done in 1-2 coats, typical China Glaze</li>
            <li> Terrible formula. Went on like glue and didn&#x27;t dry smooth. I don&#x27;t have a problem with other china glaze colors.</li>
            <li> Love this color!  Got here faster than expected! This is a great nail polish, you might have to put on more than one coat depending on how thick you put it on to begin with. Wonderful product :)</li>
            <li> This is the perfect yellow! It&#x27;s not too bright and not too pale, it&#x27;s the prefect mix. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great summer color.</li>
            <li> A lovely pale yellow without any of that metallic or brassy sheen that other yellow polishes have. A little transparent but two coats corrects that. Gorgeous,  like lemon meringue.</li>
            <li> I got this colour today and love it, especially combined with other pastel colours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour itself is very cute, I&#x27;ve not often seen pale yellow nail polish so I had to buy it. I&#x27;ve noticed several reviews here saying this polish is watery, which is something I&#x27;ve noticed with all yellows I&#x27;ve tried across several brands. Maybe it&#x27;s something about the pigment? Either way, this is one of the smoothest, best covering yellows I&#x27;ve used. Three coats is the maximum needed, and two is adequate if you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze is becoming a fast favourite of mine too!</li>
            <li> great product, as expected, high quality, very cheery and springy, will do business again!</li>
            <li> This polish arrived early, and was in good shape. It goes on nails perfectly and it looks exactly like it does in the picture. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if the same goes for everyone, but a good yellow seems hard to come by in the nailpolish world. I had bought 4 other brand&#x27;s &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; nail polish and the colors all dried really funny. They either looked like a gross dark mustard yellow or they were so see through that you would have to apply a million coats! This yellow is perfect. Two coats and you get a wonderful pastel yellow. Great for Easter designs!</li>
            <li> I am such a big fan of China glaze and this color is super pretty .. will use for waster next year..</li>
            <li> Lemon Fizz is a very nice pastel yellow. It is opaque and only takes two coats. However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the polish is quite hard to work with. It is on the thicker side, and if you stroke over the polish to much it becomes thick and harder to work with. It&#x27;s a bit hard to explain, but overall it&#x27;s a very nice polish. Just be careful when you&#x27;re applying.</li>
            <li> this nailpolish is just so so. Its very very thin. I dont know if i would purchase this brand again</li>
            <li> This nail polish had me worried that it would be like a lot of other yellow polishes that I&#x27;ve tried... wayyy too thin and streaky. You know the kind, that when you put it on it takes 4 coats to be as opaque as what it APPEARS to be in the bottle. This pleasantly surprised me! It took two coats to get it to the desired color that I wanted and it covered well with no streaking. This color also wasn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;Blind Me Yellow&amp;#34; that I&#x27;m used to, it was a softer but still proud pale yellow. This is great for the Summer and Spring seasons! :)</li>
            <li> I love yellow polish during summer months! This polish was one that my daughter went through quickly and Sally&#x27;s didn&#x27;t keep it in regular stock. Very pleased to have it again. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.</li>
