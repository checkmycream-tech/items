            <li> the only thing is it is a little bare on the scalp, but when you are done grading or whatever, you can&#x27;t tell, only she you are working with the hair</li>
            <li> This mannequin sucks it isnt even real hair, it is boars hair, you cant even color it, when I colored it all the hair fell out</li>
            <li> The hair is a little thin and falls out easily, but serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I did see that the hair was shedding a little when brushed, and tips of hair are in an eneven semi-circle.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was a little worried, but I ordered this anyway.</li>
            <li> I felt pretty ripped off and mislead after getting this doll head and needed it so badly for the project that I didn&#x27;t have the time to return it and wait for another so had to spend another $50 on extensions alone just to cover her head.</li>
            <li> I live on the other side of the globe, so the return is a bad idea.</li>
            <li> There is hardly any hair on her head so if you need a doll head with a ton of hair buy the doll head named Daisy or Veronica</li>
            <li> Her mom thinks it is creepy, not sure why.  </li>
            <li> a bit thin haired</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin.</li>
            <li> It is sad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get this for a child to practice braiding but beyond that it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> This doll has elastic strands in its hair and is of very poor quality...</li>
            <li> Bad, very bad low quality !!!!</li>
            <li> I needed this for a school updo project and was really disappointed to see that whatever I parted her hair all you could see is scalp.</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> The hair color is awful.</li>

            <li> I ordered two mannequin heads, but different length hair up to 10cm?????I am very upset. Seller is not met my expectations. It is sad.I live on the other side of the globe, so the return is a bad idea.If the seller wants to do something to help, let me write</li>
            <li> Amazing price for a Mannequin with long blonde hair!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughters 13th birthday.  The mannequin is okay looking and a bit thin haired but it works really well for her to style the hair.  She has chalked the hair, curled with a curling iron and styled it - up do&#x27;s etc.The clap is a must!</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter loves this Mannequin and practices on it a lot.</li>
            <li> Funny looking face, good hair</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing this doll in hopes that it will have beautiful long blonde hair... Then don&#x27;t. The hair color is awful. It&#x27;s thin. And hair melts when you put heat on it. The Purpose I had intended for this doll was for me to get practice on my updo&#x27;s. I am a cosmetologist, I wanted high quality hair. I did not get that at all and if I could, I&#x27;d leave zero stars. I&#x27;d get this for a child to practice braiding but beyond that it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Hair looks longer online.  Head even looks bald in places.</li>
            <li> The hair is a little thin and falls out easily, but serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> It was exactly how it was described and it came early!</li>
            <li> Gave to granddaughter for birthday. She asked for it and has spent many happy hours working with it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought the mannequin head for my 10 year old that loves to style and braid hair. This item was perfect for what she wanted it for. She has not needed to use the table clamp for it so I could have saved some money there.</li>
            <li> I questioned if this is real human hair. I expected the hair to be in better shape. It actually felt just like Barbie doll hair. I bought two. One for my 11 year old daughter to play with, but the other is for my 20 year old daughter who is in beauty school. It will be fine for my youngest, but not the quality I expected. It did however, arrive in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage daughter and she loves it.  She is able to was the hair and do many different styles</li>
            <li> Bad, very bad low quality !!!! Waist of money! Loosing hair, I can see a bold sculp. I won&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Works well, and kids in the shop love to play with it.  But I didn,t  get the table clamp...</li>
            <li> This doll has elastic strands in its hair and is of very poor quality... i returned mine to buy 2 new tina dolls for a few dollars more</li>
            <li> So in the picture the doll head looks like it has a ton of hair but she is literally bald. I needed this for a school updo project and was really disappointed to see that whatever I parted her hair all you could see is scalp. There is hardly any hair on her head so if you need a doll head with a ton of hair buy the doll head named Daisy or Veronica they have a ton and are the same price. I felt pretty ripped off and mislead after getting this doll head and needed it so badly for the project that I didn&#x27;t have the time to return it and wait for another so had to spend another $50 on extensions alone just to cover her head. Total bummer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it was her favorite gift of all of them!  The hair is thicker than I thought it would be and she has done all kinds of braids, curled it, washed it, and it still looks great!  Awesome product and came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This mannequin was perfect for what i needed. the only thing is it is a little bare on the scalp, but when you are done grading or whatever, you can&#x27;t tell, only she you are working with the hair can you tell. Overall, it is a very good mannequin!</li>
            <li> When I first received this mannequin I was excited to begin practicing hairstyles on her.&lt;br /&gt;But.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first couple weeks each time i brushed through the hair I would have to collect hairballs off the floor. So that lead to her&lt;br /&gt;becoming almost completely bald in a matter of two months. I am highly disappointed. I would suggest just buying better; (Nicole,&lt;br /&gt;Linda)you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was a little worried, but I ordered this anyway. Head is better than what I thought it would be. Has lots of hair. This was a Christmas present for my daughter who does hair all the time. She has been practicing lots of different hair styles on this manikin and once she has mastered it she does it on her or her sisters hair. This manikins hair can be brushed, curled or straightened. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the table holder clamp is not deep enough to fit on most tables or counters.</li>
            <li> My daughter  loves it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old daughter. She loves it! It Holds braids and curls very well. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This was the hit of the XMAS presents.  She loves trying new styles and shares her talent with others.  Her mom thinks it is creepy, not sure why.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This mannequin sucks it isnt even real hair, it is boars hair, you cant even color it, when I colored it all the hair fell out</li>
            <li> Hair is not as full as I&#x27;d hoped, clamp is rather cheap-ish. But… it will work, I think,</li>
            <li> Gave to my niece who is considering cosmetology school. She loved it and immediately set to work fixing her hair. I did see that the hair was shedding a little when brushed, and tips of hair are in an eneven semi-circle. Otherwise it was good for what she wanted it for.</li>
            <li> This mannequin head is great and for the price I got this for my 8 yr old instead of a cheap toy one. The hair is good quality and makeup goes on and comes off well. I might get another one. Quick tip though, don&#x27;t attach it to a countrr and then walk away and forget about it, it will scare the neck out of you when you walk back in.</li>
