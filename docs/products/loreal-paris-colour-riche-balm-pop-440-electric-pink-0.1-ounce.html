    <ol>
            <li>The Coral colour matches perfectly for me, couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li>best lip balm ever...</li>
            <li>Moisturizing and the color is beautiful!</li>
            <li>They are very good quality products and satisfy my needs, I always arrive on time and there has never been any problem so buy on amazon.</li>
            <li>great for touch-ups.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in love with this product!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, if you&#x27;re thinking about the Revlon just bitten kissable balm, I&#x27;d def recommend getting them because of the colors and the tint staying power is remarkable.</li>
            <li>So nice and good service</li>
            <li>I got the Rose Elixir, and it didn&#x27;t show up on my lip at all, given that I have quite pigmented lip/colors often show on my lip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Short story: recommend the product, but not the Rose elixir color.</li>
            <li>texture is really nice.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers on here</li>
            <li>I bought this product (Caring Coral colour) because I was looking for something that was not a lipstick, not a lip balm, but still moisturized, gave a hint of colour, and wasn&#x27;t over the top.  </li>
            <li>Def the most moisturizing tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>Maybe not a &amp;#34;HINT&amp;#34; but a &amp;#34;whisper of a suggestion&amp;#34; of color is more like it.</li>
            <li>I love the balm and the scent.</li>
            <li>the product itself is ok.</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>These balms are perfect for me in that they feel like a traditional lip balm but have just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>I feel like this gives me a healthy, sun-kissed look - not an overly make-up-applied</li>
            <li>a bit oily and gentle on color, but moisturizing and great balm.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have a bit more color.</li>
            <li>nice light color.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but it has too much color pigment and it&#x27;s too bright.</li>
            <li>Feels soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d say if you have light medium to medium skin tone, don&#x27;t get this color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is moist and smooth and seems to work as a moisturizer, but you might as well use any chap stick.</li>
            <li>This product is nice and goes on very soft and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love these balms so much!</li>
            <li>Make me look good, moisturizing working a long time, I think I will buy again</li>
            <li>this lipstick is very creamy and comfortable going on, and for</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re like me, i rarely finish up any lipstick anyway.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a tint, this is not the right color for you.</li>
            <li>this color is probably the best for a natural flushed lip that doesn&#x27;t overpower the rest of the face, if you are looking for a highly pigmented lipstick this is NOT it (like the previous reviewer noted) but if u keep in mind</li>
            <li>You can put it on sheer or layer on for more color.</li>
            <li>This lipstick line is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>but i touch up my lipstick pretty often anyways</li>
            <li>i use it as a light, everyday spot of color, like a tinted balm, though the color lasts much better than a lip balm.</li>
            <li>this is the perfect sheer balm to compliment an everyday look without looking overdone!!</li>
            <li>I really like this product it arrived on time</li>
            <li>nothing too intense......</li>
            <li>I purchased #418 Caring Coral and like many other reviewers</li>
            <li>Pretty natural color .I will buy again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the same, it has even same oroduct bar code, but the it&#x27;s more a rouge than a balm.</li>
            <li>This product is PERFECT for anyone who wants a natural looking tint to their lips, such that it is difficult to tell if you are wearing anything at all.  </li>
            <li>Cute colors and its not too heavy on your lips</li>
            <li>i also use it on top of a traditional lipstick, which can look and feel dry without the added softener.</li>
            <li>I like the color, but it is a little light.  </li>
            <li>I prefer it to the Revlon Lip butter since it&#x27;s kinda sheer and not as heavy/thick, yet still very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional photographer and a lot of the shoots I work on are beauty and modeling shots......</li>
            <li>but, so far, none have looked unnatural or unflattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don;t like lipstick during the day, but this one looks naturally.</li>
            <li>im inlove with the new balms and lip butters,and i thought the color in this will be as good and the other one i got,but i have to say it looks just like a gloss with very little tiny color,so not color pay off in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful and make sure to wind down the balm before covering with lid</li>
            <li>Basically, they cover the natural color of naked lips - a look</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a narrower column of color than most lipsticks, so probably less product than usual.</li>

            <li> Make me look good, moisturizing working a long time, I think I will buy again</li>
            <li> I really like this product it arrived on time, I ordered it on a Friday and it arrived Monday</li>
            <li> Feels soooo smooth. love it</li>
            <li> My lips are already very red, so normal heavy lipsticks make me look like a circus clown.

The Coral colour matches perfectly for me, couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> Def the most moisturizing tinted lip balm. Just texture-wise I prefer it to the Revlon Lip butter since it&#x27;s kinda sheer and not as heavy/thick, yet still very moisturizing. The downsize is the color. I got the Rose Elixir, and it didn&#x27;t show up on my lip at all, given that I have quite pigmented lip/colors often show on my lip. So I&#x27;d say if you have light medium to medium skin tone, don&#x27;t get this color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, if you&#x27;re thinking about the Revlon just bitten kissable balm, I&#x27;d def recommend getting them because of the colors and the tint staying power is remarkable. However, beware that you will have to use a balm with it or else your lips will be dry as hell, esp. in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story: recommend the product, but not the Rose elixir color.</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick cause im inlove with the new balms and lip butters,and i thought the color in this will be as good and the other one i got,but i have to say it looks just like a gloss with very little tiny color,so not color pay off in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sad coral is one of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li> best lip balm ever...with slight color...its beautiful..and keeps ur lips hydrated well. thumbs up for this one..its always in my handbag since i bot it...</li>
            <li> I purchased #418 Caring Coral and like many other reviewers I too was underwhelmed by the color. Maybe not a &amp;#34;HINT&amp;#34; but a &amp;#34;whisper of a suggestion&amp;#34; of color is more like it. I love the balm and the scent. So for $5 I give it 4 stars. Be careful and make sure to wind down the balm before covering with lid or you will smush the lip balm.</li>
            <li> So nice and good service</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and the color is beautiful!</li>
            <li> the lid is plastic. the product itself is ok.</li>
            <li> Lipstick color is not good and can not hold on</li>
            <li> this balm is now my go to color for everything!!! I&#x27;m a professional photographer and a lot of the shoots I work on are beauty and modeling shots......this color is probably the best for a natural flushed lip that doesn&#x27;t overpower the rest of the face, if you are looking for a highly pigmented lipstick this is NOT it (like the previous reviewer noted) but if u keep in mind it&#x27;s a balm then you should know that means it&#x27;s sheer color....nothing too intense......this is the perfect sheer balm to compliment an everyday look without looking overdone!!</li>
            <li> I love these balms so much! They are just slightly tinted with pops of color. You can put it on sheer or layer on for more color. Only downside is no SPF but I still love it. It doesn&#x27;t taste weird or plasticky</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear a noticeable lip color. These balms are perfect for me in that they feel like a traditional lip balm but have just a hint of color. Basically, they cover the natural color of naked lips - a look I don&#x27;t care for - without being gloppy or fake-looking. I feel like this gives me a healthy, sun-kissed look - not an overly make-up-applied look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of fighting my teen daughters over this so I&#x27;ve bought some for all of us. Every color is different but, so far, none have looked unnatural or unflattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with this product!!</li>
            <li> this lipstick is very creamy and comfortable going on, and for quite a while after. i use it as a light, everyday spot of color, like a tinted balm, though the color lasts much better than a lip balm. i also use it on top of a traditional lipstick, which can look and feel dry without the added softener. great for touch-ups. the case is plastic, and though i&#x27;ve had no trouble with it, it seems it could crack in your purse or make-up bag, especially where the notch connects with the base. pretty thick plastic, so i&#x27;m hoping it lasts as long as the lipstick itself. it&#x27;s a narrower column of color than most lipsticks, so probably less product than usual. but if you&#x27;re like me, i rarely finish up any lipstick anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color, I was hoping for something lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is really nice. I don&#x27;t use it a lot so I&#x27;m not sure, but I think it isn&#x27;t very lasting.</li>
            <li> a bit oily and gentle on color, but moisturizing and great balm.</li>
            <li> They are very good quality products and satisfy my needs, I always arrive on time and there has never been any problem so buy on amazon. by&lt;br /&gt;security and guarantee.</li>
            <li> This product is nice and goes on very soft and smoothly. I like the color, but it is a little light.  I thought it would have a bit more color. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t show up as having any color at all. It is moist and smooth and seems to work as a moisturizer, but you might as well use any chap stick. if you&#x27;re looking for a tint, this is not the right color for you.</li>
            <li> Pretty natural color .I will buy again.</li>
            <li> nice light color. I don;t like lipstick during the day, but this one looks naturally.</li>
            <li> This lipstick line is smooth and soft. Its staying power is not amazing but i touch up my lipstick pretty often anyways so its not an issue for me. if your not a lipstick guru, this is the way to go. Cute colors and its not too heavy on your lips</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not the same as the one i bought in the store. Color number it&#x27;s the same, it has even same oroduct bar code, but the it&#x27;s more a rouge than a balm. Not bad, but it has too much color pigment and it&#x27;s too bright.</li>
