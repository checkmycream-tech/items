            <li>It has a lovely scent, nothing to overpowering but an over all lovely perfume fragrance.</li>
            <li>and that seemed to work better for me as an overnight product.</li>

            <li>I have to say this works better.  </li>
            <li>I received Ednae for free to try and give an honest opinion.</li>

            <li>This is also environmentally friendly and it does no animal testing .  </li>
            <li>It has always been important to use Spa QEdnae Body Butter for Full Skin and Body Cream makes your skin feel like silk</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the name and the jar</li>
            <li>I love using Ednae&#x27;s Body butter all over after I get out of a hot shower in the morning as it keeps my body moisturized throughout the day and leaves me smelling</li>
            <li>so I made sure to try it out there the first day I got it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made up of all the lotions/butters that I already use separately and combines them to create one super smooth and silky moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin well and leaves a clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Floral scents often make me sneeze but this one is so light I do not notice it once the cream is absorbed into my skin  </li>

            <li>I liked how soft my skin felt, and I like when products have ingredients like Sea Kelp, and Avocados too.  </li>
            <li>So far I am loving the Ednae Body Butter full body Skin cream .</li>
            <li>This body butter is great, it is so light and fluffy</li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly, so it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has it somehow made it self worthy of its hefty price tag?</li>
            <li>It is most definitely a high quality product.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic body butter in a very generously sized jar!</li>
            <li>Ednae Cream is such a better option!</li>
            <li>It really helped with a dry patch I had on my leg and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This might sound like too much information..</li>
            <li>This body butter smells very feminine and light floral scent.</li>
            <li>but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion after using this myself.</li>
            <li>It absorbed and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub completely so it can be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It did make my skin soft and lovely smelling.  </li>
            <li>By morning the creme had indeed absorbed by then..</li>
            <li>item was purchased at a low cost amount in return for a honest non biased review</li>
            <li>I love that it is made with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this product review purposes.  </li>
            <li>and hey, I&#x27;m worth it.  </li>
            <li>This really is the first cream I have found that actually works to keep them looking nice and itch free all day</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t put pants on right away.</li>
            <li>I just had to try it right away</li>
            <li>Just smells real freah and clean.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a nice fluffy mixture that went on easily, and my skin absorbed it well.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles and fine lines have nearly disappeared and it works extremely well as a sort of primer for my liquid foundation, acting as a filler which leaves me with a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and fresh,a touch floral, and not overpowering, particularly after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>After trying this cream for a little over a week, i&#x27;m surprisingly neutral about it.</li>
            <li>The jar also looks appealing enough to be displayed on a vanity/dresser.</li>
            <li>Since the weather is hot where I am.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re prone, as with any product, do a test area first, as anything scented could be a concern.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many different lotions from the stores that say they hydrate for 24 hours that just don&#x27;t seem to cut it.</li>
            <li>I first opened my jar</li>
            <li>so I used it on my hands first.</li>
            <li>With flip flop season ending my feet are pretty beat up.  </li>
            <li>This has made my feet smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>and you can tell it isn&#x27;t just sitting on top of your skin but actually soaking into the body and locking in the moisture.</li>
            <li>The texture is a light waxing type, creamy, and soft type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about lotions and body butters and this product met my standards.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a few days now and it seems to do a really good job on all those problem areas .  </li>
            <li>smooth enough to go on easily, but rich enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I took it on vacation to the beach and used it nightly to moisturize and it is great for that after beach extra dry skin!</li>
            <li>Looks really nice with my other items.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so pleased with a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All of my reviews are based 100%  on my experience with the product, and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>and can&#x27;t wait to see even more after long term use</li>
            <li>This cream absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves me incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It made my skin super soft and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I love to use on my feet, it helped alot with dry skin.</li>
            <li>and i love using it on my dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just very strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitivity to certain scents and this one didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>This body butter is nice and thick, which is great as I&#x27;ve tried others in the past</li>
            <li>It actually soaks into my skin quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily, and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This has definitely become an instant favorite!</li>
            <li>That was the main reason I had switched over to argan oil in the first place.</li>
            <li>It is really moisturizing for my skin and makes my hand feel soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this on a discount for my review, received it very quickly thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>This cream is a bit thicker and really coats your face</li>
            <li>This cream absorbs so fast and by the time I finish rubbing it in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to get dressed.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it works very well.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to use much of it.</li>
            <li>I really like the formula</li>
            <li>But I will tell you  I really do like this cream, gel, lotion, whatever it is.</li>
            <li>I have money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li>My hands felt really moisturized</li>
            <li>received this cream for free to test and provide my personal experience.</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try this out to review.</li>
            <li>My elbows are already so much smoother and trust me they were like sandpaper</li>
            <li>This body butter is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>it really helped keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li>Using this stuff really makes you feel like you&#x27;re at the spa.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and really liked it especially for summer, as it is not greasy and does not make your skin feel  oily especially with this heat.</li>
            <li>It is whipped and light and has just a slight sweet scent.</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs right into my skin, leaving it soft and moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how rich and thick it is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a light bluish shade, a bit of product really goes a long way</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this cream given the high ratings from other amazon users.</li>
            <li>and it has ruined one of my favorite shirts because I didn&#x27;t give the oil enough tome to absorb properly.</li>
            <li>It has some yummy ingredients like Aloe (which is what I think creates the texture), Mango, Shea, Sea Kelp and other natural ingredients, but it smells like a fresh clean soap.</li>
            <li>I like this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and very moisturized after using.</li>
            <li>I try not to touch my face too much, but I have to keep having to stop myself from feeling how soft it feels.. DISCLAIMER:</li>
            <li>I would recommend this body butter to everyone who wants soft supple skin soothed by cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it absorbs quickly into my skin it leaves it feeling hydrated and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new anti-aging creams in my battle to fend off wrinkles</li>
            <li>The gel texture allows it to absorb quickly and dry without feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>The cream was very soft whipped looking and had a very soft smell which is a plus for me, I don&#x27;t like overpowering smells</li>
            <li>and my skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to use it on my elbows and feet which tend to dry out fast in this hot Texas weather.</li>
            <li>My arms were pretty dry and you can really tell where I put on the body butter and</li>
            <li>I am not usually a lotion person.</li>
            <li>THIS BODY BUTTER MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND MOISTURIZED!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to spread and no strong smell as well.</li>
            <li>I used it after I showered and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it made my face and legs.</li>
            <li>I did not have any allergic reaction and my skin is soft.  </li>
            <li>far sensitivity, I didn&#x27;t have any issues myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried natural remedies like coconut oil</li>
            <li>Its soft and silky to the touch and</li>
            <li>I immediately felt relief and my skin was instantly soft.</li>
            <li>like that this butter has natural ingredients like sea kelp that provide anti aging properties which we need on the neck and chest.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my legs</li>
            <li>I used it as my after shower moisturizer and it keeps my skin moisturized and soft without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>As far as hydration goes...</li>
            <li>It screams luxury and all of my friends that see it think that I&#x27;ve ordered it from somewhere professional.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s more of a thick body butter, than a lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is lightly scented and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Overall i really like this and will use it regularly</li>
            <li>It definitely left my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the evening after my shower and my skin stays soft and hydrated through until the next evening&#x27;s shower.</li>
            <li>, I would definitely recommend, even to those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a lotion that give you soft skin without any of the greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it on warm days as you will feel sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not too thick and not too light.</li>
            <li>This body butter rivals my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret butters and lotions.</li>
            <li>and it has really improved their extreme dryness.</li>
            <li>and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.  </li>
            <li>so becareful!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scent is a combination between clean linen and flowers which surprisingly is not overwhelming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad.</li>

            <li> It has a lovely scent, nothing to overpowering but an over all lovely perfume fragrance.</li>
            <li> and that seemed to work better for me as an overnight product.</li>

            <li> It has always been important to use Spa QEdnae Body Butter for Full Skin and Body Cream makes your skin feel like silk</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the name and the jar</li>
            <li> I love using Ednae&#x27;s Body butter all over after I get out of a hot shower in the morning as it keeps my body moisturized throughout the day and leaves me smelling</li>
            <li> so I made sure to try it out there the first day I got it</li>

            <li> It does absorb quickly, so it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has it somehow made it self worthy of its hefty price tag?</li>
            <li> It is most definitely a high quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic body butter in a very generously sized jar!</li>
            <li> Ednae Cream is such a better option!</li>
            <li> It really helped with a dry patch I had on my leg and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This might sound like too much information..</li>
            <li> This body butter smells very feminine and light floral scent.</li>
            <li> but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion after using this myself.</li>
            <li> It absorbed and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rub completely so it can be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin soft and lovely smelling.  </li>
            <li> By morning the creme had indeed absorbed by then..</li>
            <li> item was purchased at a low cost amount in return for a honest non biased review</li>
            <li> I love that it is made with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this product review purposes.  </li>
            <li> and hey, I&#x27;m worth it.  </li>
            <li> This really is the first cream I have found that actually works to keep them looking nice and itch free all day</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t put pants on right away.</li>
            <li> I just had to try it right away</li>
            <li> Just smells real freah and clean.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a nice fluffy mixture that went on easily, and my skin absorbed it well.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles and fine lines have nearly disappeared and it works extremely well as a sort of primer for my liquid foundation, acting as a filler which leaves me with a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and fresh,a touch floral, and not overpowering, particularly after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> After trying this cream for a little over a week, i&#x27;m surprisingly neutral about it.</li>
            <li> The jar also looks appealing enough to be displayed on a vanity/dresser.</li>
            <li> Since the weather is hot where I am.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re prone, as with any product, do a test area first, as anything scented could be a concern.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many different lotions from the stores that say they hydrate for 24 hours that just don&#x27;t seem to cut it.</li>
            <li> I first opened my jar</li>
            <li> so I used it on my hands first.</li>
            <li> With flip flop season ending my feet are pretty beat up.  </li>
            <li> This has made my feet smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> and you can tell it isn&#x27;t just sitting on top of your skin but actually soaking into the body and locking in the moisture.</li>
            <li> The texture is a light waxing type, creamy, and soft type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about lotions and body butters and this product met my standards.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few days now and it seems to do a really good job on all those problem areas .  </li>
            <li> smooth enough to go on easily, but rich enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I took it on vacation to the beach and used it nightly to moisturize and it is great for that after beach extra dry skin!</li>
            <li> Looks really nice with my other items.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so pleased with a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All of my reviews are based 100%  on my experience with the product, and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> and can&#x27;t wait to see even more after long term use</li>
            <li> This cream absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves me incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It made my skin super soft and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I love to use on my feet, it helped alot with dry skin.</li>
            <li> and i love using it on my dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just very strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to certain scents and this one didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> This body butter is nice and thick, which is great as I&#x27;ve tried others in the past</li>
            <li> It actually soaks into my skin quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily, and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This has definitely become an instant favorite!</li>
            <li> That was the main reason I had switched over to argan oil in the first place.</li>
            <li> It is really moisturizing for my skin and makes my hand feel soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this on a discount for my review, received it very quickly thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> This cream is a bit thicker and really coats your face</li>
            <li> This cream absorbs so fast and by the time I finish rubbing it in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to get dressed.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it works very well.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to use much of it.</li>
            <li> I really like the formula</li>
            <li> But I will tell you  I really do like this cream, gel, lotion, whatever it is.</li>
            <li> I have money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li> My hands felt really moisturized</li>
            <li> received this cream for free to test and provide my personal experience.</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try this out to review.</li>
            <li> My elbows are already so much smoother and trust me they were like sandpaper</li>
            <li> This body butter is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> it really helped keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li> Using this stuff really makes you feel like you&#x27;re at the spa.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and really liked it especially for summer, as it is not greasy and does not make your skin feel  oily especially with this heat.</li>
            <li> It is whipped and light and has just a slight sweet scent.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs right into my skin, leaving it soft and moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how rich and thick it is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a light bluish shade, a bit of product really goes a long way</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this cream given the high ratings from other amazon users.</li>
            <li> and it has ruined one of my favorite shirts because I didn&#x27;t give the oil enough tome to absorb properly.</li>
            <li> It has some yummy ingredients like Aloe (which is what I think creates the texture), Mango, Shea, Sea Kelp and other natural ingredients, but it smells like a fresh clean soap.</li>
            <li> I like this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and very moisturized after using.</li>
            <li> I try not to touch my face too much, but I have to keep having to stop myself from feeling how soft it feels.. DISCLAIMER:</li>
            <li> I would recommend this body butter to everyone who wants soft supple skin soothed by cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it absorbs quickly into my skin it leaves it feeling hydrated and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new anti-aging creams in my battle to fend off wrinkles</li>
            <li> The gel texture allows it to absorb quickly and dry without feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> The cream was very soft whipped looking and had a very soft smell which is a plus for me, I don&#x27;t like overpowering smells</li>
            <li> and my skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to use it on my elbows and feet which tend to dry out fast in this hot Texas weather.</li>
            <li> My arms were pretty dry and you can really tell where I put on the body butter and</li>
            <li> I am not usually a lotion person.</li>
            <li> THIS BODY BUTTER MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND MOISTURIZED!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to spread and no strong smell as well.</li>
            <li> I used it after I showered and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it made my face and legs.</li>
            <li> I did not have any allergic reaction and my skin is soft.  </li>
            <li> far sensitivity, I didn&#x27;t have any issues myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried natural remedies like coconut oil</li>
            <li> Its soft and silky to the touch and</li>
            <li> I immediately felt relief and my skin was instantly soft.</li>
            <li> like that this butter has natural ingredients like sea kelp that provide anti aging properties which we need on the neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my legs</li>
            <li> I used it as my after shower moisturizer and it keeps my skin moisturized and soft without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> As far as hydration goes...</li>
            <li> It screams luxury and all of my friends that see it think that I&#x27;ve ordered it from somewhere professional.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s more of a thick body butter, than a lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is lightly scented and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Overall i really like this and will use it regularly</li>
            <li> It definitely left my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the evening after my shower and my skin stays soft and hydrated through until the next evening&#x27;s shower.</li>
            <li> , I would definitely recommend, even to those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a lotion that give you soft skin without any of the greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it on warm days as you will feel sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too thick and not too light.</li>
            <li> This body butter rivals my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret butters and lotions.</li>
            <li> and it has really improved their extreme dryness.</li>
            <li> and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.  </li>
            <li> so becareful!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scent is a combination between clean linen and flowers which surprisingly is not overwhelming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad.</li>
            <li> This is also a large jar and seems like a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its not super thin but not to thick either it is a great medium.</li>
            <li> This cream will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot of this so the jar will last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> The tops of my arms get really dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what lotions I use and they only give me a couple hours of nourishment.</li>
            <li> I have this dry patch on my left leg that I can never get to go away and ever since I started using this a week ago</li>
            <li> I will say that one positive note is that although the cream is thick and looks goopy and oily, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily at all.</li>
            <li> The scent is faint which is another huge plus.</li>
            <li> sometimes they&#x27;re too thick, or not thick enough, or they&#x27;re overly greasy.</li>
            <li> so it will be thicker than any other regular cream.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who had dry skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try to help with my dry skin on my legs and arms and help with the cracking that I get on my hands .</li>
            <li> the dry spot has not bothered me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my dry hands for a couple of days and have noticed they are softer and not as dry.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4df8915f70f845557ab6bafbb7312b1d]]I was a lucky duck and randomly chosen to test out this product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everywhere, but especially  on my very dry elbows and feet</li>
            <li> and I was going nuts over these tiny little bumps I keep getting.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially on my legs, all year round.</li>
            <li> I have to v be careful not to lean against the couch or a wall</li>
            <li> I noticed softer skin after just a few daily uses!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not greasy but for hot days you will feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in a week and a half and my legs are prickly.</li>
            <li> I use it for my feet as a moisturizer, it helps a little but after a while my feet looks ashy.</li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin and most products break me out in ugly rashes that itch so bad.</li>
            <li> Several days, dead skin would come off, Skin felt soft, and no issues with the product causing a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I could see a difference.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, not leaving .my hands feeling greasy like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I did think it was a bit heavily fragranced.</li>
            <li> But I did notice that after 10 min after application I washed my hands and it felt as there was a heavy residue feeling on my hands.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it does not leave a greasy residue behind.  </li>
            <li> The Ednae Body Butter is a thick creamy lotion that is slightly blueish green.</li>
            <li> It is a generous 6oz pale green thick creme.</li>
            <li> I had no issue blending it with my usual scents.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of skin firming cream from spas that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> So I tried as an overnight creme for my hands, knees and elbows- usually the roughest</li>
            <li> However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to body butter.  </li>
            <li> the fragrance is very subtle but still noticeable.</li>
            <li> I do recommend you use this product on winter days or cold days.</li>
            <li> Sorry the dog photobombed the skin!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received a discount to review this product.  It is fantastic I noticed an immediate difference</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cream.  It has a light and easy on the nose floral scent.  Floral scents often make me sneeze but this one is so light I do not notice it once the cream is absorbed into my skin  A little goes a long way and it does not leave a greasy residue behind.  The cream absorbs right into my skin, leaving it soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
            <li> Edna body butter smells amazing. I am not usually a lotion person. I only use vaseline if I have to. But this works amazing. I do not feel that my skin is being irritated. It is has a nice consistency not too this nor too liquidy along with being not unreasonably greasy. The color is minty. The jar also looks appealing enough to be displayed on a vanity/dresser. There is a good amount of body butter in this jar to be used for a two to three months. It is paraben free. It doesn&#x27;t smell foul. I have actually scooped some out and put it in a travel bottle for my purse. It is really moisturizing for my skin and makes my hand feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
            <li> Got this on a discount for my review, received it very quickly thanks to Amazon. I also like the cream, it&#x27;s easy to spread and no strong smell as well.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! My skin is noticeably softer. It is so light going on, not leaving my skin with an oily residue like many body lotions do. I took it on vacation to the beach and used it nightly to moisturize and it is great for that after beach extra dry skin! I was given this product for free to write an un-biased review and am so grateful to have been introduced to the product!</li>
            <li> This body butter smells amazing, it has a clean smell to it. Its not super thin but not to thick either it is a great medium. It definitely left my skin feeling soft and moisturized. Its a good size container for the price too. I did receive this free for review but that does not effect my review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is NICE! I began using day creams to fight the wrinkled aging look as I travel a lot. This cream is a bit thicker and really coats your face well. Then it feels like it absorbs nicely into the skin. A bit pricey but you get a lot more in the jar than most! I like this and highly recommend it. Received thru promotion price for honest evaluation.</li>
            <li> I received my Body Butter Skin Cream and was very impressed with how soft this cream was. I used it after I showered and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it made my face and legs. The cream was very soft whipped looking and had a very soft smell which is a plus for me, I don&#x27;t like overpowering smells and it went on very smooth. I recommend this product for anyone that likes soft cream for their body with a great smell.</li>
            <li> The Ednae Body Butter is a thick creamy lotion that is slightly blueish green. It smells so good to me. Sort of like some kind of shampoo. Just smells real freah and clean. The lotion went on smoothly and I rubbed it in until it was asorbed. My skin felt very soft after using and I was very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved as free sample to rate and review and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the way this body cream leaves my skin! I use it on my arms, chest, stomach, legs and heels. I do not use it on my face because it contains cetyl alcohol which tends to break me out. This cream absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves me incredibly soft. I apply it in the evening after my shower and my skin stays soft and hydrated through until the next evening&#x27;s shower. The tops of my arms get really dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what lotions I use and they only give me a couple hours of nourishment. This really is the first cream I have found that actually works to keep them looking nice and itch free all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Before I began using this I used Argan Oil religiously for moisturizing, and it worked beautifully. Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately however and I end up greasy for a good 20 minutes or more after application. I have to v be careful not to lean against the couch or a wall and it has ruined one of my favorite shirts because I didn&#x27;t give the oil enough tome to absorb properly. This cream absorbs so fast and by the time I finish rubbing it in I&#x27;m ready to get dressed. I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and most products break me out in ugly rashes that itch so bad. I&#x27;ve been using this cream nightly for a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t had any problems. That was the main reason I had switched over to argan oil in the first place. Ednae Cream is such a better option! It is most definitely a high quality product. It is whipped and light and has just a slight sweet scent. I&#x27;m very impressed with how well it mouisturizes and the price is amazing! I really can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so pleased with a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive my jar free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion after using this myself.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. With me being over 40yrs it seems like my skin don&#x27;t retain moisture.This works great. It&#x27;s a  nice whipped type lotion,that seems to absorbs easily in the skin.It has vitamins and is infused with fruit oils which helps give it that spa feel. Not to mention it works very well.I use it on my arms neck and chest, where there is more sun damage. After a few uses I could see a difference.This is a product you should give a try.I DID RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new anti-aging creams in my battle to fend off wrinkles so I was very excited to try this product. First off, I love that Edna&amp;eacute; is cruelty free - there is NO ANIMAL TESTING and it has a light floral scent and the whipped souffle consistency of the body butter  goes on smoothly, not leaving .my hands feeling greasy like others I&#x27;ve tried. While it absorbs quickly into my skin it leaves it feeling hydrated and lasts all day long. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and not only am I seeing results but others are noticing as well. Wrinkles and fine lines have nearly disappeared and it works extremely well as a sort of primer for my liquid foundation, acting as a filler which leaves me with a flawless finish. I&#x27;m definitely impressed with the results thus far and can&#x27;t wait to see even more after long term use, I would definitely recommend, even to those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I got it as a review product but it leaves your skin feeling so smooth and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love the feel when applied.  Mostly the scent is delightful and clean.  The skin feels smooth and not greasy.  Definitely a product I would continue using.  This product was sent to me free for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who had dry skin. I do recommend you use this product on winter days or cold days. Don&#x27;t use it on warm days as you will feel sticky and uncomfortable. Remember this is butter cream so it will be thicker than any other regular cream. I did not have any allergic reaction and my skin is soft.  It comes in a really nice elegant looking bottle. Looks really nice with my other items. This cream will last you a long time. You really don&#x27;t have to use much of it. It smells good a light smell that is not overpowering. It absorbed and moisturizes my skin. I apply after a shower and go to sleep. My skin feels awesome in the morning.  I have been using it for my elbows and my knees mostly. Since the weather is hot where I am. Fall will come soon and I will use on all my skin. It is not greasy but for hot days you will feel uncomfortable. Make sure to rub completely so it can be absorbed.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving the Ednae Body Butter full body Skin cream . This comes in a Nice 6oz container and its made of rich butters, mango, avocado, shea ands aloe vera .  This is also environmentally friendly and it does no animal testing .  I decided to give this a try to help with my dry skin on my legs and arms and help with the cracking that I get on my hands . I have used this for a few days now and it seems to do a really good job on all those problem areas .  It does smell nice and it makes your skin very nice and soft .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed results with body butters...sometimes they&#x27;re too thick, or not thick enough, or they&#x27;re overly greasy. Edna&amp;eacute; Body Butter is what a body butter should be...smooth enough to go on easily, but rich enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to. The scent is mild and fresh,a touch floral, and not overpowering, particularly after it&#x27;s absorbed. I had no issue blending it with my usual scents. It&#x27;s great for all over, although I did need to apply a couple of times to the drier areas. It does absorb quickly, so it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far sensitivity, I didn&#x27;t have any issues myself. But if you&#x27;re prone, as with any product, do a test area first, as anything scented could be a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and smooth skin are my own.</li>
            <li> This is a great body butter! It is lightly scented and not overwhelming. It goes on smooth and does not leave an oily feeling on your skin. I did recieve this priduct for a free review and it is great! I noticed softer skin after just a few daily uses!</li>
            <li> This might sound like too much information.. I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in a week and a half and my legs are prickly. Gross I know but hear me out!&lt;br /&gt;I applied this body butter and I am not kidding. My legs feel so smooth like how they feel after you shave them.&lt;br /&gt;I lift weights, so i have calluses on the palm of my hands And my hands feel so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;If you do buy this prodcut you will NOT be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light bluish shade, a bit of product really goes a long way so becareful!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scent is a combination between clean linen and flowers which surprisingly is not overwhelming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Discaimer:I got this product for free in a review group.*</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I use it for my feet as a moisturizer, it helps a little but after a while my feet looks ashy.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free for my unbiased opinion.  This body butter is amazing. It made my skin super soft and silky to the touch.  It wasn&#x27;t too greasy and smells great. Def recommend!</li>
            <li> This a really nice body butter. I really like the formula, it&#x27;s not too thick and not too light. It rubs in easily. My skin feels so soft and very moisturized after using. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or watery residue. I did think it was a bit heavily fragranced. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just very strong and long lasting. Otherwise, it&#x27;s really great stuff. I have been using this everywhere, but especially  on my very dry elbows and feet and it has really improved their extreme dryness. *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> THIS BODY BUTTER MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND MOISTURIZED! I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WILL BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic body butter in a very generously sized jar! I have very dry skin, especially on my legs, all year round. I have used many different lotions from the stores that say they hydrate for 24 hours that just don&#x27;t seem to cut it. I&#x27;ve even tried natural remedies like coconut oil but it never actually soaks into my skin and I can&#x27;t put pants on right away. This stuff is magical! It actually soaks into my skin quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily, and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. My skin feels so quenched and hydrated even a few hours after application which is very impressive. I have this dry patch on my left leg that I can never get to go away and ever since I started using this a week ago the dry spot has not bothered me at all. It has even taken the itch away from it. I can already tell that this body butter will be just what I need during the winter. I love the natural ingredients in this cream as well and the scent is very appealing. This has definitely become an instant favorite! *discount received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> I was intending to use this as a hand cream, but it&#x27;s a bit too greasy for me. I don&#x27;t like the feeling of residue on my hands. Instead, I&#x27;ve been using it for my knees and elbows, and it&#x27;s working wonderfully. This will be my go-to cream for the upcoming winter. Prior to purchasing, I read a lot about it&#x27;s wonderful scent, but honestly, I don&#x27;t notice a scent. That&#x27;s fine with me though... I&#x27;d rather have odorless than overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> This is a full body crÃ¨me for use everywhere. It is called a crÃ¨me and it looks like a crÃ¨me, but it has the texture and feel of a gel. It reminds me of skin firming cream from spas that I have used in the past. The gel texture allows it to absorb quickly and dry without feeling greasy or oily. It has some yummy ingredients like Aloe (which is what I think creates the texture), Mango, Shea, Sea Kelp and other natural ingredients, but it smells like a fresh clean soap. I know a lot of reviews say &amp;#34;This Is Great&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;This Is The Best!!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Miracle I A Jar!&#x27;, Etc.. I&#x27;m not going to say that.. But I will tell you  I really do like this cream, gel, lotion, whatever it is. Its soft, smooth and clean smelling like your fresh out of the shower that you&#x27;re looking for, then you&#x27;ll not be happy with this. It really does feel and smell great. I used it after applying a mud mask. I was sitting on the couch and I was going nuts over these tiny little bumps I keep getting. I used the mud and then put the crÃ¨me. I try not to touch my face too much, but I have to keep having to stop myself from feeling how soft it feels..

            <li> This body butter is fantastic. I was not expecting something this creamy and luxurious! It feels just like silk when you apply.  The smell is fantastic and not overpowering at all. I have a sensitivity to certain scents and this one didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I have been apply to my knees for a few days and they are so much softer.  This is the best cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this free to test and review. All opinions are mine.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4df8915f70f845557ab6bafbb7312b1d]]I was a lucky duck and randomly chosen to test out this product. It is a generous 6oz pale green thick creme. It has a lovely scent, nothing to overpowering but an over all lovely perfume fragrance. I applied it to my arms and legs and it went on nice and evenly.  It did make my skin soft and lovely smelling.  But I did notice that after 10 min after application I washed my hands and it felt as there was a heavy residue feeling on my hands. Enough so that holding a glass would slip through my fingers. So I tried as an overnight creme for my hands, knees and elbows- usually the roughest spots- and that seemed to work better for me as an overnight product. By morning the creme had indeed absorbed by then.. I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #LL</li>
            <li> I tried this product and really liked it especially for summer, as it is not greasy and does not make your skin feel  oily especially with this heat. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a lotion that give you soft skin without any of the greasy residue.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best! Its soft and silky to the touch and the fragrance is very subtle but still noticeable. The container it comes in is durable and resistant to heat, I accidentally put it to close to my curling and iron and it survived with out harm! I&#x27;ve been using this lotion each night before I go to bed and I have noticed a huge difference in my skin already! I would recommend any woman use this and add it to their collection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*disclaimer item was purchased at a low cost amount in return for a honest non biased review</li>

            <li> First of all, I love the name and the jar looks elegant...I feel like this is something I would find in a spa. I am a pretty big fan of body butters and this brand is absolutely wonderful. The scent is light, refreshing, and appealing to both men and women (I tested it on my man). A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened my jar I just had to try it right away so I used it on my hands first. The creme felt smooth and, well, creamy without any stickiness. My hands felt really moisturized so I decided to use it on my elbows and feet which tend to dry out fast in this hot Texas weather. I immediately felt relief and my skin was instantly soft. I love using Ednae&#x27;s Body butter all over after I get out of a hot shower in the morning as it keeps my body moisturized throughout the day and leaves me smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cream for free to test and provide my personal experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used The Body Shop body butter for years.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works.  I have to say this works better.  It goes on nice and creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like so many do.  I&#x27;ve use it on my hands and feet every morning and night.  With flip flop season ending my feet are pretty beat up.  This has made my feet smooth and soft.  Thanks for letting me try this out to review.</li>
            <li> This body butter smells very feminine and light floral scent. When applied after my shower it keeps my skin nicely hydrated. I use it at night before bed since there are no spf in the cream. I use spf cream in the morning for the day and the regimen seems to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the consistency of a heavier cream which is nice, but it goes on like a gel and you can tell it isn&#x27;t just sitting on top of your skin but actually soaking into the body and locking in the moisture. In my photo I had to take a shower in the morning and didn&#x27;t have time to put on anything before work. My arms were pretty dry and you can really tell where I put on the body butter and where I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this butter has natural ingredients like sea kelp that provide anti aging properties which we need on the neck and chest. It feels like creams I have used in very nice hotels. I received this jar complimentary to evaluate and review, as always my opinions are based on my own use of the product. I hope this review helps in your buying decisions. Sorry the dog photobombed the skin!</li>
            <li> I received Ednae for free to try and give an honest opinion. I have used it for 2 weeks.  The texture is a light waxing type, creamy, and soft type. When I put it on it rubbed in nicely and after awhile it would have this sticky feeling. Several days, dead skin would come off, Skin felt soft, and no issues with the product causing a bad reaction. I love to use on my feet, it helped alot with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this body butter with one thing in mind - attempting to make my elbows, knees and heels smooth!  I can happily report that I&#x27;ve accomplished my mission.  This body butter is nice and thick, which is great as I&#x27;ve tried others in the past that felt runny and cheap.  The scent is nice and not over powering.  You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot of this so the jar will last quite a long time.  I love that it is made with all natural ingredients.  My elbows are already so much smoother and trust me they were like sandpaper before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this product review purposes.  My reviews are always my own unbiased and honest opinions.</li>
            <li> I find the Ednae Body body Renaissance Souffle cream to be a very pleasant earthy vitamin infused aroma.  I like that it&#x27;s more of a thick body butter, than a lotion.  I can pick out the notes of Mango, and Aloe the most.  I like when my body butters do more than just smell good.  I liked how soft my skin felt, and I like when products have ingredients like Sea Kelp, and Avocados too.  I found it to be a nice fluffy mixture that went on easily, and my skin absorbed it well.  I am glad it has an earthy, light, scent.  I wear scents that I can smell when my skin heats up, not scents that others can smell rooms away.  I think that&#x27;s what I liked more about this Body body, the light feeling on the skin, and the light scent.  I received product for free for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about lotions and body butters and this product met my standards. I&#x27;ve been using it on my dry hands for a couple of days and have noticed they are softer and not as dry. The body butter has a nice light scent, nothing perfumey, just a nice light fresh scent is how I would describe it. I have sensitive skin on my legs so I made sure to try it out there the first day I got it (after I shaved) and it did not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer- I received a discount to leave my honest opnion!</li>
            <li> This body butter is great, it is so light and fluffy i love putting it on! The smell is very fresh and clean, it is not too strong. This body butter is very moisturizing and i love using it on my dry skin, it goes on so silky and soothing. The container it comes in is super cute too, it has a very nice silver lid with a foggy plastic jar, the cream showing though makes the jar look very light green. Overall i really like this and will use it regularly, i received this product to test and review honestly</li>
            <li> The softest most moisturizing body butter I&#x27;ve ever tried. This body butter rivals my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret butters and lotions. I used it as my after shower moisturizer and it keeps my skin moisturized and soft without leaving a greasy residue. It smells wonderful just like cucumbers, but it is not too loud just very refreshing. It literally soothes your skin, I loved to use it on my legs after shaving it really helped keep my skin moist. I would recommend this body butter to everyone who wants soft supple skin soothed by cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to body butter.  I would rather use body butter than lotion any day...I love how rich and thick it is.  It feels so indulgent and hey, I&#x27;m worth it.  It rubs in easily and smells really good.  I can&#x27;t describe the fragrance but I have worn it without putting perfume over it and my husband really liked it.  As far as hydration goes...yes!  It really helped with a dry patch I had on my leg and feels great on my skin.  I have been using it everywhere and my skin is very soft.  Sample received for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this cream given the high ratings from other amazon users. After trying this cream for a little over a week, i&#x27;m surprisingly neutral about it. Does it moisturize my skin? yes. Has it somehow made it self worthy of its hefty price tag? no. I will say that one positive note is that although the cream is thick and looks goopy and oily, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily at all. but then again, so does Nivea. I received this cream for review purpose.</li>
            <li> Using this stuff really makes you feel like you&#x27;re at the spa. It screams luxury and all of my friends that see it think that I&#x27;ve ordered it from somewhere professional. It&#x27;s made up of all the lotions/butters that I already use separately and combines them to create one super smooth and silky moisturizer. It&#x27;s very light and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. It soaks into the skin well and leaves a clean feeling afterwards. The scent is faint which is another huge plus. This is also a large jar and seems like a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve very pleased with this product! It will make you feel pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FULL DISCLOSURE: This sample was provided to me for free for testing and reviewing purposes. This review is 100% unbiased and honest. All words are my own of course.</li>
