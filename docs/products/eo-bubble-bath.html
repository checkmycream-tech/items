            <li>This is very nice bubble bath - lots of soothing bubbles.</li>
            <li>Very nice always looking for bubble baths that are not overly scented and create lots of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>The wife loves lavender and found it added to a relaxing bath, really enjoying the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>A three pack will hold you out for a while if you use the amount wisely, and can be a good investment if you tend to take baths often and want to relax.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I use it fairly often as a body wash, too.    </li>
            <li>Non-toxic and good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Good seller, too.</li>

            <li>It is a good bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and makes nice bubbles.</li>
            <li>We tried this product and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is the best price available and I use the auto-shipment option for even greater savings.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, tons of bubbles!</li>
            <li>The lavender smell is perfection and it bubbles up amazing.  </li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>It smells great, produces great bubbles and is gentle on my sons skin.</li>
            <li>The scent does dilute nicely once in the bath water</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice before bedtime.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t often find good quality lavendar bubble bath in children&#x27;s products, so after reading the great reviews on this particular product, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Great product  ;fast delivery</li>
            <li>This is the most soothing product and it keeps the bathtub ring away, too.</li>
            <li>Use with Epson salts in a bath that will leave your skin tingly and healthy.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure I will find something to do with it.</li>
            <li>Favorite bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use the product, but did open to smell it and the scent is incredible!!  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)    </li>
            <li>Love the bath with this.</li>
            <li>We really love this bubble bath, we&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others, and I&#x27;ve now put this on my &amp;#34;subscribed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this bubble bath...</li>
            <li>Indulge &amp; enjoy!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>The French Lavender smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li>It smells great and does not irate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A deep tub filled with hot water and bubbles is the most perfect way to relax.</li>
            <li>A nice hot bath, EO Bubble Bath and a glass of wine.  </li>
            <li>No bad ingredients, tons of bubbles, a lovely light scent.  </li>
            <li>but the price was fantastic ($.96 for three bottles).  </li>
            <li>The bubbles are fabulous IF you shake your hand vigorously in the water for about 5 min.</li>
            <li>After that exercise, they are great and last, but just running the bubbles under water doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li>I am breast feeding and I feel completely comfortable with using it in mine as well.</li>
            <li>So smooth and relaxing.</li>
            <li>And enjoy.</li>
            <li>yet they were in a sealed bag so fortunately none of my books got damaged.</li>
            <li>this makes me love amazon even more than I all ready do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is a decently strong true lavendar smell - not a perfumy lavendar, but the smell you would smell if you took and rubbed a lavendar plant between your palms.  </li>
            <li>It is heavenly; not too sweet and cheap like some scents, yet without the sharpness of some lavender.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not the kiddo&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>EO products smell wonderful because of the natural essential oils that don&#x27;t smell perfume-y.</li>
            <li>Good but  not my favorite.....EO Serenity Bubble Bath, French Lavender with Aloe, 12-Ounce Bottles, (Pack of 3)...</li>
            <li>I love lavender, and this smells like real lavendar, unlike the syntheic scent from lavender extract.  </li>
            <li>It will also leave your skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>The package came with 3 bottles so it should last a good while.</li>
            <li>I love the company, it&#x27;s very Eco-conscious.</li>
            <li>I like it, but the scent is more of a natural lavender scent and is strong.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I am more impressed with Amazon than I am this product (Amazon posted the wrong price by accident but honored the advertised price because the error was their mistake)</li>
            <li>Safe, natural product that generates all the bubbles anyone could ever want for a bath!</li>
            <li>i feel so safe using this in my 3.5 year old son&#x27;s baths.</li>
            <li>The lavender is naturally calming and de-stressing as well, which is lovely.</li>
            <li>If you are used to the scent in most \\&quot;lavendar\\&quot; products; then this will smell different to you, and I worry that people will take the initial sniff and get the smell \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in their nose and not give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li>The lavender smell is nice and bubbles last a bit to be thrown around on the walls!</li>
            <li>A quick hot rinse took care of the problem, but it could have been worse.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is a no, and I do have to take away a star, because of the volume lost as a result.</li>
            <li>it smelled nice, it lathered nice and it seems to be a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product (EO brand) which has to be better than those other products loaded down with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, is all natural and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some bubble bath products do.</li>
            <li>I typically buy the California Baby for them, which is much more pricey but also lovely.</li>
            <li>The smell is not very strong, but is still good.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but smell isn&#x27;t as intense as I would personally like.    </li>
            <li>If this is your first experience with this product, I suggest avoiding the temptation to open the bottle and take a big whiff... instead, let your first impression be that of the product in a tub full of water.itial sniff and get the smell \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in their nose and not give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li>Avon Lavender has more of a lavender smell and the bubble last all thur your bath, and no bath tub ring.    </li>
            <li>Would like to see larger bottles or package deals with better pricing and higher concentration of suds and lavender.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use EO Lavender hand soap, too and love it.</li>
            <li>The product bubbles very nicely in our hard water...</li>
            <li>I did not like the product nor does it smell like pure lavender oil.  </li>
            <li>This is pure heaven.  </li>
            <li>And for about .35 a bottle, I could use it to clean out my toilet and still be making money (I actually use it in some refillable hand soaps throughout the house since I&#x27;m more of a shower person myself).</li>
            <li>I have had great luck using lavendar and low lighting to help mellow them out in the evening, and specifically bought this bubble bath to help relax my children so that I can get them to bed a little easier.</li>
            <li>In summery, I do feel confident recommending this product to help calm you and your little ones.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>It does make the bath smell smell like real lavender.</li>
            <li>Just real lavender scent that did not linger.  </li>
            <li>This is a very fragrant bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>It also make copious amounts of bubbles, so don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>biggest problem will be the shipping- the bottles are wrapped lightly in plastic to prevent leaking into the box, but it doesn&#x27;t actually prevent leaking in itself.</li>
            <li>This lavender scent is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Bubbles seem to last forever and the fragrance is light.</li>
            <li>It goes a long way and gives such nice, sudsy, good-smelling baths.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, this product is free of harmful irritating chemicals that nearly all bubble baths have, Despite this, I still get a nice amount of bubbles</li>
            <li>Nice bubbles and the scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>If this is your first experience with this product, I suggest avoiding the temptation to open the bottle and take a big whiff... instead, let your first impression be that of the product in a tub full of water.</li>
            <li>All of the main oils used in this are organic.</li>
            <li>but I think you can get similar or better bubble bath for the regular price of over $30.</li>
            <li>It is vibrant, yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also organic, so I have no complaint about that either.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who loves a long bubble bath this is a sweet smelling soothing product.  </li>
            <li>always like to try new stuff....</li>
            <li>I believe Amazon and the supplier were inundated with orders because it took about a month to get it filled, but it actually came with no extra charge.  </li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance, with long lasting bubbles from using even a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my son and it leaves him smelling fresh and doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin.</li>
            <li>Deducted a star for the price, which is a tad on the high side, but I pay the premium over generic products given its overall higher quality.  </li>
            <li>I tried this bubble bath when looking for a natural bubble bath for our baby and toddler.  </li>
            <li>However if you are on fixed income like me and can&#x27;t afford $30 for bubble bath then either find something cheaper or hope that they make an error in price again</li>
            <li>I have a five year old and another one going to turn two at the end of this month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough</li>
            <li>makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>The bottles could easily last a very long time if being used just occassionally for an adult or for a special treat.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much that I even gave a bottle to my aunt who is very serious about using products that does not have harmful chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>the bubbles do not last that long, though; but it isn&#x27;t exactly like my kids are lying and soaking...</li>
            <li>Neither of my children have had any skin reaction, (even if not properly rinsed) but their skin is not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>soft get goes a long way.</li>
            <li>makes the whole house smell of sweet faint lavender so leave the bathroom door open when you bathe or shower.</li>
            <li>The scent is weak,  the bubbles vanish quickly,  and the feel of the bathwater is barely affected by the oils.  </li>

            <li> Honestly I am more impressed with Amazon than I am this product (Amazon posted the wrong price by accident but honored the advertised price because the error was their mistake)</li>
            <li> Safe, natural product that generates all the bubbles anyone could ever want for a bath!</li>
            <li> i feel so safe using this in my 3.5 year old son&#x27;s baths.</li>
            <li> The lavender is naturally calming and de-stressing as well, which is lovely.</li>
            <li> If you are used to the scent in most \\&quot;lavendar\\&quot; products; then this will smell different to you, and I worry that people will take the initial sniff and get the smell \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in their nose and not give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li> The lavender smell is nice and bubbles last a bit to be thrown around on the walls!</li>
            <li> A quick hot rinse took care of the problem, but it could have been worse.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is a no, and I do have to take away a star, because of the volume lost as a result.</li>
            <li> it smelled nice, it lathered nice and it seems to be a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product (EO brand) which has to be better than those other products loaded down with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, is all natural and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some bubble bath products do.</li>
            <li> I typically buy the California Baby for them, which is much more pricey but also lovely.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very strong, but is still good.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but smell isn&#x27;t as intense as I would personally like.    </li>
            <li> If this is your first experience with this product, I suggest avoiding the temptation to open the bottle and take a big whiff... instead, let your first impression be that of the product in a tub full of water.itial sniff and get the smell \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in their nose and not give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li> Avon Lavender has more of a lavender smell and the bubble last all thur your bath, and no bath tub ring.    </li>
            <li> Would like to see larger bottles or package deals with better pricing and higher concentration of suds and lavender.  </li>
            <li> I regularly use EO Lavender hand soap, too and love it.</li>
            <li> The product bubbles very nicely in our hard water...</li>
            <li> I did not like the product nor does it smell like pure lavender oil.  </li>
            <li> This is pure heaven.  </li>
            <li> And for about .35 a bottle, I could use it to clean out my toilet and still be making money (I actually use it in some refillable hand soaps throughout the house since I&#x27;m more of a shower person myself).</li>
            <li> I have had great luck using lavendar and low lighting to help mellow them out in the evening, and specifically bought this bubble bath to help relax my children so that I can get them to bed a little easier.</li>
            <li> In summery, I do feel confident recommending this product to help calm you and your little ones.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> It does make the bath smell smell like real lavender.</li>
            <li> Just real lavender scent that did not linger.  </li>
            <li> This is a very fragrant bubble bath.  </li>
            <li> It also make copious amounts of bubbles, so don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li> biggest problem will be the shipping- the bottles are wrapped lightly in plastic to prevent leaking into the box, but it doesn&#x27;t actually prevent leaking in itself.</li>
            <li> This lavender scent is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Bubbles seem to last forever and the fragrance is light.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way and gives such nice, sudsy, good-smelling baths.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, this product is free of harmful irritating chemicals that nearly all bubble baths have, Despite this, I still get a nice amount of bubbles</li>
            <li> Nice bubbles and the scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> If this is your first experience with this product, I suggest avoiding the temptation to open the bottle and take a big whiff... instead, let your first impression be that of the product in a tub full of water.</li>
            <li> All of the main oils used in this are organic.</li>
            <li> but I think you can get similar or better bubble bath for the regular price of over $30.</li>
            <li> It is vibrant, yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also organic, so I have no complaint about that either.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who loves a long bubble bath this is a sweet smelling soothing product.  </li>
            <li> always like to try new stuff....</li>
            <li> I believe Amazon and the supplier were inundated with orders because it took about a month to get it filled, but it actually came with no extra charge.  </li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, with long lasting bubbles from using even a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my son and it leaves him smelling fresh and doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin.</li>
            <li> Deducted a star for the price, which is a tad on the high side, but I pay the premium over generic products given its overall higher quality.  </li>
            <li> I tried this bubble bath when looking for a natural bubble bath for our baby and toddler.  </li>
            <li> However if you are on fixed income like me and can&#x27;t afford $30 for bubble bath then either find something cheaper or hope that they make an error in price again</li>
            <li> I have a five year old and another one going to turn two at the end of this month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough</li>
            <li> makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> The bottles could easily last a very long time if being used just occassionally for an adult or for a special treat.  </li>
            <li> I love this so much that I even gave a bottle to my aunt who is very serious about using products that does not have harmful chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> the bubbles do not last that long, though; but it isn&#x27;t exactly like my kids are lying and soaking...</li>
            <li> Neither of my children have had any skin reaction, (even if not properly rinsed) but their skin is not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> soft get goes a long way.</li>
            <li> makes the whole house smell of sweet faint lavender so leave the bathroom door open when you bathe or shower.</li>
            <li> The scent is weak,  the bubbles vanish quickly,  and the feel of the bathwater is barely affected by the oils.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s a natural bubble bath w/o the chemicals typically used to maintain them</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a somewhat raw, earthy, green smell that might be off-putting at first.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct about the bubbles dissipating &amp; having to splash the water around to initially activate them.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle bubble bath with a subtle lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> and I have NOT noticed that it lingers on my children&#x27;s skin even when my son gets out of the tub before I get to their final soap down and rinse.  </li>
            <li> Would like to add another essential oil to tone it down a bit.  </li>
            <li> The one down side was the packaging as all 3 of my bottle were not closed tightly</li>
            <li> The lack of bubbles is to be expected though because they don&#x27;t use all of the chemicals to make them, but that also makes it a cleaner product.</li>
            <li> A few deep inhalations of this fragrance</li>
            <li> so I would guess that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> and I have used about a bottle and a half in the last month - with an average of every-other night use.  </li>
            <li> short lasting bubbles, Bath tub ring fake lavender smell, not worth the price.    </li>
            <li> This EO product is on the few bubble bath that actully produces a number of bubbles.  </li>
            <li> All other vendors charge at least $12.</li>
            <li> It has no special aroma or anything, it&#x27;s just bubbles!</li>
            <li> In fact, the bubbles were hard to eliminate down the drain as they stubbornly existed.  </li>
            <li> it has been 10 days past since the estimated time.</li>
            <li> I, too, got the product on a .96 cents price error, so can only say I didn&#x27;t go wrong buying</li>
            <li> I decided to try this,  as I usually use Herbalflor bubble bath.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddler to help soothe him before bedtime because there are very few bubble baths that don&#x27;t have chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> And I mean it makes TONS of bubbles.</li>
            <li> All in All  not a good bubble bath.  </li>
            <li> it is now the 5th day, i hope they ship the product to me with in 2 days, otherwise it is a failed service.  </li>
            <li> Cons: Doesn&#x27;t make very thick layer of foamy bubbles and when you get in a lot of the bubbles die :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lots of lather, fills the room with lavendar fragrance.  The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product nor does it smell like pure lavender oil.  CONS: short lasting bubbles, Bath tub ring fake lavender smell, not worth the price.    All in All  not a good bubble bath.  Avon Lavender has more of a lavender smell and the bubble last all thur your bath, and no bath tub ring.    I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this for my son and it leaves him smelling fresh and doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin.</li>
            <li> Great product  ;fast delivery</li>
            <li> Good but  not my favorite.....EO Serenity Bubble Bath, French Lavender with Aloe, 12-Ounce Bottles, (Pack of 3)...always like to try new stuff....nice smelling!~</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of bubbles but I don&#x27;t use much. It does make the bath smell smell like real lavender.</li>
            <li> A GREAT price!!! All other vendors charge at least $12. This is the most soothing product and it keeps the bathtub ring away, too.</li>
            <li> Foamy bath soap that smells very nice.  Deducted a star for the price, which is a tad on the high side, but I pay the premium over generic products given its overall higher quality.  Would like to see larger bottles or package deals with better pricing and higher concentration of suds and lavender.  Use with Epson salts in a bath that will leave your skin tingly and healthy.  Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have not actually tried this but the price was fantastic ($.96 for three bottles).  It took over a month to arrive. From the bottle, it does not smell so great but I am sure I will find something to do with it.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my wife. She loves it. It&#x27;s an excellent bath enhancing product.</li>
            <li> No sodium laureth or lauryl sulfate in this!  I tried this bubble bath when looking for a natural bubble bath for our baby and toddler.  This one is just great!  Wonderful soothing lavendar scent and great bubbles for the kids with no skin irritations.  All organic herbal ingredients and oils.  Heartily recommend!</li>
            <li> Favorite bubble bath.  It smells great, produces great bubbles and is gentle on my sons skin.</li>
            <li> EO products smell wonderful because of the natural essential oils that don&#x27;t smell perfume-y. The lavender smells just like a bouquet from Provence.  Furthermore, this product is free of harmful irritating chemicals that nearly all bubble baths have, Despite this, I still get a nice amount of bubbles and I don&#x27;t have a ring on the tub.  This is the best price available and I use the auto-shipment option for even greater savings.</li>
            <li> shipment lost, they realized that 4 days after estimated time. it is now the 5th day, i hope they ship the product to me with in 2 days, otherwise it is a failed service.  *edit1, shipment still lost they havent send anything out to replace the shipment. nothing was updated. it has been 10 days past since the estimated time.</li>
            <li> I got three bottles of this when it was priced as a promotional item ....it was .96 for three bottles!!!!  I believe Amazon and the supplier were inundated with orders because it took about a month to get it filled, but it actually came with no extra charge.  What can I say?  It&#x27;s soap liquid....it smelled nice, it lathered nice and it seems to be a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product (EO brand) which has to be better than those other products loaded down with chemicals.  And for about .35 a bottle, I could use it to clean out my toilet and still be making money (I actually use it in some refillable hand soaps throughout the house since I&#x27;m more of a shower person myself).</li>
            <li> I was worried about the bubbles lasting on this product based upon some reviews and that my last non-sulfate product only had bubbles return when I turned jets back on.  I need not have worried.  In fact, the bubbles were hard to eliminate down the drain as they stubbornly existed.  I could have molded a miniature statue out of these suckers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was excellent and relaxing and not feminine.  Just real lavender scent that did not linger.  As a man, I was worried that I&#x27;d smell like a flower all day - have no fear!</li>
            <li> This EO product is on the few bubble bath that actully produces a number of bubbles.  It smells great and does not irate my sensitive skin.  The price point was great as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use the product, but did open to smell it and the scent is incredible!!  I love lavender, and this smells like real lavendar, unlike the syntheic scent from lavender extract.  It&#x27;s also organic, so I have no complaint about that either.  I, too, got the product on a .96 cents price error, so can only say I didn&#x27;t go wrong buying this &#x3D;)    PS: Because they come as a pack of 3, they are GREAT stocking stuffers for the holidays!!</li>
            <li> The lack of bubbles is to be expected though because they don&#x27;t use all of the chemicals to make them, but that also makes it a cleaner product. It will also leave your skin feeling fresh and smooth. The smell is not very strong, but is still good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddler to help soothe him before bedtime because there are very few bubble baths that don&#x27;t have chemicals in them. The bubbles are fabulous IF you shake your hand vigorously in the water for about 5 min. After that exercise, they are great and last, but just running the bubbles under water doesn&#x27;t do the trick. Otherwise great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! i feel so safe using this in my 3.5 year old son&#x27;s baths. I am breast feeding and I feel completely comfortable with using it in mine as well. The French Lavender smell is amazing!! I love this so much that I even gave a bottle to my aunt who is very serious about using products that does not have harmful chemicals in them. All of the main oils used in this are organic. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This is a very fragrant bubble bath.  It also make copious amounts of bubbles, so don&#x27;t use too much.  A wonderful way to relax and relieve stress</li>
            <li> Safe, natural product that generates all the bubbles anyone could ever want for a bath! And I mean it makes TONS of bubbles. The lavender is naturally calming and de-stressing as well, which is lovely. Would definitely buy again (if I ever make it through three bottles of it …).</li>
            <li> Creates a lot of bubbles, nothing  fancy. It has no special aroma or anything, it&#x27;s just bubbles! Creates a lot too!</li>
            <li> Love the bath with this. So smooth and relaxing. A spa at home!  I&#x27;m never coming out. The kids can keep on knocking!!</li>
            <li> A nice hot bath, EO Bubble Bath and a glass of wine.  Perfect end to a hectic day.</li>
            <li> We really love this bubble bath, we&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I give this as gifts to friends and family. It smells great, is all natural and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some bubble bath products do. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, with long lasting bubbles from using even a small amount.  I&#x27;ve tried many others, and I&#x27;ve now put this on my &amp;#34;subscribed&amp;#34; list.  I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> After several uses this does the trick for a soothing, tranquil experience in the bath. The wife loves lavender and found it added to a relaxing bath, really enjoying the wonderful smell. The package came with 3 bottles so it should last a good while.</li>
            <li> Pros: When I got this bubble bath 3 pack I got it for the insanely low price of $0.96. Honestly I am more impressed with Amazon than I am this product (Amazon posted the wrong price by accident but honored the advertised price because the error was their mistake) this makes me love amazon even more than I all ready do. For 96 cents it was an awesome deal but I think you can get similar or better bubble bath for the regular price of over $30. Smells great    Cons: Doesn&#x27;t make very thick layer of foamy bubbles and when you get in a lot of the bubbles die :( Smells nice but smell isn&#x27;t as intense as I would personally like.    Overall: If you are looking for lavender bubble bath and have some extra money burning a hole in your pocket then by all means get this bubble bath. However if you are on fixed income like me and can&#x27;t afford $30 for bubble bath then either find something cheaper or hope that they make an error in price again so you can get an awesome deal like I did.</li>
            <li> These bottles of bubble bath are great. They foam well, smell great and keep the girlfriend happy. A three pack will hold you out for a while if you use the amount wisely, and can be a good investment if you tend to take baths often and want to relax.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem will be the shipping- the bottles are wrapped lightly in plastic to prevent leaking into the box, but it doesn&#x27;t actually prevent leaking in itself. One of the bottles leaked a bit, which covered everything inside the bag in goop. A quick hot rinse took care of the problem, but it could have been worse.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is a no, and I do have to take away a star, because of the volume lost as a result. Otherwise, go for it. And enjoy.</li>
            <li> We tried this product and have been very pleased.  We are now on our last bottle.  It has a pleasant scent and makes nice bubbles.</li>
            <li> I have a five year old and another one going to turn two at the end of this month. I have had great luck using lavendar and low lighting to help mellow them out in the evening, and specifically bought this bubble bath to help relax my children so that I can get them to bed a little easier. You don&#x27;t often find good quality lavendar bubble bath in children&#x27;s products, so after reading the great reviews on this particular product, I decided to give it a try.  My children often still take their evening bath together and I have used about a bottle and a half in the last month - with an average of every-other night use.  The bottles could easily last a very long time if being used just occassionally for an adult or for a special treat.  The product bubbles very nicely in our hard water... the bubbles do not last that long, though; but it isn&#x27;t exactly like my kids are lying and soaking... they are playing in the tub and making it a point to handle the suds.  Mr. Bubble doesn&#x27;t last any longer with my two... so I cannot take off any stars based on the bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a decently strong true lavendar smell - not a perfumy lavendar, but the smell you would smell if you took and rubbed a lavendar plant between your palms.  It is a somewhat raw, earthy, green smell that might be off-putting at first.  The scent does dilute nicely once in the bath water and I have NOT noticed that it lingers on my children&#x27;s skin even when my son gets out of the tub before I get to their final soap down and rinse.  Neither of my children have had any skin reaction, (even if not properly rinsed) but their skin is not overly sensitive.  The one thing I did worry about is that it might sting their eyes, but neither have had issues with that either.  In summery, I do feel confident recommending this product to help calm you and your little ones.  If you are used to the scent in most \\&quot;lavendar\\&quot; products; then this will smell different to you, and I worry that people will take the initial sniff and get the smell \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in their nose and not give it a fair chance.  If this is your first experience with this product, I suggest avoiding the temptation to open the bottle and take a big whiff... instead, let your first impression be that of the product in a tub full of water.itial sniff and get the smell \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in their nose and not give it a fair chance.

            <li> This is a gentle bubble bath with a subtle lavender scent.  It&#x27;s gentle enough I use it fairly often as a body wash, too.    I regularly use EO Lavender hand soap, too and love it.</li>
            <li> This is very nice bubble bath - lots of soothing bubbles.</li>
            <li> This lavender scent is the real deal. It is heavenly; not too sweet and cheap like some scents, yet without the sharpness of some lavender. It is vibrant, yet not overpowering. A few deep inhalations of this fragrance and it&#x27;s \\&quot;serenity now\\&quot;. EO produces great products, and their scents are unbeatable. (Try the lavender all-purpose soap as well.)</li>
            <li> Best bubble bath I have ever used!!! Bubbles seem to last forever and the fragrance is light. I greatly appreciate the quality of the ingredients. The one down side was the packaging as all 3 of my bottle were not closed tightly yet they were in a sealed bag so fortunately none of my books got damaged.</li>
            <li> bubbles and smells great</li>
            <li> For anyone who loves a long bubble bath this is a sweet smelling soothing product.  Highly recommended.  I give it as a gift often.</li>
            <li> The wife loves this product, we order it about once every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, tons of bubbles!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It goes a long way and gives such nice, sudsy, good-smelling baths. Non-toxic and good for my skin. Good seller, too. Always on time with shipment and it&#x27;s always in good shape.</li>
            <li> a wonderful scent of lavender while showering. soft get goes a long way. makes the whole house smell of sweet faint lavender so leave the bathroom door open when you bathe or shower.</li>
            <li> great smell, not overpowering, nice lather and bubbles. makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> This is pure heaven.  No bad ingredients, tons of bubbles, a lovely light scent.  A deep tub filled with hot water and bubbles is the most perfect way to relax.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product.  The lavender smell is perfection and it bubbles up amazing.  Makes for the perfect relaxing bath!</li>
            <li> I love this bubble bath...great smell, great bubbles, they feel &#x27;oh so silky.&#x27; I love the company, it&#x27;s very Eco-conscious. The other reviewers are correct about the bubbles dissipating &amp; having to splash the water around to initially activate them. But, it&#x27;s a natural bubble bath w/o the chemicals typically used to maintain them so I would guess that&#x27;s to be expected. I never thought of using it for kids but that&#x27;s a great idea! I typically buy the California Baby for them, which is much more pricey but also lovely. Indulge &amp; enjoy!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this,  as I usually use Herbalflor bubble bath.  Compared to Herbalflor,  I found this weaker across the board.  The scent is weak,  the bubbles vanish quickly,  and the feel of the bathwater is barely affected by the oils.  I will stick to Herbalflor.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very relaxing.  Nice bubbles and the scent is not overwhelming. It&#x27;s nice before bedtime.</li>
            <li> It is a good bubble bath.  Unfortunately, not the kiddo&#x27;s favorite.  The lavender smell is nice and bubbles last a bit to be thrown around on the walls!</li>
            <li> I like it, but the scent is more of a natural lavender scent and is strong.  Would like to add another essential oil to tone it down a bit.  Use it in a foaming dispenser for hand soap, shower gel and bath wash for my kids.</li>
            <li> Very nice always looking for bubble baths that are not overly scented and create lots of bubbles.  this one worked well for me.</li>
