    <ol>
            <li>Great products!</li>
            <li>It made a wonderful gift, and the recipient was very pleased with the quality .</li>
            <li>This set is a great way to try Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling</li>
            <li>Great kit to have.</li>
            <li>And the shampoo/ gel smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice products.</li>
            <li>this is a nice way of reminding them that I love to have them over :-)</li>
            <li>I love this product, but.....</li>
            <li>great products fast shipping</li>
            <li>I feel it would be even better if it came in a pouch instead of being lose.</li>
            <li>The rest are fine.</li>
            <li>&amp; I know my daughter will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I wanted some decent travel-sized accessories for when I was going to have surgery and be in the hospital for a couple days, and this package had everything I needed at a reasonable price and with some quality stuff, nice scents!</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to giving these as bathroom sets for guests but due to being packed loosely, many bottles had spilled and ruined most of the packaging of soap boxes, making them unacceptable to give.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice set with several different philosophy products.</li>
            <li>I originally had a problem with this order, personal preference really.</li>
            <li>The body wash, which was the main item I wanted, had spilled and soaked the paper around the bar soap.</li>
            <li>I ordered a few of these for my guest bathroom and love them .</li>
            <li>The back of the product reads, &amp;#34;these are to enjoy during your stay.&amp;#34; Definitely not legal.</li>
            <li>I often have friends stay for the weekend and in case someone forgot to bring their toiletries or stays longer unexpectedly</li>
            <li>However, I guess I should have expected that when it said &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34;, right?  </li>
            <li>A little better packaging could have prevented a lot of wasted product.</li>

            <li> this travel package is really small.  </li>
            <li> A big disappointment in the seller and Amazon for doing business with this &amp;#34;company.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Was not avoid value shipping &amp; handling made it not a good value for the amt of product disappointed !</li>

            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to giving these as bathroom sets for guests but due to being packed loosely, many bottles had spilled and ruined most of the packaging of soap boxes, making them unacceptable to give.  At a minimum, liquids need to be shipped separate from the soaps.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally had a problem with this order, personal preference really. I had done a review and was helped promptly, and I wasn&#x27;t even asking for help. My &#x27;problem&#x27; was actually taken cared of. This seller actually cared about customer and went out of their way to remedy the problem. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered a few of these for my guest bathroom and love them . I often have friends stay for the weekend and in case someone forgot to bring their toiletries or stays longer unexpectedly this is a nice way of reminding them that I love to have them over :-)</li>

            <li> Ordered for travel.  Nice products.</li>

            <li> Smaller than hotel sized bottles....</li>
            <li> This set is a great way to try Philosophy products. It made a wonderful gift, and the recipient was very pleased with the quality .</li>
            <li> Some of the bottles were open and leaked in the package.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Worth the $</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set with several different philosophy products. Great for traveling &amp; I know my daughter will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great kit to have. I feel it would be even better if it came in a pouch instead of being lose.</li>
            <li> The items were as described but packed in a ziploc bag. The body wash, which was the main item I wanted, had spilled and soaked the paper around the bar soap. Very disappointed. A little better packaging could have prevented a lot of wasted product.</li>
            <li> Was not avoid value shipping &amp; handling made it not a good value for the amt of product disappointed !</li>
            <li> Great products! I wanted some decent travel-sized accessories for when I was going to have surgery and be in the hospital for a couple days, and this package had everything I needed at a reasonable price and with some quality stuff, nice scents! Nothing too overpowering but still quite refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
