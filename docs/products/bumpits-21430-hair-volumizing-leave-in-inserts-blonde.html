    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best, easiest innovation that&#x27;s come along in years!</li>
            <li>but it works awesome!</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>They work PERFECT!</li>
            <li>I can just throw it in my hair on the way out and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Perfect item, works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>my 10 yr daughter is loving playing around with these in her hair, it is a learning experience for her.</li>
            <li>Never know when they will come in handy.</li>
            <li>It takes some practicing and hair spray but this looks great when used right!</li>
            <li>Came early, works great!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>Had a bugger of a time getting them out of teased hair, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>and so do I love these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to let my hair grow out and have used these Bumpits in many ways.  </li>
            <li>If you like to work with your hair, you&#x27;ll LOVE fooling around with these engenious gadgets.  </li>
            <li>Love my bump it.</li>
            <li>These are ok if you have a lot of hair to cover them up.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for more volume 1960s style, this is it.</li>
            <li>Light color is nice to blend with light hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well and looks good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It is working fine and all</li>
            <li>I now understand why these are so cheap.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the right color for your hair.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>They are fun and easy to use, and don&#x27;t break your hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily they&#x27;re not expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and if the detailed instructions aren&#x27;t enough for you, you can always go find a youtube tutorial.</li>
            <li>I would also say they work better on people with thicker hair, I tried just using the small one to make a bouffant and the grips stuck out the top, even when I followed directions.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>All the bumpits weren&#x27;t included, and the one I really needed wasn&#x27;t included.</li>
            <li>Maybe thick haired people would do better, but it did not work at all for me!</li>
            <li>but they only give you three sizes; tiny, huge, and extra huge.</li>
            <li>They show in your hair, don&#x27;t secure well, and are a waste of time unless you&#x27;re wearing a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not going to provide natural looking volume, and it&#x27;s going to damage your hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use these at any kind of regular event, they looked ridiculous on me, but that was the point.</li>

            <li> (I&#x27;m a dirty blonde) and they look really cute with a headband.</li>
            <li> Also be careful not to use for athletics as they could hurt your head.  </li>
            <li> The Bumpit is simply not worth the money:  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mess around with anything else.</li>
            <li> Unless you were born with four hands, and extremely thick hair, these things are hard to use and only leave a stupid looking bump on top of your head.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> You have to tease the base and really secure them in</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and you can see the little knobs on the bumpit through the hair.</li>
            <li> Even the tiny one was useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kinda sucks</li>
            <li> Waste of money....bulky and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> And makes your hairdo look very late 90s</li>
            <li> So over in all I am not impressed!</li>
            <li> Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame, lame, lame.  </li>
            <li> The seller did nothing wrong.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a medium sized numb in your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for an outrageous photoshoot, and it worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

            <li> I bought these for an outrageous photoshoot, and it worked well for me. Had a bugger of a time getting them out of teased hair, that&#x27;s for sure. I wouldn&#x27;t use these at any kind of regular event, they looked ridiculous on me, but that was the point. I would also say they work better on people with thicker hair, I tried just using the small one to make a bouffant and the grips stuck out the top, even when I followed directions. I attribute it to having thinner hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda sucks though, these are supposed to give you the voluminous look without having the voluminous hair type. They could work for you, they may just take some practice.</li>
            <li> Of course everyone loves these and so do I love these</li>
            <li> They work, they work for all different types of hair. Separate, tease, place, spray ... done. Just make sure you get the right color for your hair.</li>
            <li> It takes some practicing and hair spray but this looks great when used right! Totally worth it! I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to let my hair grow out and have used these Bumpits in many ways.  If you like to work with your hair, you&#x27;ll LOVE fooling around with these engenious gadgets.  They are fun and easy to use, and don&#x27;t break your hair. You can also set your hair up to keep it off your face while it&#x27;s drying.  At this price how can you not take a chance. . . it&#x27;s the best, easiest innovation that&#x27;s come along in years!</li>
            <li> It is working fine and all but they only give you three sizes; tiny, huge, and extra huge. You can&#x27;t get a medium sized numb in your hair. So over in all I am not impressed!</li>
            <li> Waste of money....bulky and uncomfortable.  I  tried several times to use this and ended up chunking this in the drawer.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame, lame, lame.  I now understand why these are so cheap. They show in your hair, don&#x27;t secure well, and are a waste of time unless you&#x27;re wearing a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> Came early, works great! You have to tease the base and really secure them in but it works awesome! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love my bump it. It&#x27;s easy to use and it came very quickly. I can just throw it in my hair on the way out and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Well, if your costume involves a beehive or just big hair, this is what you need. Don&#x27;t mess around with anything else.</li>
            <li> my 10 yr daughter is loving playing around with these in her hair, it is a learning experience for her.</li>
            <li> These are ok if you have a lot of hair to cover them up.  Also be careful not to use for athletics as they could hurt your head.  Light color is nice to blend with light hair.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Think twice before you order. Even the tiny one was useless.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for more volume 1960s style, this is it. It&#x27;s easy to use, and if the detailed instructions aren&#x27;t enough for you, you can always go find a youtube tutorial. The bumpits blend in well to my hair (I&#x27;m a dirty blonde) and they look really cute with a headband. I let a friend try one and she wouldn&#x27;t give it back, so I had to order another set. Luckily they&#x27;re not expensive.</li>
            <li> Unless you were born with four hands, and extremely thick hair, these things are hard to use and only leave a stupid looking bump on top of your head. I didn&#x27;t even bother to return them, just threw them away! Save your money and don&#x27;t bother buying them. At least they got the name right. Bump!</li>
            <li> The package I received did not have all the items as listed.  All the bumpits weren&#x27;t included, and the one I really needed wasn&#x27;t included.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful product! I could NEVER get my hair to tease by myself, so I gave in and bought these.  They work PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I got this to help with a look for halloween.  It did help with getting that &amp;#34;Flow&amp;#34; Pump and had no worries about it staying in.  Never know when they will come in handy.</li>
            <li> The seller did nothing wrong.  The Bumpit is simply not worth the money:  it&#x27;s not going to provide natural looking volume, and it&#x27;s going to damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as I had hoped. And makes your hairdo look very late 90s</li>
            <li> Perfect item, works exactly as described. We bought these to help my daughter appear taller. Works very well and looks good.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use. My hair is thick and you can see the little knobs on the bumpit through the hair. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Dumbest product out there.</li>
            <li> This product is not for all hair types! If you have fine hair, it doesn&#x27;t work! You can see the plastic through your hair! Maybe thick haired people would do better, but it did not work at all for me!</li>
            <li> You can see the teeth through the hair.  This is awful.</li>
