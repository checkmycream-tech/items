            <li>Not to heavy and clean scent.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>which was a waste of gas, because I should have gotten the right one to begin with.</li>

            <li> Came in a glittery box, with a green bow!</li>
            <li> I mean get your stuff together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind waiting, I mean I did order it on line, but to get the wrong fragrance is a little messed up.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed by this seller.</li>

            <li> one of bath and body works best fragrances.  I Love itüòçüòçüòçüòç</li>
            <li> Good product, false advertising on seller&#x27;s part. This is not a box gift set, the 3 containers come individually with scotch tape on the lids. Very disappointed by this seller. Even someone posted a question &amp;#34;is this a box gift set?&amp;#34; and the seller lied.</li>
            <li> I love the scent I chose beautiful day, not sure if it&#x27;s still available in stores. Going to bath and body works to take advantage of the sales I&#x27;d usually spend around $30-$40 so it was nice to get the lotion, fragrance, &amp; body wash for such a low price.

            <li> worth the money. such a beautifully light scent</li>
            <li> This was a gift. It smelled great and I liked the little baggie that was included...My only complaint was that some of the lotion leaked out on the rest of the bottles. It wasn&#x27;t a lot and we cleaned it up before wrapping, but still a waste of product.</li>
            <li> I love it it smells really good and it shipped to me really quick</li>
            <li> Came a few days earlier than expected. Smells so amazing I honestly can&#x27;t stop catching a wiff of it. Totally recommend :)</li>
            <li> I think one of the reviews said this came in a glittery gift box. It does not, maybe it did previously. But it is still very nice. I can just buy a gift bag or box at the Dollar Store, no biggie. The products were new, sealed/unopened, came with ribbon and gift tag. Price was great and shipping was quick. This will be a great gift for my sis...thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product, smells great, shipped in a timely manner &amp; packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i&#x27;ll keep buying them</li>

            <li> I ordered the beautiful day gift set and they sent me the wrong one, I was mad that first I had to wait, which to be honest I don&#x27;t mind waiting, I mean I did order it on line, but to get the wrong fragrance is a little messed up. I understand things get mixed up, but I would have had to send it back and wait longer, I mean get your stuff together. I just ended up going to bath and body works and returned it for the right one. which was a waste of gas, because I should have gotten the right one to begin with.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my daughter and she loved it. She said that it is silky smooth and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> all excellent , thank you very much</li>
            <li> Cute set! Came in a glittery box, with a green bow! Smelt soooooo goooooood!!! And they threw in a purse size antibacterial!!!  And it smells heavenly! I bought it hoping it would smell like beauty rush green apple by VS, but it smells even better! With this and my fairly nice essiantial lip gloss, I smell and taste amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> This set is perfect. Nothing is tainted, everything works well. Only problem is that I may have a slight allergic reaction to the musk and daisy smell. I&#x27;ve noticed that I only experience congestion and sneezing when I wear this scent. The only downside so I haven&#x27;t worn it too much. But as far as everything else goes its a 4/5.</li>
