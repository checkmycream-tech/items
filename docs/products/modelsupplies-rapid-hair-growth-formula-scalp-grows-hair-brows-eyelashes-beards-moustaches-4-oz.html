            <li>- I tend to find one that I like and one that is effective, and then stick to that one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for everyone that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Made with mostly castor oil  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I have noticed more lashes as well as longer lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li>His hair had just started thinning on top</li>
            <li>and I knew the family would have a good laugh about it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use many products</li>
            <li>I was lucky to find that in this product!</li>
            <li>Second, it&#x27;s a great value for the amount.</li>
            <li>I also received the product super fast, so thank you ModelSupplies for a great product, and wonderfully fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I also use it on the my receding hairline along with Minoxidil and noticed significant hair growth after a month of application.  </li>
            <li>Many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This product is good for facial hair.</li>
            <li>just once though luckily.</li>
            <li>and my brows are really coming in strong and defined.</li>
            <li>Love it, with in the first week it felt better, end of second week</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is well worth</li>
            <li>I use it only on my eyebrows and lash line, so it should last me for a good many months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope Amazon will always work with company since their products are simple, natural, very affordable, yet very effective.</li>
            <li>Just okay product- didn&#x27;t actually see a lot of difference.</li>
            <li>I think the two work very well together!  </li>
            <li>So a month from now I&#x27;m only gonna dye it one more time and see how it goes after using it for 6 weeks and then write a review.</li>
            <li>Although the instructions say to use once a day, I use it twice a day and have definitely seen more brow hairs and longer, thicker eyelashes in 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works, it really works!</li>
            <li>For me, I don&#x27;t mind the inconvenience as long as it works well, which it most certainly does!</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and really thought that this would work.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works; I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month</li>
            <li>Maybe I put too much shampoo in my beard.</li>
            <li>I use an eyeliner brush for precise application, especially since it&#x27;s an oil.</li>
            <li>I just love that a product with all natural ingredients that I recognize actually works!</li>
            <li>I used this with vitabeard beard vitamins, and to be honest the growth is a lot better when they&#x27;re used together, because when i run out of the beard vitamins i can see the growth slow down.</li>
            <li>My patchy beard began growing new hairs and this product helped thicken them.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve always taken regular multi vitamins and definately never saw a huge surge in facial hair.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life my facial hair is connecting from mustache to beard.</li>
            <li>First of all, this product definitely works.</li>
            <li>Make sure the cap and the stopper are tightly sealed before shaking, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be \\&quot;completely\\&quot; mixed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a bit of fine tuning and careful attention to apply this with precision, and ONLY to where you want to grow hair.</li>
            <li>As long as the oil at the top is not a clear yellow, but beige colored and not see thru</li>
            <li>Well, he&#x27;s laughing now because his hair is as thick and full as ever!</li>
            <li>My beard was patchi and now its pretty thick after using this, now for my scalp not so much there was no result</li>
            <li>My brother started loosing his hair due to nutrition problems months ago and his hair is not growing as fast as before.</li>
            <li>Works good but smells bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not; I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i can see new growth &amp; less hair falling out!</li>
            <li> The balding in that spot has definitely slowed down, and it appears to be getting thicker.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my beard from dark to blonde 3 times in a week to make a black and blonde checkerboard beard and maybe that is why it looks shorter.</li>
            <li> I had hair where it has been gone for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> Be careful around the lips though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this is working for me, I have lost an eyebrow due to stress, and has been gone for about a year now.</li>
            <li> the combo of this and any other beard vitamin would work as well.</li>
            <li> You only need a very thin layer so a tiny dab should do an entire eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a little hair form on past the border of my lip and it looks like herpes.</li>
            <li> Sad about what I spent to get no result.</li>
            <li> the ones who&#x27;ve used this combo know what i mean.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> i was skeptical, since my hair is thinning a bit now that i am 60.</li>
            <li> Usually very tough to find that combination, but this formulation has achieved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> :-((</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t, all I saw was my skin breakout REALLY BAD!  </li>
            <li> Smells terrible and leaves area of application greasier than heck</li>

            <li> Just okay product- didn&#x27;t actually see a lot of difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this is working for me, I have lost an eyebrow due to stress, and has been gone for about a year now. I have tried everything and really thought that this would work. It&#x27;s not for everyone that&#x27;s for sure. Sad about what I spent to get no result.</li>
            <li> This looks like a great product.  Many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Works good but smells bad</li>
            <li> My brother started loosing his hair due to nutrition problems months ago and his hair is not growing as fast as before. Doctors prescribed him different drugs but none of them worked well since they do neither increase the strength of the hair nor the speed of growing. This product can solve this issue by rapidly increasing hair grow and thickness both at the same time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works; I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my brows are really coming in strong and defined. I would recommend this to anybody who&#x27;s looking to rock an attractive set of power brows.</li>
            <li> Love it, with in the first week it felt better, end of second week I had hair where it has been gone for a long time!!! All of the products are amazing!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not; I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  I will let you know in a month if it works.  I do (sometimes )apply it to my eye lashes and brows with no side affects.</li>
            <li> The product is very poor quality. Made with mostly castor oil  I saw no traces of copper peptide at all. It should of had some sort of blue tint to the product which come from the copper peptide but it didn&#x27;t, all I saw was my skin breakout REALLY BAD!  Customer service was good though</li>
            <li> This product is good for facial hair. My beard was patchi and now its pretty thick after using this, now for my scalp not so much there was no result whats so ever but i do recommend for facial use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. For the first time in my life my facial hair is connecting from mustache to beard. Be careful around the lips though. I&#x27;ve had a little hair form on past the border of my lip and it looks like herpes. just once though luckily. and i&#x27;ve had this bottle for 3 months and it looks like it will last another 2 months at the rate i&#x27;m going. I used this with vitabeard beard vitamins, and to be honest the growth is a lot better when they&#x27;re used together, because when i run out of the beard vitamins i can see the growth slow down. the ones who&#x27;ve used this combo know what i mean. i&#x27;m sure the combo of this and any other beard vitamin would work as well. beard vitamins definately aren&#x27;t the same as regular vitamins i remember seeing someone on amazon on one of these pages say something along those lines.. and i&#x27;ve always taken regular multi vitamins and definately never saw a huge surge in facial hair. so yea i suggest this with vita beard or whatever beard vitamin works for you or one you find good legit reviews on. but that&#x27;s what worked for me, hopefully the combo can help others.</li>
            <li> I Love it! Have been using for 2 weeks &amp; i can see new growth &amp; less hair falling out! Initially i was concerned about&lt;br /&gt;sleeping with it on,because of my pillow cases,just put a hand towel on your pillow. or i sleep on a pillowcase i don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;care if it gets on it.Just wash it! i was skeptical, since my hair is thinning a bit now that i am 60. This is my remedy!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with thinning hair i would recommend this RAPID HAIR GROWTH FORMULA! Yes I will get another bottle&lt;br /&gt;it is well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ModelSupplies  is the BEST they give superb customer service &amp; the customer satisfaction is paramount to them!&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to them &amp; their products!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months.  I put it on my brows and eye lashes at night.  I have noticed more lashes as well as longer lashes.  Brows are coming in thicker too.  The smell is not great, but it does work.  I also use it on the my receding hairline along with Minoxidil and noticed significant hair growth after a month of application.  I think the two work very well together!  I will keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> My hair has been thining for years, and one spot has started to bald. I have been applying this product as instructed. The balding in that spot has definitely slowed down, and it appears to be getting thicker.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stuff for 40$ and have been using it 3 months straight on my eyebrows, unfortunately I don&#x27;t see any growing hairs at all and didn&#x27;t worth the money at all. I think this product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I bought this product based on the good reviews and also this product have a lot in it. Overall, I stopped using it and don&#x27;t know what to do throw it and give it to someone that work for them? :-((</li>
            <li> I have used this in my beard for about 2 weeks. I know it says it could take over a month to use. I can&#x27;t make a decision yet if it has been working. I have been dying my beard from dark to blonde 3 times in a week to make a black and blonde checkerboard beard and maybe that is why it looks shorter. So a month from now I&#x27;m only gonna dye it one more time and see how it goes after using it for 6 weeks and then write a review. Maybe I put too much shampoo in my beard. Sometimes I wake up and it looks shorter but when I wash it out or if I braid it then it looks longer.</li>
            <li> I used this product to help my beard grow. It helped thicken my beard but not grow hair where I was patchy. I ordered some pills that helps grow hair and used this product and the results were amazing. My patchy beard began growing new hairs and this product helped thicken them.  Also my hair on my head and nails grew because of the pills. I&#x27;m definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product definitely works. Second, it&#x27;s a great value for the amount. I use it only on my eyebrows and lash line, so it should last me for a good many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you that it&#x27;s not the easiest product to use. For me, I don&#x27;t mind the inconvenience as long as it works well, which it most certainly does! The oil does constantly separate, so you will need to shake it every time. Make sure the cap and the stopper are tightly sealed before shaking, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be \\&quot;completely\\&quot; mixed. As long as the oil at the top is not a clear yellow, but beige colored and not see thru, you&#x27;re good to go. I use an eyeliner brush for precise application, especially since it&#x27;s an oil. Although the instructions say to use once a day, I use it twice a day and have definitely seen more brow hairs and longer, thicker eyelashes in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit of fine tuning and careful attention to apply this with precision, and ONLY to where you want to grow hair. You only need a very thin layer so a tiny dab should do an entire eyebrow. Some people may not have the patience required to use this product, but it&#x27;s not a big deal at all for me. I just love that a product with all natural ingredients that I recognize actually works! I also received the product super fast, so thank you ModelSupplies for a great product, and wonderfully fast shipping. I hope Amazon will always work with company since their products are simple, natural, very affordable, yet very effective.</li>
            <li> It works, it really works! I bought this for my dad when he turned 60 kind of as a gag gift. His hair had just started thinning on top and I knew the family would have a good laugh about it. Well, he&#x27;s laughing now because his hair is as thick and full as ever! Maybe next year I&#x27;ll get him some hair dye.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and leaves area of application greasier than heck</li>
            <li> This is only 4 oz which is not enough if your using on your entire head. You could basically use castor oil and see the same results at a cheaper price. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really great ingredients in a really effective product. Usually very tough to find that combination, but this formulation has achieved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use many products - I tend to find one that I like and one that is effective, and then stick to that one. I was lucky to find that in this product!</li>
