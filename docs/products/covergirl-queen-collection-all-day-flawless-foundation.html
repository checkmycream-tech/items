            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried MUFE Mat velvet which is supposed to be great for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Lasted the hours I had it on for (4) and looked great in my pics.  </li>
            <li>lol)</li>
            <li>I love the idea of having a &#x27;perfect&#x27; face all day!</li>
            <li>It sets great without powder and setting spray but if you want to get more than 8-10 hours of wear then add those things.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I would love to give this foundation 30 thumbs up because for the price, image my surprise when I realized there are also two bottles into the box!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the great color match to skin tone.</li>
            <li>I luv that the color is so freaking amazing</li>
            <li>It is light and gives good coverage - doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing foundation.</li>
            <li>And omg the glass bottle it comes in is so cute</li>
            <li>It is actually the best match I have ever had</li>
            <li>Provides great coverage and looks natural!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and gives a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>it covers beautiful and looks so natural</li>
            <li>Ever since purchasing, I get complete strangers telling me how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it goes on smooth and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>is very dark,probably will look good on Beyonce...</li>
            <li>It looks fantastic on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using a moisturizer with spf, use this really lightly so you won&#x27;t get that greyish look in pics.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that blemishes are covered but depending on how light they are</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for daily wear as well as for occasions.</li>
            <li>this foundation MUST BE BEAUTIFUL because I couldn&#x27;t make down Any Street, or the isles in the grocery store, without being stopped and complemented.</li>
            <li>I should have known because the first time I applied this, I noticed it had a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to receive my order so quickly.</li>
            <li>The product is good but this was too dark for me</li>
            <li>Only thing i would say is make sure your face is thoroughly moisturized.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The color was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It is about 90° here in Brooklyn, NY today and even with my forehead pouring with sweat it been a long time since I&#x27;ve turned so many heads.</li>
            <li>Thanks:</li>
            <li>It gave me a really \\&quot;flawles\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>They really outdid themselves with this foundation.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t really show up in pictures after using this.</li>
            <li>But I would definitely, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe my skin had to get used to it since it was a new product, but after about a month I have decided to throw it away.</li>
            <li>It really does seem like it has both powder and concealer mixed into this product.</li>
            <li>The product is very good,I only wish I bought a lighter tone-Warm caramel</li>
            <li>Today was my very first time Ever wearing this foundation and (though I can&#x27;t say what other  people are thinking)</li>
            <li>But other than that its completely AMAZE BALLS!!!</li>

            <li> No odor and the product is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Only cover dark spots and scars and then apply my facial make up.  </li>
            <li> Althought this product was not a complete match for my skin that was no fault of ne one but me.</li>
            <li> actually too dark for my skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> With the Amazon coupon I used and the already low price via the seller, this was an unbelievable deal.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily and acne prone skin and before using this foundation, I had my breakouts under control.</li>
            <li> I just need to go one shade down with this foundation.</li>
            <li> I have never used this product before and made a guess on the shade based on what I used previously from another brand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s proven pretty difficult for me to match a foundation to my skin color but for the past few years I&#x27;ve stayed on the hunt until this...</li>
            <li> I suggest to go a shade lighter than your usual.  </li>
            <li> 2 drops is all you need, 1 for each side of face; no more!</li>
            <li> Once it dries it gives a matte finish and does not transfer unless u are seriously rubbing at it.</li>
            <li> and you hardly need any powder to set it because its a 3 in 1!</li>
            <li> Im freaking addicted.</li>
            <li> Did not compare to this one, sorry I paid $36 for that one.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong shade though, forgetting that it has foundation in it.</li>
            <li> I AM SO DISPLEASED AND DISAPPOINTED.</li>

            <li> This foundation is definitely where its at!. Only thing i would say is make sure your face is thoroughly moisturized. This stuff does not have any moisture in it at all. I luv that the color is so freaking amazing and you hardly need any powder to set it because its a 3 in 1! Im freaking addicted. And omg the glass bottle it comes in is so cute and i especially love the pump!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described. Provides great coverage and looks natural!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order.  I was not expecting to receive my order so quickly. The color was exactly what I wanted.  It looks fantastic on my skin.</li>

It is actually the best match I have ever had and it works great for my oily skin.  It is light and gives good coverage - doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used it only once; It was not the shade I wanted, but I thought it would be close and it&lt;br /&gt;is actually too dark for my skin.  Thanks:</li>
            <li> The product is good but this was too dark for me</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to apply and the great color match to skin tone. No odor and the product is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this! its perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and gives a nice smooth finish. It&#x27;s good for daily wear as well as for occasions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s proven pretty difficult for me to match a foundation to my skin color but for the past few years I&#x27;ve stayed on the hunt until this...&lt;br /&gt;This foundation matches my skin tone soooo perfectly! Ever since purchasing, I get complete strangers telling me how great my skin looks.  With the Amazon coupon I used and the already low price via the seller, this was an unbelievable deal. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Althought this product was not a complete match for my skin that was no fault of ne one but me. I just need to go one shade down with this foundation. But other than that its completely AMAZE BALLS!!! Once it dries it gives a matte finish and does not transfer unless u are seriously rubbing at it. Only foundation I have found that is like that. I&#x27;ve even tried MUFE Mat velvet which is supposed to be great for oily skin. Did not compare to this one, sorry I paid $36 for that one. It really does seem like it has both powder and concealer mixed into this product. I did not need extra concealer for my undereye or for my blackhead and pimple scars. It gave me a really \\&quot;flawles\\&quot; look. I couldnt believe how matte my skin stayed too. Wear time is ALSO AMAZE BALLS!! They really outdid themselves with this foundation. It will be my go to for the summer and even in the winter. It sets great without powder and setting spray but if you want to get more than 8-10 hours of wear then add those things. I will repurchase, at target its $10.</li>
            <li> The product is very good,I only wish I bought a lighter tone-Warm caramel is very dark,probably will look good on Beyonce...Next time I know</li>
            <li> Only cover dark spots and scars and then apply my facial make up.  Very happy with my purchases (bought 2)!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. 2 drops is all you need, 1 for each side of face; no more! I bought the wrong shade though, forgetting that it has foundation in it. I suggest to go a shade lighter than your usual.  Lasted the hours I had it on for (4) and looked great in my pics.

I won&#x27;t say that blemishes are covered but depending on how light they are, they don&#x27;t really show up in pictures after using this.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily and acne prone skin and before using this foundation, I had my breakouts under control. After using this, my skin looks like it did in middle school. I started to get breakouts in places I haven’t had them in years. I thought maybe my skin had to get used to it since it was a new product, but after about a month I have decided to throw it away. I should have known because the first time I applied this, I noticed it had a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it goes on smooth and stays all day.  I like because it has foundation and powder in it. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I never knew i could wear foundation all day until this! I love the idea of having a &#x27;perfect&#x27; face all day!</li>
            <li> it covers beautiful and looks so natural</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this foundation, but when I received it the glass bottle was ALL BROKEN. AND FOUNDATION WAS OVER EVERYTHING. I AM SO DISPLEASED AND DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> SO this is No Lie! Today was my very first time Ever wearing this foundation and (though I can&#x27;t say what other  people are thinking) this foundation MUST BE BEAUTIFUL because I couldn&#x27;t make down Any Street, or the isles in the grocery store, without being stopped and complemented. It is about 90° here in Brooklyn, NY today and even with my forehead pouring with sweat it been a long time since I&#x27;ve turned so many heads. I would love to give this foundation 30 thumbs up because for the price, image my surprise when I realized there are also two bottles into the box! (I hope that wasn&#x27;t a shipping mistake, lol) But I would definitely, highly recommend this product. It, IS, truly Flawless.  ↖(^▽^)↗</li>
