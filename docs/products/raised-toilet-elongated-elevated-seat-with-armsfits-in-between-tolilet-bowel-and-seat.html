            <li>We have elongated seats and this product was perfect, very well built and cleaned up easily.</li>
            <li>It serves it&#x27;s function, but could be more user-friendly for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>AND I ARE  GLAD</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean, install and perfect for anyone with back problems or someone needing the support to get up.</li>
            <li>The wingged side bars which are molded to the seat as one piece are  brilliant idea and have saved falling several times.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>IT WAS SO EASY TO PUT TOGETHER</li>

            <li>It was easy to install and feels quite secure.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install and fits well, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This seat makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>So I can visit knowing I will be comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very displeased!!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s even a product made specifically for the very rare sufferers of Tolilet Bowel Syndrome.  </li>
            <li>Works and fits great on my elongated toilet as promised.</li>
            <li>The ability to use your existing seat and to lift it and lower it, as needed, is a significant advantage.</li>
            <li>Great for people in wheel chairs and with limited lower body mobility.</li>
            <li>I recently had both lower back and hip replacement surgery and this item was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Very simply, I did considerable research and found this particular seat to be perfect for my wife&#x27;s need.</li>
            <li>, it is obviously standard, but check and be sure before you order, folks!</li>
            <li>I like the arms on this product, and it did give a nice lift to the toilet seat.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find an elongated toilet raiser, but would have kept looking if I knew how hard it would be to keep the area that is the top of the stool, under the raiser, clean.  </li>
            <li>My wife finds this raised toilet seat very easy to use dispite her handicapped situation.</li>
            <li>All in all, it seems to have been a good purchase that will help make an elderly person&#x27;s life a little easier.</li>
            <li>After about a year, the top of the riser had a great big crack from the downward pressure of the toilet seat above it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This means there was more than an inch of the porcelain rim under the raised seat in the back.</li>
            <li>She was so pleased with it that we purcahsed a second for use in her assisted living facility where she lives.  </li>
            <li>If you are able to use your existing toilet, and are able to remove your existing toilet seat [or know someone that can help you] then this one&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my elderly mother and so far, she really seems to prefer it over the seat riser I&#x27;d originally purchased for her.  </li>
            <li>The information given and the reviews were very helpful in making my choice.  </li>
            <li>I can tell that by being raised and having arms to assist me is going to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>It fit quite well on my elongated toilet.</li>
            <li>When it comes to cleaning the toilet bowl ,I&#x27;ve found that a spray bottle with  some kind of bleach can be sprayed in the crack between the raised seat and the toilet..</li>
            <li>Your old toilet seat and lid attach to the top of this unit making it look pretty much like a normal toilet except for the large handles sitting out to the sides.  </li>
            <li>On the downside, I can see that the nuts will have to be tightened pretty regularly to insure that the seat does not move too much.  </li>
            <li>This unit is well made and sits very securely on the toilet bowl since it gets attached by long bolts.  </li>
            <li>Nice in theory, but this unit slips entirely too much on our toilet, and we&#x27;ve tried several different strategies to prevent it.</li>
            <li>Once removed, the raised seat and the existing toilet seat were very easy to install to the toilet fixture and were very solid and sturdy once installed.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally broke down and bought it..</li>
            <li>No way does this fit any long gated toilet</li>
            <li>I was worried that it would shift or that I would not be able to use the handles on the side to assist me in sitting down and getting up, but the handles were strong enough to support all of my weight and the seat did not shift - it was firmly in place!  </li>
            <li>This unit does not scare off visitors like our old one did.  </li>
            <li>Purchased one for my 92 year old mother-in-law to use in her house which she still maintains.  </li>
            <li>The arms are a nice helper--especially for getting up; less so for sitting down.  </li>
            <li>The attachment of the seat is straight forward but requires the removal of the two bolts that hold your existing seat to the toilet fixture.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a huge waste of people&#x27;s time and effort!</li>
            <li>But there are two major downsides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning between it and the surface of the toilet bowl upon which it sits can be a little tricky (I leave just enough play in the base/toilet seat interface to allow small movement side-to-side enabling me to clean any build-up on the top lip at the front part of the toilet bowl).  </li>
            <li>This elevated toilet seat has been great for my poor husbands battered body!!  </li>

            <li> This elevated toilet seat has been great for my poor husbands battered body!!  </li>
            <li> Because of my toilet and its configuration, it was necessary to go to the local hardware store and purchase different (longer) bolts, but when installed the seat is solidly in place.  </li>
            <li> My toilet was over ten years old and the removal of these bolts required some effort due to corrosion on their threads.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only place we could find a raised elongated elevated toilet seat for my Mom.  </li>
            <li> The only con would be that urine does tend to collect between the seat and the toilet  </li>
            <li> It easily bolted to the toilet base, with the two-part lid firmly attached to the top of the unit.</li>

            <li> The only improvement could be to have the handles a little farther apart and include an insert for the space between the tank and the seat.</li>
            <li> Fecal debris will gather in the crevice between the toilet bowl and the riser, which is very difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that cleaning under the riser will mean loosening the nuts completely which may result in stripped nuts in the longer term.  </li>
            <li> I had the other knee replaced previously without the aid of a raised seat.  </li>
            <li> The raiser is bolted down so it&#x27;s not a matter of just lifting it off.  </li>
            <li> She is 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;, about 110 pounds, not very mechanically inclined at all, and not particularly strong; but she had no problem installng the seat for me.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;IT WAS HERE IN LESS THAN 36 HRS&lt;br /&gt;THAMS</li>
            <li> The opening in the seat was the same size and shape of my toilet, but the screw holes to attach it were in the wrong place.</li>

            <li> I was happy to find an elongated toilet raiser, but would have kept looking if I knew how hard it would be to keep the area that is the top of the stool, under the raiser, clean.  The raiser is bolted down so it&#x27;s not a matter of just lifting it off.  It serves it&#x27;s function, but could be more user-friendly for cleaning.  Because of this, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Prior to my knee replacement I surveyed the options on Amazon.com.  The information given and the reviews were very helpful in making my choice.  The fact that I needed an elongated seat was brought to my attention by the comments - saving me from having to return a round seat.  It was a bit difficult to install.  My husband found a friend to help him.  It is excellent for me and saved me a great deal of discomfort in my recovery.  I had the other knee replaced previously without the aid of a raised seat.  This seat makes a huge difference.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I recently had a total hip replacement and purchased this raised seat to assist me with my recovery. If you are able to use your existing toilet, and are able to remove your existing toilet seat [or know someone that can help you] then this one&#x27;s for you. The ability to use your existing seat and to lift it and lower it, as needed, is a significant advantage. The attachment of the seat is straight forward but requires the removal of the two bolts that hold your existing seat to the toilet fixture. My toilet was over ten years old and the removal of these bolts required some effort due to corrosion on their threads. Once removed, the raised seat and the existing toilet seat were very easy to install to the toilet fixture and were very solid and sturdy once installed. The arm rails were helpful too.</li>
            <li> Seat is solid and sturdy.  The wingged side bars which are molded to the seat as one piece are  brilliant idea and have saved falling several times.  The height is good.  After several months of usage, there have been no problems.  Easy to install.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOTHER WHO HAD FALLEN AND IT WAS HARD FOR HER TO GET UP OFF THE TOILET.  SHE LOVES IT!  IT WAS SO EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND IT IS STRONG, DOESN&#x27;T MOVE AROUND AND IT WORKS GREAT.  DOESN&#x27;T COST A FORTUNE. I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> This unit is well made and sits very securely on the toilet bowl since it gets attached by long bolts.  Your old toilet seat and lid attach to the top of this unit making it look pretty much like a normal toilet except for the large handles sitting out to the sides.  This unit does not scare off visitors like our old one did.  Cleaning between it and the surface of the toilet bowl upon which it sits can be a little tricky (I leave just enough play in the base/toilet seat interface to allow small movement side-to-side enabling me to clean any build-up on the top lip at the front part of the toilet bowl).  My wife finds this raised toilet seat very easy to use dispite her handicapped situation.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this one to keep at my son&#x27;s home for when I visit.  (Hate using toilets that make you&lt;br /&gt;feel like you are on the floor.  So I can visit knowing I will be comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not for elongated toilet. Very displeased!!! Please change your description of this item. No way does this fit any long gated toilet and it&#x27;s a huge waste of people&#x27;s time and effort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have surgery and may have some difficulty standing.  I installed this raised seat before the surgery.  It was easy to install and feels quite secure.  I can tell that by being raised and having arms to assist me is going to be very helpful.  It fit quite well on my elongated toilet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly mother and so far, she really seems to prefer it over the seat riser I&#x27;d originally purchased for her.  The arms are a nice helper--especially for getting up; less so for sitting down.  On the downside, I can see that the nuts will have to be tightened pretty regularly to insure that the seat does not move too much.  I agree with other reviewers that cleaning under the riser will mean loosening the nuts completely which may result in stripped nuts in the longer term.  I found it easy to assemble--the problems I had were a result of working in a tight space rather than anything else.  All in all, it seems to have been a good purchase that will help make an elderly person&#x27;s life a little easier.</li>
            <li> In short, the holes didn&#x27;t line up. The opening in the seat was the same size and shape of my toilet, but the screw holes to attach it were in the wrong place. When I had the seat attached it was pushed back 1.5 inches towards the tank. This means there was more than an inch of the porcelain rim under the raised seat in the back. Sadly this misalignment meant that body fluids hitting the top of the porcelain leaked out along the back of the seat. Gross. Unfortunately I had used it for several days before I discovered where the odor was coming from. I bought a different one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with my Tolilet Bowel, and was worried that it may have to be surgically removed.  Then, after doing a Google search for \\&quot;Tolilet Bowel,\\&quot; I discovered that I&#x27;m not alone.  There&#x27;s even a product made specifically for the very rare sufferers of Tolilet Bowel Syndrome.  My only concern now is how this product will affect my dog&#x27;s drinking habits.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean, install and perfect for anyone with back problems or someone needing the support to get up.</li>
            <li> Purchased one for my 92 year old mother-in-law to use in her house which she still maintains.  She was so pleased with it that we purcahsed a second for use in her assisted living facility where she lives.  Great for people in wheel chairs and with limited lower body mobility.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only place we could find a raised elongated elevated toilet seat for my Mom.  It was easy to install and fits well, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Nice in theory, but this unit slips entirely too much on our toilet, and we&#x27;ve tried several different strategies to prevent it. If it weren&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. Barring that issue it&#x27;s just what we needed.</li>
            <li> It screws down so there is no easy way to clean the porcelain under it which gets very dirty.  You can only slide it to one side partially to get to the porcelain but it is very difficult.</li>
            <li> Very simply, I did considerable research and found this particular seat to be perfect for my wife&#x27;s need. We installed it on an elongated Kohler toilet. It easily bolted to the toilet base, with the two-part lid firmly attached to the top of the unit.</li>

            <li> The raised toilet seat is a blessing. It was easy to install. When it comes to cleaning the toilet bowl ,I&#x27;ve found that a spray bottle with  some kind of bleach can be sprayed in the crack between the raised seat and the toilet..Glad I finally broke down and bought it..</li>
            <li> I like the arms on this product, and it did give a nice lift to the toilet seat.  But there are two major downsides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  After about a year, the top of the riser had a great big crack from the downward pressure of the toilet seat above it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Fecal debris will gather in the crevice between the toilet bowl and the riser, which is very difficult to clean.  This is especially problematic if you ever have diarrhea. The only way to clean it is to remove the riser, which involves the tedious job of unscrewing two extremely long screws.</li>
            <li> I recently had both lower back and hip replacement surgery and this item was perfect for me.  It installs easily.  Because of my surgeries, my wife had to install this seat.  She is 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;, about 110 pounds, not very mechanically inclined at all, and not particularly strong; but she had no problem installng the seat for me.  Because of my toilet and its configuration, it was necessary to go to the local hardware store and purchase different (longer) bolts, but when installed the seat is solidly in place.  I was worried that it would shift or that I would not be able to use the handles on the side to assist me in sitting down and getting up, but the handles were strong enough to support all of my weight and the seat did not shift - it was firmly in place!  We have elongated seats and this product was perfect, very well built and cleaned up easily.</li>
            <li> This elevated toilet seat has been great for my poor husbands battered body!!  He has not fallen off the commode since we got this. As you all know tho please use caution because nothing is fool proof. This item is definitely a keeper.  Thank you. The Garcias</li>
            <li> Works well to aid guests because it is easy to install and remove.  The only con would be that urine does tend to collect between the seat and the toilet  - just check that once in a while - not a big enough problem to not purchase this seat.</li>
            <li> On the toilet our client has, the holes are 8 in. apart.  This seat has holes 6 in. apart.  As most people are happy w\this, it is obviously standard, but check and be sure before you order, folks!</li>
            <li> IT IS FINEMY WIEF AND I ARE  GLAD WE GOT IT&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS HERE IN LESS THAN 36 HRS&lt;br /&gt;THAMS</li>
            <li> Works and fits great on my elongated toilet as promised. Local medical supply companies have nothing like this. Before committing to a raised insert without any handles you must give this one a try. The only improvement could be to have the handles a little farther apart and include an insert for the space between the tank and the seat. The seat might slide toward the rear as used. I put a piece of hard styrofoam there to prevent this.</li>
