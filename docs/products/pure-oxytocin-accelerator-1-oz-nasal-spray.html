    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a gimmick. There is probably no oxytocin in this product. The labeling describes the product as a homeopathic solution:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients say &amp;#34;Oxytocin 12x, Testosterone 30x ...&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wish this had listed the ingredients on the description since I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I realized that it also had testosterone , endorphins, dopamine and a host of other ingredients.  Plus was a bit suspicious since it looked like someone had crossed out the number of fluid ounces on label.  Wanted an Oxytocin only spray not a bunch of other stuff.</li>
            <li> helo to all the people who do research on keeping a healthy libedo, Im 65 and I have notice real improvement in my libedo from this product. I will continue use this product</li>
            <li> Oxytocin isn&#x27;t doing what the ad said it would do. I will try it for a not longer,but I don&#x27;t have much faith so far.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to no one. this does not work at all. It&#x27;s miss leading and false advertising for sure.</li>
            <li> I feel great!  It&#x27;s a mood enhancer for sure!!</li>
            <li> Did not work at all what is limit on time I have to return it?</li>
            <li> it is nothing close to what it&#x27;s advertised.  it&#x27;s effect is no different than using saline water mist. I followed directions as stated and felt no&amp;#34;positive  effects&amp;#34; as stated on d instructions. I feel it is falsely advertised and its a waste of money. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just got my shipment and took first dosage. However the ingredients listed on the bottle indicate that this is a homeopathic remedy and therefore the concentrations of oxytocin are minute (virtually undetectable) compared to the prescription form of oxytocin nasal spray. In addition there are multiple additional ingredients listed on the bottle including homeopathic amounts of testosterone and multiple other ingredients and this should be clearly stated. If you think you are buying oxytocin in amounts that will make a difference when you purchase this product you are sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> This product proved to be completely worthless  !  I have purchased many items via Amazon over the years.  This is the first time I was completely wasting my time and money.  It was $ 34.95 down the drain.  POTENTIAL BUYERS BEWARE !!!</li>
            <li> This product delivered on time. Good calming effect and mood enhancer. Homeopathic medicine. Easy to use. Applicator is hard plastic;so be careful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice anything different</li>
            <li> I love this product. Since I have to take a lot of medication, things have really slowed down in the bedroom. I have seen a big difference between my desire before the product and today. I also have an over all happy feeling. Nothing works the same for everyone. I&#x27;m very happy this product works for me. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic at first i was skeptical but i tried it out and it really works. My wife and i love this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;going to buy again in the future</li>
            <li> Another FAKE PRODUCT! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AND BURNS YOUR NOSE!</li>
