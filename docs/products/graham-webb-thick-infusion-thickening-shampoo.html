            <li> I had thin, fine hair before, and I have thin, fine hair now.</li>
            <li> I HAVE REALLY FINE AND THIN HAIR</li>
            <li> This shampoo uplifts and gives my flat hair some life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that gives my hair some volume, consistently, without making it dry and dull.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I also found that this product doesn&#x27;t even keep my hair clean as long as typical shampoo.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to others with thin hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is lack of availability and I can&#x27;t figure out why these products are so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> After I started using Thick Infusion, my hair actually did thicken up and has body, which lasts from shampoo to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time, money, or hope on this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Used once didn&#x27;t notice any improvement not sure it&#x27;s helpful to thicken hair....</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m always on the look out for the stuff that  will keep my hair moist and thick looking.   </li>
            <li> I have used Thick Infusion for years because my hair is thin and limp and does not hold a style.  </li>
            <li> The thickening is subtle, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that it is so hard to find this product because I have used other \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; shampoos, but none compare to Thick Infusion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to write this review.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry that this company, to my knowledge, has gone out of business.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has been discontinued.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Over a quarter of the shampoo had leaked out of the bottle when I opened it. That should not happen, these bottles should be sealed.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t love this product.   i&#x27;m always on the look out for the stuff that  will keep my hair moist and thick looking.   for me, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to write this review. I used this shampoo every time I showered for 4 months (the entire life of the bottle). I had thin, fine hair before, and I have thin, fine hair now. I read reviews and thought this looked legitimate, but I was scammed. This product does not produce any good results. Unfortunately I also found that this product doesn&#x27;t even keep my hair clean as long as typical shampoo. Don&#x27;t waste you time, money, or hope on this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry that this company, to my knowledge, has gone out of business.....this is a great product and a great line and works really well for thinning hair....smells great too and feels good on scalp.</li>
            <li> great shampoo for fine hair, gives lots of volume&lt;br /&gt;it maybe discontinued, what a mistake&lt;br /&gt;like to buy more before gone</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT/ACCURATE  FUNCTION(DOES WHAT IS ADVERTISED AND IT MAKES YOUR HAIR SMELL FRESH TOO!</li>
            <li> This shampoo uplifts and gives my flat hair some life.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so I was thrilled to find it online.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo if you have very thin fine hair as I do. It gives good volume and does not weigh down your hair. It also has a good clean smell. Unfortunately it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for about 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried others, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that gives my hair some volume, consistently, without making it dry and dull. I wouldn&#x27;t switch.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it saddens me that Graham Web products are very hard to find. Thankyou for having it available</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Would highly recommend to others with thin hair. Also, the product came in a timely manner and was what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Especially since you cannot buy it in the stores anymore.  The same quality that you expect from Graham Webb but at a great price.  I finally got my fianc√© to try it and he is hooked.  Would not buy it anywhere else.  Fast shipping.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great shampoo for fine limp hair</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this shampoo. Cleanses well. The thickening is subtle, but noticeable. We will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product and am delighted that it still available.  After too many futile attempts at finding something different, I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>

            <li> What a great product!  I have used Thick Infusion for years because my hair is thin and limp and does not hold a style.

            <li> I used to use it all the time and feel it really did make my hair thicker...but, I developed an allergy to citrus and so I can no longer use the product.  My husband finished the bottle and asked me to get more.  And, so I have been for several years now.</li>
