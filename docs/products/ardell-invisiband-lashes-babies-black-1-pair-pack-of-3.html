            <li>They still looked ok, though.</li>
            <li>They are graduated length and almost a 3/4 length (I did not need to trim) which is perfect for smaller, almond eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can wear them more then once .</li>
            <li>My daughters are competitive dancers which they love.  </li>

            <li>They are so simple and elegant.</li>

            <li>These lashes are the only ones I have ever worn that look like they&#x27;re not fake.</li>
            <li>Has a natural look with a bit of glam.</li>
            <li>I put them in my top 5 at least.</li>
            <li>People could tell I was wearing falsies because my real eyelashes are quite short, but I still got lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>that lessons my chances of them lifting on the corner towards my eye because they don&#x27;t go that far.</li>
            <li>I think if you naturally have short lashes these would be great but on me it just looked silly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticable.  </li>

            <li>These are a little too long for me to wear with glasses but with a slight trim they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>I thought they would look a little more natural than they do - they look a little stiff.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m new at this, applying them properly was a total failure.  </li>
            <li> and dbl ply them on the ends to get thicker fuller outside lashes and use dark glue</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ruined my first two pairs trying to learn how to put them on correctly, but the third time was a charm!</li>
            <li> I soak them in rubbing alcohol overnight, and in the morning I carefully pull off the lash glue.</li>
            <li> I have very long, dark lashes but in the pursuit of bulking up the volume I ordered these.</li>
            <li> Plus, for some reason, they seem sturdier than other types of Ardell lashes.</li>

            <li> They are short and thin.</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t too heavy on their eyes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like those big spidery lashes some people they look scary</li>
            <li> and you know they are fake, these lashes still give you big lashes</li>
            <li> Because the girls don&#x27;t mind when I put them on, it makes a necessary evil so much easier.</li>
            <li> It adds a subtle but noticeable touch to you style on your wedding day or whenever.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these babies.</li>
            <li> Sorry, no offense to anyone....</li>
            <li> People are shocked when I tell them they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> The one thing they both hate, having to wear false eyelashes.  </li>

            <li> Someone forget to tell me that my eyelashes would become thinner and shorter with age.;-) The naturals line is great for anyone looking for &amp;#34;you but better&amp;#34; lashes. I wear these when I go out on the weekends or on special occasions. I think they are believable. Plus, for some reason, they seem sturdier than other types of Ardell lashes. I soak them in rubbing alcohol overnight, and in the morning I carefully pull off the lash glue. Then, I just rinse them off and they are almost as good as new. I always use the original container for storage.</li>
            <li> Products was well packed and came on time. Very nice quality. Has a natural look with a bit of glam. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> These ones were sooo short! My own lashes are longer than these! I think if you naturally have short lashes these would be great but on me it just looked silly!</li>
            <li> Only one pair.Not pack of three, as listed in parentheses on web site. The single pair was new and same as pictured item.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like those big spidery lashes some people they look scary and you know they are fake, these lashes still give you big lashes but they look like they are your own gorgeous lashes, it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li> Best natural looking strip lashes hands down!!! I wear these every day and I always get compliments, people think they are my own eye lashes until I tell them they are my fake lashes. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants longer lashes that look real. I will continue to buy these forever!</li>
            <li> These are cute but unless you want a minimalist look, go with another one.  It&#x27;s barely noticable.  They are short and thin.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes my husband always say how good my make up look but still did not realize my lashes are fake !</li>
            <li> Love them! Even my eye dr was impressed with how natural they looked! I would recommend these to anyone looking for lashes.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these babies. I love to cut what doesn&#x27;t fit off the end and dbl ply them on the ends to get thicker fuller outside lashes and use dark glue, that&#x27;s the ticket there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different false lashes and these are some of the best. I put them in my top 5 at least. They look great, are easy to apply &amp; stay on well. My only small complaint would be that they seem to be slightly narrower than some other lashes I&#x27;ve tried. They don&#x27;t extend across the eye quite as they should. They still looked ok, though.</li>
            <li> Adorable lashes that add just enough length and volume.</li>
            <li> Great value. I thought they would look a little more natural than they do - they look a little stiff. They are graduated length and almost a 3/4 length (I did not need to trim) which is perfect for smaller, almond eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No glue included.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very natural. Whenever I wear them I get complements on &amp;#34;my lashes&amp;#34;. People are shocked when I tell them they&#x27;re fake. They are not crazy long nor do they look like stage lashes. They are very natural looking. I bought 10 sets of these because they&#x27;re so good.</li>
            <li> These are a little too long for me to wear with glasses but with a slight trim they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> These are very attractive and not over whelming as others, but....I&#x27;m new at this, applying them properly was a total failure.  They are still attractive and better than others I received, however the glue had a bad reaction to my eyes and worried about attempting to use agtain.</li>
            <li> Love these! Unfortunately I ruined my first two pairs trying to learn how to put them on correctly, but the third time was a charm! People could tell I was wearing falsies because my real eyelashes are quite short, but I still got lots of compliments. I&#x27;m repurchasing!</li>
            <li> These are great lashes, I bought them befor and you can wear them more then once . Yes I would recommend</li>
            <li> These lashes are the only ones I have ever worn that look like they&#x27;re not fake. I have very long, dark lashes but in the pursuit of bulking up the volume I ordered these. Very pleased with the results!!</li>
            <li> These are just perfect for me! I love my lashes to look full and long, but not theatrical. They don&#x27;t go across my entire eyelid, but only 3/4 of the way. that lessons my chances of them lifting on the corner towards my eye because they don&#x27;t go that far. I will be ordering time and time again. These alone are $5 a pair at my local Sally&#x27;s, so I am happy for such a deal.</li>
            <li> I like these lashes because they are not \\&quot;over-the-top\\&quot; looking! They look very natural to your eye-lash.  I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;Lamb-Chop&#x27;s\\&quot; looking lashes. You remember the puppet cow or whatever animal the lady use to talk to on the kid friendly channel?! I just think makeup should compliment you, not emabarrass you. Anyway, these lashes are very nice, if you do not want the clown look. Sorry, no offense to anyone....</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Blends with just mascara. Eye liner optional.</li>
            <li> Loved them. I bought these for my wedding in august. They are so simple and elegant. They are not to thick were it is noticeable that you are wearing them (compared to those really thick ones you can buy)- alot of people thought they were my real eyelashes. It adds a subtle but noticeable touch to you style on your wedding day or whenever. lol I love them. And I would recommend them to anyone who wants a more natural look on their wedding day.</li>
            <li> My daughters are competitive dancers which they love.  The one thing they both hate, having to wear false eyelashes.  However, they don&#x27;t mind these at all, they aren&#x27;t overly large so they aren&#x27;t too heavy on their eyes.  Because the girls don&#x27;t mind when I put them on, it makes a necessary evil so much easier.</li>
            <li> Great!  Allergic to glue</li>
            <li> Ardell eyelashes are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> You can still tell they are fake but still look ok.  They are fun to wear on a night out on the town.</li>
