            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Get more than you paid for.</li>
            <li>but also a cute clip for cutains</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy up as many as I can</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a rinky dinky hair clip, and the color was astonishing.</li>
            <li>it almost seems like an antique piece and from a time when women dressed more elegantly than they do today.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s best for decoration rather than actually clipping up your hair.</li>
            <li>I really love this hairpin.</li>
            <li>I really love the turquoise-colored beads.</li>
            <li>I love this hair clip.</li>

            <li>Used it many times and still in tact.</li>

            <li>I will enjoy wearing this piece â˜º</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I got this for such a great price.</li>
            <li>It would work Great in a Updo or a French Twist....</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic item for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought it from Goods-cool for about $3 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>The clip is comfortable and does not pull my hair like some clips do.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my friend who has beautiful long hair.</li>
            <li>She love it so much ,he ordered more to send.</li>
            <li>the color is beautiful and holds my long hair in place.</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful on her long, auburn hair.</li>
            <li>It is so beautiful, it is very well made and is still as pretty as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>The quality seems good; no loose stones or cheap materials.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and strong</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s good because it is strong enough to keep my hair in the style I choose.</li>
            <li>but so worth it!</li>
            <li>It looks stunning in real!</li>
            <li>VERY MUCH WORTH IT! ...</li>
            <li>And certainly worth the money!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It takes about two weeks to ship - pretty sure it comes from China.</li>
            <li>I was blown away with how great it looked got to say it made the prefect little gift for Christmas:)</li>
            <li>For someone with very long hair, they hold up great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely made and looks like it does in the photo, just way bigger than most hair clips I see at the store.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that this clip is not light weight, but for the cost it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li>This is lovely, made of real metal, and quite sturdy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also incredibly sturdy, but it is heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is best for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li>I Love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful to say the least my daughter in law was very excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>I have very think hair and most clips fall out quickly.  </li>
            <li>These lovely, eye catching hairpins hold in thin, fine hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great clip.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty - pretty - I would expect this to cost a great deal more in the states.  </li>
            <li>It stays in place well, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on even though it is in my hand, and is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I find Chinese creativity to be exceptional and this hair clip is no exception to that.  </li>
            <li>The Pin is Huge and Heavy great Quality for the Price....</li>
            <li>I simply love this clip I wear it daily and get many complements.</li>
            <li>Would be more for a teenager or someone older.</li>
            <li>The color is very vivid, perhaps even more so than shown in the picture here.  </li>
            <li>Huge, but pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty get compliments when I wear it but dont grip hair</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty hair clip.</li>
            <li>Very pretty for the price, I just had to buy jewelry glue because the stones were falling</li>
            <li>While I think it is very pretty</li>
            <li>I must say its very pretty in person</li>
            <li>Very pretty hairpin.</li>
            <li>This butterfly hair clip is very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty and well made</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>It is very pretty in person.  </li>
            <li>VERY PRETTY</li>
            <li>a lot bigger, stronger, heavier and more beautiful than I expected.  </li>
            <li>But they are pretty!</li>
            <li>OMG IT WAS SO PRETTY!</li>
            <li>So pretty my granddaughter absconded with it!</li>
            <li>This barrette is beautiful, but it is so heavy that is falls right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>liked but was bit heavy for light fine hair</li>
            <li>The color and quality was amazing especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many nice compliments on it in just the few weeks that i&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>Picture doesn&#x27;t really even show an accurate description of this item.  </li>
            <li>A bit larger than expected but truly wonderful and colorful</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the cost and the wait to get here.</li>
            <li>I loved this piece so much I decided to get a second one for my mom.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait and money.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to get here as it comes from Asia, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>All in all, worth the price</li>
            <li>Takes a while to get here of course but who cares, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry.</li>
            <li>but it was soooo worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The wait was well worth it though.</li>
            <li>I paid under $3 for it, so for the price, it was well worth it and fun for my daughter.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good size clip - looks best if you have a bun or pony tail and put it at the base of where the hair is gathered.  </li>
            <li>why better then I expected... definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li>This hair clip is absolutely beautiful but very heavy</li>
            <li>if you love to put your hair in a bun this clip holds it better the any other clip i tried.</li>
            <li>Very nice Color, Heavy duty</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the weight of it will make it slide right out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful head piece, but its so heavy, I haven&#x27;t really found the right outfit that will work with it</li>
            <li>This is even more beautiful in person and looks like an expensive item.</li>
            <li>Solid metal piece with pretty nice stones/</li>
            <li>I use small clips and then put this one on top covering them and it looks nice</li>
            <li>best because this clip is a bit heavy and holds well near the scalp/colors are bright green and pretty.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair it might be too heavy but for all other hair types it is very attractive.</li>
            <li>I hope she can enjoy her new gift when she dresses up.</li>
            <li>It did take a very long time for it to arrive, but that made it a nice surprise since I had forgotten about it.</li>
            <li>So worth the $2 I paid for this (with free shipping!), even though one of the larger stones had fallen off on arrival.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick hair, so I was pleasantly suprised in that it holds my hair up!</li>
            <li>A little heavy for a full days wear, but for a few hours, its perfect and very cute!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, love it, but it is only for thick hair.</li>
            <li>This looks good with jeans and just as good with the little black dress.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was good - arrived a little ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant and colorful and a good weight, not too heavy, not too flimsy.  </li>
            <li>pretty, I keep one and sent one to my friend.</li>
            <li>It works well as a clip for wearing your hair up in back or on top of your head.  </li>
            <li>I wish there where more in different colors</li>
            <li>Perhaps my favorite and I have ordered several from China!!</li>
            <li>it has nothing to do with real jade!</li>
            <li>but wonder how something so prettily crafted can be offered so inexpensively.</li>
            <li>This is actually quite lovely up close.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy and perfect for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>I could have never bought these clips in a store as pretty and for the price.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it to work I got compliments from 7 different people ( mostly men).</li>
            <li>This is pretty butterfly clip..</li>
            <li>This product came and was more blue than the image looks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to be so pretty and shiney.  </li>
            <li>better quality than I expect for only paying $2.38..</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on it because it is such a standout</li>
            <li>Everyone is always commenting on how pretty it is.  </li>
            <li>PRETTY.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>That was actually my first thought after noticing how pretty it was.</li>
            <li>but wonder how something so prettily crafted can be offered so inexpensively.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it looked pretty</li>
            <li>it is sooo pretty</li>
            <li>but this is the first one .</li>
            <li>This is SO pretty, and well made...</li>
            <li>The color is hot.  </li>
            <li>I really could not believe I got such a great sturdy clip for the low price.  </li>
            <li>It seems pretty durable and well made though.</li>
            <li>So shiney and pretty.</li>
            <li>I love the color blue, too.</li>
            <li>Came with all stones intact and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this - turquoise, blue and greens.  </li>
            <li>This hair clip is so pretty.</li>
            <li>really pretty.</li>
            <li>Super high quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very large and certainly stands out.</li>
            <li>It holds thick hair in place, perfect for holding French hair.</li>
            <li>Design was too large but pin was pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty large clip</li>
            <li>Looks best in dark brown or black hair.</li>
            <li>Very elegant and of a heavy metal.  </li>
            <li>This is so pretty and the shipping was really fast.  </li>
            <li>Attractive, subtle beauty &amp; very functional.</li>
            <li>but I just superglued it back on easily.</li>
            <li>I think the blue is more vibrant in real life.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It is quite large and would be best for hair that is long and/or thick.</li>
            <li>It is large (approx 4 inches</li>
            <li>A bit too large for my taste.</li>
            <li>It is a large clip and made of durable product</li>
            <li>its large and fits comfy in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly large - the size of my palm.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is large (check the dimensions before you order).  </li>
            <li>I like the jeweled butterflies on the strong hair clip that keeps long hair in place and off the neck in hot, humid weather.  </li>
            <li>Vibrant colors!</li>
            <li>Came pretty quickly considering it is coming from Hong Kong, but the piece is solid and pretty.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait, very detailed and not a stone missing.  </li>
            <li>and it is large enough to fit a lot of hair too.</li>
            <li>my hair may be too much for the size</li>
            <li>In real life it sparkles a lot and the colors are deeper and truer in real life.  </li>
            <li>The metal material its made of its very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really like the hair pin.</li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t beat the price especially with free shipping.</li>
            <li>It has a definite sparkle, but it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>This hairpin was more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Has not broken at this point.</li>
            <li>It is very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As well, I received the item in the mail much sooner than the earliest estimated delivery date.  </li>
            <li>This is a very well made product.</li>
            <li>I really like this item.</li>
            <li>It really is like the picture</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat this price either.</li>
            <li>It is very luminous.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t appear cheaply made, and I always receive multiple compliments when I wear it out.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this piece, because of the price.</li>
            <li>The jewels aren&#x27;t real, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.</li>
            <li>very impress with this clip</li>
            <li>I really like this hair clip</li>
            <li>They are direct from china, so the shipping is about a month, but for the price I would buy tons more if I had enough places to wear the,  </li>
            <li>It is much larger than expected, but absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It is a tad heavy when on my hair, but it is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>made very well heavy metal holds long hair great</li>
            <li>clip is strong and holds my thick hair securely.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the colors.</li>
            <li>It is a little larger than I would have liked, but so pretty it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>This hair clip is very pretty, but the clip is much larger than I thought it would be and it doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>this hair clip is very pretty and BIG.  </li>
            <li>So very pretty and bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend checking these out.</li>
            <li>and it was a high quality piece.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this clip.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this pin to all who admire butterflies like myself.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you it is about 4&amp;#34; across and 2 1/2 high.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these for a friend as a gift, and was very pleasantly surprised at how large they are.</li>
            <li>It holds hair EXTREMELY well and its easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is a little heavy and might not stay in finer hair without pony tail or some thing beautifully made for the price</li>
            <li>It is very dressy, but such pretty colors, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>Shipped slow but considering where it shipped from, it was worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li>It is about 4 inches long and looks very pretty in the hair.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is a little heavy, but it sits great on a hair bun.  </li>
            <li>A bit larger than I thought, but WOW is this a pretty piece!</li>
            <li>bought a very similar pink butterfly hairpin, and will be on the lookout for more.</li>
            <li>say a pony tail, but with it it took all of 5 seconds to put my hair into a fantastic french twist - no extra pins needed.</li>
            <li>This is so pretty and much bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only pretty</li>
            <li>They can be worn for all ages - from 10 years old to 110!</li>
            <li>the right size for my long hair.</li>
            <li>This bpwlmpt hairpin is very delicately made, excatly as shown in the picture,and even better!.</li>
            <li>and heavy but stays put surprisingly well in my average thicknesses hair.  </li>
            <li>The little gems reflect so much light.  </li>
            <li>It is a clamp type (similar to a ficcare) but it has little teeth inside to help grip your hair more.  </li>
            <li>Thought I could use it to pin-up my damp hair and look a little better than a skinned back ponytail.</li>
            <li>It looks stunning but is hard to keep in your hair.</li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive of course but does not look in the least bit cheap.  </li>
            <li>It is a clip old style, like the old clips from the 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and she loves it as far as I know.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pretty,  extremely well made.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t fin this in a store near me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a young lady who loves hair clips.</li>
            <li>I personally did not care to much for.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size when it arrived.</li>
            <li>They are so pretty in long hair.</li>
            <li>This has a classy look when you place it and pumps up your look.</li>
            <li>but order early if this is for an event or gift.</li>
            <li>Sold as barrette, but it is really too big for that.  </li>
            <li>but I know china is a far country</li>
            <li>Got these for my 5 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>She loves them and wants to wear them daily.</li>
            <li>Got it for my five year old.</li>
            <li>I bought a similar one a few months ago for way more than this one and there is no difference in quality.</li>
            <li>i will definitely be looking for a few more from this seller.</li>
            <li>But I use for other uses than a hair pin; it decorates my purse, can use as scarf pin even a tie back for a light, lacey curtain.</li>
            <li>The clip may seem a little heavy at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly and would forget that I was wearing it until someone complimented me.</li>
            <li>Large and strong enough to hold my thick medium length hair in a bun.</li>
            <li>I find my very fine hair does slip out of it a bit, as it&#x27;s a bit heavy, however that is to be expected since it&#x27;s made of metal and stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This is very pretty, but a bit larger then I expected.  </li>
            <li>Lovely appearance - heavily than i had expected</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect this much for such low price ......</li>
            <li>So this hairpin actually came in earlier than the estimated delivery date and that was very pleasing.</li>
            <li>this looks much more expensive than it really is.</li>
            <li>Could it have lead as a major component?</li>
            <li>Could it have lead as a major component?  </li>
            <li>It is very pretty though but somewhat heavy.  </li>
            <li>I got this in blue and it is far higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>Seems very well-made -- nothing loose or flimsy.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and it is way to big for her head.  </li>
            <li>the color is really nice in person and it looks expensive.</li>
            <li>It did take a few weeks to be delivered, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>My hair is extraordinarily thick, and this clip will hold about half of it up securely without any assistance from bobby pins or hair bands - definitely a first for me.</li>
            <li>These are a beautiful hair ornament that looks expensive but only costs a few dollars.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m going to see if the same company offers any different designs...</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it takes a few weeks for delivery, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>A little heavy though and larger then thought but still love it</li>
            <li>The clip spring is very tight, and if you get it in right it WILL stay -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>It is a little oversized and would look great on thick healthy long hair as it is slightly heavy for thin hair.</li>
            <li>If your wanting something different and pretty for one night then perhaps you can use this without it pulling your hair down to much however for everyday use etc this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thick, long, and curly like mine you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I imagine if one had fine or thin hair</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, or thin hair - it might not stay as well as you&#x27;d hope.  </li>
            <li>It might be a little heavy if you have short or fine hair.</li>
            <li>Product is large and HEAVY.  </li>
            <li>Unusual little hair decoration</li>

            <li> this is a fantastic item for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought it from Goods-cool for about $3 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> The clip is comfortable and does not pull my hair like some clips do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who has beautiful long hair.</li>
            <li> She love it so much ,he ordered more to send.</li>
            <li> the color is beautiful and holds my long hair in place.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful on her long, auburn hair.</li>
            <li> It is so beautiful, it is very well made and is still as pretty as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> The quality seems good; no loose stones or cheap materials.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty and strong</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s good because it is strong enough to keep my hair in the style I choose.</li>
            <li> but so worth it!</li>
            <li> It looks stunning in real!</li>
            <li> VERY MUCH WORTH IT! ...</li>
            <li> And certainly worth the money!  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It takes about two weeks to ship - pretty sure it comes from China.</li>
            <li> I was blown away with how great it looked got to say it made the prefect little gift for Christmas:)</li>
            <li> For someone with very long hair, they hold up great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely made and looks like it does in the photo, just way bigger than most hair clips I see at the store.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that this clip is not light weight, but for the cost it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> This is lovely, made of real metal, and quite sturdy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also incredibly sturdy, but it is heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is best for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I Love it so much.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful to say the least my daughter in law was very excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> I have very think hair and most clips fall out quickly.  </li>
            <li> These lovely, eye catching hairpins hold in thin, fine hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great clip.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty - pretty - I would expect this to cost a great deal more in the states.  </li>
            <li> It stays in place well, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on even though it is in my hand, and is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I find Chinese creativity to be exceptional and this hair clip is no exception to that.  </li>
            <li> The Pin is Huge and Heavy great Quality for the Price....</li>
            <li> I simply love this clip I wear it daily and get many complements.</li>
            <li> Would be more for a teenager or someone older.</li>
            <li> The color is very vivid, perhaps even more so than shown in the picture here.  </li>
            <li> Huge, but pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty get compliments when I wear it but dont grip hair</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty hair clip.</li>
            <li> Very pretty for the price, I just had to buy jewelry glue because the stones were falling</li>
            <li> While I think it is very pretty</li>
            <li> I must say its very pretty in person</li>
            <li> Very pretty hairpin.</li>

            <li> It is very pretty in person.  </li>
            <li> VERY PRETTY</li>
            <li> a lot bigger, stronger, heavier and more beautiful than I expected.  </li>
            <li> But they are pretty!</li>
            <li> OMG IT WAS SO PRETTY!</li>
            <li> So pretty my granddaughter absconded with it!</li>
            <li> This barrette is beautiful, but it is so heavy that is falls right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> liked but was bit heavy for light fine hair</li>
            <li> The color and quality was amazing especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many nice compliments on it in just the few weeks that i&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t really even show an accurate description of this item.  </li>
            <li> A bit larger than expected but truly wonderful and colorful</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the cost and the wait to get here.</li>
            <li> I loved this piece so much I decided to get a second one for my mom.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait and money.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get here as it comes from Asia, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> All in all, worth the price</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get here of course but who cares, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> but it was soooo worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The wait was well worth it though.</li>
            <li> I paid under $3 for it, so for the price, it was well worth it and fun for my daughter.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good size clip - looks best if you have a bun or pony tail and put it at the base of where the hair is gathered.  </li>
            <li> why better then I expected... definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li> This hair clip is absolutely beautiful but very heavy</li>
            <li> if you love to put your hair in a bun this clip holds it better the any other clip i tried.</li>
            <li> Very nice Color, Heavy duty</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the weight of it will make it slide right out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful head piece, but its so heavy, I haven&#x27;t really found the right outfit that will work with it</li>
            <li> This is even more beautiful in person and looks like an expensive item.</li>
            <li> Solid metal piece with pretty nice stones/</li>
            <li> I use small clips and then put this one on top covering them and it looks nice</li>
            <li> best because this clip is a bit heavy and holds well near the scalp/colors are bright green and pretty.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair it might be too heavy but for all other hair types it is very attractive.</li>
            <li> I hope she can enjoy her new gift when she dresses up.</li>
            <li> It did take a very long time for it to arrive, but that made it a nice surprise since I had forgotten about it.</li>
            <li> So worth the $2 I paid for this (with free shipping!), even though one of the larger stones had fallen off on arrival.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so I was pleasantly suprised in that it holds my hair up!</li>
            <li> A little heavy for a full days wear, but for a few hours, its perfect and very cute!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, love it, but it is only for thick hair.</li>
            <li> This looks good with jeans and just as good with the little black dress.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was good - arrived a little ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Very vibrant and colorful and a good weight, not too heavy, not too flimsy.  </li>
            <li> pretty, I keep one and sent one to my friend.</li>
            <li> It works well as a clip for wearing your hair up in back or on top of your head.  </li>
            <li> I wish there where more in different colors</li>
            <li> Perhaps my favorite and I have ordered several from China!!</li>
            <li> it has nothing to do with real jade!</li>
            <li> but wonder how something so prettily crafted can be offered so inexpensively.</li>
            <li> This is actually quite lovely up close.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy and perfect for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I could have never bought these clips in a store as pretty and for the price.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it to work I got compliments from 7 different people ( mostly men).</li>
            <li> This is pretty butterfly clip..</li>
            <li> This product came and was more blue than the image looks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be so pretty and shiney.  </li>
            <li> better quality than I expect for only paying $2.38..</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on it because it is such a standout</li>
            <li> Everyone is always commenting on how pretty it is.  </li>
            <li> PRETTY.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> That was actually my first thought after noticing how pretty it was.</li>
            <li> but wonder how something so prettily crafted can be offered so inexpensively.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it looked pretty</li>
            <li> it is sooo pretty</li>
            <li> but this is the first one .</li>
            <li> This is SO pretty, and well made...</li>
            <li> The color is hot.  </li>
            <li> I really could not believe I got such a great sturdy clip for the low price.  </li>
            <li> It seems pretty durable and well made though.</li>
            <li> So shiney and pretty.</li>
            <li> I love the color blue, too.</li>
            <li> Came with all stones intact and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this - turquoise, blue and greens.  </li>
            <li> This hair clip is so pretty.</li>
            <li> really pretty.</li>
            <li> Super high quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very large and certainly stands out.</li>
            <li> It holds thick hair in place, perfect for holding French hair.</li>
            <li> Design was too large but pin was pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty large clip</li>
            <li> Looks best in dark brown or black hair.</li>
            <li> Very elegant and of a heavy metal.  </li>
            <li> This is so pretty and the shipping was really fast.  </li>
            <li> Attractive, subtle beauty &amp; very functional.</li>
            <li> but I just superglued it back on easily.</li>
            <li> I think the blue is more vibrant in real life.  </li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant.  </li>
            <li> It is quite large and would be best for hair that is long and/or thick.</li>
            <li> It is large (approx 4 inches</li>
            <li> A bit too large for my taste.</li>
            <li> It is a large clip and made of durable product</li>
            <li> its large and fits comfy in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly large - the size of my palm.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is large (check the dimensions before you order).  </li>
            <li> I like the jeweled butterflies on the strong hair clip that keeps long hair in place and off the neck in hot, humid weather.  </li>
            <li> Vibrant colors!</li>
            <li> Came pretty quickly considering it is coming from Hong Kong, but the piece is solid and pretty.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait, very detailed and not a stone missing.  </li>
            <li> and it is large enough to fit a lot of hair too.</li>
            <li> my hair may be too much for the size</li>
            <li> In real life it sparkles a lot and the colors are deeper and truer in real life.  </li>
            <li> The metal material its made of its very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> My daughter really like the hair pin.</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t beat the price especially with free shipping.</li>
            <li> It has a definite sparkle, but it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> This hairpin was more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Has not broken at this point.</li>
            <li> It is very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As well, I received the item in the mail much sooner than the earliest estimated delivery date.  </li>
            <li> This is a very well made product.</li>
            <li> I really like this item.</li>
            <li> It really is like the picture</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this price either.</li>
            <li> It is very luminous.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear cheaply made, and I always receive multiple compliments when I wear it out.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this piece, because of the price.</li>
            <li> The jewels aren&#x27;t real, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.</li>
            <li> very impress with this clip</li>
            <li> I really like this hair clip</li>
            <li> They are direct from china, so the shipping is about a month, but for the price I would buy tons more if I had enough places to wear the,  </li>
            <li> It is much larger than expected, but absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It is a tad heavy when on my hair, but it is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> made very well heavy metal holds long hair great</li>
            <li> clip is strong and holds my thick hair securely.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the colors.</li>
            <li> It is a little larger than I would have liked, but so pretty it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very pretty, but the clip is much larger than I thought it would be and it doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> this hair clip is very pretty and BIG.  </li>
            <li> So very pretty and bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend checking these out.</li>
            <li> and it was a high quality piece.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this clip.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this pin to all who admire butterflies like myself.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you it is about 4&amp;#34; across and 2 1/2 high.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these for a friend as a gift, and was very pleasantly surprised at how large they are.</li>
            <li> It holds hair EXTREMELY well and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> it is a little heavy and might not stay in finer hair without pony tail or some thing beautifully made for the price</li>
            <li> It is very dressy, but such pretty colors, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> Shipped slow but considering where it shipped from, it was worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li> It is about 4 inches long and looks very pretty in the hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is a little heavy, but it sits great on a hair bun.  </li>
            <li> A bit larger than I thought, but WOW is this a pretty piece!</li>
            <li> bought a very similar pink butterfly hairpin, and will be on the lookout for more.</li>
            <li> say a pony tail, but with it it took all of 5 seconds to put my hair into a fantastic french twist - no extra pins needed.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and much bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only pretty</li>
            <li> They can be worn for all ages - from 10 years old to 110!</li>
            <li> the right size for my long hair.</li>
            <li> This bpwlmpt hairpin is very delicately made, excatly as shown in the picture,and even better!.</li>
            <li> and heavy but stays put surprisingly well in my average thicknesses hair.  </li>
            <li> The little gems reflect so much light.  </li>
            <li> It is a clamp type (similar to a ficcare) but it has little teeth inside to help grip your hair more.  </li>
            <li> Thought I could use it to pin-up my damp hair and look a little better than a skinned back ponytail.</li>
            <li> It looks stunning but is hard to keep in your hair.</li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive of course but does not look in the least bit cheap.  </li>
            <li> It is a clip old style, like the old clips from the 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and she loves it as far as I know.</li>
            <li> Colors are very pretty,  extremely well made.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t fin this in a store near me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a young lady who loves hair clips.</li>
            <li> I personally did not care to much for.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size when it arrived.</li>
            <li> They are so pretty in long hair.</li>
            <li> This has a classy look when you place it and pumps up your look.</li>
            <li> but order early if this is for an event or gift.</li>
            <li> Sold as barrette, but it is really too big for that.  </li>
            <li> but I know china is a far country</li>
            <li> Got these for my 5 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> She loves them and wants to wear them daily.</li>
            <li> Got it for my five year old.</li>
            <li> I bought a similar one a few months ago for way more than this one and there is no difference in quality.</li>
            <li> i will definitely be looking for a few more from this seller.</li>
            <li> But I use for other uses than a hair pin; it decorates my purse, can use as scarf pin even a tie back for a light, lacey curtain.</li>
            <li> The clip may seem a little heavy at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly and would forget that I was wearing it until someone complimented me.</li>
            <li> Large and strong enough to hold my thick medium length hair in a bun.</li>
            <li> I find my very fine hair does slip out of it a bit, as it&#x27;s a bit heavy, however that is to be expected since it&#x27;s made of metal and stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is very pretty, but a bit larger then I expected.  </li>
            <li> Lovely appearance - heavily than i had expected</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect this much for such low price ......</li>
            <li> So this hairpin actually came in earlier than the estimated delivery date and that was very pleasing.</li>
            <li> this looks much more expensive than it really is.</li>
            <li> Could it have lead as a major component?</li>
            <li> Could it have lead as a major component?  </li>
            <li> It is very pretty though but somewhat heavy.  </li>
            <li> I got this in blue and it is far higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> Seems very well-made -- nothing loose or flimsy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and it is way to big for her head.  </li>
            <li> the color is really nice in person and it looks expensive.</li>
            <li> It did take a few weeks to be delivered, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> My hair is extraordinarily thick, and this clip will hold about half of it up securely without any assistance from bobby pins or hair bands - definitely a first for me.</li>
            <li> These are a beautiful hair ornament that looks expensive but only costs a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m going to see if the same company offers any different designs...</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it takes a few weeks for delivery, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> A little heavy though and larger then thought but still love it</li>
            <li> The clip spring is very tight, and if you get it in right it WILL stay -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> It is a little oversized and would look great on thick healthy long hair as it is slightly heavy for thin hair.</li>
            <li> If your wanting something different and pretty for one night then perhaps you can use this without it pulling your hair down to much however for everyday use etc this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, long, and curly like mine you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I imagine if one had fine or thin hair</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, or thin hair - it might not stay as well as you&#x27;d hope.  </li>
            <li> It might be a little heavy if you have short or fine hair.</li>
            <li> Product is large and HEAVY.  </li>
            <li> Unusual little hair decoration</li>
            <li> so cute and match with clothes even fir casual wear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if very fine hair would hold it, but my hair is medium to thick and curly and holds it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy, but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have really think long hair, so it can only hold half my hair back.</li>
            <li> beautiful color well made looks expensive, but is heavy, very heavy.</li>
            <li> a big pin (around 4 inches long)!  </li>
            <li> LONG WAIT TO BE SHIPPED TO YOU,</li>
            <li> was very much larger than expected and heavier.</li>
            <li> Just has to come a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> It holds my long hair well too.</li>
            <li> Again, long time arriving.</li>
            <li> Turned out a lot bigger than I expected, but my mother loves it...actually holds up all her hair.</li>
            <li> If you can hang on for the verrrrrry long shipping time.</li>
            <li> , I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...</li>
            <li> It takes a bit long to arrived but it arrived.</li>
            <li> Will work well in my really long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> It did not take as long as I was told.</li>
            <li> The shipping for this item took forever, however it was earlier than the month expected.</li>
            <li> service took long</li>
            <li> It does take a long time so order a month or 2 ahead of time.</li>
            <li> it was larger than i expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger and heavier than I had expected. .bit</li>
            <li> I held up my long blond hair for 10 hours befour</li>
            <li> I suggest a low pony or half pony and then put the clip just above it.  </li>
            <li> BUT it is so darn heavy, that you have to have super thick hair to hold it up.</li>
            <li> Seemed much more expensive than it was!</li>
            <li> The only complain I have about it is that it is a little to big...</li>
            <li> Way larger than I expected!</li>
            <li> but my granddaughter has very long course hair</li>
            <li> One of the big blue beads were missing, but I received the credit as soon as I reported the problem.</li>
            <li> The first thing is its heavy as all get out!!!</li>
            <li> The only set back, is the long waiting time for it to arrive and it is really heavy!</li>
            <li> that it cost less then $5 which is why we got her multiple designs and colors for x-mas this year.</li>
            <li> I actually used this to clip to the shoulder of a black dress for an event and got a LOT of compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> Easily opens and closes, sturdy, works in both thin and thick hair.</li>
            <li> This clip is a little bigger and heavier than I thought.  </li>
            <li> BUTTERFLIESIT IS A LITTLE BIGGER  </li>
            <li> 10 days before expected delivery.  </li>
            <li> It is way too big and heavy.</li>
            <li> She has really heavy, coarse hair</li>
            <li> It came sooner the expected.  </li>
            <li> looks like you spent alot of money on it .</li>
            <li> I wear it regularly in my daily hair updos and/or even with messy buns.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is as expected (30ish days) from China.  </li>
            <li> (Though plastic center beads.)  </li>
            <li> And I actually like that it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is a bit bulky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Too big and heavy to use in my hair</li>
            <li> The second thing is where the part you slide your hair on to clamp it had a few rough spots where it pulled the hair while putting it on.</li>
            <li> But I think other reviewers making a fuss about the quality and appearance of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look into buy this in other colors.</li>
            <li> The clip is heavier than any other that I&#x27;ve worn in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The clip is strong and held up my thin hair for a long time without moving or feeling insecure.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is it&#x27;s very heavy for a broach.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend it for long hair because its so heavy and will slide out of short or thin hair.</li>
            <li> but it holds my long, thick hair up all day long</li>
            <li> The color is rich, and looks very expensive.</li>
            <li> Be careful of the metal, though heavy it is not exactly sturdy.</li>
            <li> Be careful of the metal, though heavy it is not exactly sturdy.</li>
            <li> ; long, so it a little heavy, but evenly distributed along the clip.</li>
            <li> I rate it five stars, the only negative was the time it took for me to recieve it.  </li>
            <li> Big clip for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have hair down to my rear and it hold all of it in a bun without a problem.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or sliding down my hair</li>
            <li> But when I put it on my hair it just fall down.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said- the picture does not do the hairpin justice!</li>
            <li> For such price to got this it unbelievable thing!</li>
            <li> I got a few other theses.  </li>
            <li> I paid less than what it would cost me to mail a letter to China.</li>
            <li> I paid less than what it would cost me to mail a letter to China.</li>
            <li> always get complements when I were in my hair but have long thick hair  </li>
            <li> Extremely heavy, cannot be worn in hair, falls down and pulls hair out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re prone to headaches from tight ponytails, this will do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> The clip is heavy, but it works well in my hair which is thick and long.  </li>
            <li> I suspect the running and jumping loosened it a little and caused it to pull on her hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful...a little heavier than i thought.</li>
            <li> This clip came a little bit over the estimated time</li>
            <li> so it is a little on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> it a little bit heavy but</li>
            <li> And it is a little heavy,</li>
            <li> This is just heavy.</li>
            <li> Sturdy but not to heavy.  </li>
            <li> However, this clip stayed even after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It is, however, too heavy for my 7-year-old.</li>
            <li> She wore it to school once, but she said it was too heavy during recess, so she had to take it off.</li>
            <li> is heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy piece</li>
            <li> Not an everyday hair clip.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty</li>
            <li> but when I received it, it&#x27;s not too heavy to put in an updo</li>
            <li> not too heavy and the clasp is firm.</li>
            <li> Too heavy, doesn&#x27;t tell customers what size and weight on their ad.</li>
            <li> This is heavy</li>
            <li> Another waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is heavy because it is made out of metal.  </li>
            <li> It is not cheap looking either.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s HEAVY.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Its a bit heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy though</li>
            <li> so it took a few weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and very long, a little past my waist.  </li>
            <li> If you have super-thick hair, you could probably pin up half your hair, but I&#x27;m not able to do that.</li>
            <li> I only received one and ordered two, but am fearful I might have lost the first one at the gym.</li>
            <li> It is fairly heavy so not good for short thin hair.  </li>
            <li> This clip is heavy - definitely not for the weak necked or those with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they make money on this for the price though, just saying.</li>
            <li> They are not cheap plastic pieces!</li>
            <li> I have never seen a hair clip so heavy!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable quality and beauty.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend, not sure if it met any standards.</li>
            <li> if you dont have thick hair you may have trouble gettin it to stay in place.</li>
            <li> but it is very heavy</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy hairpiece.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s VERY heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy, so</li>
            <li> so it does take a while for shipping approximately 3 weeks is average..</li>
            <li> Made for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I wish my hair wasn&#x27;t so thick though.</li>
            <li> For me to use, it was a bit too heavy as my hair tends to be thin, but....</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick hair and this clip held my hair for over 10 hours.</li>
            <li> it hold all my really thick curly hair with ease</li>
            <li> If u have shorter or thin hair, this product is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Unless you have very thick hair you might want to pick something else out.</li>
            <li> Even you can say that there is too much fake shine in it.</li>
            <li> They were very heavy, so I suggested that my daughter wear them with her hair clipped at the base of her neck.  </li>
            <li> I felt rather bad about its source and can&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> I felt rather bad about its source and can&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> picture shown is very bad.</li>
            <li> and for the price, you will not be disappointed!</li>

            <li> pretty, I keep one and sent one to my friend.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is gorgeous.  It is about 4 inches long and looks very pretty in the hair.  I got many compliments.  It works well as a clip for wearing your hair up in back or on top of your head.  The quality seems good; no loose stones or cheap materials.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this! Made very well looks great! Made for thick hair. Really love items from this company.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is adorable! I love the colors and it fits perfectly. The jewels and stones have a vintage look, this automatically reminded me of something Rose would have worn in Titanic. It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> Best qualtity clip holds the hair so nice</li>
            <li> This is just heavy. I have to use bobby pins in order to keep it in place.  It would be perfect other than that.  It is lovely!</li>
            <li> This Iteam is more than I thought it would be great towear and not hard to spot. I love the size and love wearing it</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this  barrette. I have hair down to my rear and it hold all of it in a bun without a problem. I wish there where more in different colors</li>
            <li> Easily opens and closes, sturdy, works in both thin and thick hair. Simply glitters!</li>
            <li> Very pretty get compliments when I wear it but dont grip hair well  but fairly a good buy my hair may be too much for the size</li>
            <li> Design was too large but pin was pretty. Prettier if smaller</li>
            <li> Absolutely Gorgeous. Got it for my mother&#x27;s birthday and she loved it! Very good quality for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is absolutely beautiful but very heavy so would not work with fine hair but my granddaughter has very long course hair so it works great for her.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who has beautiful long hair. I hope she can enjoy her new gift when she dresses up.</li>
            <li> This is really good price and its very nice color so cute and match with clothes even fir casual wear</li>
            <li> Simply gorgeous!! Very good quality! The picture does not do it justice.  In real life it sparkles a lot and the colors are deeper and truer in real life.  The metal material its made of its very sturdy.  This was definitely a good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful. I wish my hair wasn&#x27;t so thick though. It doesn&#x27;t hold enough</li>
            <li> I love this clip. It holds my hair all day!!</li>
            <li> it is very beautiful. bigger then I thought. looks wonderful in my hair. I will be buying more. thank you</li>
            <li> This item is bey good quality. My daughter really like the hair pin. The Colorado of the gems are very bright.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hairpiece.  Sturdy but not to heavy.  A bit larger than expected but truly wonderful and colorful</li>
            <li> love the hair clip, it&#x27;s very beautiful and sturdy. I rate it five stars, the only negative was the time it took for me to recieve it.  It was a day short of a month.  Very beautiful detail and color.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I expected.  Very pretty and I was pleased with the quality of the item. Very good value.</li>
            <li> This so beautiful. I only received one and ordered two, but am fearful I might have lost the first one at the gym. I promptly ordered a second one because it is so beautiful! I am very, very happy with this beautiful hair piece. Perhaps my favorite and I have ordered several from China!! It is stunning!</li>
            <li> I like it, It&#x27;s ok. But I think other reviewers making a fuss about the quality and appearance of this product. It&#x27;s just ok, nothing more. Even you can say that there is too much fake shine in it. And believe me! it has nothing to do with real jade!</li>
            <li> Amazing materials pack a beautiful sparkle. Be careful of the metal, though heavy it is not exactly sturdy. Could it have lead as a major component? Over all the quality for price is amazing.. so amazing I felt rather bad about its source and can&#x27;t help but wonder how something so prettily crafted can be offered so inexpensively. I paid less than what it would cost me to mail a letter to China. It took about a month to arrive, but no complaints. Just concerns about what sort of labor and materials are being used.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture, and arrived well before the earliest shipping estimate.  Seems very well-made -- nothing loose or flimsy.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh, this is GORGEOUS.. why better then I expected... definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, very well-made. Was an excellent gift. Seemed much more expensive than it was!</li>
            <li> this product is beautiful, the photo does not do it justice. it sparkles, it has weight to it good material. buying more for all the girls in the office.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I got this in the mail. It is beautiful and very sparkly. The picture does not do this hair clip justice. Absolutely worth the cost and the wait to get here. Have gotten compliments every time I where this.</li>
            <li> Loved this piece of jewelry it was low cost but a great made piece of jewelry it stays in the hair well.</li>
            <li> Lovely appearance - heavily than i had expected but that&#x27;s good because it is strong enough to keep my hair in the style I choose.</li>
            <li> This is actually quite lovely up close.  It is a clip old style, like the old clips from the 60&#x27;s so there is no lock on it.  Not too heavy and perfect for my long hair.  It might be a little heavy if you have short or fine hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice Color, Heavy duty, I bought this for a friend and she loves it as far as I know.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these cilia and am very happy with the quality and how pretty they are. I could have never bought these clips in a store as pretty and for the price. I want more</li>
            <li> I can see that you take pride in this product...plan to give this to my precious granddaughter I know she will just love this ..thank you</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a friend as a gift, and was very pleasantly surprised at how large they are. For someone with very long hair, they hold up great.</li>
            <li> Beautiful clip.  It is large (approx 4 inches +/-) and heavy but stays put surprisingly well in my average thicknesses hair.  Colors are very pretty,  extremely well made. Packaged like it was a precious diamond or something.....took some time to open,  Lol!  Arrived approx. 10 days before expected delivery.  I have bought about 6-8 different clips from these sellers,  will definitely continue.  The clips are unique and I have never paid more than $2-3. for one.  Would make FABULOUS GIFTS!</li>
            <li> a lot bigger, stronger, heavier and more beautiful than I expected.  I got a few other theses.  They are direct from china, so the shipping is about a month, but for the price I would buy tons more if I had enough places to wear the,  Just beautiful and functional!</li>
            <li> Love the beautiful hair clip!  Fantastic quality.  Can&#x27;t fin this in a store near me.  I highly recommend checking these out.</li>
            <li> very beautiful !!!!!!!!!!  I love this piece, good quality too , very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and much bigger than I thought it would be. Love it</li>
            <li> This is VERY BIG! I must have missed something in the description.</li>
            <li> I loved this piece so much I decided to get a second one for my mom. It&#x27;s just awesome. Yes it is a little heavy, but it sits great on a hair bun.  The first time I wore it to work I got compliments from 7 different people ( mostly men). It&#x27;s looks so much better in person. It&#x27;s just such a great accessory.</li>
            <li> Very vibrant and beautiful piece...... Very attractive colors.......nice and heavy ..... Didn&#x27;t expect this much for such low price ......</li>
            <li> I loved this hairpin! It&#x27;s not only pretty but it holds my long, thick hair up all day long and that isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li> This is pretty butterfly clip..&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> It is beautiful!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This hairpin is even prettier in person. It was so sparkly. I love it. Plus, it is really cheap. I would recommend this! I sure will be ordering some more. It is from Hong kong, so takes a couple of weeks to recieve product but so worth it!</li>
            <li> This is my lucky barrett and it really looks good wearing it had alot of nice complaments thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> always get complements when I were in my hair but have long thick hair  it is a little heavy and might not stay in finer hair without pony tail or some thing beautifully made for the price</li>
            <li> This product came and was more blue than the image looks. The image to me looks turquoise. I have not tried it on yet as I am waiting for spring. It is cute. I just would have preferred turquoise to blue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got earrings to match.  Will look great with my hair pinned up.  Great accent to my hair. Can&#x27;t wait to wear this summer.</li>
            <li> No second thought! Buy it!!&lt;br /&gt;the picture shown is very bad. It looks stunning in real! I really love this clip!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to buy this clip.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said- the picture does not do the hairpin justice! Its so beautiful in person! Also I was very impressed with how big this is! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase I&#x27;m going to look into buy this in other colors.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty hair clip. I particularly like the colors. It is cheaply made though. It will make a great holiday gift.</li>
            <li> This was so beautiful! I was so happy when it finally came in the mail! The colors were gorgeous! The only set back, is the long waiting time for it to arrive and it is really heavy! I couldn&#x27;t clip my hair with this, so I have figure out what I can use it for now!</li>
            <li> I gave to a friend with red hair and she LOVES it.  it looks so adorable in her hair.  It took something like 2 months to come from China and there was no documentation inside the package, but it&#x27;s absolutely lovely.  I will get another one for another curly redhead I know.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely beautiful!  I put my hair in a ponytail then put this in (above the ponytail).  It does have some weight to it,  It is just so beautiful, the first day I wore it I got many compliments.  Every time I wear it I get compliments and insure you will too</li>
            <li> I really love this clip it is really good quality and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or sliding down my hair</li>
            <li> This clip is a little bigger and heavier than I thought.  However, it does a great job staying in place.  I have very think hair and most clips fall out quickly.  However, this clip stayed even after a few hours.</li>
            <li> A bit too large for my taste.</li>
            <li> I like the jeweled butterflies on the strong hair clip that keeps long hair in place and off the neck in hot, humid weather.  &amp;#60;thick hair&lt;br /&gt;does best because this clip is a bit heavy and holds well near the scalp/colors are bright green and pretty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be so pretty and shiney.  Well worth the wait and money. A little heavy though and larger then thought but still love it</li>
            <li> I love this clip.. The only complain I have about it is that it is a little to big... I have had many compliments while wearing this piece.. For the price you just can&#x27;t beat it..&lt;br /&gt;I do want to point out that this item does come from china/hong kong so it does take a while for shipping approximately 3 weeks is average.. The colors are beautiful, and it has great detail to it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better quality than I expect for only paying $2.38.. I would definitely recommend this anyone..</li>
            <li> This is really a nice hair clip, heavy, good quality and beautiful. And you can&#x27;t beat the price especially with free shipping. I bought a similar one a few months ago for way more than this one and there is no difference in quality. I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li> The picture of this hairclip just doesn&#x27;t do it justice. The stones and crystals in it are very bright and solid. It has a definite sparkle, but it doesn&#x27;t look cheap. I have received so many compliments on it because it is such a standout item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, thick hair. When I wear this clip, I can twist my hair into a simple know and use the clip to hold it all up. The clip may seem a little heavy at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly and would forget that I was wearing it until someone complimented me. It is, however, too heavy for my 7-year-old. She wore it to school once, but she said it was too heavy during recess, so she had to take it off. I suspect the running and jumping loosened it a little and caused it to pull on her hair. I haven&#x27;t had that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a very similar pink butterfly hairpin, and will be on the lookout for more. At this price, this just can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> A little heavy for a full days wear, but for a few hours, its perfect and very cute! Received several compliments!</li>
            <li> This is lovely, made of real metal, and quite sturdy. I find my very fine hair does slip out of it a bit, as it&#x27;s a bit heavy, however that is to be expected since it&#x27;s made of metal and stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rhinestones are secured well. I&#x27;ve worn this many times and find it provides a welcome splash of color.</li>
            <li> This hairpin was more than I expected.  Very vibrant and colorful and a good weight, not too heavy, not too flimsy.  This will make a great gift also.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Beautiful piece of Jewelry for the price! A bit larger than I thought, but WOW is this a pretty piece! Looks Beautiful on! Love it! Not sure how they make money on this for the price though, just saying. Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly lovely piece. Only drawback is it&#x27;s very heavy for a broach.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ... &amp;#34;LARGE&amp;#34; HAIR PIN ... VERY MUCH WORTH IT! ... LONG WAIT TO BE SHIPPED TO YOU, BUT, WELL WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift. I did not see the hair pin itself but in a picture it looked very nice, and the recipient was happy with it , so I would recommend it to anyone, and would buy it again. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> These are very nice for the money.  They were very heavy, so I suggested that my daughter wear them with her hair clipped at the base of her neck.  I gave her an out to give them to her blond sister, she said &amp;#34;no, they are mine&amp;#34;, so must have liked them.</li>
            <li> My grandson sent this to his girlfriend in Ga.She love it so much ,he ordered more to send.She was very happy</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful. Takes a while to get here as it comes from Asia, but worth the wait. Well packaged and in good condition. Definitely recommend. There was a tiny chip on one of the blue gems, that I noticed on closer inspection, which was the only drawback. Doesn&#x27;t change my rating, I still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> this was just beautiful and got here on time too thanks a lot for the beautiful hair clip my daughter will love it</li>
            <li> Love this item.  It works great and is beautiful.  Everyone is always commenting on how pretty it is.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very pretty for the price, I just had to buy jewelry glue because the stones were falling</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very pretty, but the clip is much larger than I thought it would be and it doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Really cute. Has good grip. I have really think long hair, so it can only hold half my hair back. Other than that it&#x27;s a great clip.</li>
            <li> Beautiful - many compliments</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS TODAY. VERY HAPPY. LOVELY HAIR PIN,  AND TWO BUTTERFLIES.  WELL PACKAGED  THE STONES LOOK LIKE TURQUOISE... PRETTY.</li>
            <li> Loved it !! Super high quality</li>
            <li> Big clip for thick hair.  Very cute, I love the butterfly design. It holds thick hair in place, perfect for holding French hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece. Great price. Great quality.</li>
            <li> The color and quality was amazing especially for the price.  It looks gorgeous in my dark hair and stays in place perfectly.</li>
            <li> This clip is beautiful! I have very thick hair, so I was pleasantly suprised in that it holds my hair up! I love it.</li>
            <li> This bpwlmpt hairpin is very delicately made, excatly as shown in the picture,and even better!. Get more than you paid for.</li>
            <li> Pretty Fun good for any age is heavy so need the hair to support it but also a cute clip for cutains</li>
            <li> If I could hug every person who works on this hair clip, I would! These are not only beautiful and cheap but they are heavy-duty!! They are not cheap plastic pieces! I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy up as many as I can so I can give these away as gifts!</li>
            <li> I just got this today. The color is brilliant and its nicely made. I will enjoy wearing this piece â˜º</li>
            <li> was very much larger than expected and heavier. I thought it would be a rinky dinky hair clip, and the color was astonishing.</li>
            <li> This clip is very sparkly and beautiful.  It is fairly heavy so not good for short thin hair.  I am using mine actually as part of a wreath</li>
            <li> This looks good with jeans and just as good with the little black dress. The workmanship is among the best, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Beautiful for hair, colors are bright. I took it out of my hair and clipped it to my blouse and got a compliment on my beautiful pin! Two-fold use?</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and it was a high quality piece.  Beautiful to say the least my daughter in law was very excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> While I think it is very pretty it almost seems like an antique piece and from a time when women dressed more elegantly than they do today. I&#x27;ve since given it to a senior, elegant friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t tell the recipient what the actual purchase price was and she was amazed of the quality and workmanship of the detail of the air..  She loves the butterfly.</li>
            <li> This vintage hair decor was very, very pretty!  And certainly worth the money!  For me to use, it was a bit too heavy as my hair tends to be thin, but....I ordered it as a gift, and it was well received.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price! It&#x27;s a heavy piece so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a child. However, if you&#x27;re grown and looking for something to fancy up/decorate a french twist, this is the clip for you! It&#x27;s a pretty large clip and I think it&#x27;s best for decoration rather than actually clipping up your hair. Solid metal piece with pretty nice stones/rocks/glass (whatever they are). For under $3.00 you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> So this hairpin actually came in earlier than the estimated delivery date and that was very pleasing. It is so beautiful and has a nice hold on your hair! I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a young lady who loves hair clips. I must say its very pretty in person however two things I personally did not care to much for. The first thing is its heavy as all get out!!! Unless you have very thick hair you might want to pick something else out. I have never seen a hair clip so heavy! The second thing is where the part you slide your hair on to clamp it had a few rough spots where it pulled the hair while putting it on. I actually did not give this to the person I had intended for bc I knew they would not be able to use it comfortable so now its sitting in my drawer waiting for someone who can use it. If your wanting something different and pretty for one night then perhaps you can use this without it pulling your hair down to much however for everyday use etc this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> None of the photos, seller&#x27;s or customers&#x27;, do it justice.  It is so shiny!  The little gems reflect so much light.  The bodies are made of an iridescent type.  So pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit timely getting here, but it was shipped almost immediately after I ordered it.  Just has to come a long way.  ;)</li>
            <li> I really love this hairpin. I have fine hair so I use this as decoration when i have my hair pulled up. I&#x27;ve gotten so many nice compliments on it in just the few weeks that i&#x27;ve had it. i will definitely be looking for a few more from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was completely impressed with the look and quality of this piece!! It is quite large and would be best for hair that is long and/or thick. I have medium length thick hair and this clip held my hair for over 10 hours. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful barrette, and is a great value for the price. I really love the turquoise-colored beads. The clip is heavier than any other that I&#x27;ve worn in my hair.  I use this for putting all my hair up in a french twist and just clipping it in back. If you have super-thick hair, you could probably pin up half your hair, but I&#x27;m not able to do that.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip. It is beautiful and appears as shown in the photo. It is a large clip and made of durable product so it is a little on the heavy side. About palm size. If you have fine hair it might be too heavy but for all other hair types it is very attractive.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful! I love it! I&#x27;m giving it as a gift to my sister in law and she is going to love it too! Stunning colors!</li>
            <li> Heavy duty - pretty - I would expect this to cost a great deal more in the states.  I have a similar one that was given me lastChristmas - this is easily as nice.  Shipping was good - arrived a little ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Not an everyday hair clip.  This is a dressy sparkler so more for a night on the town.  Heavy duty it hold all my really thick curly hair with ease</li>
            <li> Extremely heavy, cannot be worn in hair, falls down and pulls hair out. Probably would be good wearing in a wig for a more formal occasion. It&#x27;s very pretty and good  quality.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful piece. I got it for a gift for a friend. I was surprised at the size when it arrived. I was bigger than I expected. It&#x27;s still gorgeous however, and breathtaking when you see it in person.</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE this!!!  So pretty I wear it a lot and got so many complements on it!!!</li>
            <li> this is even more stunning in person. the color is really nice in person and it looks expensive. I get a lot of compliments on it</li>
            <li> made very well heavy metal holds long hair great</li>
            <li> A very pretty clip that works great.</li>
            <li> I find Chinese creativity to be exceptional and this hair clip is no exception to that.  It is very inexpensive of course but does not look in the least bit cheap.  It is as it named Lovely!</li>
            <li> This clip is beautiful! The picture doesn&#x27;t do the color justice. It&#x27;s a beautiful teal blue and the crystals are so sparkly. I can&#x27;t believe I got this for such a great price. It holds my long hair well too. It did take a few weeks to be delivered, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Very pretty hairpin. Quality is excellent. Price is affordable. Used it many times and still in tact. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> These are really big folks.  I might decorate my jewelry box with them, but I&#x27;m not the type to put such a big item in my hair.  But they are pretty!</li>
            <li> this hair clip is very pretty and BIG.  I would only recommend it for long hair because its so heavy and will slide out of short or thin hair. All in all, worth the price and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This butterfly hair clip is very pretty, I thought it was going to be a barrette, but it is a clip.  It is way too big and heavy.</li>
            <li> Super cute hairpin. Lovely color and jewels are intact. Has not broken at this point. A very pretty piece of hair jewelry! Love it!</li>
            <li> This hair clip is beautiful and very well made.  I was impressed when I received it! and for the price, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This clip is even better than the picture! The picture doesn&#x27;t capture the lovely sparkle. It is very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also incredibly sturdy, but it is heavy. That was actually my first thought after noticing how pretty it was. I don&#x27;t think I could use it horizontally to hold say a pony tail, but with it it took all of 5 seconds to put my hair into a fantastic french twist - no extra pins needed. I&#x27;m shaking my head around, and it&#x27;s still staying put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beautiful accent and accessory.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this gift and was going to send me $20 to order one for my sister-in-law. I had to break it to her that it cost less then $5 which is why we got her multiple designs and colors for x-mas this year. She loves it</li>
            <li> When this hairpins only come I was happy, because it looks gorgeous. But when I put it on my hair it just fall down. This hair stick does not work properly, it does not keep on my hair.</li>
            <li> The Pin is Huge and Heavy great Quality for the Price....I thought it would be Small/Medium size,I was going to use it for a Side Twist,but it&#x27;s Too Big LOL....It would work Great in a Updo or a French Twist....It&#x27;s a very Elegant hair pin,the picture does Not do it justice...</li>
            <li> I got this for my granddaughter, and my daughter said it is so beautiful that I decided to order another one as a gift.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Unusual little hair decoration but well liked.  We have to figure out just how we can put them to best use.  Again, long time arriving.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved the hairpins.  She wears them all the time.  She has really heavy, coarse hair and they work great.</li>
            <li> Great price for a beautiful, quality item.</li>
            <li> This is even more beautiful in person and looks like an expensive item. I was worried about the weight but when I received it, it&#x27;s not too heavy to put in an updo</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair fork &amp; a fantastic price.  It is very dressy, but such pretty colors, I couldn&#x27;t resist. I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> So worth the $2 I paid for this (with free shipping!), even though one of the larger stones had fallen off on arrival.  No problem to fix it with some rubber cement.  I have gotten many compliments on this clip when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This piece is absolutely gorgeous.  I&#x27;ve worn it since receiving it and had many, many compliments on it.  The color is very vivid, perhaps even more so than shown in the picture here.  The clip is heavy, but it works well in my hair which is thick and long.  As well, I received the item in the mail much sooner than the earliest estimated delivery date.  You won&#x27;t find a more beautiful ornament to dress up your hair for this price, so don&#x27;t hesitate for a moment to order one for yourself!</li>
            <li> Pictures do not do this justice. This is absolutely beautiful. I figured it would be like something from Wal-Mart but it is definitely NOT. This is a very well made product. It is heavy but stays put very well. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This strong and beautiful and can go with many colors.</li>
            <li> So gorgeous! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
            <li> This hair ornament is absolutely beautiful in person.&lt;br /&gt;You can not beat the price for the workmanship.&lt;br /&gt;It is best for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> its a beautiful piece. its large and fits comfy in my hair. the color is beautiful and holds my long hair in place.</li>
            <li> Gem fell off immediately but glued it on, no problems</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made</li>
            <li> Got tons of compliments. Large and strong enough to hold my thick medium length hair in a bun.</li>
            <li> Beautiful...a little heavier than i thought. It was given as a gift and my friend loved it.</li>
            <li> Amazing materials pack a beautiful sparkle. Be careful of the metal, though heavy it is not exactly sturdy. Could it have lead as a major component?  Over all the quality for price is amazing.. so amazing I felt rather bad about its source and can&#x27;t help but wonder how something so prettily crafted can be offered so inexpensively.  I paid less than what it would cost me to mail a letter to China. It took about a month to arrive, but no complaints. Just concerns about what sort of labor and materials are being used.</li>
            <li> This piece is very big. But the stones are gorgeous. I love this piece and will order more. Shipped slow but considering where it shipped from, it was worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li> These beautiful crystal butterfly bowknot hairpins met and exceeded my expectations. They are beautiful, sturdy and I can&#x27;t wait to give them to my Daughter who loves butterflies for Christmas... :) get these for the money you can&#x27;t go wrong and when you open the package you will be stunned at how truly lovely they are!!!</li>
            <li> OMG IT WAS SO PRETTY! I was blown away with how great it looked got to say it made the prefect little gift for Christmas:)</li>
            <li> it arrived really fast and its so unbelievably beautiful!! it all came in one piece and  looks just like the picture and is about the size of my palm.</li>
            <li> I simply love this clip I wear it daily and get many complements. You just have to be patient because it takes about a month for shipping.</li>
            <li> Beautiful--a Lovely Christmas Gift.  Now, I&#x27;ll have to order one for myself...really a good value, quality purchase for any woman with a head of hair--YouTube has videos for &amp;#34;Easy Updos&amp;#34; that help in using these big clips</li>
            <li> It came sooner the expected.  It is very cute and stays in my hair without the use of bobbie pins.  My hair is thick and very long, a little past my waist.  I put my hair in a ponytail then twist it into a bun.  I use the butterfly clip to hold the ends on the side of the bun.  I had many compliments on it. I highly recommend buying this clip.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it looked pretty and i love hair clips . the picture does nothing for it it is sooo pretty .it looks like you spent alot of money on it . It&#x27;s made good every time i ware it out to dinner or to the store everybody will tell me they love my hair clip where did i get it at i say Amazon for 3 dollars . Its the best hair clip i ever had it holds up my hair great and i go threw the hair clips because i can&#x27;t find one that holds up my hair but this is the first one . I will be buying more of these they are the best clip ever. if you love to put your hair in a bun this clip holds it better the any other clip i tried. WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Looks like real turquoise and isn&#x27;t heavy while sporting this Jewelry for your hair. Quite attractive, and always receiving lovely compliments. Attractive, subtle beauty &amp; very functional. In hair, clipping a scarf or decorating your purse...</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  So pretty my granddaughter absconded with it!</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this pin to all who admire butterflies like myself. The size and gem setting are perfect...love it</li>
            <li> These lovely, eye catching hairpins hold in thin, fine hair nicely.  They can be worn for all ages - from 10 years old to 110!</li>
            <li> a very nice item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is  for a friend and it worked in her hair very nice.</li>
            <li> I got this in blue and it is far higher quality than I expected. I wear it on the side of a top bun and it is a statement without being HUGE. not too heavy and the clasp is firm. VERY pleased with the detail and tone.</li>
            <li> Turned out a lot bigger than I expected, but my mother loves it...actually holds up all her hair. Very beautiful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very nice and beautiful. Heavier than thought would be and&lt;br /&gt;hes only two clips to hold in hair. Easily fell out of hair.</li>
            <li> The colour is gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;The clip is strong and holds my thick hair securely.  Great deal arrived within estimated dates</li>
            <li> I really like this item. Beautiful and it is large enough to fit a lot of hair too. Thank you x</li>
            <li> The item was beautiful, excellent gift, recieved within designated time. Very pleased, i will be using this site again and the details on the item made it a hit with the girls.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this hair decoration. Looks beautiful on her long, auburn hair. Made well and elegant for that fancy date.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous. Looks best in dark brown or black hair. I get so many compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> These are a beautiful hair ornament that looks expensive but only costs a few dollars.  Unbelievable quality and beauty.  If I bought this in the US, it would cost much more, but because they come from overseas they are priced very cheap.  The only drawback is that it takes a few weeks for delivery, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It really is like the picture I like it it a little bit heavy but ot ok.. and the price is good to :)</li>
            <li> I must have really loved this hair clip...I ordered two of them!  Lol. It is very pretty though but somewhat heavy.  Wish it was lighter made.</li>
            <li> Beautiful head piece.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and nice pin for a nice price.  The colors matches the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a big pin (around 4 inches long)!  But I use for other uses than a hair pin; it decorates my purse, can use as scarf pin even a tie back for a light, lacey curtain.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait, very detailed and not a stone missing.  The price is right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and looks great. It took a long time to get here, but I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments when I wear this. It is absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but it is very heavy I imagine if one had fine or thin hair this would not work well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they can sell these at these prices, they are just so feminine and beautiful. My hair is way too short to wear one, but I bought several for gifts. They are so pretty in long hair. I am thinking I can make one of these into a necklace for myself. Or if you had a really special gift, just picture one of these on the bow!!  Just gave myself another great idea!</li>
            <li> Very nice, I love it.</li>
            <li> Way larger than I expected! Gorgeous! One stone popped off in shipping but I just superglued it back on easily. When it arrived, seeing how big and sturdy it is I thought for sure it would fall out or pull my hair. NO IT DIDNT! It stays in place well, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on even though it is in my hand, and is gorgeous! This has a classy look when you place it and pumps up your look. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT THE COLOR IS GREAT.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom and she loved it.  Looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> Too heavy, doesn&#x27;t tell customers what size and weight on their ad.</li>
            <li> This clip is very pretty in person! &#x3D;)  It has great color &amp; it hold really well.</li>
            <li> love this hair piece.  It was a gift to a friend who loved it as well.</li>
            <li> The hair pin is of a good quality, doesn&#x27;t slip, and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is SO pretty, and well made...BUT it is so darn heavy, that you have to have super thick hair to hold it up.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip.  Vibrant colors!</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, but a bit larger then I expected.  It is great for when I twist my hair up.</li>
            <li> Beautiful workmanship. Incredible value. Takes a while to get here of course but who cares, it&#x27;s worth it. Good job.</li>
            <li> I got this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She actually uses it often. Its heavier than I imagined but cute.</li>
            <li> these are the best hair clips I own, i loved them so much i ordered one in every color. this is a fantastic item for the price. they are very beautiful and sturdy. If you can hang on for the verrrrrry long shipping time. for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry. if you are thinking of them for gifts, they are super nice in that the jewels are good quality and well set and the clip parts are quite sturdy suitable for long hair. but order early if this is for an event or gift. it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course. I wear these every day and am complemented on them constantly. if your not in a hurry I say buy.</li>
            <li> Sold as barrette, but it is really too big for that.  My daughter (grown) wears it&lt;br /&gt;as pin on a jacket.  VERY NICE for that.</li>
            <li> i love butterflies and this piece is gorgeous in every way!  It took me forever to get it but it was soooo worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expected that this hair clip soooo beautiful , even more beautiful than on picture . For such price to got this it unbelievable thing!</li>
            <li> This hair clip is absolutely the most beautiful hair clip I have ever gotten. This was a mothers day gift from my children and a wonderful surprise.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Bought for my daughter who loves butterflies and hair accessories, so this was perfect. Only issue is one stone on one wing was very crooked and had to be popped off and re glued.</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit long to arrived but it arrived. It is as it shows in the picture and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wore this hair piece out shopping, got a lot of ( what a beautiful hair piece ) compliments.</li>
            <li> liked but was bit heavy for light fine hair</li>
            <li> Very pretty piece! It is a little larger than I would have liked, but so pretty it doesn&#x27;t matter. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this hairpin! It&#x27;s a little heavy, but other than that, I love it. I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I was nervous given the cheap price of this clip, but this is gorgeous.  I wear it regularly in my daily hair updos and/or even with messy buns.  I think the blue is more vibrant in real life.  I hope this helps; enjoy!</li>
            <li> This butterfly clip is gorgeous in person! The photo does not do it justice. You really can&#x27;t beat this price either.</li>
            <li> These are so very beautiful.  The color is bright and vibrant.  This is heavy so if you have thin hair you may want to use another way to secure it to your hair, rather than relying on it to hold itself.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty but please note that it is HUGE!  I do not recall if the measurements were in the product description but I can tell you it is about 4&amp;#34; across and 2 1/2 high.  I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and it is way to big for her head.  Would be more for a teenager or someone older.</li>
            <li> Huge, but pretty. Will work well in my really long hair.</li>
            <li> This clip is amazing. The crystals sparkle like nothing i have ever seen and the stones look like jade. It&#x27;s also very large and certainly stands out. I feel like a million dollar movie star whenever I wear it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lovely on - have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  It is very luminous.  The color is hot.  My dauthers loves it.  They look very good.</li>
            <li> This barrette is beautiful, but it is so heavy that is falls right out of my hair.  I cannot wear it.  Again, no invoice so I cannot return it.  Another waste of money.</li>
            <li> You will definitely need a rubber band under this to hold it up.  I suggest a low pony or half pony and then put the clip just above it.  Otherwise, the weight of it will make it slide right out of your hair.  I actually used this to clip to the shoulder of a black dress for an event and got a LOT of compliments on it.  It looks stunning but is hard to keep in your hair.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very elegent and beautiful. The color is rich, and looks very expensive. You have to buy this!</li>
            <li> This clip is absolutely beautiful. It takes about two weeks to ship - pretty sure it comes from China. But the quality is outstanding. It also definitely has a vintage feel. I highly recommend, especially for the price! I like it so much, I&#x27;m going to see if the same company offers any different designs... after I type this review :-)</li>
            <li> I bought it from Goods-cool for about $3 with free shipping.  Shipping is as expected (30ish days) from China.  It is heavy because it is made out of metal.  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, don&#x27;t expect this clip to hold.  It is very pretty in person.  I will be returning to buy more hair clips from Goods-cool.</li>
            <li> This clip came a little bit over the estimated time but it is very cute and sturdy. It is not cheap looking either. It looks like a lot of work went into it.</li>
            <li> This clip is even more beautiful in person. It&#x27;s bigger than I expected. Will work great pulling your hair up.</li>
            <li> the stone colors are bright and the hairpin stick perfectly in my hair which is usually not the case with other pins</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful head piece, but its so heavy, I haven&#x27;t really found the right outfit that will work with it but the colors are brighter than the picture.</li>
            <li> This clip is heavy - definitely not for the weak necked or those with thin hair. My hair is extraordinarily thick, and this clip will hold about half of it up securely without any assistance from bobby pins or hair bands - definitely a first for me. If there were 10 colors, I would buy all 10. Doesn&#x27;t appear cheaply made, and I always receive multiple compliments when I wear it out.</li>
            <li> Good quality and very pretty.  The colors are very vibrant.  Considering how well this is made I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> So very pretty and bigger than I thought. It did not take as long as I was told. Love it.</li>
            <li> This piece of jewelry for hair is well made, solid and beautiful.  I really could not believe I got such a great sturdy clip for the low price.  Lucky me!</li>
            <li> The shipping for this item took forever, however it was earlier than the month expected. The wait was well worth it though. I love to wear this clip and always get compliments on it. It is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair piece. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap. It&#x27;s fairly large - the size of my palm. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> beautiful color well made looks expensive, but is heavy, very heavy. service took long but I know china is a far country</li>
            <li> Beautiful, sturdy, quality looking.  (Though plastic center beads.)  The clip is strong and held up my thin hair for a long time without moving or feeling insecure.  Very pleased.  Good bargain.  It makes me want to put my hair up all the time and look for excuses to wear it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, and she loved it. Brownie Points! Delivery time was excellent and the hair clip is beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy hairpiece.  I love the look of it - but it&#x27;s VERY heavy.  If you have fine hair, or thin hair - it might not stay as well as you&#x27;d hope.  That said, it does stay.  The clip spring is very tight, and if you get it in right it WILL stay - but the issue is getting it to clip onto enough hair to stay.  And it&#x27;s HEAVY.  If you&#x27;re prone to headaches from tight ponytails, this will do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s beautiful and I love it!  And I actually like that it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely hair piece.. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is a bit bulky and heavy.  The clip looks beautiful though.  Just be aware that this clip is not light weight, but for the cost it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> very pretty, looks great in hair, made nice, not missing any stones, really like it. the right size for my long hair.</li>
            <li> For the price of this piece I was so worried I would get a cheap looking or broken item BUTT when I opened the package I was stunned. this looks much more expensive than it really is. It is a little oversized and would look great on thick healthy long hair as it is slightly heavy for thin hair. But the colors are mesmerizing.&lt;br /&gt;Getting more of these for my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this beautiful butterfly hairpin.  Picture doesn&#x27;t really even show an accurate description of this item.  It is much larger than expected, but absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I really like this but it&#x27;s just too heavy for my hair. It seems pretty durable and well made though. If you have thicker hair, go for it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend, not sure if it met any standards. But is beautiful and impressive looking.</li>
            <li> Pics don&#x27;t do this piece justice. It really sparkles and is so gorgeous. I get stopped everytime I wear it.</li>
            <li> So shiney and pretty. I bought off many sellers but this one is one of the better ones. It does take a long time so order a month or 2 ahead of time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this piece, because of the price. Boy was I blown away! It is beautiful and has the look of a quality piece. Definitely ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love the butterfly clip. I love the color blue, too. This will look so beautiful in my hair when I go to beautiful events.</li>
            <li> I purchased this beautiful hair pin as a gift for my daughter.  She will love the design and color of the stones!  Just beautiful!</li>
            <li> It was much bigger than I thought it would be. I don&#x27;t recall if there are measurements listed but it was a good 4&amp;#34; or so. Looks great in my hair.</li>
            <li> Item was defective. One of the big blue beads were missing, but I received the credit as soon as I reported the problem.</li>
            <li> These butterflies are just as beautiful in person as they are in the picture</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li> Came pretty quickly considering it is coming from Hong Kong, but the piece is solid and pretty. Gave as a gift and it was instantly loved. Came with all stones intact and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It takes some time for this to come in the mail, but the shipping estimate alerted me to this and it arrived within the time frame given. The clip is absolutely stunning. It&#x27;s 4.5&amp;#34; long, so it a little heavy, but evenly distributed along the clip. The clip is comfortable and does not pull my hair like some clips do.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so amazingly lovely!  Very elegant and of a heavy metal.  It is a clamp type (similar to a ficcare) but it has little teeth inside to help grip your hair more.  I&#x27;m not sure if very fine hair would hold it, but my hair is medium to thick and curly and holds it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take about a month or so to get.  I will be ordering more from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> This is really beautiful and arrived in perfect condition.  Yes, it is large (check the dimensions before you order).  I like to clip it in next to a bun.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and the shipping was really fast.  I Love it so much.  It will match a lot of things.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, love it, but it is only for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Wow  truly a beautiful PC  it was larger than i expected but thats great.  It was a wonderful surpise and would of cost a lot in retail store.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do this item justice.  I love the colors in this - turquoise, blue and greens.  It holds hair EXTREMELY well and its easy to use. Awesome item.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because we were heading to the beach for a week. Thought I could use it to pin-up my damp hair and look a little better than a skinned back ponytail. I ended up using it after my hair was styled on nights when we went out to dinner. The clip hinge is nice and strong and the rhinestones sparkle very nicely. I&#x27;m looking into buying additional ones for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip. It perfect. Its a bit heavy so you need a lot of hair for it. Its a bit bigger than I thought it would be but im totally fine with than</li>
            <li> Got these for my 5 year old granddaughter. She loves them and wants to wear them daily. Good quality also</li>
            <li> This pin hairpin is very pretty and nicely made. It is a tad heavy when on my hair, but it is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The price is good. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on this purchase. It is so beautiful, it is very well made and is still as pretty as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is my mistake for not reading the product description closely enough, but this clip was way larger than I had anticipated. I was actually buying it for a child to wear so it was quite a bit bigger than I preferred. It&#x27;s nicely made and looks like it does in the photo, just way bigger than most hair clips I see at the store.</li>
            <li> Too big and heavy to use in my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger and heavier than I had expected. .bit it was very beautiful</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so pretty. The details are wonderful. It did take a very long time for it to arrive, but that made it a nice surprise since I had forgotten about it. It is very heavy, so if you dont have thick hair you may have trouble gettin it to stay in place. If your hair is thick, long, and curly like mine you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous. It is not made out of plastic junk.Holds well.I don&#x27;t know why it is so cheap.Either stores at the mall are rip offs or these are made at a sweat shop.</li>
            <li> Product is large and HEAVY.  Probably my fault for not reading the deminsions better. If u have shorter or thin hair, this product is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> The photo didn&#x27;t do clip justice.  It&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li> Looks great in my alter room</li>
            <li> Loved it. It&#x27;s heavy though</li>
            <li> Love this piece. I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Amazing piece. I love it.</li>
            <li> Was gift and the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Got it for my five year old. It&#x27;s pretty heavy. The jewels aren&#x27;t real, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be. I paid under $3 for it, so for the price, it was well worth it and fun for my daughter.</li>
            <li> VERY PRETTY AND I LOVE BUTTERFLIESIT IS A LITTLE BIGGER  THAN I THOUGHT BUT IT IS OK AAND GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> its sooo prettyyyy!!! definitely worth the money. I thought it would look cheap buttt its really nice. 5 out of 5. :) would buy again /recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> the picture does not do it justice.  It is made well and very beautiful.  I held up my long blond hair for 10 hours befour it started to sag.  very impress with this clip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good size clip - looks best if you have a bun or pony tail and put it at the base of where the hair is gathered.  Really good quality and fast shipping.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great item. Great price. Product is as advertised. Arrived promptly!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair clip but the hair comes off on one side. And it is a little heavy, what I did is I use small clips and then put this one on top covering them and it looks nice, I get compliments when I wear it.  It comes from China so it took a few weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> really pretty. no complaints</li>
            <li> Love that way it looks in my hair and it does hold a lot hair!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, and arrived much faster than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and strong</li>
            <li> It looks bigger than picture but i still like it</li>
