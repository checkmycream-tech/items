            <li>It&#x27;s a great size also.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good conditioner for my hair because almost everything irritates my scalp</li>
            <li>This conditioner has all of the good stuff</li>
            <li>It smells like the good stuff they use on your hair in the salon.</li>
            <li>Good hair mask.</li>

            <li>When I styled it I got so many complements..</li>
            <li>Great high quality product.</li>
            <li>A cheap $2 drugstore conditioner works better.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, after 1 treatment my hair was hydrated and smooth.  </li>

            <li>This is a great deep conditioner..</li>
            <li>Its has a light  scent to it thats not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really fantastic</li>
            <li>The results were fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try</li>
            <li>Makes your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>O think the tub will last me about 10 washings - which is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The big test was how it&#x27;d do over a week or so - I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed because that means there is still a generous amount left for future treatments, perhaps 15+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nicely scented conditiong mask, I use it as a once a week  treatment as I don&#x27;t condition my hair daily</li>
            <li>Honest review for a deep discounted price..</li>
            <li>so my hair didn&#x27;t fully absorbed all the benefits?</li>
            <li>This treatment is great, I live in a humid area and this product helps tame and smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this conditioner and highly recommend it especially for my 3 and 4 ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was rinsing it out I could tell that my hair was so soft and silky, my fingers just so easily glided through my hair.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this was a couple days after doing some highlighting on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Will come back and revise my review if i&#x27;m able to get it to work.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is more of a once a week kind of treatment because it is extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times  on my frizzy hsir and Leaves great results after my hair really soft and manageable to style.</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review</li>
            <li>I think my hair can stand its moisturizing power and this would suit a person perfectly if you have dry, damaged or thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a better product than their previous hair mask.</li>
            <li>It is not thick at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and new.  </li>
            <li>Your hair may have that weighed down feeling if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>, i  use it with its a 10 spray after the shower and leaves hair in a very soft condition, received the product for discounted price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Obviously, simple fix of loosening it first, but just wanted to throw that out there -</li>
            <li>My 3C hair gets super duper dry and frizzy without moisture and loses all curl pattern easily.</li>
            <li>It is not as runny as bottle conditioner, but it&#x27;s not a heavy cream either.</li>
            <li>Hair felt really soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>I am a red head with naturally curly hair which tends to be very dry, then you you add on top of that the flat iron that I use or the hair color dyes to cover up the grays.</li>
            <li>My hair feels stronger but softer, and I must say it really smoothed out my frizz and the fluffiness I get from dry hair.</li>
            <li>Rinsed it out and immediately noticed that the dry parts of my hair (the newly highlighted) were silky soft, not slimy like some conditioners, it rinsed well</li>
            <li>I use a little on my ends as a leave in on the weekdays and do a full deep condition on the weekend..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge amount of product, and thick creamy texture</li>
            <li>and it left my hair feeling extremely soft and manageable, but it did feel somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li>I have washed my hair a couple of times since using this hair mask, and I still haven&#x27;t been able to remove all of the buildup and residue that it left behind.  </li>
            <li>got this and immediately thought it was much thinner than my average conditioner.</li>

            <li> got this and immediately thought it was much thinner than my average conditioner.</li>
            <li> It may be because I didn&#x27;t keep it in my hair long enough (~10 mins)</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry, flat, and frizzy, all at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I have not been using it that long...</li>
            <li> I actually think I am going to have to use less conditioner the next time I shower.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry from coloring it every month..</li>
            <li> I figured it would be dry by the time I unwrapped my hair to wash it out, but my hair was still drenched with moisture.</li>
            <li> and it would still not be greasy, so very very dry.</li>
            <li> Hair has been a bit frizzy due to hard water at my new home.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely use this again because after three uses, it did not irritate my scalp when usually that happens with only one use of other products that do irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> My ends were definitely looking a little ragged.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair a few times and the last time I did it, my hair got severely damaged.</li>
            <li> A little hoes a long way...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how else they&#x27;d package without wasting product, but it&#x27;s really hard to open with wet hands in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I use it about every other day, sometimes less, as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is absolutely not worth $20.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a liter of conditioner at a time and condition my hair twice with showers just because my dry hair soaks it all up.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and use a lot of thick conditioner on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a treatment that requires less time.</li>
            <li> I figured I would need half of the jar.</li>
            <li> I may have got a fake or perhaps the company was sold off and the new company is making it differently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (especially if you&#x27;re like me - auburn, thick, curly/wavy, course hair)!</li>
            <li> My hair is well past my shoulders, thick and on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I have long thick oily type hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After getting out of the shower, I realized EVERY time that my hair was very tangled and impossible to comb through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Instead, it coats you hair, weighs it down, flattens it, and makes your hair feel thin and stringy.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is a total disappointment.  </li>
            <li> While I appreciate the ingredients it contains, it&#x27;s simply not an effective product.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and get a thick conditioner.</li>
            <li> I do have thick hairs so that may be the reason.</li>
            <li> Works well, but like some of the other reviewers said, I&#x27;m not thrilled with the smell, not that it&#x27;s bad, because it&#x27;s not, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as yummy as some of the other products I use.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this hair mask reminds me of being in the salon when the stylist puts all sorts of yummy, expensive smelling potions on my hair that is always too expensive to bring back home with me</li>
            <li> So, I was shocked when I received this hair mask to test and review, that I only needed a dollop.</li>
            <li> I do have thin, curly hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find the time for a 20+ minute hair treatment.</li>
            <li> That is how awful this was for me.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for a good conditioner for my hair because almost everything irritates my scalp so I decided to try this out and it left my hair feeling extremely soft and manageable, but it did feel somewhat greasy. I do have thin, curly hair so I expect some things to leave my hair greasy. I will definitely use this again because after three uses, it did not irritate my scalp when usually that happens with only one use of other products that do irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> This treatment is great, I live in a humid area and this product helps tame and smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> My 3C hair gets super duper dry and frizzy without moisture and loses all curl pattern easily. This conditioner has all of the good stuff I like putting in my hair so I was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a tub. It is not as runny as bottle conditioner, but it&#x27;s not a heavy cream either. It is is light cream so you don&#x27;t have to worry about weighing your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t describe the fragrance, but it&#x27;s real nice. It smells like the good stuff they use on your hair in the salon. I like it A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saturated my curls with it left it on my hair for an hour, then co-washed with it. I have shoulder-length hair and doing this method O think the tub will last me about 10 washings - which is pretty good. I found that it didn&#x27;t take gobs of this stuff to penetrate my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this conditioner and highly recommend it especially for my 3 and 4 ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair nice and soft. It&#x27;s a great size also. Feels and smells wonderful on your hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, but like some of the other reviewers said, I&#x27;m not thrilled with the smell, not that it&#x27;s bad, because it&#x27;s not, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as yummy as some of the other products I use.</li>
            <li> Wow!  The first time I used this was a couple days after doing some highlighting on my hair.  My ends were definitely looking a little ragged.  I used this as the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;, first - it feels so good on my hair!  Rinsed it out and immediately noticed that the dry parts of my hair (the newly highlighted) were silky soft, not slimy like some conditioners, it rinsed well but my hair still felt nourished. The big test was how it&#x27;d do over a week or so - I&#x27;m in love!  Not only did it make my hair manageable and frizz-free during the day, I&#x27;m not seeing the split ends like I did before using this.  I use it about every other day, sometimes less, as a conditioner.  A &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; once a week. The only thing that is a bummer is the packaging. It&#x27;s a huge amount of product, and thick creamy texture so I don&#x27;t know how else they&#x27;d package without wasting product, but it&#x27;s really hard to open with wet hands in the shower.  Obviously, simple fix of loosening it first, but just wanted to throw that out there - that&#x27;s no reason not to try this though - it&#x27;s a must have (especially if you&#x27;re like me - auburn, thick, curly/wavy, course hair)!</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  Hair felt really soft after using it.  Better if you use it more often.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, hair feels amazing a bit frizzy still but overall great conditioner, i  use it with its a 10 spray after the shower and leaves hair in a very soft condition, received the product for discounted price for my unbiased opinion. Also nice size bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair bouncy and looking healthy. Love this hair mask</li>
            <li> This is a nicely scented conditiong mask, I use it as a once a week  treatment as I don&#x27;t condition my hair daily and this is a wonderful recovery for after color or hi-lites. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I&#x27;ve used about everything out there.</li>
            <li> Nope. I have never used a hair mask and I was excited to try something new. I have long, thick hair and use a lot of thick conditioner on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this and immediately thought it was much thinner than my average conditioner. It is not thick at all. I tried it five times. I put it on in the shower using quite a bit of product. I then shaved which gave it about 5-10 minutes on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting out of the shower, I realized EVERY time that my hair was very tangled and impossible to comb through. I&#x27;m not even going to use the rest of this. That is how awful this was for me. From the reviews, I&#x27;m guessing the actual product is great. I may have got a fake or perhaps the company was sold off and the new company is making it differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely not worth $20. Save your money and get a thick conditioner. It is loads better.</li>
            <li> Good hair mask. I use it weekly to condition my hair. It is a better product than their previous hair mask.</li>
            <li> Helps restore dryness to hair but if use too often it does make it oily.</li>
            <li> Great high quality product. I&#x27;ve used it a few times  on my frizzy hsir and Leaves great results after my hair really soft and manageable to style.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry from coloring it every month.. this one is my life saver..got this at discounted price</li>
            <li> Hydrating mask that helps repair split ends.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.</li>
            <li> Honest review for a deep discounted price..This is a great deep conditioner..I use a little on my ends as a leave in on the weekdays and do a full deep condition on the weekend..I feel my hair is fuller and stronger with use of this product. Its has a light  scent to it thats not overpowering.I recommend this conditioner..A little hoes a long way...Very Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I feel so biased when I review Instanatural products, but they are that good.  Hair has been a bit frizzy due to hard water at my new home.  I cut it thinking it would make a difference, but things didn&#x27;t get dramatically different until I started using this hair mask.  I have not been using it that long...about a week and it is awesome!  My hair is shiny and new.  It looks healthy and shiny.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure on the results of the product as I&#x27;ve only used it once.  It seemed to work fine and my hair did seem more manageable while styling.  It&#x27;s difficult to find the time for a 20+ minute hair treatment. I will be looking for a treatment that requires less time.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a liter of conditioner at a time and condition my hair twice with showers just because my dry hair soaks it all up. So, I was shocked when I received this hair mask to test and review, that I only needed a dollop. I figured I would need half of the jar. My hair is well past my shoulders, thick and on the dry side. I&#x27;m pretty impressed because that means there is still a generous amount left for future treatments, perhaps 15+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The fragrance of this hair mask reminds me of being in the salon when the stylist puts all sorts of yummy, expensive smelling potions on my hair that is always too expensive to bring back home with me (I can find it cheaper online!). It&#x27;s a really fantastic fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Here&#x27;s what I did for the treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1) I shampooed my hair twice with a sulphate-free shampoo (I needed it).&lt;br /&gt;  2) I rubbed the mask between my palms and spread it through my damp hair from tips to roots (I did it backwards from the  directions because my hair is drier on the ends).&lt;br /&gt;  3) I combed the mask through my hair and wrapped a towel around it for about 20 minutes. I figured it would be dry by the time I unwrapped my hair to wash it out, but my hair was still drenched with moisture. Impressed once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I rinsed my hair thoroughly, but this is the kind of conditioning that stays. My hair felt truly moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The results were fantastic for me. My hair feels stronger but softer, and I must say it really smoothed out my frizz and the fluffiness I get from dry hair. I actually think I am going to have to use less conditioner the next time I shower. Overall, I think this is more of a once a week kind of treatment because it is extremely moisturizing. I think my hair can stand its moisturizing power and this would suit a person perfectly if you have dry, damaged or thick hair.  Your hair may have that weighed down feeling if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a total disappointment.  It is not moisturizing at all.  Instead, it coats you hair, weighs it down, flattens it, and makes your hair feel thin and stringy.  It made my hair dry, flat, and frizzy, all at the same time.  I have washed my hair a couple of times since using this hair mask, and I still haven&#x27;t been able to remove all of the buildup and residue that it left behind.  A cheap $2 drugstore conditioner works better.  While I appreciate the ingredients it contains, it&#x27;s simply not an effective product.  I cannot recommend it for any hair type.</li>
            <li> I have long thick oily type hair! I&#x27;ve dyed my hair a few times and the last time I did it, my hair got severely damaged. I was hoping this product can help with the recovery process but it didn&#x27;t seem to work that well for me. It may be because I didn&#x27;t keep it in my hair long enough (~10 mins) so my hair didn&#x27;t fully absorbed all the benefits? I&#x27;m not sure. I do have thick hairs so that may be the reason. I will try again next week and maybe keep it on for 20 mins to see if anything changed. Will come back and revise my review if i&#x27;m able to get it to work.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, after 1 treatment my hair was hydrated and smooth.  Does not contain formaldehyde.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily ..</li>
            <li> I am a red head with naturally curly hair which tends to be very dry, then you you add on top of that the flat iron that I use or the hair color dyes to cover up the grays. I literally can wash my hair once a week and it would still not be greasy, so very very dry. So when I got this in the mail I did a mask treatment, I actually left it in my hair for an hour with a shower cap over it. When I was rinsing it out I could tell that my hair was so soft and silky, my fingers just so easily glided through my hair. When I styled it I got so many complements.. For me this is a keeper..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review</li>
