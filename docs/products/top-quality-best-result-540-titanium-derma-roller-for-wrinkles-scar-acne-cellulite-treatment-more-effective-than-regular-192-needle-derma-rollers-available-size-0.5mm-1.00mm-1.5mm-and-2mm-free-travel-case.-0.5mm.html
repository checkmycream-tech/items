            <li>It does mildly hurt, feels like exactly what it is, tiny needles poking you and afterward feels and looks like you have a mild sunburn.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it has done 100%, but I can say that I am comfortable enough to be around other people with no makeup on.</li>
            <li>In some cases, it would take a few days for it to take affect, after some peeling and dry skin, I can&#x27;t help but touch my face and feel free from the burden of acne and scars alike!</li>
            <li>The derma roller(0.5mm) was nicely packed and was delivered in time.&lt;br /&gt;The needles did look scary</li>
            <li>Its fun to do and doesn&#x27;t  hurt, just leaves the skin a little blushy red.  </li>
            <li>Only used the facial &amp; around the eyes so far &amp; not the body one.</li>

            <li> Thank u so much I had stretch marks for 3 yrs I tried emu oil tca peels laser rosehip oil morrocan oil nothing happened but this literally got rid of my marks thought it was a scam I still can&#x27;t believe there gone I lift my shirt up sometimes in disbelief lol it also got rid of those oil filled blkheads</li>
            <li> I am so glad to see the result. I have had stretch mark for half my life. After using the derma roller, I noticed the stretch mark was definitely change for better. I applied Vitamin C serum together. That would help a lot. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> I ordered.5mm. I been using this for two weeksthink its good I don&#x27;t feel any pain.&lt;br /&gt;You just need to roll it gently not make yourself bleed.&lt;br /&gt;I roll it on and under my eyes. I got hyperpigmentaion after a chemical peel, hoping that derma roller help me fade this. Before rolling I wipe all my makeup and wash my face with a cetaphil face wash. After that I put hydroceles serum and brightening masque by Eminence.&lt;br /&gt;I derma roll and sleep with the masque on. I soak my derma roll overnite in medical alcohol. I love this derma roller.</li>
            <li> Used it, Got a little red! Only more use will tell.</li>
            <li> has not reduced any scars but kind of feels good on your face</li>
            <li> I was scared to use this. I mean really, needles on your face? So, I did it gently, very gently ;) At first, my face was a little tingly and red. So afterwards, I put on my Main Line Vitamin C Serum and WOW. After 3 days, my acne scars and pores aren&#x27;t so noticeable. It&#x27;s going to be part of my skin care regimen. Also, I like to use the Derma Rolling Post facial mask after the needle roller.  I alternate between the two.  I am a happy camper!</li>
            <li> I like this derma roller. It is so helpful for my skin  .  My skin looks bright and more firm. Thank you</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do. It&#x27;s not painful. It leaves a bit of irritation immediately afterward. It feels to me like a mild sunburn. That fades quickly if you use a good face cream afterwards. If you do the treatment often it there seems to be less irritation, each time. The results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Amazing results ! After one use I saw i difference in my skin. My mom is going to buy one today ;)</li>
            <li> I received this product last week. The derma roller(0.5mm) was nicely packed and was delivered in time.&lt;br /&gt;The needles did look scary and I was nervous to use this on my face. I followed the sanitizing instructions and used it as I had seen on the you tube videos.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how painless it was. I actually had to press harder to feel the discomfort :D&lt;br /&gt;If you have used epilator ever(which I use on a regular basis, not in my face though) this thing won&#x27;t hurt at all compared to that! However it will sting a bit after you apply the moisturizer or serum. My face had bit of redness for almost 30 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have used it only once and plan to use on a weekly basis I&#x27;m yet to see the results. My skin did feel dry and little itchy (which I attribute to the dryness) so something did happen there :)&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Love it. Only used the facial &amp; around the eyes so far &amp; not the body one. I had to wait &amp; get the topical anesthetic cream first as it was quite uncomfortable without it. Can say now I am beginning to see the changes in my face for the better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it very long and have only used it once.  Its fun to do and doesn&#x27;t  hurt, just leaves the skin a little blushy red.  No overnight miracles - takes some time and patience.  I believe this roller will bring better results than a year&#x27;s worth of expensive skin creams.</li>
            <li> Seemed like it might have produced results eventually, but it squeaked so loudly when I used it that I couldn&#x27;t stand the noise so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to write a review considering I have only been using it for 3 days. My first impressions are 1) It does mildly hurt, feels like exactly what it is, tiny needles poking you and afterward feels and looks like you have a mild sunburn. 2) My skin does appear to be looking better already, very smooth and even skin tone. If you can stand the pain, I believe it is worth trying out!</li>
            <li> watch out I believe these destroy collagen leaving your face sunken and pores damaged</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bought this. This item has saved my skin from YEARS of damage. I can&#x27;t say that it has done 100%, but I can say that I am comfortable enough to be around other people with no makeup on. I paired using this, with a Vitamin E oil to get rid of the scars. When using it over the acne (which has lessened by 90%), it feels a little uncomfortable, but nothing that anyone can handle, when you are done, it feels like a light sunburn. In the morning, my skin felt good as new! In some cases, it would take a few days for it to take affect, after some peeling and dry skin, I can&#x27;t help but touch my face and feel free from the burden of acne and scars alike! It&#x27;s really worth what I paid!</li>
