            <li>I was so excited for this to come.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but I sure this gift will make this little girl happy.</li>
            <li>This was a special notification from Budget Savvy Diva, and I thought....</li>
            <li>just sits in toy room now for its cuteness (only good aspect of it)</li>
            <li>This is adorable but doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Wasted good momey!</li>
            <li>Very cute but does not blow enough air</li>
            <li>Added new batteries to make sure it would workand</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t worth the $3</li>
            <li>It would have cost me more to ship to China than it did for the actual item</li>
            <li>But once I figured it out, thought it was such a cute novelty item.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I do kids nails pretty often.</li>
            <li>it cause it was cute and a monkey.  </li>
            <li>This is cute, I dont think it will really dry nails.</li>
            <li>you would think with that kind of &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; it might blow a little air.  </li>
            <li>I wrote u to tell u your item doesn&#x27;t blow air much how can I send a picture of something like that</li>
            <li>They both look very scratched up.....</li>
            <li>The air does not come out of his mouth like you would think, but she really likes using it</li>
            <li>And it sounds like a jet plane getting ready to take off......</li>
            <li>I highly suggest purchasing anything from their shop!</li>
            <li>Doesnt work very well</li>
            <li>Because I knew what I was possibly getting myself into by ordering an item dirt cheap from out of the country, I&#x27;m not too upset that when this item arrived, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I am thankful I didn&#x27;t spend much</li>
            <li>Drying one nail at at time isn&#x27;t really what I want to do.</li>
            <li>I received my monkey nail dryer in the mail very quickly.</li>
            <li>It’s also very, very, very noisy and you have to hit the button at the right angle to get it to actually work.  </li>
            <li>Even though it came with loose part, which I have no idea where they came from, it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>would not recommend this particular product to anyone looking for anything with power</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute, but tiny and the air it blows out is less than what is in a breath.</li>
            <li>besides the head looks like it can easily pop open....not to happy with them...  :(</li>
            <li>Really, really cute little nail dryer.</li>
            <li>I emailed the niceEshop team and they emailed back right away and sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>First I thought it was going to be bigger.  </li>
            <li>well its also a fun way to dry you nails ^-^</li>
            <li>it is cute but not effective.  </li>
            <li>I got it for a 5 year old</li>
            <li>old grandaughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>lOUD. aND BARELY FEEL ANY AIR COMING OUT.</li>
            <li>i tried all different types of brand new batteries.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would recommend if you really need it to dry your nails.</li>
            <li>I ordered early because it was a Christmas present, but it still arrived after the estimated date given to me by the company.</li>
            <li>I really helps them sit still long enough for the polish to dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very sure how long it takes for it to successfully dry a nail simply because I&#x27;m impatient when I&#x27;m doing my own nails.</li>

            <li> lOUD. aND BARELY FEEL ANY AIR COMING OUT.</li>
            <li> i tried all different types of brand new batteries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would recommend if you really need it to dry your nails.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not very sure how long it takes for it to successfully dry a nail simply because I&#x27;m impatient when I&#x27;m doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> The dryer is not very powerful and makes a loud noise.</li>
            <li> , my daughter still wants to use this every time but just cant get it to work with her little fingers pressing on it, so in turn it ends up being a pain in my butt!</li>
            <li> I did recieve my item pretty late</li>
            <li> And if you waited for each one to dry (with this fan) before you painted the next one, it&#x27;d be a very long and drawn out process.</li>
            <li> Especially when all of the others are still wet.</li>
            <li> I bought this to give to my daughter and granddaughters thinking they could use this to dry their nails.</li>
            <li> Also waiving your nails in the air or blowing on them will dry them faster than the air this puts out.  </li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t work all that well, so don&#x27;t expect this to really dry your nails faster than just letting it air dry</li>
            <li> and it helps keep her entertained while getting her nails dry.</li>
            <li> I got it for my niece for Christmas to blow her nails dry.  </li>
            <li> and her nails would dry faster.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this mainly for my 4 year old for our little nail parties, but the button is too hard for her to push down, so it&#x27;s just decor now.</li>
            <li> It was not working, not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s not powerful enough and when you press the buttons sometimes .</li>
            <li> I was a bit confused at first since it did not come with instructions.  </li>
            <li> Even I, as an adult, have to press really hard</li>
            <li> While there is nothing wrong with the product itself, I&#x27;m just not very sure how useful it is for me personally.</li>
            <li> Be careful what you order &amp; check things out!</li>
            <li> I spent on it!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a fun little present for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, but when it arrived, little bits of the plastic were breaking off, and the actual blower is basically worthless.</li>
            <li> nOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> made of thin plastic,does not &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; enough air to dry.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m thankful to the amazon customer service rep who helped me track this package down.</li>
            <li> they have 3 little things to stand on and on one of mine one is broke off...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> it was just a waste of $2.99</li>
            <li> poor fan location and doesn&#x27;t blow enough.</li>
            <li> waste your money.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves to dry her nails with this!!!!!</li>
            <li> The button is a little hard to press down.  </li>
            <li> This gets one star for being cute but when it came little bits of plastic were broken at the base.</li>
            <li> (if any at all, that is how weak it is) to dry nails!</li>
            <li> The blower hardly blows air</li>
            <li> I mean blowing on it from your mouth from 5 feet away</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.</li>
            <li> it was broken.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I always, always, always read the product reviews when I order on Amazon, but the one time I don’t I end up with a totally useless product.  </li>
            <li> but I was still very, very disappointed in this.  </li>
            <li> We were very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. Really, really cute little nail dryer. It&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I would not buy another one of these. I bought this to give to my daughter and granddaughters thinking they could use this to dry their nails. The blower hardly blows air, that is if you can get it to come on. It doesn&#x27;t always work when you push on the button. Very disappointed in this! It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It probably will end up in the toy box for the grandkids to play with.</li>
            <li> it is cute but not effective.  Even I, as an adult, have to press really hard and i feel like it actually blows at my cuticles and below, my daughter still wants to use this every time but just cant get it to work with her little fingers pressing on it, so in turn it ends up being a pain in my butt!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It came broke,  now what?  I can&#x27;t send it back. Be careful what you order &amp; check things out!</li>
            <li> I always, always, always read the product reviews when I order on Amazon, but the one time I don’t I end up with a totally useless product.  Thank goodness I was only out 8 bucks but I was still very, very disappointed in this.  First I thought it was going to be bigger.  These piece can fit in the palm of your hand.  Also waiving your nails in the air or blowing on them will dry them faster than the air this puts out.  It’s also very, very, very noisy and you have to hit the button at the right angle to get it to actually work.  I contacted the seller to return it but the only return address they had was in China.  It would have cost me more to ship to China than it did for the actual item so I counted it as a loss and threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> This cute monkey nail dryer is awesome. I purchased it for my granddaughter. She loves it! It is perfect for those little princesses who love to do their nails.</li>
            <li> I wrote u to tell u your item doesn&#x27;t blow air much how can I send a picture of something like that it was just a waste of $2.99</li>
            <li> poor fan location and doesn&#x27;t blow enough. just sits in toy room now for its cuteness (only good aspect of it)</li>
            <li> I was a bit confused at first since it did not come with instructions.  But once I figured it out, thought it was such a cute novelty item.  That&#x27;s it. Novelty.  IT doesn&#x27;t work all that well, so don&#x27;t expect this to really dry your nails faster than just letting it air dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this mainly for my 4 year old for our little nail parties, but the button is too hard for her to push down, so it&#x27;s just decor now.</li>
            <li> This is cute, I dont think it will really dry nails. I got it for a 5 year old so she can pretend.  I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 of these...They both look very scratched up.....paint is all messed up....they have 3 little things to stand on and on one of mine one is broke off...besides the head looks like it can easily pop open....not to happy with them...  :(</li>
            <li> Great lil gift from my mother loves it alot&lt;br /&gt;Works well its also a fun way to dry you nails ^-^</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It&#x27;s really cute and works great! It was affordable also. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is adorable but doesn&#x27;t work very well. The dryer is not very powerful and makes a loud noise. It would be good for a child or pre-teen.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 yr. old grandaughter for Christmas.  She really enjoyed it cause it was cute and a monkey.  The button is a little hard to press down.  The air does not come out of his mouth like you would think, but she really likes using it and it helps keep her entertained while getting her nails dry.</li>
            <li> OK....I knew this was going to be a cheapo ok??? I got it for my niece for Christmas to blow her nails dry.  You can&#x27;t feel any air.....I mean blowing on it from your mouth from 5 feet away and her nails would dry faster.  And it sounds like a jet plane getting ready to take off......you would think with that kind of &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; it might blow a little air.  NOPE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  And it took WEEKS to get here.....I ordered early because it was a Christmas present, but it still arrived after the estimated date given to me by the company.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken. It was not working, not worth sending back. We were very disappointed with this product. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this because I do kids nails pretty often. I really helps them sit still long enough for the polish to dry.</li>
            <li> This was a special notification from Budget Savvy Diva, and I thought....oh, why not.  It was $2.99 shipped, and even if it doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m not out anything.  My granddaughter (4) loves to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; her nails, and has her momma, daddy or me paint them all the time.  She LOVES this polish dryer!  She giggles while her nails are getting done.  Great buy, great price!</li>
            <li> made of thin plastic,does not &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; enough air to dry. would not recommend this particular product to anyone looking for anything with power</li>
            <li> I received my monkey nail dryer in the mail very quickly. However when I put the required batteries in several different times it would not work. I emailed the niceEshop team and they emailed back right away and sent me a new one. I highly suggest purchasing anything from their shop!</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s super cute, but tiny and the air it blows out is less than what is in a breath.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a fun little present for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, but when it arrived, little bits of the plastic were breaking off, and the actual blower is basically worthless. Two stars for being cute, but functionally--pointless.</li>
            <li> Very cute ..... My daughter loves to dry her nails with this!!!!! We are painting nails alot !!!!! Love it</li>
            <li> lOUD. aND BARELY FEEL ANY AIR COMING OUT. nOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s not powerful enough and when you press the buttons sometimes . I do not recommend this .</li>
            <li> Doesnt work very well but it looks really cute. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend if you really need it to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> I thought this was absolutely adorable. It is perfect for a little girl who loves to paint their nails. Even though it came with loose part, which I have no idea where they came from, it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this to come. and when i got it, i opened it up and put batteries in and it did not work. i tried all different types of brand new batteries. and it still didnt work. it was broken.</li>
            <li> This gets one star for being cute but when it came little bits of plastic were broken at the base. I put the batteries in and nothing - I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> it cute gift for the neice. Gave it to her for her birthday and she enjoyed. well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Because I knew what I was possibly getting myself into by ordering an item dirt cheap from out of the country, I&#x27;m not too upset that when this item arrived, it didn&#x27;t work. Would have been a nice addition to the nail polish and makeup I got my daughter, but oh well.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my item it wasn&#x27;t what I excepted it to be. But all in all it&#x27;s a cute product. I did recieve my item pretty late but I sure this gift will make this little girl happy. So all in all if she happy with the item so am I. And I&#x27;m thankful to the amazon customer service rep who helped me track this package down.</li>
            <li> Very cute but does not blow enough air (if any at all, that is how weak it is) to dry nails! I am thankful I didn&#x27;t spend much but it wasn&#x27;t worth the $3 I spent on it! I recommend not buying this item unless you are using it for decor not as a nail dryer!</li>
            <li> It looks even cheaper than the picture,  I thought to give it to my niece.  Added new batteries to make sure it would workand it doesnt. Nothing happens. There is no on off switch you have to press the plate in front of the head, it does not work! Wasted good momey!</li>
            <li> While there is nothing wrong with the product itself, I&#x27;m just not very sure how useful it is for me personally. Drying one nail at at time isn&#x27;t really what I want to do. Especially when all of the others are still wet. And if you waited for each one to dry (with this fan) before you painted the next one, it&#x27;d be a very long and drawn out process. I&#x27;m not very sure how long it takes for it to successfully dry a nail simply because I&#x27;m impatient when I&#x27;m doing my own nails. Nevertheless, this is a very adorable product and I&#x27;m sure it does work. I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased about 4 for all my neices and they didnt work. Figures. You get what you pay for!</li>
