            <li>Smells very good and worked really good on my dry skin!</li>
            <li>Love buying this in bulk, saves a trip to the store</li>
            <li>Because of the packaging, this product is a better VALUE to me than a comparable product in a more generously dispensing bottle because it lasts longer and still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this body wash my skin</li>
            <li>Love, love, love Nivea.</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizing effects of this body wash.</li>
            <li>it works great for that too, very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still calming and moisturizing, still one of my top favorites</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Nivea body washes and bath oils.</li>
            <li>I love Nivea body wash.  </li>
            <li>Most retailers around me don&#x27;t carry it.  </li>
            <li>I love this body wash</li>
            <li>I love this brand and scent.</li>
            <li>I found it here at Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are the big size so to get them at this price for three of them is superb.</li>
            <li>Will order more when I run Out.</li>
            <li>Love Nivea body wash.</li>
            <li>I love this bath gel...</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Nice light aroma.</li>

            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Could suds up more.</li>
            <li>Quite pleased with it, also it&#x27;s vegan</li>
            <li>Love Nivia products and this three pack</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent not too over powering but still strong enough to smell after your shower!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay full price for; but, so glad to get it on a great lightning deal</li>
            <li>The wash itself is pretty good-</li>
            <li>Nivea products are perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li>people should be responsible for their own squirting habits and ration their own use of a product, but I have teenagers.</li>
            <li>This wash was not what I expected for scent wise, but I still consider it a good buy for price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like strong scents</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance, good lathering, leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite body wash!</li>
            <li>Body wash is not only a great deal it is a luxurious product.</li>
            <li>They would happily dump the entire bottle onto their bath pouf if the squirt hole was two inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>A purchase everyone will enjoy, leaves my skin soft, smooth, and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>I gifted one to a friend who has sensitive skin and she liked it as well and had no issue.</li>
            <li>This provides a smooth clean feeling; not the fanciest smell</li>
            <li>Not as moisture rich as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>, I used to be an avid Dove body wash user, and Nivea I think is so much better.</li>
            <li>Great body wash, lasted a long time, Shea butter can have a waxy smell to me</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in a nursing home and this product makes me feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really shea or vanilla but more musky smelling.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, and does not seem to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>So many body washes have a big squirt hole which encourages overuse so you have to buy more sooner.</li>
            <li>will mention [that] often choose Dove or Caress for the mild fragrance, and foaming quality...</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>Big size bottles very pleased</li>
            <li>You will find a nice, mild, low foam body wash.</li>
            <li>However, I really like that I can purchase Nivea bath/shower products at Amazon.com and sometimes at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it retails for so much more at Target and other big box stores, so this is a great deal from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy this particular scent again but the body wash itself is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I also like the price, and the shipping was right on schedule.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a light scent to remain after you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Good deal for the price but a little to perfumy for me.</li>
            <li>always feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing the whole order out!</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed a difference and vowed to never run out again. :)</li>
            <li>and I will most likely not buy again.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would offer a better deal on the 3-pack of this, which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>This smells great, lathers generously, and has a very small dispensing hole in the bottle.</li>
            <li>like many popular brand body washes, and isn&#x27;t a super thick in overall consistency.</li>
            <li>My skin used to crack it was so dry, and now it is smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough on your skin and very moisturizing, but leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much money</li>
            <li>I wish it was available in a larger container, though.</li>
            <li>Product lasted a while and lathers really well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>Blossom Scent is very soothing and healing for those who suffer from Eczema.  </li>
            <li>It does very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t only clean; it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, no itching or dry skin after shower.</li>
            <li>This is a better than average body wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really bad, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t call it vanilla if I smelled without seeing the label.</li>
            <li>You definately can&#x27;t go wrong if you like smooth skin and a mild scent that&#x27;s not too strong..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this body wash for those who suffer from Eczema.</li>
            <li>I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Nivea body wash usually</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin soft without being oily and the smell of the Shea Butter &amp; Vanilla is heavenly!</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry skin because it has various moisturizers and very little or no alcohol.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon for offering this terrific product.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on how soft my skin is all the time.</li>
            <li>if you stick to bar soap, it&#x27;s time you treat your body and stop depleting your skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>This smells great,plus makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at a local store, however, they have discontinued this particular scent.  </li>
            <li>but this was old smelling and when I received the package it had spilled all over everything and was not packaged properly!</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about Nivea&#x27;s products usually, but Nivea Harmony Body wash is the exception.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin like some other products do.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a light scent to remain after you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Good deal for the price but a little to perfumy for me.</li>
            <li> always feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing the whole order out!</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference and vowed to never run out again. :)</li>
            <li> and I will most likely not buy again.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would offer a better deal on the 3-pack of this, which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> This smells great, lathers generously, and has a very small dispensing hole in the bottle.</li>
            <li> like many popular brand body washes, and isn&#x27;t a super thick in overall consistency.</li>
            <li> My skin used to crack it was so dry, and now it is smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough on your skin and very moisturizing, but leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have much money</li>
            <li> I wish it was available in a larger container, though.</li>
            <li> Product lasted a while and lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> Blossom Scent is very soothing and healing for those who suffer from Eczema.  </li>
            <li> It does very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t only clean; it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> Works fine, no itching or dry skin after shower.</li>
            <li> This is a better than average body wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really bad, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t call it vanilla if I smelled without seeing the label.</li>
            <li> You definately can&#x27;t go wrong if you like smooth skin and a mild scent that&#x27;s not too strong..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this body wash for those who suffer from Eczema.</li>
            <li> I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Nivea body wash usually</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft without being oily and the smell of the Shea Butter &amp; Vanilla is heavenly!</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin because it has various moisturizers and very little or no alcohol.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon for offering this terrific product.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on how soft my skin is all the time.</li>
            <li> if you stick to bar soap, it&#x27;s time you treat your body and stop depleting your skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> This smells great,plus makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it at a local store, however, they have discontinued this particular scent.  </li>
            <li> but this was old smelling and when I received the package it had spilled all over everything and was not packaged properly!</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about Nivea&#x27;s products usually, but Nivea Harmony Body wash is the exception.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin like some other products do.</li>
            <li> so the scent has a slightly floral perfumy quality to it that I would not ordinarily buy.</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture so if there&#x27;s another Gold box deal that would make this item less expensive and there was a non-floral scent I would buy it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or left any residue.  </li>
            <li> Also, it isn&#x27;t super thin when you pour it on a face cloth...</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it lingers long after you step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This works well, but it has a strange yogurt-y smell to it?  </li>
            <li> I expected it to smell differently but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Recommend for people who have dry skin and</li>
            <li> The price only saved me a few cents off of the store price.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin deal with the cold and dry New England winters.</li>
            <li> This bottle has a little squirt hole so you use less and still get lots of lather.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few soaps that moisturizes, instead of drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was having trouble finding it.  </li>
            <li> I know I can get through this cold winter without completely drying out.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t have to add an additional moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Body wash is not only a great deal it is a luxurious product. It smells great while using and the smell remains. I&#x27;m in a nursing home and this product makes me feel nice and soft. I have been using for quiet a while, but your cost is what got me to order it. Don&#x27;t have much money but this product makes me feel like I do.</li>
            <li> Love buying this in bulk, saves a trip to the store</li>
            <li> Loved this product! We got a three pack for an awesome price! This is a great body wash. It feels like you are rubbing silk all over your body! Both my husband and myself love this product!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing bodywash out there!  One I&#x27;m willing to pay full price for; but, so glad to get it on a great lightning deal</li>
            <li> There are body washes.  Then there is Nivea&#x27;s Cream Oil Body Wash!  This product doesn&#x27;t only clean; it moisturizes.  I&#x27;m especially pleased with the nice--not overwhelming fragrance that doesn&#x27;t conflict with my lotion or perfume.</li>
            <li> This was a welcomed improvement over a well-known competitor&#x27;s product.  Lathers very well, has a pleasant smell without being overly perfumey, and moisturizes skin very effectively.  We bought this during an Amazon Lightning Deal, and we&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again in the future.  I wish it was available in a larger container, though.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome..leaves the fragrance even after shower. Got it for a good price. Doesn&#x27;t remain soapy on the body like some of the moisturizing body washes do.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, and does not seem to dry out my skin. I gifted one to a friend who has sensitive skin and she liked it as well and had no issue.</li>
            <li> Smells Great and skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Not as moisture rich as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This smells great, lathers generously, and has a very small dispensing hole in the bottle. So many body washes have a big squirt hole which encourages overuse so you have to buy more sooner. This bottle has a little squirt hole so you use less and still get lots of lather. I appreciate a company that doesn&#x27;t do the &amp;#34;big hole trick&amp;#34; to get you to burn through the product in a wasteful manner. I know, I know...people should be responsible for their own squirting habits and ration their own use of a product, but I have teenagers. They would happily dump the entire bottle onto their bath pouf if the squirt hole was two inches in diameter. My reviews are always based on value, not just the quality of the product. Because of the packaging, this product is a better VALUE to me than a comparable product in a more generously dispensing bottle because it lasts longer and still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive a pack of 3, like stated, but only received one. Though, got refunded for the price of not getting two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I used to be an avid Dove body wash user, and Nivea I think is so much better. My skin used to crack it was so dry, and now it is smooth!</li>
            <li> Delicious aroma, very good texture and works very well at the time of the shower. Good product. Excellent, fine, nice.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance, good lathering, leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash my skin always feel smooth and soft I use it everyday!! Would recommend it</li>
            <li> I LOVE Nivea body wash usually but this was old smelling and when I received the package it had spilled all over everything and was not packaged properly! I will not order this again! I ended up throwing the whole order out! The mail lady had it all over her shirt and hands!</li>
            <li> Product works great. Felt clean and had a pleasant smell.  Didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or left any residue.  Product lasted a while and lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Really nice body wash.</li>
            <li> Sold on all Nivea products now. Great scent and makes my skin so smooth. Love, love, love Nivea. I am now a believer!</li>
            <li> Moist, smell good and cleans</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizing effects of this body wash. The smell... I can live with it. I like the fact that it lingers long after you step out of the shower. I also like the price, and the shipping was right on schedule.</li>
            <li> No complaints about this body wash.  It&#x27;s lovely, it smells great and gets the job done.  I use it as bubble bath adn it works great for that too, very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> Great body wash, lasted a long time, Shea butter can have a waxy smell to me but it&#x27;s still calming and moisturizing, still one of my top favorites</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely fantastic!!!  A purchase everyone will enjoy, leaves my skin soft, smooth, and smelling good.  No need for lotion during the summer months with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nivea body washes and bath oils. This product is great for dry skin because it has various moisturizers and very little or no alcohol. I used to buy Nivea bath/shower products from Target, but could never find enough; sometimes any at all, in stock for purchase. However, I really like that I can purchase Nivea bath/shower products at Amazon.com and sometimes at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea body wash.  It is one of the few soaps that moisturizes, instead of drying out my skin.  Most retailers around me don&#x27;t carry it.  I had to switch to a Dial moisturizing body wash while I waited for this to come in.  I definitely noticed a difference and vowed to never run out again. :)</li>
            <li> The wash itself is pretty good- lathers and rinses quite well. But the smell is too flowery for me and I will most likely not buy again. If you don&#x27;t mind a flowery smell, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Smells good and washes off well. Enough said!</li>
            <li> I love this body wash and I was having trouble finding it.  Thank you so much.  I know I can get through this cold winter without completely drying out.</li>
            <li> This wash was not what I expected for scent wise, but I still consider it a good buy for price.</li>
            <li> Cheaper at Amazon, my daughter isstationed in Germany she is in the Army and she loves this body wash! So do I!</li>
            <li> I love this brand and scent. I&#x27;ll buy it again and again. You definately can&#x27;t go wrong if you like smooth skin and a mild scent that&#x27;s not too strong..</li>
            <li> This is a nice body wash.  It smells pretty good and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a better than average body wash. It leaves your skin feeling soft. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nivea Touch Of Harmony Cream Oil Body Wash, Shea Butter &amp; Vanilla Blossom Scent is very soothing and healing for those who suffer from Eczema.  Thanks, Amazon for offering this terrific product. I highly recommend this body wash for those who suffer from Eczema.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Over the holidays, I ordered this brand of Nivea Oil Cream Body Wash....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mention [that] often choose Dove or Caress for the mild fragrance, and foaming quality... So, I&#x27;m writing from constant use of these&lt;br /&gt;two popular brands. Nivea, likewise, has a good, quality scent... Also, it isn&#x27;t super thin when you pour it on a face cloth...However, it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;foam like many popular brand body washes, and isn&#x27;t a super thick in overall consistency. So, if you been searching for your next Oil of Olay--&lt;br /&gt;you WON&#x27;T find it here. You will find a nice, mild, low foam body wash.</li>
            <li> This body wash is wonderful!  It is moisturizing, and it smells wonderful.  I used to buy it at a local store, however, they have discontinued this particular scent.  I found it here at Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a light scent to remain after you get out of the shower.  My skin feels so clean and I usually don&#x27;t have to add an additional moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Most products of Nivea is awesome., This is also an excellent body wash and it gives good moisturizer effect after bath. Value for money and pleasant smell too.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. The bottles are the big size so to get them at this price for three of them is superb.</li>
            <li> Love it! Scent smells great</li>
            <li> Love the aroma very nice</li>
            <li> I use it every day. It does very well on my skin. Will order more when I run Out. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great deal and good soap for the price. I get compliments on how soft my skin is all the time.</li>
            <li> Love Nivea body wash. The orange blossom scent is the best!</li>
            <li> The has a very nice smell but it feels like it just sits on your skin when you&#x27;re washing.  So you smell good but don&#x27;t feel as clean as can be.</li>
            <li> I love this bath gel...it retails for so much more at Target and other big box stores, so this is a great deal from Amazon.  It&#x27;s gentle enough on your skin and very moisturizing, but leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Nice light aroma.</li>
            <li> Big size bottles very pleased</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about Nivea&#x27;s products usually, but Nivea Harmony Body wash is the exception. It is not a heavily perfumed body wash, but it does an excellent job of leaving your skin smooth and moisturized. Recommend for people who have dry skin and if you stick to bar soap, it&#x27;s time you treat your body and stop depleting your skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> This provides a smooth clean feeling; not the fanciest smell but, it works!</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. I bought it on a whim and will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Smells very good and worked really good on my dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best body washes you can get. This smells great,plus makes your skin really soft. Nivea products are perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft without being oily and the smell of the Shea Butter &amp; Vanilla is heavenly! without being overwhelming. I just wish they would offer a better deal on the 3-pack of this, which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The price only saved me a few cents off of the store price.</li>
            <li> It works fine but I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  It wasn&#x27;t really shea or vanilla but more musky smelling.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin. This is the only bodywash I can use that is scented. It is very soft, lathers great, and smells really great. I&#x27;m happy to have it in a 3 pack!</li>
            <li> This works well, but it has a strange yogurt-y smell to it?  It&#x27;s not really bad, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t call it vanilla if I smelled without seeing the label.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great. Could suds up more.</li>
            <li> my husband has psoriasis and this helps. Quite pleased with it, also it&#x27;s vegan so that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Works fine, no itching or dry skin after shower. Gives good lather as well, so you can save some soap.</li>
            <li> Best will order again</li>
            <li> smells awesome and really moisturizes</li>
            <li> My fault for misreading the description but this is not a vanilla scented body wash. It&#x27;s vanilla BLOSSOM so the scent has a slightly floral perfumy quality to it that I would not ordinarily buy. I don&#x27;t like strong scents but this one is tolerable. I won&#x27;t buy this particular scent again but the body wash itself is perfectly fine. It lathers nicely if you like that sort of thing, and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it for it to be effective. It has a nice texture so if there&#x27;s another Gold box deal that would make this item less expensive and there was a non-floral scent I would buy it.</li>
            <li> Love Nivia products and this three pack well worth the money.</li>
            <li> smells like that racist perfume called white shoulders.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite body wash!</li>
            <li> I like the product and will continue to use it. it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I expected it to smell differently but it does the job. Finally on my last bottle so it lasts quite a while. Good deal for the price but a little to perfumy for me.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lots of lather.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin deal with the cold and dry New England winters. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin like some other products do.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent not too over powering but still strong enough to smell after your shower!</li>
