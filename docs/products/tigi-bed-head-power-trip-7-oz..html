            <li> My only complaint was that the cans weren&#x27;t packed as well as they could have been.  </li>
            <li> Just put a small amount in you wet hand and rub it in your wet hair.</li>
            <li> ; i am 100% danish and my hair is thick blonde</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair in place without looking stiff and without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It provides body and fullness,and just a little does the job.</li>
            <li> Just need a little to add body and help hold style.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to had a little body and manageability to their hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;a few months.  </li>
            <li> At least I can get it somewhat cheaper,and know I can always find it online.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I could not find this product anywhere recently and decided to order online. I have been using this hair gel for several years and it really helps hold my hair and keeps it looking great.</li>
            <li> I understand, this product is going off the market and has been a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for several years now.  So, as soon as I learned this, I went to you and you satisfied my need for now and in the future.  I am wondering what the replacement might be?  Suppose I&#x27;ll just have to take a &amp;#34;wait and see&amp;#34; approach.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite brand of gel so we buy this all the time.  It&#x27;s expensive, but for salon brands you always spend more. Does not leave any flakes and has a firm hold for short hair.  I will occasionally use it for really tight ponytails to prevent flyaways and pull-outs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and love it!  I have fine, fly-away hair. This product keeps my hair in place without looking stiff and without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Now if you could just convince Tigi to UN-discontinue it! I have bought every can I can find. The best hair styling product since hair spray but better. And it is not loaded with perfume.</li>
            <li> Defective product.  Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Would not dispense gel.</li>
            <li> I think that this is a great product but I also think its a little over priced but works great!!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this gel....a local I usually buy from said this product is going to be discontinued so I purchased three from Amazon...will&lt;br /&gt;probably buy some more, thank you</li>
            <li> It really holds my hair in place without being too sticky or unmanageable, unlike may other gels I have tried.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair care product. Would not be without it.&lt;br /&gt;only problem--how to get it in my carry on luggage &#x27;cause&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to leave home without it. makes a huge difference&lt;br /&gt;in the way my behaves!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair.  Sorry to say I think they are discontining it.  GREAT for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was angry because the pump was not operational!!! I was in the obligation to bring the bottle!!!!thanks for your attention !..........</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can find this product since the stores have stopped carrying it.  Don&#x27;t know why TIGI has decided to stop producing this product.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Holds well and all day.  Amazon was same price as my salon. Good product and it was sent to my home for free using &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  The beauty supply house that supplied this product no longer carried it.  They claimed it had been discontinued.  My only complaint was that the cans weren&#x27;t packed as well as they could have been.  Everything arrived OK, it&#x27;s just that they were not packed with padding between them so they banged around during shipment.</li>
            <li> My son and I use Bed Head instead of hair spray. Just put a small amount in you wet hand and rub it in your wet hair. It works great at holding your hair in place and you don;t have top breath the hair spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that Bed Head hasn&#x27;t figured this out....they have discontinued this product.  What they replaced it with STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to get 2 Power Trips on Amazon.com albeit at a 300+% mark-up...but at least I have two cans which will last me&lt;br /&gt;a few months.  The old supply and demand theory....you want it...you pay for it.  And I did with pleasure.</li>
            <li> Had to return....product was outdated.</li>
            <li> What I was needing got in a short time have use Tigi Bed Head Power Trip Gel for many year Great Product</li>
            <li> Love this product. So glad you carry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Unfortunately, it seems as tho it&#x27;s become unavailable, I think by the manufacturer.  I hope you will have it available for a long time to come.  There&#x27;s nothing like it to thicken my fine hair. I tried a recommended product - Big Sexy Hair Voluminizing Gel - and had to use twice as much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair gel for firm hold.  I used to buy it at the beauty shop and they stopped carrying it.  I am happy to be able to order it.</li>
            <li> I used this product every time I wash my hair since I have fine hair it helps to give me body and control.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, so hard to find</li>
            <li> I have a flat top hair cut and all the gels I had tried didn&#x27;t stay stiff and spike it up nicely this one far exceeded all the others!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over ten years.  I always purchased it at the Walmart hair salon or other salons.  Couldn&#x27;t not find it anywhere in the last several months, so I found it on Amazon.  Hope his product is not going to be discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that gives my fine hair the extra body it needs. My salon says they have trouble stocking it, so I bought my own.</li>
            <li> After trying many gels for my fine hair,I always go back to this one. It provides body and fullness,and just a little does the job. I have to say,though,that it is expensive and hard to find in stores. At least I can get it somewhat cheaper,and know I can always find it online.</li>
            <li> Hard to find!!!! I heard they discontinued it? WHY??? Best stuff to use on fine hair. Mixed it with a dab of Mohawk Gel. Worked great!!</li>
            <li> dont take this review as a bad proudct it would work better with less hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok look&amp;#60; i am 100% danish and my hair is thick blonde so it dosent hold up i go to school 4 six hours and it wont even hold up for that and i use alot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, I love it! Hard to find in stores, so husband suggested I look on internet, who knew he was so smart? So glad I did, and it&#x27;s cheaper on this site, in store it was about 17$, when I ordered these 3 cans it turned out to be 11$. I will keep on ordering from Amazon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Several of the canisters did not work properly....can&#x27;t get the gel out of them.  Reviewed November 11, 2013.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The product was defective and I have not seen a credit in my credit card statement. Doubt if I will purchase thru Amazon again as such a bad experience.</li>
            <li> $39.00 is was too high.  I love Power Trip and cannot find it.  However $39.00 for one bottle is way to high.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it is light, greaseless, and easy to use on my short hair. I&#x27;ve used it for years and am glad to find it on Amazon for convenient ordering.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product online. Had searched all my previous&lt;br /&gt;places where I had bought it with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can find it again when I have used up the 3 cans I bought.</li>
            <li> Holds but not sticky. It leaves a clean and lasting hold without the tacky smell and feel. My husband has been using this product for 5 years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my fine hair.  Just need a little to add body and help hold style.  It is what my hairdresser uses on me.</li>
            <li> I would not only highly recommend this product, but also the seller. I have used this gel for several years now, and with great results. Coupled with blow drying the hair afterwards, this gel is not noticeable, does not cake up, and has a very natural look to it.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. The can with a push button is awesome. i dont have to open or close any lids. I get exactly how much I want every time. This product works great on wet or dry hair. Holds all day if you dont run your fingers through your hair. I tend to run my fingers through my hair a lot and I can get my hands wet later in the day and run them through my hair and its like having freshly styled hair all over again. I am a big fan of this product. My 10 year old loves it also. I finally bought him his own can so he will stop stealing mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m scared as this is a product I have used FOREVER, and it has been discontinued...I bought four from this vender, and it arrived quickly.  When I opened the first can, it wouldn&#x27;t squirt out.  My crafty husband cut the entire lid off, I use plastic wrap and a rubber band around it to keep the product from solidifying. I assume it was just an unusual circumstance...I should try one of the other cans that are on my shelf...At least I have the product...</li>
            <li> I very much like this product.  It helps me manage my fine hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to had a little body and manageability to their hair. I have used it for years.</li>
