            <li>It didn&#x27;t even smell good.</li>
            <li>Might be a great conditioner, but I need a good trim/cut because my hair isn&#x27;t healthy &amp;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This stuff is beyond amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, but after paying shipping and everything it wasn&#x27;t really as cheap as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I saw how many good reviews it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has excellent slip and works very well for a wash and go, as a leave in and moisturizing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and does the trick</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not that thrilled with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; in my hair.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find one thing I liked about this product.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, tried many products and nothing compares to this hair is growing fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to stop wandering and experimenting with things that don&#x27;t for, for me.</li>
            <li>Anything that can make a tail like that silky smooth has got to be good.</li>
            <li>By far this is the best.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality clean feeling conditioner without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth as you rinse it off</li>
            <li>Armed with this new information I tried the product again and loved it!</li>
            <li>They make th hair feel healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>This is great for my hair, and doesn&#x27;t contain any dimethicone, which is basically silicone which makes your hair really greasy.   </li>
            <li>each time I showered, more and more of it would fall out while I was shampooing / conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many types of shampoos and conditioners and none of them make my hair fall out the way this duo did.&lt;br /&gt;Never buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love mane n tail products...</li>
            <li>My lottabody leave in did a better job.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this conditioner and the shampoo.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s ever been before, really truly happy.</li>
            <li>that Mane &#x27;n Tail and work so much better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE all of Mane n&#x27; Tail products.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it did make my hair smell nice and feel smooth</li>
            <li>I then tried Mane n Tail shampoo and deep moisturizing conditioner and was very impressed.</li>
            <li>i use this in combination with the shampoo... makes my hair nice and smooth...</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>, my hair is shinny and healthy once again :)</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use it with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--John, Kay&#x27;s husband :)</li>
            <li>use this conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo and this over the years has been my favorite go to shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>After using both the shampoo and then the conditioner, my hair feels both healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>cheap and fabulous, one of the best deep conditioners out there!!!</li>
            <li>Given the price, it&#x27;s about on par with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Detangler, so this is a good substitute for that product if one wants to save money (and don&#x27;t we all?).  </li>
            <li>Very nice, mild fragrance; rinses off of my hair easily; hair feels nice and soft after I&#x27;ve towel-dried my hair.</li>
            <li>this is hands down the best conditioner and shampoo ever (even better than thos &#x27;salon brands&#x27;)</li>
            <li>I used this and the first time I could feel my hair was softer, and had more body than I have ever had in my life !</li>
            <li>which is fine</li>
            <li>This product is fine.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, nice on hair.</li>
            <li>Combined with their detangler spray and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap (various scents, but I always have Rose, Peppermint, and Eucalyptus on hand - Peppermint to strip the oils, Eucalyptus to clean thoroughly and help the psoriasis on my scalp, and Rose for the scent and softness it gives my hair) as shampoo, this makes my hair</li>
            <li>From the first day of using this my hair is softer, tangle free and has just as much or more body.</li>
            <li>only thing I did notice was that the more I used it, the more MY HAIR FELL OUT!</li>
            <li>This product gives my hair a beautiful shine and brings out its waviness, so after careful styling it looks like it belongs on a magazine cover.</li>
            <li>Give it a try its worth it!</li>
            <li>100% success!  </li>
            <li>Horse owners reported seeing \\&quot;significant improvement in the health and appearance of their horses&#x27; manes and tails.\\</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Tail shampoo to get your hair incredibly clean</li>
            <li>i had heard great things about this product and having extremely dry and damaged hair I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s clean and bouncy with no frizzies.</li>
            <li>Arrived super quick, smells good, keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try the Mane &#x27;n Tail products.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, fuller and i just love it!</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this product, it might as well been from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>While the shampoo is good, this conditioner left my hair drier than the straw in a barn.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it does not linger.  </li>
            <li>So maybe try using again before using a super moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>, you need to use a lot more shampoo and conditioner than normal.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it is!</li>
            <li>Perfect for long hair and to keep long, lustrous and full bodied.</li>
            <li>and i can actually see rapid hair growth using this with the shampoo- love it!</li>
            <li>Strong, beautiful, and smooth - no frizz at all, even on the ends of my hair (which would previously poof out several inches).</li>
            <li>amazing especially on Afro textured hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive and works very well for a healthy hair routine.</li>
            <li>I expected good results but wound up disliking the products.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and my hair feels more healthy already, and I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery,</li>
            <li>I use it as a conditioner wash (over the original mane n tail bottle, like a 2-step for more moisture) and sometimes for wash days to detangle my hair while it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li>I had previously used redken, aveda and most recently biolage and did not get the good results I got from this.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate so keeping my horses mane and tail in good condition is a challenge.  </li>
            <li>and this is only 9 dollars for a huge bottle!</li>
            <li>This product (if it is indeed the actual product and not a knock off) does not work any better than Suave.</li>
            <li>I can only find the normal kind..    </li>
            <li>This is the first conditioner I&#x27;ve found that keeps it under control for days - but it goes beyond even that.</li>
            <li>Here are the things to be aware of when using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You also need to comb it through (especially the conditioner) and be sure every strand is covered.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product, and it works better than products like Kerastase- which is 60 dollars for a small can-</li>
            <li>I apply a glop to my beard first, then rub up the excess to use on the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>this conditioner is amazing, i have fine, wavy, mid length hair and in the alasken winter it gets really dry but after using this conditioner/shampoo for about a week my hair is shiny</li>
            <li>With first use, I realized how soft my hair was and how it brought out my natural curl alot better.</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair feel as soft and silky as original Mane and Tail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks along with shampoo of same brand, leaves hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I will never go back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a conditioner that works perfectly for straight and curly hair all the same.</li>
            <li>Now I just hope it will help me grow my hair as long and healthy as a Mane.  </li>
            <li>came in early, so that was good, and it definitely keeps your hair soft all day.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and love using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is not dry at all, it&#x27;s shiny, and it feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for the deep conditioning version of this product, however, this is not as good as the regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>(And my hair&#x27;s in pretty decent condition to begin</li>
            <li>I have fine-ish, straight hair and bought this thinking it would add shine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li>make sure your hair is THOROUGHLY wet before shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I just felt like it made my hair look like straw, very fly-away</li>
            <li>For years, everything that I tried (mostly salon products, too) had absolutely no effect.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>just did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>The texture of my horses mane and tail is much softer.  </li>
            <li>Ive curly, frizzy, bleached, damaged hair and this is really improving it</li>
            <li>For those who have curly or wavy hair, the conditioner preserves the natural shape of those curls, and because it smoothes and reduces frizz, it actually makes them look healthier and more defined.    </li>
            <li>and I love how it deep cleaned without stripping my hair of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li>Product came in the size I expected and is the real deal :-)</li>
            <li>Most products burn my scalp due to allergies.</li>
            <li>I am a black woman with 4b/4c hair and it made my hair much more curlier and softer than I expected :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not life-changing, but it is a nice change from ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li>My first-day hair with this stuff is what my old second-day hair really wanted to be but never could.</li>
            <li>You used to be able to see them from a mile away, now I have trouble even if I&#x27;m looking for them.    </li>
            <li>I use a different shampoo to make sure my hair gets clean, and then use this only from my ears down, it makes your scalp too greasy.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be light enough to moisturize and strengthen but for some hair types, it isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>Once I rinsed the conditioner out my hair was very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, you&#x27;re better off making a trip to the local store for something much cheaper.</li>
            <li>,i cant see any split ends,extremely manageable,and sooo soft, plus it brought out my waves!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for anyone with super think coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent and seems to have done as much for my facial hair as humanly possible short of oiling the d@mn thing every few days.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>but after a couple uses my hair feels soft and shiny and has moisture again but isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Ive used this product as a child and regret not continuing this as an adult.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft, supple, shiny with lots of body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes hair silky soft and doesn&#x27;t flare up my allergies.</li>
            <li>It really does deep mosterize my hair.  </li>
            <li>Within two uses my hair is already soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a deep conditioner when I wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, bouncy, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 20 years and can feel a difference when not using.</li>
            <li>From what I understand, Mane &#x27;n Tail was originally developed for horses.</li>
            <li>I use that after shampooing her and her fur gets super soft, I massage it in for as long as possible so she enjoys the treatment,....</li>
            <li>I feel like the shampoo leaves my hair super dry and the deep conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition my hair</li>
            <li>I have used many hair products from cheap to very expensive and this fell way near the lower end.  </li>
            <li>My naturally dry, frizzy, and curly hair is now soft and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite long and likes to become very frizzy, despite its somewhat oily nature.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but my normal to frizzy, color treated hair likes this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair, and I wish I could find this type of main n tail in stores, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My hair became very dry following an extremely hot summer.</li>
            <li>I pitched it after two uses and went back to my old conditioner.</li>
            <li>It left my hair, soft, bouncy, and shiny.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair to be manageable, and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair became thicker and longer much much faster than any other shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Once the horse has dried, the tangles don&#x27;t come back right away.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and it&#x27;s thick in consistency.  </li>
            <li>a little goes a long way...and their prices are worth the quality of product you receive...</li>
            <li>I have tried every brand you can get from the grocery store, and every salon brand that was recommended to me by stylists, and nothing would make my dry damaged hair soft again.</li>
            <li>am a 21 year old female with long brown hair.</li>
            <li>but seriously, for the price, its not bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very pleased with the scent, as it reminds me of bar soap or industrial hand soap, something very \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; and \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; about it that reminds me of something that is not shampoo.  </li>

            <li> hope its good i,m taking</li>
            <li> it seems good.</li>
            <li> hope its good i,m taking</li>
            <li> it seems good.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even smell good.</li>
            <li> Might be a great conditioner, but I need a good trim/cut because my hair isn&#x27;t healthy &amp;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, but after paying shipping and everything it wasn&#x27;t really as cheap as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I saw how many good reviews it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has excellent slip and works very well for a wash and go, as a leave in and moisturizing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and does the trick</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not that thrilled with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; in my hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find one thing I liked about this product.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, tried many products and nothing compares to this hair is growing fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to stop wandering and experimenting with things that don&#x27;t for, for me.</li>
            <li> Anything that can make a tail like that silky smooth has got to be good.</li>
            <li> By far this is the best.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality clean feeling conditioner without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth as you rinse it off</li>
            <li> Armed with this new information I tried the product again and loved it!</li>
            <li> They make th hair feel healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is great for my hair, and doesn&#x27;t contain any dimethicone, which is basically silicone which makes your hair really greasy.   </li>
            <li> each time I showered, more and more of it would fall out while I was shampooing / conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many types of shampoos and conditioners and none of them make my hair fall out the way this duo did.&lt;br /&gt;Never buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love mane n tail products...</li>
            <li> My lottabody leave in did a better job.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this conditioner and the shampoo.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s ever been before, really truly happy.</li>
            <li> that Mane &#x27;n Tail and work so much better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE all of Mane n&#x27; Tail products.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it did make my hair smell nice and feel smooth</li>
            <li> I then tried Mane n Tail shampoo and deep moisturizing conditioner and was very impressed.</li>
            <li> i use this in combination with the shampoo... makes my hair nice and smooth...</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> , my hair is shinny and healthy once again :)</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use it with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--John, Kay&#x27;s husband :)</li>
            <li> use this conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo and this over the years has been my favorite go to shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> After using both the shampoo and then the conditioner, my hair feels both healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> cheap and fabulous, one of the best deep conditioners out there!!!</li>
            <li> Given the price, it&#x27;s about on par with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Detangler, so this is a good substitute for that product if one wants to save money (and don&#x27;t we all?).  </li>
            <li> Very nice, mild fragrance; rinses off of my hair easily; hair feels nice and soft after I&#x27;ve towel-dried my hair.</li>
            <li> this is hands down the best conditioner and shampoo ever (even better than thos &#x27;salon brands&#x27;)</li>
            <li> I used this and the first time I could feel my hair was softer, and had more body than I have ever had in my life !</li>
            <li> which is fine</li>
            <li> This product is fine.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, nice on hair.</li>
            <li> Combined with their detangler spray and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap (various scents, but I always have Rose, Peppermint, and Eucalyptus on hand - Peppermint to strip the oils, Eucalyptus to clean thoroughly and help the psoriasis on my scalp, and Rose for the scent and softness it gives my hair) as shampoo, this makes my hair</li>
            <li> From the first day of using this my hair is softer, tangle free and has just as much or more body.</li>
            <li> only thing I did notice was that the more I used it, the more MY HAIR FELL OUT!</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair a beautiful shine and brings out its waviness, so after careful styling it looks like it belongs on a magazine cover.</li>
            <li> Give it a try its worth it!</li>
            <li> 100% success!  </li>
            <li> Horse owners reported seeing \\&quot;significant improvement in the health and appearance of their horses&#x27; manes and tails.\\</li>
            <li> &#x27;n Tail shampoo to get your hair incredibly clean</li>
            <li> i had heard great things about this product and having extremely dry and damaged hair I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s clean and bouncy with no frizzies.</li>
            <li> Arrived super quick, smells good, keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try the Mane &#x27;n Tail products.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, fuller and i just love it!</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this product, it might as well been from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> While the shampoo is good, this conditioner left my hair drier than the straw in a barn.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it does not linger.  </li>
            <li> So maybe try using again before using a super moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> , you need to use a lot more shampoo and conditioner than normal.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is!</li>
            <li> Perfect for long hair and to keep long, lustrous and full bodied.</li>
            <li> and i can actually see rapid hair growth using this with the shampoo- love it!</li>
            <li> Strong, beautiful, and smooth - no frizz at all, even on the ends of my hair (which would previously poof out several inches).</li>
            <li> amazing especially on Afro textured hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive and works very well for a healthy hair routine.</li>
            <li> I expected good results but wound up disliking the products.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and my hair feels more healthy already, and I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery,</li>
            <li> I use it as a conditioner wash (over the original mane n tail bottle, like a 2-step for more moisture) and sometimes for wash days to detangle my hair while it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used redken, aveda and most recently biolage and did not get the good results I got from this.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so keeping my horses mane and tail in good condition is a challenge.  </li>
            <li> and this is only 9 dollars for a huge bottle!</li>
            <li> This product (if it is indeed the actual product and not a knock off) does not work any better than Suave.</li>
            <li> I can only find the normal kind..    </li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner I&#x27;ve found that keeps it under control for days - but it goes beyond even that.</li>
            <li> Here are the things to be aware of when using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You also need to comb it through (especially the conditioner) and be sure every strand is covered.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product, and it works better than products like Kerastase- which is 60 dollars for a small can-</li>
            <li> I apply a glop to my beard first, then rub up the excess to use on the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> this conditioner is amazing, i have fine, wavy, mid length hair and in the alasken winter it gets really dry but after using this conditioner/shampoo for about a week my hair is shiny</li>
            <li> With first use, I realized how soft my hair was and how it brought out my natural curl alot better.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair feel as soft and silky as original Mane and Tail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks along with shampoo of same brand, leaves hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I will never go back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a conditioner that works perfectly for straight and curly hair all the same.</li>
            <li> Now I just hope it will help me grow my hair as long and healthy as a Mane.  </li>
            <li> came in early, so that was good, and it definitely keeps your hair soft all day.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and love using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is not dry at all, it&#x27;s shiny, and it feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for the deep conditioning version of this product, however, this is not as good as the regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> (And my hair&#x27;s in pretty decent condition to begin</li>
            <li> I have fine-ish, straight hair and bought this thinking it would add shine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li> make sure your hair is THOROUGHLY wet before shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I just felt like it made my hair look like straw, very fly-away</li>
            <li> For years, everything that I tried (mostly salon products, too) had absolutely no effect.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> just did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> The texture of my horses mane and tail is much softer.  </li>
            <li> Ive curly, frizzy, bleached, damaged hair and this is really improving it</li>
            <li> For those who have curly or wavy hair, the conditioner preserves the natural shape of those curls, and because it smoothes and reduces frizz, it actually makes them look healthier and more defined.    </li>
            <li> and I love how it deep cleaned without stripping my hair of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li> Product came in the size I expected and is the real deal :-)</li>
            <li> Most products burn my scalp due to allergies.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with 4b/4c hair and it made my hair much more curlier and softer than I expected :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not life-changing, but it is a nice change from ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li> My first-day hair with this stuff is what my old second-day hair really wanted to be but never could.</li>
            <li> You used to be able to see them from a mile away, now I have trouble even if I&#x27;m looking for them.    </li>
            <li> I use a different shampoo to make sure my hair gets clean, and then use this only from my ears down, it makes your scalp too greasy.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be light enough to moisturize and strengthen but for some hair types, it isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> Once I rinsed the conditioner out my hair was very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, you&#x27;re better off making a trip to the local store for something much cheaper.</li>
            <li> ,i cant see any split ends,extremely manageable,and sooo soft, plus it brought out my waves!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for anyone with super think coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent and seems to have done as much for my facial hair as humanly possible short of oiling the d@mn thing every few days.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> but after a couple uses my hair feels soft and shiny and has moisture again but isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product as a child and regret not continuing this as an adult.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft, supple, shiny with lots of body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes hair silky soft and doesn&#x27;t flare up my allergies.</li>
            <li> It really does deep mosterize my hair.  </li>
            <li> Within two uses my hair is already soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a deep conditioner when I wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, bouncy, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 20 years and can feel a difference when not using.</li>
            <li> From what I understand, Mane &#x27;n Tail was originally developed for horses.</li>
            <li> I use that after shampooing her and her fur gets super soft, I massage it in for as long as possible so she enjoys the treatment,....</li>
            <li> I feel like the shampoo leaves my hair super dry and the deep conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition my hair</li>
            <li> I have used many hair products from cheap to very expensive and this fell way near the lower end.  </li>
            <li> My naturally dry, frizzy, and curly hair is now soft and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite long and likes to become very frizzy, despite its somewhat oily nature.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but my normal to frizzy, color treated hair likes this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair, and I wish I could find this type of main n tail in stores, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair became very dry following an extremely hot summer.</li>
            <li> I pitched it after two uses and went back to my old conditioner.</li>
            <li> It left my hair, soft, bouncy, and shiny.</li>
            <li> It helps my hair to be manageable, and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair became thicker and longer much much faster than any other shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Once the horse has dried, the tangles don&#x27;t come back right away.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad and it&#x27;s thick in consistency.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way...and their prices are worth the quality of product you receive...</li>
            <li> I have tried every brand you can get from the grocery store, and every salon brand that was recommended to me by stylists, and nothing would make my dry damaged hair soft again.</li>
            <li> am a 21 year old female with long brown hair.</li>
            <li> but seriously, for the price, its not bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very pleased with the scent, as it reminds me of bar soap or industrial hand soap, something very \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; and \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; about it that reminds me of something that is not shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that I have used in a long time that actually conditions my hair.</li>
            <li> I have not use this long enough to rate it.</li>
            <li> I will be returning my old hair care products which cost a lot less</li>
            <li> If you have hair that is coarser than mine, it will be a complete and utter waste.</li>
            <li> As noted in my shampoo review, my hair is very long, color-treated, and naturally dry, curly, and coarse.</li>
            <li> This has been around for a very long time</li>
            <li> Dry.</li>
            <li> Even tho I have natural African American hair, I always had a problem with how thin my hair was.</li>
            <li> It works no better than any standard Suave conditioner you can pick up at your local Target.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because i have an extremely itchy dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair stopped shedding so bad and is more manageable.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so small and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Before I used it I add a few drops of argan oil and mixed it together with this conditioner and applied to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing my other products away.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo along with the conditioner and began using them as I would any other shampoo or conditioner before.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner every other day.  </li>
            <li> Does nothing that other conditioners can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> didnt realize how small the bottle actually was when it arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> the years, I have gone to other brands</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the usual size and you can find a really big bottle for less at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I used the products for about a week and a half washing my hair every other day and saw no improvement with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick asian hair and conditioning is sometimes an issue.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I found this product at vitacost.com for half the price and will be ordering it through that site.</li>
            <li> Unless it&#x27;s VERY regularly tamed, it&#x27;s always a thick and matted mess.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is shinier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure my sometimes-accumulating dandruff, but that&#x27;s a tough one to tackle in general.  </li>
            <li> your hair feels hard and dry afterwards, it is because the conditioner is loaded with PROTEINS, the stuff that strengthens your hair.</li>
            <li> This just isn&#x27;t your average shampoo or conditioner!</li>
            <li> and I wanted something that would baby it a little bit.</li>
            <li> I can leave this in a little when wearing my hair curly.</li>
            <li> I also use a little as a leave in conditioner once a week overnight and rinse it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> Curly, blonde thin hair.</li>
            <li> After using it my hair felt straw-like and gross, something I had never experienced even when I do not use conditioner.</li>
            <li> I saw this product praised here on Amazon, so I gambled a few bucks and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Leave the conditioner on for AT LEAST two mins, my hair is extremely damaged</li>
            <li> and it felt dry and unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> Saw a lot of reviews from what I believed to be a race of people with traditionally rough and tough hair</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the shampoo &amp; conditioner for my excessive hair loss.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet and not sure if I ever will since it is not what I wanted</li>
            <li> It also helps with breakage and sheading which is usually caused by either a lack of moisture or protein.</li>
            <li> I tried expensive detangler/conditioners and the yellow colored version of this brand.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to use rinse out conditioners in the past</li>
            <li> I read a few bad reviews with the same issues I had and what other people recommended they do to achieve their desired results.</li>
            <li> so I leave it on for at least 5 but usually</li>
            <li> It had previously looked rather dull and was dry which had been driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> Also ridiculously thick, in terms of density and strand dimension.</li>
            <li> My hair type is thick and prone to dryness on the ends.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling light and bouncy because it doesn&#x27;t leave nasty deposits behind.</li>
            <li> you need to be aware that after shampooing your hair is going to feel awful, like straw.</li>
            <li> Upon using this the product wasn&#x27;t very thick</li>
            <li> I used this product \\&quot;correctly\\&quot; as another reviewer outlined and still got poor results.</li>
            <li> This conditioner unfortunately, was no miracle for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from expensive salon products to overnight virgin coconut oil treatments, to no avail.    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this</li>
            <li> Even combing through my hair after using the product was difficult.  </li>
            <li> My hair was shedding really bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Try this shampoo &amp; condition - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You keep these things in mind and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not life-changing, but it is a nice change from ordinary shampoo. Try this shampoo &amp; condition - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product (if it is indeed the actual product and not a knock off) does not work any better than Suave. I have fine-ish, straight hair and bought this thinking it would add shine. It didn&#x27;t do anything. If you have hair that is coarser than mine, it will be a complete and utter waste.</li>
            <li> Mane &#x27;n Tail is the best I&#x27;ve found for frizz. I&#x27;m throwing my other products away.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Mane and Tail products. They make th hair feel healthy and manageable. Hat is off to Mane and Tail!</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair, and I wish I could find this type of main n tail in stores, but I can&#x27;t. I can only find the normal kind..    This is great for my hair, and doesn&#x27;t contain any dimethicone, which is basically silicone which makes your hair really greasy.   I would definitely recommend this for anyone with super think coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Great service.  Good product - use all the time.   Thank you  Marcia    san diego</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have thick asian hair and conditioning is sometimes an issue. This conditioner unfortunately, was no miracle for me. It works no better than any standard Suave conditioner you can pick up at your local Target. Don&#x27;t waste your money, you&#x27;re better off making a trip to the local store for something much cheaper.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the shampoo &amp; conditioner for my excessive hair loss. Ever since I started using these products, my hair loss is under control. Also, my hair is shinier and less frizzy. I highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li> While the shampoo is good, this conditioner left my hair drier than the straw in a barn. I pitched it after two uses and went back to my old conditioner.</li>
            <li> A long-time Mane &#x27;n Tail user, I tried this product after seeing it online. I have very fine hair but lots of it. With the regular conditioner I was still getting tangles. From the first day of using this my hair is softer, tangle free and has just as much or more body.</li>
            <li> I actually like this stuff a lot.  I use it as a conditioner wash (over the original mane n tail bottle, like a 2-step for more moisture) and sometimes for wash days to detangle my hair while it&#x27;s wet.  My hair feels softer when I do the process.  The smell is not bad and it&#x27;s thick in consistency.  It says leave it in for 1-2 minutes before rising it out, but since I have kinkier hair I have to keep it in longer which is fine it doesn&#x27;t break my hair off.</li>
            <li> I ordered conditioner but received shampoo.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet and not sure if I ever will since it is not what I wanted but I&#x27;m sure it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I saw how many good reviews it had.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 21 year old female with long brown hair. I was hoping this shampoo / conditioner would help me get rid of some of the dryness and frizziness. I used the products for about a week and a half washing my hair every other day and saw no improvement with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did notice was that the more I used it, the more MY HAIR FELL OUT! each time I showered, more and more of it would fall out while I was shampooing / conditioning my hair. I have used many types of shampoos and conditioners and none of them make my hair fall out the way this duo did.&lt;br /&gt;Never buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason im giving it 2 stars is because even though my hair fell out, it did do a good job of cleaning it. However did nothing to help the frizz or dryness.</li>
            <li> This has been around for a very long time and I still use it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizing conditioner with protein! That makes it excellent for growth and length retention. It also helps with breakage and sheading which is usually caused by either a lack of moisture or protein. This conditioner has both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has excellent slip and works very well for a wash and go, as a leave in and moisturizing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s very inexpensive and works very well for a healthy hair routine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond amazing. As noted in my shampoo review, my hair is very long, color-treated, and naturally dry, curly, and coarse. Also ridiculously thick, in terms of density and strand dimension. I have tried everything from expensive salon products to overnight virgin coconut oil treatments, to no avail.    Mane &#x27;n Tail prevailed where nothing else could. It leaves my hair feeling light and bouncy because it doesn&#x27;t leave nasty deposits behind. My hair is not dry at all, it&#x27;s shiny, and it feels silky smooth. It&#x27;s manageable and stronger, and nothing, no amount of brushing or even humidity, can make it frizz! I have people asking me constantly how I get my hair to look/feel so good, and they&#x27;re always shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s the \\&quot;horse shampoo/conditioner\\&quot; I buy at the grocery store. (\\&quot;I thought that was for animals! It&#x27;s not even expensive!\\&quot;)    My first-day hair with this stuff is what my old second-day hair really wanted to be but never could. And the second-day hair looks like it belongs on a glossy magazine cover. For those who have curly or wavy hair, the conditioner preserves the natural shape of those curls, and because it smoothes and reduces frizz, it actually makes them look healthier and more defined.    Oh! And my split ends are totally gone. You used to be able to see them from a mile away, now I have trouble even if I&#x27;m looking for them.    Start with the Mane &#x27;n Tail shampoo to get your hair incredibly clean (mine is cleaner than it has been in a decade, it got rid of ALL the build-up), and then leave the conditioner on for 1-2 minutes. Rinse. Dry. Style. Done.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite long and likes to become very frizzy, despite its somewhat oily nature. This is the first conditioner I&#x27;ve found that keeps it under control for days - but it goes beyond even that. This product gives my hair a beautiful shine and brings out its waviness, so after careful styling it looks like it belongs on a magazine cover. Combined with their detangler spray and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap (various scents, but I always have Rose, Peppermint, and Eucalyptus on hand - Peppermint to strip the oils, Eucalyptus to clean thoroughly and help the psoriasis on my scalp, and Rose for the scent and softness it gives my hair) as shampoo, this makes my hair the best it ever has been. Strong, beautiful, and smooth - no frizz at all, even on the ends of my hair (which would previously poof out several inches).</li>
            <li> I love mane n tail products...the conditioners do wonders not only for my hair but my 2 daughters...a little goes a long way...and their prices are worth the quality of product you receive...definitely recommend and will be ordering again...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this but after a couple uses my hair feels soft and shiny and has moisture again but isn&#x27;t greasy. It had previously looked rather dull and was dry which had been driving me crazy. I would recommend giving this product a try. I had previously used redken, aveda and most recently biolage and did not get the good results I got from this. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but my normal to frizzy, color treated hair likes this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Might be a great conditioner, but I need a good trim/cut because my hair isn&#x27;t healthy &amp;I this did not make the detangling process any easier. My lottabody leave in did a better job.</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT, IT DIDN&#x27;T FEEL LIKE IT DID ANYTHING. I STILL COULDN&#x27;T BRUSH MY HAIR AFTER USING IT. BLAH</li>
            <li> this conditioner is amazing, i have fine, wavy, mid length hair and in the alasken winter it gets really dry but after using this conditioner/shampoo for about a week my hair is shiny,i cant see any split ends,extremely manageable,and sooo soft, plus it brought out my waves! this is hands down the best conditioner and shampoo ever (even better than thos &#x27;salon brands&#x27;)</li>
            <li> This conditioner works quite well, but it&#x27;s not anything remarkable.  Given the price, it&#x27;s about on par with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Detangler, so this is a good substitute for that product if one wants to save money (and don&#x27;t we all?).  It works well at detangling hair. I&#x27;m not very pleased with the scent, as it reminds me of bar soap or industrial hand soap, something very \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; and \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; about it that reminds me of something that is not shampoo.  Luckily, it does not linger.  I will likely purchase this product again, in the larger size.</li>
            <li> I recently gave birth to a baby boy. If your a woman you know how your hormones are all over the place. My hair was shedding really bad. I would go to a beautician here in Germany but they charged $135 for something that&#x27;s only $80 back in the states. So I figured I&#x27;d buy this to help save some money. And it worked. My hair stopped shedding so bad and is more manageable. Ive used this product as a child and regret not continuing this as an adult. Now I will!</li>
            <li> i had heard great things about this product and having extremely dry and damaged hair I decided to give it a shot. I purchased the shampoo along with the conditioner and began using them as I would any other shampoo or conditioner before. I began to notice my hair was breaking and felt like straw. I had heard great things about this product so I went online to try and figure out if anyone else was having these problems. I read a few bad reviews with the same issues I had and what other people recommended they do to achieve their desired results. Armed with this new information I tried the product again and loved it! I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair! I love how soft it is! Here are the things to be aware of when using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. make sure your hair is THOROUGHLY wet before shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;2. you need to be aware that after shampooing your hair is going to feel awful, like straw. this will go away when you use the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;3. your going to need A LOT of product. I&#x27;m no expert but I  think its because this stuff basically absorbs into your hair, you need to use a lot more shampoo and conditioner than normal. You also need to comb it through (especially the conditioner) and be sure every strand is covered.&lt;br /&gt;4. Leave the conditioner on for AT LEAST two mins, my hair is extremely damaged so I leave it on for at least 5 but usually even longer.&lt;br /&gt;5. Use the shampoo AND conditioner together. These products are a system and will not work as well without each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You keep these things in mind and you won&#x27;t be disappointed! This just isn&#x27;t your average shampoo or conditioner!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this conditioner and the shampoo. It leaves your hair soft, supple, shiny with lots of body.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does not strip the hair at all yet it&#x27;s clean and bouncy with no frizzies. Really good. Wish I would&#x27;ve known about it years ago. Since it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair, because it has moisturizing benefits, you don&#x27;t have  brittleness or breakage. Perfect for long hair and to keep long, lustrous and full bodied. This will make your hair prettier and fuller then it&#x27;s ever been before, really truly happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks along with shampoo of same brand, leaves hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff and I am not even a horse. Makes hair silky soft and doesn&#x27;t flare up my allergies. Most products burn my scalp due to allergies. This product is fine.</li>
            <li> Works great.. Provided moisture and stimulated growth!</li>
            <li> !JUST A TIP &amp; WARNING!&lt;br /&gt;If your hair feels hard and dry afterwards, it is because the conditioner is loaded with PROTEINS, the stuff that strengthens your hair. It is supposed to be light enough to moisturize and strengthen but for some hair types, it isn&#x27;t enough. So maybe try using again before using a super moisturizing conditioner. Hope this review was helpful for all the reviewers rating it low.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try the Mane &#x27;n Tail products.  I expected good results but wound up disliking the products.  I feel like the shampoo leaves my hair super dry and the deep conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition my hair that well at all.  Even combing through my hair after using the product was difficult.  I just felt like it made my hair look like straw, very fly-away and it felt dry and unhealthy.  I will be returning my old hair care products which cost a lot less that Mane &#x27;n Tail and work so much better.</li>
            <li> I used this to co-wash my hair and I love how it deep cleaned without stripping my hair of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li> My hair became thicker and longer much much faster than any other shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because i have an extremely itchy dry scalp. Even tho I have natural African American hair, I always had a problem with how thin my hair was. With first use, I realized how soft my hair was and how it brought out my natural curl alot better. I leave it on for 30-45 minutes once a week...usually as a co-wash....with a plastic cap to lock in the&lt;br /&gt;moisture. My hair is so soft, fuller and i just love it! I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, but after paying shipping and everything it wasn&#x27;t really as cheap as I was hoping. I like it though.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that I have used in a long time that actually conditions my hair. For years, everything that I tried (mostly salon products, too) had absolutely no effect. It&#x27;s nice to be able to stop wandering and experimenting with things that don&#x27;t for, for me. (And my hair&#x27;s in pretty decent condition to begin with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wonder why they made it blue, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and does the trick but it&#x27;s pretty pricy for such a small bottle. It&#x27;s not the usual size and you can find a really big bottle for less at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Great service and product is as advertised</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping bring my horse&#x27;s tail back to life.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner every other day.  This conditioner works really well on my hair.  It really does deep mosterize my hair.  I love it</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, tried many products and nothing compares to this hair is growing fast! Give it a try its worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mane-n-Tail for about 8 months now and I can honestly say I will never go back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> It conditions nicely and has a great smell. Once the horse has dried, the tangles don&#x27;t come back right away.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair. I didn&#x27;t feel moisture or dryness...just did absolutely nothing. I&#x27;d rather have Suave professionals Conditioner in Rosemary Mint...amazing especially on Afro textured hair.</li>
            <li> Product is good.  I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair for two or three days after one day&#x27;s treatment of Mane&#x27;n&#x27;Tail.  It doesn&#x27;t cure my sometimes-accumulating dandruff, but that&#x27;s a tough one to tackle in general.  Product came in the size I expected and is the real deal :-)</li>
            <li> I love it.  Very creamy, nice on hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE all of Mane n&#x27; Tail products. Upon using this the product wasn&#x27;t very thick but it wasn&#x27;t too lose, and the smell was just great. I am a black woman with 4b/4c hair and it made my hair much more curlier and softer than I expected :)</li>
            <li> I have not use this long enough to rate it. I keep you post it. I don&#x27;t have a horse.</li>
            <li> I got this when I was growing my beard out. I have coarse hair and I wanted something that would baby it a little bit. Saw a lot of reviews from what I believed to be a race of people with traditionally rough and tough hair so that convinced me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well. Has a nice scent and seems to have done as much for my facial hair as humanly possible short of oiling the d@mn thing every few days.</li>
            <li> Curly, blonde thin hair. It&#x27;s very smooth as you rinse it off but I wouldn&#x27;t say it has any effect on taming hair after it dries.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Within two uses my hair is already soft and shiny. This is a really great product</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and love using this conditioner. I used to use this over 20 years ago and forgot about it. I can leave this in a little when wearing my hair curly. This is the perfect conditioner for my hair and it loves it. I also use it as a deep conditioner when I wear my hair straight. It is hard to find a conditioner that works perfectly for straight and curly hair all the same. This one is it.</li>
            <li> I will now and forever use this shampoo and conditioner! My hair is so silky after using these products! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I had only used this on horses before I used it on myself. Ask yourself: have you ever seen a horse&#x27;s tail up close and touched it? Unless it&#x27;s VERY regularly tamed, it&#x27;s always a thick and matted mess. Anything that can make a tail like that silky smooth has got to be good. It&#x27;s been working great for me and I think that I&#x27;ll keep buying this for myself.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have tried every brand you can get from the grocery store, and every salon brand that was recommended to me by stylists, and nothing would make my dry damaged hair soft again. I used this and the first time I could feel my hair was softer, and had more body than I have ever had in my life ! I use a different shampoo to make sure my hair gets clean, and then use this only from my ears down, it makes your scalp too greasy. My hair is soft, bouncy, and shiny. I also use a little as a leave in conditioner once a week overnight and rinse it out in the morning. Absolutely LOVE this product, and it works better than products like Kerastase- which is 60 dollars for a small can- and this is only 9 dollars for a huge bottle! I never try a different conditioner again !</li>
            <li> nothing great about this product but it did make my hair smell nice and feel smooth</li>
            <li> I am african american and have long,natural hair. My hair became very dry following an extremely hot summer. For several months, I tried deep conditioners, and various products to restore the moisture back into my hair. I then tried Mane n Tail shampoo and deep moisturizing conditioner and was very impressed. It left my hair, soft, bouncy, and shiny. There is also no stripping of my hair. I have finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for. These are great products.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the 32 ounce bottles, instead, I received the 12 ounce bottles. Caveat Emptor.</li>
            <li> i use this in combination with the shampoo... makes my hair nice and smooth...and i can actually see rapid hair growth using this with the shampoo- love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived super quick, smells good, keeps my beard soft. Would recommend to anyone looking for a way of taming their beard or longer hair.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this shampoo.  There&#x27;s a lot of product for this great price.  It smells amazing and my hair feels more healthy already, and I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so keeping my horses mane and tail in good condition is a challenge.  I tried expensive detangler/conditioners and the yellow colored version of this brand.  By far this is the best.  The texture of my horses mane and tail is much softer.  My only complaint is I found this product at vitacost.com for half the price and will be ordering it through that site.</li>
            <li> hope its good i,m taking it seems good. hope its good i,m taking it seems good. hope its good i,m taking it seems good.</li>
            <li> cheap and fabulous, one of the best deep conditioners out there!!! Ive curly, frizzy, bleached, damaged hair and this is really improving it, my hair is shinny and healthy once again :)</li>
            <li> I use that after shampooing her and her fur gets super soft, I massage it in for as long as possible so she enjoys the treatment,....</li>
            <li> Does nothing that other conditioners can&#x27;t do.  The bottle is so small and doesn&#x27;t last long. It doesn&#x27;t feel like its enough when I use it.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, but I&#x27;m not that thrilled with the conditioner.  Kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for the cost.  I didn&#x27;t know how to use rinse out conditioners in the past but now I do</li>
            <li> I like the price and what this product does for my hair.  Now I just hope it will help me grow my hair as long and healthy as a Mane.  lol</li>
            <li> As with the shampoo this conditioner is amazing! It smells great and works wonderfully. Before I used it I add a few drops of argan oil and mixed it together with this conditioner and applied to my hair. Once I rinsed the conditioner out my hair was very soft and silky. I was shocked. I didn&#x27;t believe that Mane and Tail was so great until I tried it! My naturally dry, frizzy, and curly hair is now soft and very moisturized. I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry hair. It&#x27;s wonderful! Just make sure to use it with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 20 years and can feel a difference when not using.</li>
            <li> My hair type is thick and prone to dryness on the ends.  My hair is not overly damaged but this product actually made it feel damaged. I used this product \\&quot;correctly\\&quot; as another reviewer outlined and still got poor results. There is nothing special about this product, it might as well been from the dollar store. I have used many hair products from cheap to very expensive and this fell way near the lower end.  After using it my hair felt straw-like and gross, something I had never experienced even when I do not use conditioner. It didn&#x27;t even smell good. I couldn&#x27;t find one thing I liked about this product. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> i like it an all but i jus didnt realize how small the bottle actually was when it arrived in the mail. came in early, so that was good, and it definitely keeps your hair soft all day. but seriously, for the price, its not bad.</li>
            <li> Very nice, mild fragrance; rinses off of my hair easily; hair feels nice and soft after I&#x27;ve towel-dried my hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this conditioner. It helps my hair to be manageable, and soft at the same time. My mom and sister uses this conditioner as well ... With superb results of course.</li>
            <li> I have a wiry beard that I wanted to soften.  I tried all the various conditioners the female residents of my house had on our shelves with no luck.  I saw this product praised here on Amazon, so I gambled a few bucks and gave it a try.  100% success!  My wiry beard has been totally subdued, not only just after using it, but also for days afterward.  One thing I have noticed: for best effect be generous in the amount you use.  I apply a glop to my beard first, then rub up the excess to use on the rest of my hair.  You need enough to make your beard feel slippery.  I always rinse this conditioner out  thoroughly; that does not seem to vitiate the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--John, Kay&#x27;s husband :)</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for the deep conditioning version of this product, however, this is not as good as the regular conditioner.  It does not make my hair feel as soft and silky as original Mane and Tail.</li>
            <li> From what I understand, Mane &#x27;n Tail was originally developed for horses. Horse owners reported seeing \\&quot;significant improvement in the health and appearance of their horses&#x27; manes and tails.\\&quot; The improvement in their animals&#x27; hair prompted horse owners to try the shampoo out on themselves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo and this over the years has been my favorite go to shampoo and conditioner.  After using both the shampoo and then the conditioner, my hair feels both healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have gone to other brands but I always seem to come back to this brand.  This is a good quality clean feeling conditioner without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop around though as you can find the big bottles of these cheaper locally in the big box stores.</li>
