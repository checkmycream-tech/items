            <li>When I contacted the maker I was told that there was a good chance the product was a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer in December 2010 and thought hey good reviews</li>

            <li>This one is so much better than the T3.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to buy for myself..100% satisfied...</li>
            <li>Great product  has multiple ranges  good heat and</li>
            <li>They stated they have system restrictions on returns but they were very apologetic and very nice about the situation.</li>

            <li>This drier is light and easy to handle...</li>
            <li>You can choose strong or light drying</li>
            <li>Also, the diffuser didn&#x27;t fit on the end of the blower.  </li>
            <li>(Maybe even spending full price because I feel refurbished ones could be getting sold judging by the reviews)</li>
            <li>cool  </li>
            <li>Loved it until it stopped working a year later.  </li>
            <li>this is a good dryer, the only thing i really have a problem with is how the 1900 doesnt stand for watts, its just part of the name.</li>
            <li>This dryer is lightweight, gets super hot and has the longest chord I&#x27;ve ever had on a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer gets the job done and is super lightweight and leaves hair really shiny.  </li>
            <li>The money I spent on this dryer will pay itself off since I won&#x27;t have to be making as many trips to the salon!</li>
            <li>On the first rainy Fall day after I purchased this,</li>
            <li>I love my FHI Heat Nano Weight Pro 1900 Turbo Dryer in White.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very lightweight!</li>
            <li>You would think this product would last more than 2 years 9 months.</li>
            <li>They even thanked me for contacting FHI Heat first.  </li>
            <li>I almost repurchased that dryer, since it was dependable for so long, but I&#x27;m so glad I made a change.</li>
            <li>I feel very cheated since this is the first time I ever purchased a hair dryer for over $100.  </li>
            <li>The main points being is the T3 gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li>I will say even though I didn&#x27;t purchase mine on Amazon, I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My hair was soooo much shinier and softer, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t use as much watts as my old Revlon Walmart dryer, which surprised me, but, it gives much better results, more heat, and uses less energy!</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and basically they offered me some okay options but not a full refund since the hair dryer was purchased in 2010.</li>
            <li>Medium and high.  </li>
            <li>It get very hot and dries my thick hair quickly.</li>
            <li>For my natural hair, using this dryer gets me relaxed results.</li>
            <li>It must be purchased from a professional hair salon or directly from them for the warranty to help consumers.  </li>
            <li>At first I was concerned FHI was sacrificing airspeed to keep the noise level down, because the airflow was noticeably softer, even on high.</li>
            <li>For all of my African American girls out there wondering if this dryer will work with our hair, the answer is ABSOLUTELY!</li>
            <li>it smells like fire, doesn&#x27;t go on high speeds, and burns the hair on LOW Medium heat.</li>
            <li>My hand and arm don&#x27;t even begin to get tired, which is a huge change from the Babyliss; I was surprised at what an enormous difference it made in my comfort level.</li>
            <li>I was REALLY skeptical about spending this much on a blow dryer but its so worth it!</li>
            <li>It really seals down that cuticle.  </li>
            <li>The technique does matter too because the smaller portions that I blow dried came out nicer than the large portions.</li>

            <li> I would definitely purchase again and now am looking into the flat iron by FHI.</li>
            <li> So beware that your hair dryer may not last for a long time, you may think I paid a lot of money so it should last but not in my case.</li>
            <li> I really did like the hair dryer for the past 2 years, it helped with my hair frizz</li>
            <li> Shortly after the Fhi Nano gave out I was able to find a Baby Bliss TT blow dryer at my local Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with similar attachments, approximately the same size and weight for less than half the price of the Fhi.</li>
            <li> It only took one blow-dry, however, for me to see that the technology used in this dryer allows it to dry hair faster even with the lower (and quieter) airspeed.</li>
            <li> It has a long cord, which enables me to dry without feeling restricted by a short cord.</li>
            <li> Long cord.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and it took not as much to blow dry my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have shopped around a bit more because I think for the price, I could have found something less expensive and wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> Distributor does not offer a warranty, and neither does the manufacturer, as this particular distributor is not an authorized distributor (learned the hard way).  </li>
            <li> I ordered a white one.. but got black instead which was no major deal.</li>
            <li> The T3 also notoriously breaks down and does not last.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that this hair dryer is lighter and quieter than my previous one, and does seem to dry my hair faster.</li>
            <li> And I have a big thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is relatively thick and it styled in a short bob.</li>
            <li> My long, thick hair has never been so shiny and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> It also dried my hair in half the time, probably less!</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I paid for quality but did not receive long term quality, sadly.</li>
            <li> only cold air came out.</li>
            <li> Oh, and an A+ for making the Cold Shot feature a click-on/click-off button instead of making me hold it down!</li>
            <li> The attachments it came with were the wrong-sized attachments for this blow dryer (thus completely useless) and, (2) It stopped working within two months.</li>
            <li> While this served the purpose, there were two problems: (1)</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in my purchase.</li>

            <li> I bought this when my Babyliss Carrera 2 died after about 7 years. I almost repurchased that dryer, since it was dependable for so long, but I&#x27;m so glad I made a change. This dryer is the InStyle winner for 2010, and I have to say that they obviously know what they&#x27;re talking about. To begin with, it really is SO LIGHT! My hand and arm don&#x27;t even begin to get tired, which is a huge change from the Babyliss; I was surprised at what an enormous difference it made in my comfort level. Second, it is extremely quiet. At first I was concerned FHI was sacrificing airspeed to keep the noise level down, because the airflow was noticeably softer, even on high. It only took one blow-dry, however, for me to see that the technology used in this dryer allows it to dry hair faster even with the lower (and quieter) airspeed. My long, thick hair has never been so shiny and frizz-free. On the first rainy Fall day after I purchased this, when I looked in the mirror and saw my hair hadn&#x27;t turned into a poof around my head, I knew this hair dryer was awesome. Oh, and an A+ for making the Cold Shot feature a click-on/click-off button instead of making me hold it down!</li>
            <li> This drier is light and easy to handle...It get very hot and dries my thick hair quickly. I ordered a white one.. but got black instead which was no major deal.</li>
            <li> I love my FHI Heat Nano Weight Pro 1900 Turbo Dryer in White.  I was debating between this hairdryer and a T3 which I have used before.  This one is so much better than the T3.  The main points being is the T3 gets way too hot.  This hairdryer has two options of heat.   Medium and high.  The T3 also notoriously breaks down and does not last.  There are 3 stylist in my salon who have had that problem.  This hairdryer gets the job done and is super lightweight and leaves hair really shiny.  It really seals down that cuticle.  I would definitely purchase again and now am looking into the flat iron by FHI.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive brand hair dryers...saw my stylist was using this..so I decided to buy for myself..100% satisfied...great hair dryer- excellent purchase and savings- thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I guess I got a bum one - after two or three times using it, the heat would not come on.  Also, the diffuser didn&#x27;t fit on the end of the blower.  Sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> This dryer is lightweight, gets super hot and has the longest chord I&#x27;ve ever had on a hair dryer. I wish I would have shopped around a bit more because I think for the price, I could have found something less expensive and wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference.  I like this hair dryer but it gets the job done in the same way my Conair did but the Conair crapped out (after about 3 years).</li>
            <li> this is a good dryer, the only thing i really have a problem with is how the 1900 doesnt stand for watts, its just part of the name.</li>
            <li> I kept finding different types of this same dryer sold on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t figure out which one to get. I will say even though I didn&#x27;t purchase mine on Amazon, I would highly recommend this! (Maybe even spending full price because I feel refurbished ones could be getting sold judging by the reviews) Anyway. It&#x27;s not just the technique, but the blow dryer that gets salon results! I was REALLY skeptical about spending this much on a blow dryer but its so worth it! For my natural hair, using this dryer gets me relaxed results. My hair was soooo much shinier and softer, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. And I have a big thick head of hair. The technique does matter too because the smaller portions that I blow dried came out nicer than the large portions. It also dried my hair in half the time, probably less! For all of my African American girls out there wondering if this dryer will work with our hair, the answer is ABSOLUTELY! The money I spent on this dryer will pay itself off since I won&#x27;t have to be making as many trips to the salon! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the diffuser doesn&#x27;t attach well. It&#x27;s also very lightweight! It doesn&#x27;t use as much watts as my old Revlon Walmart dryer, which surprised me, but, it gives much better results, more heat, and uses less energy!</li>
            <li> Great product  has multiple ranges  good heat and cool  nice  flow.  Buit solid too  the cord length is good. I dropped it once on a tile floor and it took the impact well no rattles after  the fall.</li>
            <li> Loved it until it stopped working a year later.  I paid $89.99 for a blow dryer that only worked for a year.  When I contacted the maker I was told that there was a good chance the product was a counterfeit.  The seller will not do anything to help me.</li>
            <li> Will not fry your hair.  Long cord. You can choose strong or light drying power.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy about this product.</li>
            <li> Lasted 1 1/2 years, compared to my last FHI blow dryer that lasted over 8 years.  Distributor does not offer a warranty, and neither does the manufacturer, as this particular distributor is not an authorized distributor (learned the hard way).  Very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer in December 2010 and thought hey good reviews so it must be a great hair dryer.  I really did like the hair dryer for the past 2 years, it helped with my hair frizz and it took not as much to blow dry my long thick hair.  Then this past week I smelled this battery smell from where the handle and cord meet and the handle would get hot after 10 minutes of use. I contacted the manufacturer FHI heat and they stated that since I purchased it from Amazon the warranty was void.  It must be purchased from a professional hair salon or directly from them for the warranty to help consumers.  I feel very cheated since this is the first time I ever purchased a hair dryer for over $100.  You would think this product would last more than 2 years 9 months. I paid for quality but did not receive long term quality, sadly. I contacted Amazon and basically they offered me some okay options but not a full refund since the hair dryer was purchased in 2010. They stated they have system restrictions on returns but they were very apologetic and very nice about the situation. They even thanked me for contacting FHI Heat first.  So beware that your hair dryer may not last for a long time, you may think I paid a lot of money so it should last but not in my case. Please note I took great care of the dryer and never dropped it.  Just wanted to add that to my review. Best of luck if you do purchase this hair dryer,</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this hair dryer is lighter and quieter than my previous one, and does seem to dry my hair faster. My hair is relatively thick and it styled in a short bob. It has a long cord, which enables me to dry without feeling restricted by a short cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly short (5&#x27;2&amp;#34;)--and have fairly short arms--so I was looking for a smaller, lightweight blow dryer.  While this served the purpose, there were two problems: (1) The attachments it came with were the wrong-sized attachments for this blow dryer (thus completely useless) and, (2) It stopped working within two months. It was a complete waste of money.  Shortly after the Fhi Nano gave out I was able to find a Baby Bliss TT blow dryer at my local Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with similar attachments, approximately the same size and weight for less than half the price of the Fhi. The attachment fits AND the blow dryer still works!</li>
            <li> i purchased in feb. and come end of October it smells like fire, doesn&#x27;t go on high speeds, and burns the hair on LOW Medium heat. what a disaster. i only PRAY my one year warranty my receipt says i have works.</li>
            <li> I loved it the first two times I used it, then the heat setting stopped working and only cold air came out.</li>
            <li> Most amazing hair dryer I have ever had!! I would defiantly recommend it. It dries my hair in no time.</li>
            <li> This is excellent! I bought it and liked it. I have used it a few times and it worked well.</li>
            <li> Was great while it worked. Died after 3 months. My $20 hair dryer from CVS lasted over 10 years. Very unhappy.</li>
