            <li>So, need I say more?</li>
            <li>Peppermint is my favorite, I love the refreshing feeling of mint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my girl friend who is already satisfied.</li>
            <li>They might judge me, but I don&#x27;t have cracked lips, makes me a better choice for kissing.</li>
            <li>Some flavors are ok but most don&#x27;t glide on smoothly or feel nourishing.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this from my friend, in which she told me that she has seen this first for real cheap and wanted to try it because of the price tag and the flavors.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are wonderful and they came so fast that I was actually surprised to see the delivery man so soon!  </li>
            <li>Great buy, my new favorite chapsticks, and much cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li>I happen to love natural beauty products, and lip balm, so naturally, I love this product that combines those two things!  </li>
            <li>The blue one feels great.</li>
            <li>This is really cheap</li>
            <li>First of all, the variety is a welcome change from the normal watermelon chapstick I have.</li>
            <li>I am most impressed that  formula contains natural, powerful ingredients such as Beeswax, Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, Sunflower, Coconut, Castor, Cocoa Butter and Shea Butter, and their flavors are really fun.  </li>
            <li>I am able to have smooth lips thanks to this.</li>
            <li>Sweet.</li>
            <li>This is helpful and sweet.</li>
            <li>I would love to see more unique flavors in the future too.</li>
            <li>Each one has the same sensational feel on your lips.</li>
            <li>They are super moisturizing and they are a cure for my often chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>these are all safe and highly skin-nurturing ingredients.</li>
            <li>Ive only used the peppermint but seems like they are high quality and great for the price.</li>
            <li>Its a very nice lip balm, great flavors and no more to dry lips!</li>
            <li>This lip balm is a constant in our family as our lips get easily irritated and so a layer of moisture keeps it safe.</li>
            <li>Useful for dryness and cracking of the lips.</li>
            <li>The lip balms are really useful.</li>
            <li>In fact, they smell so good, that my dog tried to eat it the other day.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Mama, you like to share with me&amp;#34; is what he says right before he&#x27;s about to steal it.  </li>
            <li>After &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; one from her, I was able to feel that my dry lips really felt moistened better than just beeswax.</li>
            <li>I have been using other products, and this is not much different, but this one does not have the connotation that using this makes me gay, plus the lingering aftertaste of acai berry is somewhat of a welcome sensation for me.</li>
            <li>I think this is what my first kiss tasted like.</li>
            <li>They are Vegan friendly and the ingredients they use in their products are recognizable: Beeswax, Coconut oil, sunflower see oil, aloe vera, cocoa seed butter, shea butter, and castor seed oil and vitamin E. if you are into natural products you know</li>
            <li>think I will be buying more in the future, as it&#x27;s really fun to have all natural flavored lip balm.  </li>
            <li>But it really reminds me of my first kiss.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>and this really help</li>
            <li>There is a lot of variety and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, but definitely smells like real fruits and not some chemical smell like other lip balms.  </li>
            <li>It makes me want to slather over my whole body and run through the rain naked while clicking my heels.  </li>
            <li>We all need the Acai Berry Natural Lip Balm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are made with all natural ingredients, no parabens&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>That also means these lip balms are truly made of all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and she was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I googled Maple Holistics and checked their &amp;#34;about us&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> THe next is the way this lasts and keeps my lips wet enough to not dry or get chapped.</li>
            <li> actually use these lip balms to moisture dry spots on my face or hand too.  </li>
            <li> , I could apply them all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have been experiencing dry lips for a real long time.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that they did not smell particularly like the scents listed on the tubes and that the product itself was somewhat thick and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasting power is perfection and it doesn&#x27;t make for icky kisses, which brings me to my next point.  </li>
            <li> The money I used is money well spent.</li>
            <li> My dog never tried to eat any of my other lip balms.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, I found some ants on the table where I had the 3 other Maple Holistic lip balms.  </li>
            <li> MH are on par with Burt&#x27;s Bees quality but half the price.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t buy this for the listed effects, we brought this because this is a great wind protector for our lips because windburn is such a bad thing especially in cold places, like when skiing.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of my other lip balms</li>
            <li> I hate it when lip balms have coloring or dyes in them, just a personal preference</li>
            <li> If you put artificial flavor and chemical ingredient lip balms out, I guarantee no animal or insects will try to eat it because they can smell the chemical and unnaturalness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my dog did chew up the lip balm cap and sadly I had to discard the lip balm :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really hate mouth sores</li>

            <li> The blue one feels great. I don&#x27;t care if they see me with a lip balm, this is very comfortable</li>
            <li> This set of lip balms was bought to be given as a gift.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me want to buy stock in the company.  It makes me want to slather over my whole body and run through the rain naked while clicking my heels.  From the moment I tried it, I was in love.  It has the perfect glide-stick ratio.  It&#x27;s not too glossy, not too waxy.  And the scent is heavenly.  It&#x27;s lasting power is perfection and it doesn&#x27;t make for icky kisses, which brings me to my next point.  My 4-year-old son has also fallen in love.  &amp;#34;Mama, you like to share with me&amp;#34; is what he says right before he&#x27;s about to steal it.  I accidentally made the mistake of letting my mom try it and she almost confiscated, too.  We all need the Acai Berry Natural Lip Balm.  All of us!  NEEEEED!  I thought I lost it on vacation last week and I almost wept.  I almost don&#x27;t want to write about it, because I fear that I&#x27;ll try to order some and it&#x27;ll be sold out.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this from my friend, in which she told me that she has seen this first for real cheap and wanted to try it because of the price tag and the flavors. After &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; one from her, I was able to feel that my dry lips really felt moistened better than just beeswax. I had my boyfriend order this immediately. I love the feel this leaves on my lips.</li>
            <li> I happen to love natural beauty products, and lip balm, so naturally, I love this product that combines those two things!  I am most impressed that  formula contains natural, powerful ingredients such as Beeswax, Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, Sunflower, Coconut, Castor, Cocoa Butter and Shea Butter, and their flavors are really fun.

Here in what I love most about this lip balm:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made with all natural ingredients, no parabens&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, leave your lips moisturized and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;The Peppermint and Vanilla flavors are amazing&lt;br /&gt;100% Money Back Guarantee&lt;br /&gt;Fun flavors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will be buying more in the future, as it&#x27;s really fun to have all natural flavored lip balm.  I would love to see more unique flavors in the future too. That would be great! I also felt like the price was more than fair for a multi-pack!</li>
            <li> The lip balm is great for chapped lips. I bought this because I got tired of my other lip balms</li>
            <li> wonderful for the lips. a balm that makes me happy and feel comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> Blown away by the loveliness of these lip balms. First of all, the variety is a welcome change from the normal watermelon chapstick I have. THe next is the way this lasts and keeps my lips wet enough to not dry or get chapped.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this product. Each one has the same sensational feel on your lips. The different flavors of you wish are all Simply wonderful and feel so good to the lip</li>
            <li> My lips feel softer now after using this for a week.</li>
            <li> I really hate mouth sores so I always make sure that I re-apply lip balm.</li>
            <li> Interesting flavors and keeps lips moisturized! Great price and would be perfect for giving as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have been dehydrated a lot before and this is something that is helping me now in coping with my damaged lips.</li>
            <li> Love it! They all smell amazing. Works really well. Keeps my lips moisturized for hours!</li>
            <li> Ive only used the peppermint but seems like they are high quality and great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these lip balms.  They are super moisturizing and they are a cure for my often chapped lips.  The smell is light, but definitely smells like real fruits and not some chemical smell like other lip balms.  In fact, they smell so good, that my dog tried to eat it the other day.  My dog never tried to eat any of my other lip balms.  I left Maple Holistics&#x27; Pomegranate flavor lip balm on my desk.  My 11 lbs terrier/chihuahua mix dog actually jumped on the chair and then climb on the desk to steal the lip balm before running under the bed to chew on the lip balm.  Good thing I catch it before it actually swallowed the inside content.  But my dog did chew up the lip balm cap and sadly I had to discard the lip balm :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I found some ants on the table where I had the 3 other Maple Holistic lip balms.  But I don&#x27;t have any food or beverage on the table, so I was bewildered as to why the ants are on the table.  Turned out they were crawling on my lip balms.  Yes, these lip balms are so organic and tasty that they are actually like food to animals and insects.  I am putting these lip balms in a ziploc bag from now on because all the animal and insects are trying to get my lip balms.  That also means these lip balms are truly made of all natural ingredients.  If you put artificial flavor and chemical ingredient lip balms out, I guarantee no animal or insects will try to eat it because they can smell the chemical and unnaturalness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use these lip balms to moisture dry spots on my face or hand too.  Maple Holistic, please make a face or body stick, I&#x27;d love to buy one like that.  The price for these lip balms are good as I bought them when they are $5 for 4 lip balms.  I hope the price can continue to be this affordable!</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t buy this for the listed effects, we brought this because this is a great wind protector for our lips because windburn is such a bad thing especially in cold places, like when skiing.</li>
            <li> A kiss is sweeter with vanilla. I tried this with my girlfriend and she was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Its a very nice lip balm, great flavors and no more to dry lips!</li>
            <li> Great buy, my new favorite chapsticks, and much cheaper than the store. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Good formula based on the ingredients. This lasts a good while before having to reapply. I have been experiencing dry lips for a real long time.</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t lose anything if I do this for my lips because it gets wind chill after riding out, so I guess I pushed through and this really help</li>
            <li> Useful for dryness and cracking of the lips.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. My first impression was that they did not smell particularly like the scents listed on the tubes and that the product itself was somewhat thick and difficult to apply. After a week of use, my lips were more chapped than ever and I ended up returning the product.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is a constant in our family as our lips get easily irritated and so a layer of moisture keeps it safe.</li>
            <li> The lip balm works great in keeping my lips moist. I drink water before applying it because I do not want it to smear, a habit I picked up with lipstick</li>
            <li> Comforting moisturizer for my lips. It does not leave cracks or lines on my lips, making it real smooth and glossy</li>
            <li> Feels good. Tastes a bit good too. I may have licked this once or twice to make sure.</li>
            <li> This is really cheap and I love the colors! I got three!</li>
            <li> I think this is what my first kiss tasted like. Asked my bf if he uses this he said no. But it really reminds me of my first kiss.</li>
            <li> I have stopped biting my lips after healing them with these.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this!</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms. The ingredients are wonderful and they came so fast that I was actually surprised to see the delivery man so soon!  Buying anything online turns me into an investigator. You buy online to compare prices, ingredients, and if you&#x27;re like me you want to know who the company is that you&#x27;re giving your money to. Naturally, I googled Maple Holistics and checked their &amp;#34;about us&amp;#34; page and was delighted to see that they DO NOT use ingredients that have been tested on animals. They are Vegan friendly and the ingredients they use in their products are recognizable: Beeswax, Coconut oil, sunflower see oil, aloe vera, cocoa seed butter, shea butter, and castor seed oil and vitamin E. if you are into natural products you know these are all safe and highly skin-nurturing ingredients. 5 out of 5 on ingredients.  All the lip balms are dye free!! I hate it when lip balms have coloring or dyes in them, just a personal preference but I don&#x27;t need FD color #whatever on my lips. So I was really happy to see that they had no color.  How they compare with others: EOS and Burt&#x27;s Bees Maple Holistics lip balms are so much better than EOS, honestly EOS... I love their concept but I&#x27;ve found they don&#x27;t work well for me. Some flavors are ok but most don&#x27;t glide on smoothly or feel nourishing.  MH are on par with Burt&#x27;s Bees quality but half the price. So, need I say more? I love BBs but for price MH was just an easy choice because the ingredients are still just as good as in BBs but much more affordable.  Peppermint is my favorite, I love the refreshing feeling of mint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I have been using other products, and this is not much different, but this one does not have the connotation that using this makes me gay, plus the lingering aftertaste of acai berry is somewhat of a welcome sensation for me.</li>
            <li> The lip balms are really useful. There is a lot of variety and it really helps. The money I used is money well spent.</li>
            <li> extremly good product. I bought this item for my girl friend who is already satisfied. it smells, feels, and tastes wonderful!!. it is good for dryness!</li>
            <li> I got two flavors, peppermint and acai berry. my wife has pom and vanilla.</li>
            <li> Sweet. This is helpful and sweet. I am able to have smooth lips thanks to this. They might judge me, but I don&#x27;t have cracked lips, makes me a better choice for kissing.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and it is very cheap too for a pack of four. Thanks</li>
