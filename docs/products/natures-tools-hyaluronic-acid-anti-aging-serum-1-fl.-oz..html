            <li>I was given the opportunity to test this product in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>

            <li>: I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>We all are loving what it has done for our skin.</li>
            <li>disclosure, however, the company does &#x27;reward&#x27; customers by sending them coupon codes/free products to review through their own program.</li>
            <li>Feels so good and lovely lilac scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the awesome product!</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels on my face, the serum is nice</li>
            <li>I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>Good genes, I eat very clean, and have been working out and taking care of myself since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>my skin is soooo supple, fresh and bright!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a gel-like substance and smells strongly of lilac (which I find pleasant, but probably should be avoided if you have an allergy).</li>
            <li>The seller was very good and shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>Due to this excellent product, I am now a loyal and happy customer!  </li>
            <li>This is even more amazing considering that it&#x27;s winter now</li>
            <li>This is a good product for smooth supple skin, but you need an ADE cream to seal the moisture in.</li>
            <li>I thought the bottle perfectly suitable for the gel substance, and the design of the bottle  apropos to contents.</li>
            <li>but I am impressed so far.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to test this out.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>The extra bonus is that this stuff smells great!</li>
            <li>It also make my skin stay way more moisturized with it on.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it for now to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to try this product.  </li>
            <li>First thing I notice about this product was the amazing smell!</li>
            <li>Before I even opened the bottle I was in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>And my patients (i practice dermatology and am not a stranger to Botox and fillers) have commented on how much more youthful I look.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell</li>
            <li>love it don&#x27;t leave my face shine.</li>

            <li>There has been no change with my fine lines.</li>

            <li>As a side note, they also mention a \\&quot;free ebook\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t think I received it</li>
            <li>I very much enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>the customer would receive free products to test.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t an overpowering scent just a light floral one.  </li>
            <li>The best one I&#x27;ve found that has really put the elasticity back in my skin is Collagen Replenish powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the fine lines around my eyes and mouth disappear.</li>
            <li>I love the clean fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Stuff smells nice and goes on smooth but as far as it diminishing fine line and wrinkles what a joke.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and was so excited waiting for it to arrive.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all...</li>
            <li>Love the eye dropper dispenser, makes it that much easier to use the right amount!  </li>
            <li>Those that get full of dirt and never go away, well mine have started shrinking.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and absorbs completely.</li>
            <li>This stuff is light feeling too, and gives my face a fresh cooling feel.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one to try out if you&#x27;re looking for a good wrinkke serum!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>this serum has such a light refreshing lilac scent, I just love it.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a lovely fresh, clean feeling - and, you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot at a time.</li>
            <li>Delivery was really quick.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away how soft my skin felt and how the dryness was almost gone, I am hoping with a couple more uses my skin will be silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>The serum glides on my skin easily, immediately leaving my skin feeling smooth, soft and fresh, not oily at all.</li>
            <li>Out of all the anti-wrinkle serums I&#x27;ve tried so far... I not only love the way it absorbs in my skin, but I love the smell!</li>
            <li>And my friends have commented on how much more youthful I look, definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Botox user,which I will not give up,but this is a huge help</li>
            <li>This serum is completely worth gushing over.</li>
            <li>With this product my skin is so much more clear and radiant looking.</li>
            <li>It will be worth your time to try it.</li>
            <li>I love this product so far, could see a deference in a couple of days...</li>
            <li>After doing some research I found that rarely does hyaluronic acid cause allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>I tried other serums and have come back to this one, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid Skin Serum is superior to other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>But then I showed her my fine lines around my eyes and she was like wow baby!!</li>
            <li>The eye dropper helps me get just the right amount to apply.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that when used with the enclosed dropper, I can get just the right amount out.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin in my t-zone and this cleared it right up, even better than 2800 IU moisturizing cream!  </li>
            <li>I believe the 5 star reviews are those that want free products from this company...in the package I received was a paper that states for all high reviews</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my spouse because he has very dry skin on the top of his hands, my daughter recommended this serum and we have been using it for quite sometime and the dryness is gone!</li>
            <li>It lessens the look of fine lines and wrinkles and makes my skin soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review so the company will stop sending me emails over and over again asking me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li>I really like that!</li>
            <li>This is my first amazon review ever.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I have just ordered more and will only use this seller for Hyaluronic Acid Serum!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I would use it at night the first time to avoid stares from friends/colleagues.</li>
            <li>After the first application, I didn&#x27;t have this issue again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t leave a review on a product until I&#x27;ve used it a week or two; however, after only using this serum for two days I can say, &amp;#34;WOW, this is wonderful!</li>
            <li>So far serum makes skin feel smooth&amp; moist.</li>
            <li>just look younger, my wrinkles are fading and my face looks like it has more life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works on me!</li>
            <li>Which for me is important because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really is like Botox without the needle!  </li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient in the lilac extract, verbascoside, is an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.</li>
            <li>It is excellent for hydration, which I really need since I am unable to drink a lot of water during my teaching hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also ecstatic that it has been gentle on my sensitive skin while still being effective at making me look and feel younger.</li>
            <li>I glide the substance on after a shower, let it dry, then put on a sunscreen based lotion on top of it.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Fine Lines Filler\\&quot;, but no where is this specifically mentioned on the actual packaging of the product, which I thought a bit misleading</li>
            <li>Having very dry skin, I probably use more than a person who does not have that problem.</li>
            <li>I see such a huge difference in my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>so I really did not like the fact that I was already getting wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I have noticed that I really was not expecting was that my skin is so much softer than it was in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face around my eyes and the laugh lines have nearly vanished.</li>
            <li>My skin has really cleared up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had a lot of time to really try the product.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I used it day and night but didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>It make my skin feel much firmer.</li>
            <li>I really like this and want to order again just to see if I think this is working as well as it seems to be.</li>
            <li>I do respect that the company appears to respond regularly to customer reviews on Amazon, though, shows that they take responsibility for their product, seems to be more rare these days, especially on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Wish a larger size was available as I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product,  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t done much for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really seeing a difference-</li>
            <li>My skin felt much softer and firmer.</li>
            <li>I CAN REALLY FEEL THE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>and it really helps with face pigmentation</li>
            <li>My skin felt more firm after the first application.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it very much .</li>
            <li>far, Nerium was the only product I have used that really smoothed out my fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is great to use on dry skin in general, so if you have a problem with dry skin get this and use it a couple of times per day!</li>
            <li>The bottle small so it will pack nicely in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Little fine lines are disappearing!</li>
            <li>Love this product , see slight results I apply it to my face after I shower at night .</li>
            <li>As a woman in my 60s, I have bought so many different facial products to try over the years.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find moisture retention to specifically be \\&quot;Anti Aging\\&quot;, so just be an informed consumer and have realistic</li>
            <li>They are not terribly noticeable or deep set, but they have bothered me for several years.</li>
            <li>Smells good enough to ingest (but you don&#x27;t want to waste any).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My prominent line has diminished by at leas 50% and the little wrinkles are almost gone…</li>
            <li>It is a thick, clean gel that applies smoothly to your face.</li>
            <li>When I was camping with my daughter and grandchildren a couple of weeks ago, a complete stranger thought that I was my daughters older sister!</li>
            <li>Really makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>and I notice my deep smile lines around my mouth and forehead are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks so cannot give a full review, but so far I am liking the it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect if you want to loose years without expensive surgery.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m having these kind of results after only a couple weeks I cant wait to see how it works after a few months, Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Starting to see my skin and fine lines IMPROVE after only a weekWill continue to use.</li>
            <li>I might reduce any new wrinkle lines but not the existing.</li>
            <li>I had a very prominent wrinkle across my forehead with several small wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The back of the box has the directions, which are also not as detailed as the ones on the product description on Amazon, so I would recommend following those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft and that was an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am prone to acne breakouts whdn using face products.</li>
            <li>, I used it the first night and the very next day, my skin had an almost &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it.</li>
            <li>Would love to see a small brush wand for applicator instead of dropper.</li>
            <li>Moisturized skin has a tendency to appear fuller and make fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I found the product to help in making the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable while I was using it.</li>
            <li>Just like a facelift in a bottle!&amp;#34;  I used it for the first time night before last.</li>
            <li>My usually dull, dry skin is so much softer and I feel it gives me more of a glow!</li>
            <li>In fact, I imagine much of the \\&quot;improvements\\&quot; mentioned in other reviews is more due to the gelatinous product drying and leaving a barrier that helps to retain moisture, making the skin appear plumper, rather than any skin/wrinkle damage being reduced.</li>
            <li>I have battled with oily skin and large pores for years spending $100&#x27;s in name brand facial cleaners, masks and serums and non worked.</li>
            <li>I must admit I was a little perturbed when I found out that the company gave some customers free bottles to get them to try it and then write reviews.</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait to get more....</li>
            <li>No word on whether you will continue to receive products if your review is less than positive, but just something to be aware of when reading reviews.</li>
            <li>Just to clear this up just in case, this is not an oil it is a gel.</li>
            <li>This has made my skin soft and plump and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 and appear to be in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I use same product it works very well,but got mine and all my wrinkle products @piping rock.com.</li>
            <li>I bought this product last year and gave it a 5☆ for customer service but much lower for the product itself.</li>
            <li>Still a bit early to see what type of results it will bring, but immediately I noticed it gets rid of the flakes on my skin.  </li>
            <li>so far ....</li>
            <li>Improvement for a 70 year old face with a sealant.</li>
            <li>, once I started to use this Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Lilac Stem Cells from this specific company I was amazed at how fast I got results.</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever made my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had an issue with this serum causing breakouts</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>my skin is soft, smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>It smoothed out my skin and made a wonderful base for me to apply my makeup on.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, and my skin is clearing up for the first time in a long time!  </li>
            <li>I ran out of the bathroom this morning and told my better half that I had them on the run!!!</li>
            <li>highly recommend all women to take collagen daily as well.</li>
            <li>And in the winter my skin usually dry and peel my skin while the oil made my face very oily.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin was damage from recent sun exposure but after applying this serum my skin became smooth after a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about 3 weeks now, which some might say is too short of a time to judge product effectiveness, but after using similar types of products for years, I&#x27;ve found that anywhere between 2 weeks to a month is a decent timeframe to notice if the product is being effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may sound unbelievable, but when I work up yesterday morning, I could already see a big difference in the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The title of the product on Amazon seems to change frequently, but as of this review, it currently implies the product is an \\&quot;Anti Aging Wrinkle Serum\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>This serum left my skin feeling baby soft and hydrated without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>i have just a few lines around my eyes as im still pretty young</li>
            <li>The faint smell is nice.</li>
            <li>This has really helped to soften that skin and irritates her far less than when she uses a lotion moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I had a slight stinging sensation and redness on the applied areas...</li>
            <li>so didn&#x27;t have much faith in the other&#x27;s reviewing it</li>
            <li>I ordered this, based on all of the positive reviews that other people left.  </li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and to not expect miracles but lately I received compliments on my skin , I rarely wear makeup so the improvement shows, when I asked what the difference was from</li>
            <li>I am crossing my fingers that after a few more weeks of twice daily use (in a addition to using the Derma Roller once a day) that I will notice less &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; in the skin on my forehead, around my eyes and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>No research I could find pointed to topical applications of hyaluronic acid of having major skin benefits.</li>
            <li>, what I found was that hyaluronic acid is apparently used in a lot of derma fillers, as it is found naturally in the deeper layers of the skin, but just like any other cream, it does not mean that applying it above the skill would have the same effect.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a free bottle... not fair...</li>
            <li>I am unable to order another bottle just now due to recently becoming disabled but as soon as I can I will order more.</li>
            <li>The redness has gone down in areas that that always really reddish looking, the scar on my chin is lightening up.  </li>
            <li>It is very thick but not that oily so it is easy to absorb</li>
            <li>but if you look at my past reviews on other products you&#x27;ll notice i&#x27;m pretty straight forward striving for truth not perfection ....</li>
            <li>For me, since I am older than my teens, I find that it is helping with my dark circles under my eyes</li>

            <li> received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> Nice size bottle.</li>
            <li> Loving this serum.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use to see what kind of results I get.</li>
            <li> : I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> We all are loving what it has done for our skin.</li>
            <li> disclosure, however, the company does &#x27;reward&#x27; customers by sending them coupon codes/free products to review through their own program.</li>
            <li> Feels so good and lovely lilac scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my face, the serum is nice</li>
            <li> I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Good genes, I eat very clean, and have been working out and taking care of myself since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> my skin is soooo supple, fresh and bright!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a gel-like substance and smells strongly of lilac (which I find pleasant, but probably should be avoided if you have an allergy).</li>
            <li> The seller was very good and shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> Due to this excellent product, I am now a loyal and happy customer!  </li>
            <li> This is even more amazing considering that it&#x27;s winter now</li>
            <li> This is a good product for smooth supple skin, but you need an ADE cream to seal the moisture in.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle perfectly suitable for the gel substance, and the design of the bottle  apropos to contents.</li>
            <li> but I am impressed so far.</li>

            <li> It also make my skin stay way more moisturized with it on.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it for now to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to try this product.  </li>
            <li> First thing I notice about this product was the amazing smell!</li>
            <li> Before I even opened the bottle I was in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> And my patients (i practice dermatology and am not a stranger to Botox and fillers) have commented on how much more youthful I look.  </li>

            <li> of the day, I bought this product to help reduce my fine lines and crows feet around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The fine wrinkle lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I use it at night on my fine lines and I use it under my foundation in the morning</li>

            <li> This is definitely one to try out if you&#x27;re looking for a good wrinkke serum!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> this serum has such a light refreshing lilac scent, I just love it.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a lovely fresh, clean feeling - and, you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot at a time.</li>
            <li> Delivery was really quick.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away how soft my skin felt and how the dryness was almost gone, I am hoping with a couple more uses my skin will be silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> The serum glides on my skin easily, immediately leaving my skin feeling smooth, soft and fresh, not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Out of all the anti-wrinkle serums I&#x27;ve tried so far... I not only love the way it absorbs in my skin, but I love the smell!</li>
            <li> And my friends have commented on how much more youthful I look, definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Botox user,which I will not give up,but this is a huge help</li>
            <li> This serum is completely worth gushing over.</li>
            <li> With this product my skin is so much more clear and radiant looking.</li>
            <li> It will be worth your time to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far, could see a deference in a couple of days...</li>
            <li> After doing some research I found that rarely does hyaluronic acid cause allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> I tried other serums and have come back to this one, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Skin Serum is superior to other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> But then I showed her my fine lines around my eyes and she was like wow baby!!</li>
            <li> The eye dropper helps me get just the right amount to apply.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that when used with the enclosed dropper, I can get just the right amount out.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin in my t-zone and this cleared it right up, even better than 2800 IU moisturizing cream!  </li>
            <li> I believe the 5 star reviews are those that want free products from this company...in the package I received was a paper that states for all high reviews</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my spouse because he has very dry skin on the top of his hands, my daughter recommended this serum and we have been using it for quite sometime and the dryness is gone!</li>
            <li> It lessens the look of fine lines and wrinkles and makes my skin soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review so the company will stop sending me emails over and over again asking me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li> I really like that!</li>
            <li> This is my first amazon review ever.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> I have just ordered more and will only use this seller for Hyaluronic Acid Serum!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I would use it at night the first time to avoid stares from friends/colleagues.</li>
            <li> After the first application, I didn&#x27;t have this issue again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave a review on a product until I&#x27;ve used it a week or two; however, after only using this serum for two days I can say, &amp;#34;WOW, this is wonderful!</li>
            <li> So far serum makes skin feel smooth&amp; moist.</li>
            <li> just look younger, my wrinkles are fading and my face looks like it has more life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works on me!</li>
            <li> Which for me is important because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really is like Botox without the needle!  </li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in the lilac extract, verbascoside, is an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for hydration, which I really need since I am unable to drink a lot of water during my teaching hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also ecstatic that it has been gentle on my sensitive skin while still being effective at making me look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> I glide the substance on after a shower, let it dry, then put on a sunscreen based lotion on top of it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Fine Lines Filler\\&quot;, but no where is this specifically mentioned on the actual packaging of the product, which I thought a bit misleading</li>
            <li> Having very dry skin, I probably use more than a person who does not have that problem.</li>
            <li> I see such a huge difference in my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> so I really did not like the fact that I was already getting wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I have noticed that I really was not expecting was that my skin is so much softer than it was in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face around my eyes and the laugh lines have nearly vanished.</li>
            <li> My skin has really cleared up.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had a lot of time to really try the product.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I used it day and night but didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> It make my skin feel much firmer.</li>
            <li> I really like this and want to order again just to see if I think this is working as well as it seems to be.</li>
            <li> I do respect that the company appears to respond regularly to customer reviews on Amazon, though, shows that they take responsibility for their product, seems to be more rare these days, especially on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Wish a larger size was available as I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product,  </li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done much for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really seeing a difference-</li>
            <li> My skin felt much softer and firmer.</li>
            <li> I CAN REALLY FEEL THE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> and it really helps with face pigmentation</li>
            <li> My skin felt more firm after the first application.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it very much .</li>
            <li> far, Nerium was the only product I have used that really smoothed out my fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is great to use on dry skin in general, so if you have a problem with dry skin get this and use it a couple of times per day!</li>
            <li> The bottle small so it will pack nicely in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Little fine lines are disappearing!</li>
            <li> Love this product , see slight results I apply it to my face after I shower at night .</li>
            <li> As a woman in my 60s, I have bought so many different facial products to try over the years.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find moisture retention to specifically be \\&quot;Anti Aging\\&quot;, so just be an informed consumer and have realistic</li>
            <li> They are not terribly noticeable or deep set, but they have bothered me for several years.</li>
            <li> Smells good enough to ingest (but you don&#x27;t want to waste any).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My prominent line has diminished by at leas 50% and the little wrinkles are almost gone…</li>
            <li> It is a thick, clean gel that applies smoothly to your face.</li>
            <li> When I was camping with my daughter and grandchildren a couple of weeks ago, a complete stranger thought that I was my daughters older sister!</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> and I notice my deep smile lines around my mouth and forehead are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks so cannot give a full review, but so far I am liking the it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect if you want to loose years without expensive surgery.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m having these kind of results after only a couple weeks I cant wait to see how it works after a few months, Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Starting to see my skin and fine lines IMPROVE after only a weekWill continue to use.</li>
            <li> I might reduce any new wrinkle lines but not the existing.</li>
            <li> I had a very prominent wrinkle across my forehead with several small wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The back of the box has the directions, which are also not as detailed as the ones on the product description on Amazon, so I would recommend following those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft and that was an improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am prone to acne breakouts whdn using face products.</li>
            <li> , I used it the first night and the very next day, my skin had an almost &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it.</li>
            <li> Would love to see a small brush wand for applicator instead of dropper.</li>
            <li> Moisturized skin has a tendency to appear fuller and make fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I found the product to help in making the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable while I was using it.</li>
            <li> Just like a facelift in a bottle!&amp;#34;  I used it for the first time night before last.</li>
            <li> My usually dull, dry skin is so much softer and I feel it gives me more of a glow!</li>
            <li> In fact, I imagine much of the \\&quot;improvements\\&quot; mentioned in other reviews is more due to the gelatinous product drying and leaving a barrier that helps to retain moisture, making the skin appear plumper, rather than any skin/wrinkle damage being reduced.</li>
            <li> I have battled with oily skin and large pores for years spending $100&#x27;s in name brand facial cleaners, masks and serums and non worked.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little perturbed when I found out that the company gave some customers free bottles to get them to try it and then write reviews.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to get more....</li>
            <li> No word on whether you will continue to receive products if your review is less than positive, but just something to be aware of when reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Just to clear this up just in case, this is not an oil it is a gel.</li>
            <li> This has made my skin soft and plump and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and appear to be in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use same product it works very well,but got mine and all my wrinkle products @piping rock.com.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year and gave it a 5☆ for customer service but much lower for the product itself.</li>
            <li> Still a bit early to see what type of results it will bring, but immediately I noticed it gets rid of the flakes on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so far ....</li>
            <li> Improvement for a 70 year old face with a sealant.</li>
            <li> , once I started to use this Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Lilac Stem Cells from this specific company I was amazed at how fast I got results.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had an issue with this serum causing breakouts</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> my skin is soft, smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> It smoothed out my skin and made a wonderful base for me to apply my makeup on.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, and my skin is clearing up for the first time in a long time!  </li>
            <li> I ran out of the bathroom this morning and told my better half that I had them on the run!!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend all women to take collagen daily as well.</li>
            <li> And in the winter my skin usually dry and peel my skin while the oil made my face very oily.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin was damage from recent sun exposure but after applying this serum my skin became smooth after a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about 3 weeks now, which some might say is too short of a time to judge product effectiveness, but after using similar types of products for years, I&#x27;ve found that anywhere between 2 weeks to a month is a decent timeframe to notice if the product is being effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may sound unbelievable, but when I work up yesterday morning, I could already see a big difference in the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The title of the product on Amazon seems to change frequently, but as of this review, it currently implies the product is an \\&quot;Anti Aging Wrinkle Serum\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> This serum left my skin feeling baby soft and hydrated without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> i have just a few lines around my eyes as im still pretty young</li>
            <li> The faint smell is nice.</li>
            <li> This has really helped to soften that skin and irritates her far less than when she uses a lotion moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I had a slight stinging sensation and redness on the applied areas...</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t have much faith in the other&#x27;s reviewing it</li>
            <li> I ordered this, based on all of the positive reviews that other people left.  </li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and to not expect miracles but lately I received compliments on my skin , I rarely wear makeup so the improvement shows, when I asked what the difference was from</li>
            <li> I am crossing my fingers that after a few more weeks of twice daily use (in a addition to using the Derma Roller once a day) that I will notice less &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; in the skin on my forehead, around my eyes and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> No research I could find pointed to topical applications of hyaluronic acid of having major skin benefits.</li>
            <li> , what I found was that hyaluronic acid is apparently used in a lot of derma fillers, as it is found naturally in the deeper layers of the skin, but just like any other cream, it does not mean that applying it above the skill would have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a free bottle... not fair...</li>
            <li> I am unable to order another bottle just now due to recently becoming disabled but as soon as I can I will order more.</li>
            <li> The redness has gone down in areas that that always really reddish looking, the scar on my chin is lightening up.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick but not that oily so it is easy to absorb</li>
            <li> but if you look at my past reviews on other products you&#x27;ll notice i&#x27;m pretty straight forward striving for truth not perfection ....</li>
            <li> For me, since I am older than my teens, I find that it is helping with my dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a smell, its kind of hard to explain but its not to bad and really not that strong.</li>
            <li> As to the effectiveness my opinion was negative in the first few days but after about 5 days I then noticed a difference in the texture of my skin it seemed luminescent and not dull.</li>
            <li> The product has the consistency of a gel, therefore I would dip the eye dropper in the product then turn it sideways and glide the product onto my face, rather than use the dropper action, as it&#x27;s not a true liquid.</li>
            <li> The serum is just fine, but not excellent yet.</li>
            <li> My face creases and sun damage are increasingly minimal after only about 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term results are.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s leave my skin so soft and firm.</li>
            <li> company knows what they are doing, I&#x27;ll be using hyaluronic acid serum for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than any other serums I tried.</li>
            <li> Well...now I have to rewrite that review because I finally decided to try the remaining product after 6 months of trying other stuff.</li>
            <li> I had a patch on my cheek that was really dry</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s oily but yet dry.</li>
            <li> After only using for a few days, I can definitely see a difference!</li>
            <li> But a few days ago, I went through my cabinet of creams and serums and got rid of all the facial products I had on hand (some not even opened yet), and all that I kept was this hyaluronic acid serum, and also Yalmeh Aloe Vera Face Moisturizer which I use following the hyaluronic serum.  </li>
            <li> When I started to use the serum I was skeptical at first as I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of anti-aging products in the past and nothing really works no matter</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount so this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The crows feet are hardly noticeable at all and the dark bags are much lighter.</li>
            <li> Less oily, smaller pore appearance.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very dry skin and winter</li>
            <li> My mother in law has been using it on some very dry skin patches on her hand and wrist from an IV mishap of her chemo medication a few years ago that has left her skin dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement in skin, not total removal of creases, but they are definitely softer looking and less harsh.</li>
            <li> My wife says my skin looks healthier and I look a few years younger.</li>
            <li> Within using this for just a few days my face made big changes.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few days  </li>
            <li> I noticed a small change the morning after using it and a few days later I noticed a BIG change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in treatment for 2 weeks still no positive effects</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I have replaced my other serum with this one as I feel it makes my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell after only using for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My dark spots have not faded at all.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount of the product went a long way.</li>
            <li> not a dermatologist or a scientist, I do my research on Google like the average person</li>
            <li> Not sure of the long term affect.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Also some improvement with the slight frown lines i have obtained over the years.</li>
            <li> The little time that I have I have noticed my skin already feel softer.</li>
            <li> It also feels a little tighter to the touch .</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> Also, I have slightly uneven (reddish) skin tone on my cheeks, I hoped it would help even that</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell horrible like many other serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> You use very little, when applying.   </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve chosen 3 stars for this product, which according to Amazon, implies a product that is acceptable, perhaps it could have gone to 3.5 stars, but I was not impressed enough to push it to a 4 or 5 star review</li>
            <li> The product comes in small cardboard outer box, with the product title (\\&quot;Hyaluronic Acid with Lilac Stem</li>
            <li> /&gt;Inside the box is a small glass jar with an eye dropper top/cap.</li>
            <li> Personally, I found applying the product to my face with an eye dropper a bit difficult to deal with...</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a small brush or rubber cube, as you still need to spread the product once it&#x27;s on the skin</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick without being annoying and my face seems to quickly absorb it without any sticky feel or residue.</li>
            <li> I used it morning and evening yesterday and could hardly wait to use it again this morning.</li>
            <li> you know the ones I mean.  </li>
            <li> I really do mean that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been down this road before and was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> and the air is cold and dry.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I will recommend to try it at least once and see it for yourself!</li>
            <li> I have really bad crows feet and bags under my eyes and was looking for something to help make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> In just a few days I noticed those ugly pores on my nose...</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s way too expensive</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, use this product and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely skeptical person by nature</li>
            <li> I like how the serum doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful when I started because I used Botox regular every two -three months and that got to expensive!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it on my entire face twice a day and I have seen improvement.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money! Stuff smells nice and goes on smooth but as far as it diminishing fine line and wrinkles what a joke.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!! I use it along with the micro roller and my brown spots have almost disappeared! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Skin Serum is superior to other products I have tried.  The fragrance is light and pleasant, the serum is not greasy and glides on over your face and decolletage area and absorbs quickly....but the BEST thing is that my skin appears more radiant and glowing, fine lines and wrinkles are being erased and my age spots from years of sun worshiping are fading.  This product does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> After only using for a few days, I can definitely see a difference! My usually dull, dry skin is so much softer and I feel it gives me more of a glow! Love the eye dropper dispenser, makes it that much easier to use the right amount!  I did receive this product at a reduced rate to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Have been using the serum once a day in the morning.  I can definitely see a difference in my skin and the wrinkles are definitely improving, my friends also noticed.  I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything wast of your money</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about purchasing this product,  but after the first use I was sold.  This has made my skin soft and plump and hydrated. The difference is noticeable.  I will definitely be ordering again. This will be part of my skin care regime.  The seller was very good and shipping was fast.  I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum and noticed almost immediately that it makes my skin feel softer. The extra bonus is that this stuff smells great! no sticky or greasy residue, over all a great product.</li>
            <li> wonderful  will buy again</li>
            <li> I have notice a change around my eyes and my entire face....My skin look younger and health now since I started with this product.  This product is great!.  I plan to continue the usage.</li>
            <li> I almost never leave reviews for items I purchase, but felt compelled.  I ordered this, based on all of the positive reviews that other people left.  I&#x27;ve been down this road before and was skeptical.  I have to say, I used it the first night and the very next day, my skin had an almost &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it. Yes, the VERY NEXT DAY.  This is even more amazing considering that it&#x27;s winter now and the air is cold and dry.  I suffer from very dry skin and winter always makes my skin look horrible.  Yet, this stuff make it look refreshed in the middle of winter. I still use face cream because this product does not feel like it moisturizes, but I can&#x27;t deny the benefits of this product.  I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I really like how this serum make my skin feel firm. It also make my skin stay way more moisturized with it on.</li>
            <li> I received this during a promotion for my owm opinion. I decided to give this to my mother since I already have anti aging serums and shes been using and she can tell a difference around her eyes and mouth that the fine lines are becoming smoother. The texture she said is smooth and it absorbs into her skin. No bad smell no nasty residue feeling.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was so excited waiting for it to arrive. As soon as it got here I added it to my morning routine.  In just a few days I noticed those ugly pores on my nose...you know the ones I mean.  Those that get full of dirt and never go away, well mine have started shrinking.  I ran out of the bathroom this morning and told my better half that I had them on the run!!! She just laughed at me.  But then I showed her my fine lines around my eyes and she was like wow baby!! Now I have To get her some too!  Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Results not as claimed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review so the company will stop sending me emails over and over again asking me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first bottle and I&#x27;m using it as directed. It cannot be compared to botox by any means. My dark spots have not faded at all. There has been no change with my fine lines. It is excellent for hydration, which I really need since I am unable to drink a lot of water during my teaching hours.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that the company allow consumers a longer period of time before continually asking to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;So far, Nerium was the only product I have used that really smoothed out my fine lines. For me, it&#x27;s way too expensive so I stopped using it a while ago. I will continue using it for now to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend all women to take collagen daily as well. The best one I&#x27;ve found that has really put the elasticity back in my skin is Collagen Replenish powder. I&#x27;m 42 and appear to be in my early 30&#x27;s. Good genes, I eat very clean, and have been working out and taking care of myself since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I have been noticing a lot of fine lines forming around my mouth.  I am only 45 so I really did not like the fact that I was already getting wrinkles.  I was given the opportunity to test this product in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I can say that I have noticed a difference in the wrinkles.  The one thing I have noticed that I really was not expecting was that my skin is so much softer than it was in the beginning.  I had a patch on my cheek that was really dry and now it is gone.  That was something I was not expecting.  I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to try this product.  It only takes a small amount so this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> First thing I notice about this product was the amazing smell! Before I even opened the bottle I was in love with the scent. The feel of this product on my skin was smooth and then I noticed a tightening sensation. It wasn&#x27;t sticky or gooey like some of the products I have tried. Just a small amount of the product went a long way. Nice size bottle. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and absorbs completely. Noticeable improvement in skin, not total removal of creases, but they are definitely softer looking and less harsh.</li>
            <li> So happy that I was able to get this Anti Aging Serum at a massive discount. trying to find something to help me as I age. I don&#x27;t want to look my age and this product looks like its going to be the ticket Trying it and found that it worked in making the appearance of my face look smoother and much younger looking. I really like that! Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for only about a week and have noticed that my skin is already looking smoother and healthier.  The fine wrinkle lines are disappearing.  It feels like botox in a bottle.  And my patients (i practice dermatology and am not a stranger to Botox and fillers) have commented on how much more youthful I look.  Will keep using the serum and will post an update once I have used it for a while.  But at this point, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use same product it works very well,but got mine and all my wrinkle products @piping rock.com.There products are good and kind to the pocket.</li>
            <li> This is my first amazon review ever. This serum is completely worth gushing over. My face creases and sun damage are increasingly minimal after only about 2 weeks of using it. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term results are. After washing my face, when I apply this it&#x27;s like giving myself a micro-facial. I also love the smell and I&#x27;m recommending it to all my friends, also strangers: your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face around my eyes and the laugh lines have nearly vanished. It&#x27;s perfect if you want to loose years without expensive surgery. It also doesn&#x27;t smell horrible like many other serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have really bad crows feet and bags under my eyes and was looking for something to help make them less noticeable. A friend of mine recommended this to me after she had been using it for a while and was seeing great results with it. I have been using it for a couple weeks now and have noticed a big difference in the appearance of my skin. The crows feet are hardly noticeable at all and the dark bags are much lighter. My wife says my skin looks healthier and I look a few years younger. If I&#x27;m having these kind of results after only a couple weeks I cant wait to see how it works after a few months, Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my complexion. I have suffered with acne for years and my face has always been blotchy. With this product my skin is so much more clear and radiant looking.</li>
            <li> Loving this serum.  Really makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.  The smell is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> Lessened the look of my fine line wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I love it don&#x27;t leave my face shine. I recommend.</li>
            <li> it actually works.  My skin has really cleared up.  The redness has gone down in areas that that always really reddish looking, the scar on my chin is lightening up.  I doubted this product, but on an impulse decided to buy it.  It really is great, and I&#x27;m about to buy another one.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing! I can already see results in just one week of use .....my skin is soooo supple, fresh and bright! The consistency is thick without being annoying and my face seems to quickly absorb it without any sticky feel or residue. And, the price is right which means I will continue to purchase this wonderfully perfected beauty in a bottle.</li>
            <li> awesome product. Makes your skin feel so good. I took it along with Hyaluronic acid capsules.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, and I definitely will keep buying it on Amazon. As a woman in my 60s, I have bought so many different facial products to try over the years.  But a few days ago, I went through my cabinet of creams and serums and got rid of all the facial products I had on hand (some not even opened yet), and all that I kept was this hyaluronic acid serum, and also Yalmeh Aloe Vera Face Moisturizer which I use following the hyaluronic serum.  I am very pleased with the serum and use it around my eyes as well as on my neck and chest.  Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. Little fine lines are disappearing! I love how smooth it makes my face feel. It also leaves a lovely fresh, clean feeling - and, you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot at a time. Bonus.</li>
            <li> Great product, great company.  I&#x27;m on my second order of this and will continue to order.  The company follows up to make sure you got the correct order and are pleased with your purchase.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Well it smell very pleasant!!! I use this before my moisturizer, it help my skin keep moisturized without having shiny face.  I have combination skin so it&#x27;s oily but yet dry. And in the winter my skin usually dry and peel my skin while the oil made my face very oily. The product help to moisturize without making my face shiny from oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product , see slight results I apply it to my face after I shower at night . Will continue to use . Should make it in bigger jars</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have been using it for almost a month now and I notice my deep smile lines around my mouth and forehead are not as noticeable., my pores are smaller and I can say I do look younger. When I was camping with my daughter and grandchildren a couple of weeks ago, a complete stranger thought that I was my daughters older sister! I am 58! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product has help my wrinkles. I will buy more. Love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had a lot of time to really try the product. The little time that I have I have noticed my skin already feel softer. I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference already it&#x27;s only been 2 days. I would encourage anyone to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I was happy with the results I was getting.  My skin was very soft and that was an improvement.  Then, I used it in conduction with a derma roller and OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  Two times using it after the derma roller and what a HUGE difference in my forehead wrinkles. I had a very prominent wrinkle across my forehead with several small wrinkles.  My prominent line has diminished by at leas 50% and the little wrinkles are almost gone….after just TWO times.  Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim with an amazon gift card and it was the best decision ever. I have battled with oily skin and large pores for years spending $100&#x27;s in name brand facial cleaners, masks and serums and non worked. Within using this for just a few days my face made big changes. Less oily, smaller pore appearance. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results over time! A must buy!</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  I used it day and night but didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> This is a liquid moisturizing liquid.  A little bit goes a long way. It make my skin feel much firmer. Having very dry skin, I probably use more than a person who does not have that problem. It does not have an oily feel to it.  It leaves the skin feeling a lot firmer.  I have really enjoyed this product.  It arrived before I was expecting it.  It will be worth your time to try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than any other serums I tried. Its smell is amazing. I am not sure if it works but I love using it. Will buy again if the price does not go up.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year and gave it a 5☆ for customer service but much lower for the product itself. Well...now I have to rewrite that review because I finally decided to try the remaining product after 6 months of trying other stuff. I now have to change my total score to 5+☆&#x27;s.  This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m not kidding. I didn&#x27;t give it a chance. I must admit I was a little perturbed when I found out that the company gave some customers free bottles to get them to try it and then write reviews. I didn&#x27;t get a free bottle... not fair...😕... I am unable to order another bottle just now due to recently becoming disabled but as soon as I can I will order more. Trust me people you&#x27;ll be glad u gave it a chance.... I can hardly wait to get more....I&#x27;ll never try anything else cause this is the best s***e on the market!!!!&lt;br /&gt;☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆</li>
            <li> This stuff works good i have just a few lines around my eyes as im still pretty young but im seeing improvement in them. Also some improvement with the slight frown lines i have obtained over the years. This also has a lovely smell to it. I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and to not expect miracles but lately I received compliments on my skin , I rarely wear makeup so the improvement shows, when I asked what the difference was from before I was told that my skin looked fresher . It also feels a little tighter to the touch . I have been using the Serum for about four weeks in the morning under a moisturizer, I have not been using it at night yet since I wanted to see if it worked using it once a day. So far I like it very much .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for only about a week and have noticed that my skin is already looking smoother. The fine wrinkle lines around my eyes are disappearing.</li>
            <li> This product is great!!  I have been using it a short time, and I have already noticed that my wrinkles are fading.  My skin feels so soft, and my skin is clearing up for the first time in a long time!  It evens smells great!  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Still a bit early to see what type of results it will bring, but immediately I noticed it gets rid of the flakes on my skin.  I have dry skin in my t-zone and this cleared it right up, even better than 2800 IU moisturizing cream!  This stuff is light feeling too, and gives my face a fresh cooling feel.</li>
            <li> so far .... SO EXCELLENT ~ I&#x27;ll get back in a month to update .... this is the 60 whose face looks 40 no joke .....wish i had a before and after but if you look at my past reviews on other products you&#x27;ll notice i&#x27;m pretty straight forward striving for truth not perfection ....</li>
            <li> I love this Serum!  My skin is soft, smooth and glowing.  I tried other serums and have come back to this one, it&#x27;s the best! My skin tone is now even, moist even in the colder months, and has plumped up my skin.  Due to this excellent product, I am now a loyal and happy customer!  I have just ordered more and will only use this seller for Hyaluronic Acid Serum!  Don&#x27;t hesitate, use this product and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I really like this and want to order again just to see if I think this is working as well as it seems to be.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to look brighter after using for 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve been getting comments that I &amp;#34;look good&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Hard to tell after only using for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> very impressed with this product..can&#x27;t wait for them to come out with more serums for skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product. It makes my skin feel good and It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy. I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my spouse because he has very dry skin on the top of his hands, my daughter recommended this serum and we have been using it for quite sometime and the dryness is gone! We are very pleased with the result and will continue using it. It is also great for the face, it helps with wrinkles, I have been adding it to my facial moisturizer. All around great serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far, could see a deference in a couple of days... Not disappointed at all... I will recommend to try it at least once and see it for yourself! ;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks and I am truly amazed at how much I am in love with this product. My face feels and looks really great. Bought 2 more bottles at a very reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> Starting to see my skin and fine lines IMPROVE after only a weekWill continue to use. Would love to see a small brush wand for applicator instead of dropper. You use very little, when applying.   Update!  This week will be one month of FAITHFULLY using it day and night PLUS WITH the  aid of ponds cold cream. Combination of both night n day. HAS MY FACE LOOKING WRINKLE FREE! This does what it claims H.Acid works! Don&#x27;t spend your money on anything, else! I was doubtful when I started because I used Botox regular every two -three months and that got to expensive!! Was looking for an alternative to Botox n I&#x27;m glad to say I DID! Try it and you will see got your self. I don&#x27;t blow up any product unless it does. My thoughts are the TRUTH :)))) I will continue to buy and tell everyone my secret weapon against wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product will order again</li>
            <li> I have just begun using the serum.  It is very soothing on my skin and feels great.  Will continue to use to see what kind of results I get.</li>
            <li> Out of all the anti-wrinkle serums I&#x27;ve tried so far... I not only love the way it absorbs in my skin, but I love the smell! I have been using this for a few days now and I have replaced my other serum with this one as I feel it makes my skin feel smoother. This is definitely one to try out if you&#x27;re looking for a good wrinkke serum!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I received this hyaluronic acid for a product review and I love it. It is a serum that has lilac stem cell and is an alternative to botox. This serum will work wonders on your face. It combats the signs of aging, blackheads, pimples and shiny skin. I love it. I use it and my teen daughters use it. We all are loving what it has done for our skin. It is a thick, clean gel that applies smoothly to your face. It does not feel oily or greasy. We use it once a day for our skin and it has worked well for all of us. For me, since I am older than my teens, I find that it is helping with my dark circles under my eyes and it helps with the puffiness of my face. It is easy to use and the results are fantastic. I do not want to go have needles and botulism put into my face, so I am glad that there is a safe, pain free alternative. It is great to use on dry skin in general, so if you have a problem with dry skin get this and use it a couple of times per day! My mother in law has been using it on some very dry skin patches on her hand and wrist from an IV mishap of her chemo medication a few years ago that has left her skin dry and damaged. This has really helped to soften that skin and irritates her far less than when she uses a lotion moisturizer. It is really awesome how well it works.</li>
            <li> The sale price was great. This was why I bought them for trying again. The serum is just fine, but not excellent yet. I might reduce any new wrinkle lines but not the existing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about 3 weeks now, which some might say is too short of a time to judge product effectiveness, but after using similar types of products for years, I&#x27;ve found that anywhere between 2 weeks to a month is a decent timeframe to notice if the product is being effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve chosen 3 stars for this product, which according to Amazon, implies a product that is acceptable, perhaps it could have gone to 3.5 stars, but I was not impressed enough to push it to a 4 or 5 star review, I&#x27;ll explain why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line of this review is that I found the serum definitely helped in moisture retention, but don&#x27;t fall into the trap of thinking it is wrinkle reversing. Moisturized skin has a tendency to appear fuller and make fine lines less noticeable. The title of the product on Amazon seems to change frequently, but as of this review, it currently implies the product is an \\&quot;Anti Aging Wrinkle Serum\\&quot;, \\&quot;Fine Lines Filler\\&quot;, but no where is this specifically mentioned on the actual packaging of the product, which I thought a bit misleading and I don&#x27;t find moisture retention to specifically be \\&quot;Anti Aging\\&quot;, so just be an informed consumer and have realistic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the more detailed impressions on the product, I&#x27;ll go into the packaging. The product comes in small cardboard outer box, with the product title (\\&quot;Hyaluronic Acid with Lilac Stem Cell\\&quot;). I mentioned the packaging of the product didn&#x27;t make anti-aging claims, unlike the Amazon title, the claims are simply: \\&quot;Brighter + Balanced Hydrating Serum\\&quot;. The back of the box has the directions, which are also not as detailed as the ones on the product description on Amazon, so I would recommend following those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box is a small glass jar with an eye dropper top/cap. Personally, I found applying the product to my face with an eye dropper a bit difficult to deal with...The product has the consistency of a gel, therefore I would dip the eye dropper in the product then turn it sideways and glide the product onto my face, rather than use the dropper action, as it&#x27;s not a true liquid. I would have preferred a small brush or rubber cube, as you still need to spread the product once it&#x27;s on the skin and you lose product by smearing it with the dropper and then spreading it with your fingers. All in all a bit clunky, but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the product itself, it&#x27;s a gel-like substance and smells strongly of lilac (which I find pleasant, but probably should be avoided if you have an allergy). I glide the substance on after a shower, let it dry, then put on a sunscreen based lotion on top of it. The first time I used the product I had a slight stinging sensation and redness on the applied areas...I would use it at night the first time to avoid stares from friends/colleagues. After the first application, I didn&#x27;t have this issue again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is sticky, but once it dries on your skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film, but I can tell there&#x27;s a moisture barrier there. I found the product to help in making the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable while I was using it. That is, the moisture retention puffed up the skin a bit, so they weren&#x27;t as obvious. Once it washes or wears off, the effects are gone, which is fine, if that&#x27;s your expectation of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a dermatologist or a scientist, I do my research on Google like the average person, what I found was that hyaluronic acid is apparently used in a lot of derma fillers, as it is found naturally in the deeper layers of the skin, but just like any other cream, it does not mean that applying it above the skill would have the same effect. In fact, I imagine much of the \\&quot;improvements\\&quot; mentioned in other reviews is more due to the gelatinous product drying and leaving a barrier that helps to retain moisture, making the skin appear plumper, rather than any skin/wrinkle damage being reduced. No research I could find pointed to topical applications of hyaluronic acid of having major skin benefits. Again, I&#x27;m not an expert. Just trying to help set expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of the day, I bought this product to help reduce my fine lines and crows feet around my eyes. They are not terribly noticeable or deep set, but they have bothered me for several years. I&#x27;m glad the appearance is minimized and the moisture retention aspect is great, but I do feel I was \\&quot;upsold\\&quot; the product in terms of reversing wrinkles/anti-aging. Also, I have slightly uneven (reddish) skin tone on my cheeks, I hoped it would help even that as well (I saw no difference in terms of tone). As a side note, they also mention a \\&quot;free ebook\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t think I received it (it&#x27;s not in my Amazon digital content), not really a big deal, as I wasn&#x27;t planning on reading it anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure, however, the company does &#x27;reward&#x27; customers by sending them coupon codes/free products to review through their own program. No word on whether you will continue to receive products if your review is less than positive, but just something to be aware of when reading reviews. I do respect that the company appears to respond regularly to customer reviews on Amazon, though, shows that they take responsibility for their product, seems to be more rare these days, especially on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave a review on a product until I&#x27;ve used it a week or two; however, after only using this serum for two days I can say, &amp;#34;WOW, this is wonderful! Just like a facelift in a bottle!&amp;#34;  I used it for the first time night before last. It may sound unbelievable, but when I work up yesterday morning, I could already see a big difference in the lines around my eyes. I used it morning and evening yesterday and could hardly wait to use it again this morning. It goes on smoothly, has a nice scent, and isn&#x27;t oily. The bottle small so it will pack nicely in my makeup bag. The eye dropper helps me get just the right amount to apply. It doesn&#x27;t take much. I&#x27;m excited to see the fine lines around my eyes and mouth disappear. I highly recommend this product. It truly is amazing.</li>
            <li> Have been using product for 1 week. Feels so good and lovely lilac scent. Use morning and evening. Now seeing results in softer, smoother face. Wish a larger size was available as I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the serum for only about a week and have noticed that my skin is already looking smoother and healthier. The fine wrinkle lines are disappearing. It feels like botox in a bottle. And my friends have commented on how much more youthful I look, definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Botox user,which I will not give up,but this is a huge help</li>
            <li> I like the feel and smell. Not sure of the long term affect. Still using. Prob will order more soon</li>
            <li> This is a good product for smooth supple skin, but you need an ADE cream to seal the moisture in. Improvement for a 70 year old face with a sealant. You just need a lid for this cup of dew</li>
            <li> I really like this product,  it&#x27;s leave my skin so soft and firm. I really recommend it. It does a good work. I am planning to buy it again.</li>
            <li> So far serum makes skin feel smooth&amp; moist.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done much for me &amp;  I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle perfectly suitable for the gel substance, and the design of the bottle  apropos to contents. As to the effectiveness my opinion was negative in the first few days but after about 5 days I then noticed a difference in the texture of my skin it seemed luminescent and not dull. I purchased 3 bottles so have plenty of time to send another review in coming weeks.</li>
            <li> very nice smelling and feels good. But we can&#x27;t see the difference with the existing  wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;no noticeable difference in the skin quality.</li>
            <li> Delivery was really quick. Before even applying, I noticed how great the serum smelled. I have very sensitive skin and am prone to acne breakouts whdn using face products. This serum left my skin feeling baby soft and hydrated without feeling oily. Any lines around my eyes are starting to disappear. All in all I am very pleased. Would definitely reccommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to use this serum and my skin is beautiful! I&#x27;m really seeing a difference- my skin is soft, smooth and firm. And I particularly love it because it&#x27;s repairing some of my skin damage from being a sun worshipper for so many years. I can&#x27;t imagine how great it&#x27;s going to look after using this product over a longer period of time! I&#x27;m also ecstatic that it has been gentle on my sensitive skin while still being effective at making me look and feel younger. I&#x27;m glad I ordered this Hyaluronic Acid Serum witih Lilac Stem Cells to add to my anti-aging arsenal. Thanks for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is an update on this hyaluronic acid skin serum that I bought couple weeks ago. I really love it ,I can tell the difference when I put on the product and moisturize , even the next morning I wake up with plumper and firmer skin! I don&#x27;t want to be without it ,would buy it again and recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. I did notice the changes in 2 weeks. My skin felt much softer and firmer. The smell and color is doable when you see great effects.</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy this product. I do feel like my skin is brighter and more toned since I started using the product. The product arrived sooner than expected and was perfectly packaged!</li>
            <li> This serum has worked as well as everyone says. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I started to use the serum I was skeptical at first as I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of anti-aging products in the past and nothing really works no matter what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, once I started to use this Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Lilac Stem Cells from this specific company I was amazed at how fast I got results. I noticed a small change the morning after using it and a few days later I noticed a BIG change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, my friends are commenting that they see a noticeable difference !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just look younger, my wrinkles are fading and my face looks like it has more life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company knows what they are doing, I&#x27;ll be using hyaluronic acid serum for a long time to come.  And I&#x27;ve already recommended it to friends too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Highly Recommend*</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my face, the serum is nice but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.  Wrinkles are still there after using it for over a month,</li>
            <li> I love this. Keeps me wen hydrated amd fir.</li>
            <li> I believe the 5 star reviews are those that want free products from this company...in the package I received was a paper that states for all high reviews the customer would receive free products to test. This product does nothing. I will finish the product and if I see Botox in a bottle, I will come back and eat my words. But for now I see nothing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond amazing! Seriously. I am an extremely skeptical person by nature so didn&#x27;t have much faith in the other&#x27;s reviewing it but for the price I gave it a try. I am telling all of my friends to buy! I even put it on my husbands frown lines. Smells good enough to ingest (but you don&#x27;t want to waste any).</li>
            <li> It really works on me! Thank you its the best!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great on my skin. Nothing has ever made my skin so soft.  I really do mean that.  The faint smell is nice. I have only used this a few days  but I am impressed so far.</li>
            <li> I am in treatment for 2 weeks still no positive effects</li>
            <li> Great product and the best customer service ever.  Have already purchased a second bottle.</li>
            <li> very good. I love the serum</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A GREAT PRODUCT, I REALLY LOVE IT. I CAN REALLY FEEL THE DIFFERENCE ON MY SKIN AFTER USING IT. WILL BE ORDERING MORE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for about a week now, but I already like it. I can&#x27;t speak for the anti wrinkle part of it as its too soon to tell but I have noticed a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes. I like how the serum doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or sticky. So far I haven&#x27;t had an issue with this serum causing breakouts so that&#x27;s also a plus. I will continue to use this and update my review in a couple weeks. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to test this out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I love this hyaluronic acid!! I see such a huge difference in my skin since I started using it. I use it at night on my fine lines and I use it under my foundation in the morning and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a lot of my friends.</li>
            <li> Very good product makes skins soft and smooth will purchase again</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin was damage from recent sun exposure but after applying this serum my skin became smooth after a few days.</li>
            <li> Just to clear this up just in case, this is not an oil it is a gel. I didn&#x27;t realize this when I bought it until I opened it and went to use it. It does have a bit of a smell, its kind of hard to explain but its not to bad and really not that strong. Hyaluronic acid has been promoted as a &amp;#34;fountain of youth.&amp;#34; Some people apply hyaluronic acid to the skin for healing wounds, burns, skin ulcers, and as a moisturizer and to prevent the effects of aging. After doing some research I found that rarely does hyaluronic acid cause allergic reactions. Which for me is important because I have sensitive skin. This product also has lilac stem cell. Stem cells from plants are one of the newest anti-aging ingredients. Lilac stem cells have been shown to be a treatment for acne disorders. The active ingredient in the lilac extract, verbascoside, is an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. So the mix together is almost like a miracle mix. I noticed right away how soft my skin felt and how the dryness was almost gone, I am hoping with a couple more uses my skin will be silky smooth.  I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I love using this serum after I&#x27;ve washed my face because it feels like liquid silk. It lessens the look of fine lines and wrinkles and makes my skin soft &amp; supple. I have sensitive skin and this serum has such a light refreshing lilac scent, I just love it. It&#x27;s like a mini face-lift in a bottle. I was specially selected to try this serum at a special price and share my honest feedback with you here in this review. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it and ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks so cannot give a full review, but so far I am liking the it. The serum is more like a gel, which I love, as my skin tends to be on the oily side. The serum glides on my skin easily, immediately leaving my skin feeling smooth, soft and fresh, not oily at all. I love the clean fresh fragrance. I am crossing my fingers that after a few more weeks of twice daily use (in a addition to using the Derma Roller once a day) that I will notice less &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; in the skin on my forehead, around my eyes and around my mouth. Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> This is a very good face serum. It is very thick but not that oily so it is easy to absorb and it really helps with face pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;I love that my skin look healthier and I also feel it thither&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements. It did not meet thw expectations .</li>
            <li> The results from using Hyaluronic Serum with lilac stem cells can be seen almost immediately.  It really is like Botox without the needle!  My skin felt more firm after the first application.  I like the fact that when used with the enclosed dropper, I can get just the right amount out.  It is a good makeup primer.  It smoothed out my skin and made a wonderful base for me to apply my makeup on.  I absolutely love the scent.  It isn&#x27;t an overpowering scent just a light floral one.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing in exchange for my opinion and review. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other way.</li>
