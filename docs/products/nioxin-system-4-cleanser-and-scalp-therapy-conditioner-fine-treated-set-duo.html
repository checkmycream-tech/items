            <li>Probably the best shampoo and conditioner ever for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>best for my thinning fine hair</li>
            <li>Amazing deal, great savings.  </li>
            <li>good stuff good price</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see how handfuls of hair falling out constantly good.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be patient because I bought the 4 litres after reading all the brilliant reviews online, but I am not taking any more chances.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be good</li>
            <li>Good cleansing and conditioning prep for any scalp treatment.  </li>
            <li>However, it is a great product and I have a reasonably nice head of hair and no bald spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using volumizing hair powders on the thinner spots and a good hair spray.</li>
            <li>I also use the scalp treatment foam that is good too.</li>
            <li>Loved the product.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but incorrect shipment.  </li>
            <li>However, incredibly, while she was preparing to cut my hair, while she was talking, I caught her putting more drops of serum on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>GOOD STUFF and IT</li>
            <li>I have always loved nioxin products.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent deal if these products are genuine.</li>

            <li>It is a good product and my doctor suggest me to use</li>
            <li>and it is good</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>

            <li>It has made an amazing difference from the time I started using it.</li>
            <li>Thank  your for sending me this great buy and huge bottles of Nioxin.  </li>
            <li>Product is amazing--</li>
            <li>These products are amazing.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this product about a year ago; she&#x27;d been using it herself and her hair looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>ALL of their products are amazing and have SAVED my hair.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing and solved my thinning hair problem.  </li>
            <li>And as effective as Nioxin is, I couldn&#x27;t deduct a start for smell.  </li>
            <li>The price of the product has soared and it was nice to get some relief with the price from Amazon.</li>
            <li>If you are suffering from hair loss or thinning hair, Nioxin is effective if DHT is the cause of the problem.</li>
            <li>will order again, fast and wonderful product!</li>
            <li>It works SO much better than even a prescription ketoconazole shampoo, and smells/feels good.</li>
            <li>reviews most were good</li>
            <li>My hairstylist had used this on my hair &amp; I liked the results.</li>
            <li>She has recorded it many times so must be good.</li>
            <li>It must be used soon after the date code to be effective.  </li>
            <li>awesome price and fast service.</li>
            <li>Used about 1 week- liked because it made my hair feel smooth/</li>
            <li>Really liked how it made my hair feel but not the scalp sores.  </li>
            <li>Good but too many types and sizes</li>
            <li>I liked the mint in the conditioner, i used it for 9 months</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and I haven&#x27;t lost as much hair while using this.</li>
            <li>My head feels nice coming out of the shower, though.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Product is excellent.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that it appears that it has stabilized my hair loss.  </li>
            <li>(The leaf oil and menthol warm it up.)</li>
            <li>The cleanser and shampoo are nice</li>
            <li>My wife is loving this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Really works, worth the money!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair grows so much faster, and is so healthy now!!!</li>
            <li>They both are great and the size of the bottles are so worth the price!</li>
            <li>And as always Amazon provided best pricing and super fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>I had to go in for a cut and all my new best friend said was</li>
            <li>I love Nioxin and really happy to see it available again.</li>
            <li>Called Nioxin and was told their expired products won&#x27;t hurt our hair but will do nothing to help it.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon customer service is great and quickly offered a refund.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had an experienced hairdresser who recommended I try the Nioxin.  </li>
            <li>I did have to temper my expectations somewhat, but I am more than pleased with what I am seeing!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>Even if I don&#x27;t get new hair growth, I think I&#x27;ve just found my favorite shampoo/conditioner!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and recommended to me by the University of Florida after consulting with them about my hair thinning so much.  </li>
            <li>So far, there&#x27;s no miracle shampoo but Nizoral seems to be the best for me.</li>
            <li>The scalp therapy product sure does tingle the scalp and makes your hair nice and</li>
            <li>Great winter fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I honestly believe this product has helped me regrow hair, I can see it along my forehead, and thickening hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li>this shampoo conditioner combination is the best for me for a clear scalp and also for maintaining my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, kind of a minty smell.  </li>
            <li>Sent quickly, well packaged, great price and now my hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li>( so I wont fry it anymore) and My hair is very fine as well.</li>
            <li>and my mom does too, because her hair is very fine and oily</li>
            <li>I started using Nioxin shampoo and conditioner about 3 years ago after my sister-in-law told me about it, she has very fine hair</li>
            <li>I use it every days, and my hair started to stay really strong!</li>
            <li>Feels so good on your scalp, after I use Shampoo and then Conditioner, my hair feels and smells so fresh and minty!</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it really smells good!</li>
            <li>I kept using it though because my sister in law had experienced such great results with it</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have been using Nioxin with great results since 2008 when I was first introduced to it by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>I guess I should have known it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>So I told her I didn&#x27;t believe there was anything that could work to help my fine frail thinning hair!</li>
            <li>So nice makes your hair looks ok shinning and feel so clean, I personally love the kind of minty scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very passionate about too many products out there, but for this one I am because it is so amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really love this production.</li>
            <li>I purchased a smaller sized set with the scalp therapy and was so impressed</li>
            <li>Love Nioxin system&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE free shipping!</li>
            <li>so I was so upset to be able to literally see my scalp thru my hair when it started to thin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These products take time to show results but I believe they do work better than most others on the market.</li>
            <li>I was most concerned with authenticity.  </li>
            <li>I started using Nioxin in 2007 and am still using it today :)</li>
            <li>Love the tingle on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I was losing hair rapidly, and this system has stopped most of that.  </li>
            <li>love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Also I have had way more breakage.</li>
            <li>ok, I tried this once before about a month again</li>
            <li>I was just trying to find a better price.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>will buy more when out.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed increased hair shedding/thinning for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with product have seen results</li>
            <li>I love the minty feel.  </li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I had way more scalp than hair.</li>
            <li>okay, what&#x27;s to lose?</li>
            <li>If my hair went much more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is more than 1/4\\&quot; between any two hairs</li>
            <li>I have been using WEN products for a while now, since i had my hair FRIED from bleaching at the salon, and all of the top of my hair SPLIT off.</li>
            <li>so i read alittle about it, and it said it works better if you use the shampoo( cleanser and scalp</li>
            <li>but it was OK...</li>
            <li>then We all can see YOUR post of how well it did for you too!.:)</li>
            <li>This is the best cleaning system for thinning hair especially for hair that is chemically treated.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser is always amazed that my bleach/highlighted hair remains so healthy, and I&#x27;m sure that these Nioxin products are a part of that.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the tingly feel that you get on your scalp when using these products...</li>
            <li>I would have been able to purchase just one for the cost of the two at the store.</li>
            <li>I just love Nioxin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li>, I got a cute pixie</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I told you\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>and I am extremely satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and has helped in hair replacement after illness and drug related hair loss.</li>
            <li>My hair is in better condition too.</li>
            <li>I love Nioxin products.</li>
            <li>and it does feel like I have more hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how it is after more time.</li>
            <li>Simply the best on the market. .</li>
            <li>My hair fell out more than ever before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy.  </li>
            <li>, smell was okay</li>
            <li>It made my hair grow longer faster, but the follicles didn&#x27;t increase in thickness by any means, and it dries out my hair more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I do like the tingling sensation and minty smell of the shampoo, but otherwise these are just OK.</li>
            <li>I was really happy to find it at such a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product does not seem to be the authentic Nioxin.</li>
            <li>You have nothing to lose except more hair by not giving it a chance.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product once more and started using it.</li>
            <li>It it looks &amp; feels better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the fullness of my hair since using this product.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and see if I have better results with continued use.</li>
            <li>will continue to purchase more as needed.</li>
            <li>I love, love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>glad my sister-in-law shared it with me</li>
            <li>Nioxin 4 has a minting scent and a refreshing tingle on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I know that some products do say that you may notice more thinning before it starts working.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my scalp and my hair hasn&#x27;t been softer.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Now amazon price is comparible to most salons and ULTA.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner really works with hair that is falling</li>
            <li>Just make sure to rinse thoroughly to avoid flaking.</li>
            <li>Make sure you order the correct system as this is meant for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It would be more believable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>They do seem to work ok for now.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>My hair feels fuller and more bouncy.</li>
            <li>My barber bills have gone through the roof. :-).  </li>
            <li>but I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>It is simply the best!</li>
            <li>It is ok.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to read and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>more keeps falling out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I notice a visible difference, but I trust the reputation of this product to keep my hair from thinning more than it already has.</li>
            <li>After 15 years of using it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working anymore</li>
            <li>After about a week, got focused on finding a better way to deal with this because I do like</li>
            <li>Fast service and great product</li>
            <li>Ok then.</li>
            <li>Gives me more confidence</li>
            <li>and I feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>Love it，</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not too impressed with the &amp;#34;scalp cleanser&amp;#34; (who needs a liter of shampoo?), the scalp therapy definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li>really works great for thinning hair</li>
            <li>nioxin has been my husbands favorite line for many many years now.  </li>
            <li>Using the cleanser and conditioner has given my hair more body and shine.</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>and I did 3 pumps of cleanser and massaged through my hair from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>and I lather my hair from top to bottom and let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for the better part of 15 years</li>
            <li>I will continue use :-)</li>
            <li>Pleased with both cleanser and scalp therapy conditioner...</li>
            <li>I love the cleanser and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years</li>
            <li>colored.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products and Nioxin</li>
            <li>and I wash my hair about twice a week at most.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the shampoo and the tingling from the conditioner.</li>
            <li>With prime I got my product within two days and the whole process was great.</li>
            <li>Nothing better than this to grow your hair</li>
            <li>I would a most call it miraculous.</li>
            <li>have been using it for years now and love the product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I only order on Amazon as its best price.</li>
            <li>5-6x. :-)</li>
            <li>Not any more.  </li>
            <li>but it is so much better and thicker.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair healthy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the Nixon bottles and after about 3 months, I noticed more hair loss again even while continued the supplements.  </li>
            <li>Gives hair more body and looks fuller.</li>
            <li>My hair does look fuller and thicker and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I however LOVE the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have been reading alot about the Nioxin and found that buyers are pleased with the product if it is made in USA, but not if made in Mexico.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had research it more for the kit.</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you have SUPER fine hair this could be a really good thing for you, it makes your scalp tingle (in a good way, not a bad, burning way)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked :)</li>
            <li>Love the feel of my hair after using though.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love how the makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>As a result I am pulling out more hair.</li>
            <li>From that time I started see my scalp thru hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li>My hair was falling out even more.  </li>
            <li>conditioner is just ok..</li>
            <li>so it is in your best interest to rule out any medical condition that can be causing your thinning or balding hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Nioxin System because my hair was thinning, and the top of my scalp was peeking through my hair.  </li>
            <li>ive been using this for a while,i love it</li>
            <li>love this products.</li>
            <li>I love using this, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker</li>
            <li>Once I got the hair loss under control, I was able to just use the cleanser/conditioner(scalp therapy).</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it</li>
            <li>The #4 shampoo is great, has a lovely minty smell and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Hair feels thicker and is more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad my niece in Ca.</li>
            <li>My scalp is still on the mend but 90% better than it was after about three months of use.  </li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t needed to buy any more</li>
            <li>Great price for a great product that works extremely well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice scents, and rinses out clean.  </li>
            <li>Leaves scalp feeling clean, warm, and tingly.</li>
            <li>It  is gentle for my thinning and very fine hair and keeps it in good condition.</li>
            <li>The sixe is perfect and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>My hair loss has reduced significantly!</li>
            <li>Awesome Product, I got rid of my dry scalp</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent and very nice/effective shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the shipping was so easy.</li>
            <li>It just makes my scalp feel so clean!</li>
            <li>I bought this System #4 after using System #2 because the bulk price was very good compared to buying this same product in a Hair Care product store.</li>
            <li>The bottles are huge and I love that.</li>
            <li>OK, I know writing a review should not be done until I can evaluate how it works, but I think it&#x27;s important to share info about the reason why the product I received may not work as described by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and minty, rather than overly sweet or floral like many products out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok, I have not tried the thousands of shampoos that are available today.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner has helped a ton, and always leaves my hair shiny, soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>My hair is doing fantastic and I love the way it feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I then switched to Nioxin System 4 (since I color my hair), and it&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping;</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good products.</li>
            <li>Good product, reasonable price and prompt service</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe Nioxin  grows new hair, but it sure makes my hair feel thicker and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li>This is a really great deal with super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I know this is not a miracle worker, but I will continue use this for sure because I like its fresh mint smell and the cleanness of scalp after wash!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other types of shampoo and conditioner and this has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>At this price, this is easy to do, compared to the alternatives of either a &amp;#34;rogaine for women&amp;#34; product or hair implants.</li>
            <li>Really, it could be any cheap conditioner that smells good.</li>
            <li>-- it leaves the hair looking healthy and clean -- but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in hair loss side and any improvement in &amp;#34;thinness&amp;#34; is slight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy and always in stock......</li>
            <li>Will keep using, my scalp has never been so clean :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them and now my hair is just amazing.</li>
            <li>When I stop to use the treatment I lost faster and don’t recovery easy.  </li>
            <li>Good only if you own a hair salon</li>
            <li>Whoa, this stuff smells quite strongly of mint and tingles my scalp.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I also started taking a high dose of biotin and a zinc supplement as well.  </li>
            <li>great price free shipping was a better deal than my hairdresser offered me for the same stuff</li>
            <li>Full thicker healthy.</li>
            <li>Liked it at first.</li>

            <li>Everything seemed fine, I felt no difference in my hair, but I kept using the shampoo and conditioner at home.  </li>
            <li>have been using nioxin fro about  1year, hair is  healthier and getting thicker in fine areas around the temple.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my fine hair was stronger fuller and fewer</li>

            <li>The shampoo and conditioner seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone with fine hair.</li>

            <li>After using the shampoo and conditioner about a month,I could see and feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference with in a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just waiting to finish these two huge bottles before I move on to something else.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a year now and the change is Huge.</li>
            <li>Made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and I can already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>These bottles are huge.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had huge results yet..</li>
            <li>I made a huge mistake by going to Aveda.</li>
            <li>Nioxin was recommended by a friend and have noticed a huge decrease in losing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s huge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nioxin and really appreciate that I can get it through Amazon at such great prices!</li>
            <li>Nothing there in spots about 1.5\\&quot; in diameter but smooth as a babies butt skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it was sulfate free, but its not.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon today because the order I placed yesterday had not been filled or shiiped although the product was shown to be in stock.  </li>
            <li>I have been using NIOXIN 4 for about 3 months now and it has made such a great difference.</li>
            <li>the HAir stays smooth after using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell and tingle of the conditioner and cleanser</li>
            <li>Great product and terrific service!</li>
            <li>im lookin for the pills where can i get them for cheap ???</li>
            <li>these were genuine if you were getting just one bottle and not the set.</li>
            <li>then my known genuine comparable.</li>
            <li>Was totally perplexed when I could not get any of the Conditioner to some out of the bottle by squeezing.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by our hairdresser for my husband which my husband likes and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>When I wash my hair out my hair is smooth....</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to give it more months to see more results, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Buying these 2 products together in this size makes it more economical.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product that I will keep using.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to make sure you are getting fresh product by checking the batch code.  </li>
            <li>far as the products go, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Pail Mitchell and other quality hair products for years and Nioxin is easily the superior product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuing to see new growth, and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Now my scalp shows right through my hair on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li>but at this rate I&#x27;d be bald by the end of the first week!!</li>
            <li>Brings hair back to a healthy state!!</li>
            <li>She offered to take the bottles back which I thought was very nice of her.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Wen shampoo and enjoy silky shiny hair that my wonderful hair dresser colors a chunky brown and blond blend.</li>
            <li>Quick easy no problems</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to continue to use it, but that went away in about a week and after a couple of months I could see new hair coming in.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this product and how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>The first washing was okay</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin products for years and at 67 years of age I still have a pretty healthy head of hair</li>
            <li>I purchased first at Ulta for much more.  </li>
            <li>This was not the original Nioxin product...  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price either, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>After cancer surgery and radiation treatment, I lost a significant amount of my hair.</li>
            <li>And I just noticed this week that the baby hairs that grow around the crown of my face are filling in and significantly thicker.  </li>
            <li>I truly believe that these are not Nioxin&#x27;s original product.  </li>
            <li>This is not the original Nioxin formula.</li>
            <li>The original formula was changed when they sold the company.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and helps grow new hair after bariatric surgery.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to thoroughly clean the hair and folicles, opening up the folicles and then thoroughly feeding the scalp etc...</li>
            <li>My hair always is squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Both products leave the hair clean and without the oily building that sometimes comes from cheaper conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves a tingly sensation and leaves my hair feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li>I love these products and was so happy to find these big salon-size bottles at a decent price.</li>
            <li>leaves hair feeling clean and refreshed and a lot fuller after styling.  </li>
            <li>Best with short hair that is trimmed frequently.</li>
            <li>my scalp is clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has completely changed the texture and thickness of my hair- for the better!</li>
            <li>So far I love this product!</li>
            <li>and she has me on a strict hair regimen to try to prevent anymore breakage and hairloss from happening due to the damage that nioxin did in screwing up my beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I really like Nioxin because it seems to stop hair loss which is very important to someone with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon is so easy and orders are delivered right to my home.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that seemed to be falling out more than normal</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I got over my irritation, I calmly searched Amazon and found a Keratin Pump which reviewers say fit the Nioxin one liter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its smells super clean and it&#x27;s also does strip my hair out like others.</li>
            <li>like system 3 much better, this doesnt seem to condition my hair as much.</li>
            <li>I really should stick with that part better...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, but after 5 weeks, I had to stop.</li>
            <li>it shines and looks full.</li>
            <li>tell you my bath drain isn&#x27;t full of hair after I shower anymore.</li>
            <li>I just cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the next bottles from Amazon because of the good price they offered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but it feels good on my scalp, and my hair looks fuller.</li>
            <li>Has worked for me, takes a good 2 months to see baby hair come back in, just be patient.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it really works...</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it online, much cheaper than at the salon.  </li>
            <li>On my second bottle I started to question if it was doing any good.</li>
            <li>Got it fast and the product was definitely authentic.</li>
            <li>Its really shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I would give it a full 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t contain this ingredient.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is really thick, and I happened to have a pump from another conditioner container that fits perfectly and makes it easier to dispense.  </li>
            <li>, it is too early to tell for my own hair results.</li>
            <li>Send me a return sticker and refund my credit card in full, please</li>
            <li>Love it so much I bought the System 2 for my mom</li>
            <li>At first, the tingling was so strong</li>
            <li>perfect for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found because it makes my scalp healthier and hair feel stronger; BUT don&#x27;t expect your hair to start growing back in fast, because it took many months for my scalp to get healthy enough before I started noticing new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li>as described, received quickly</li>
            <li>I also have mild dandruff.</li>
            <li>this product has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Received quickly and product was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Seller shipped out product quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for some time,  however, this particular package states that this is Cleanser and Scalp Therapy.  </li>
            <li>The product was received quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair and scalp feeling fresh  and over time leaves your hair looking healthy and much fuller.</li>
            <li>I ordered online and received quite quickly.</li>
            <li>I see a tremendous difference in my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worthy for the money...</li>
            <li>the transaction was very fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>One day a hair stylist who has used Nioxin herself for hair loss over many years highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>my life long hair stylist would always comment on how healthy my hair was and would praise me for being her favorite client who would take such good care of my hair.</li>
            <li>This will be my first time postng a review for a product I did not purchase through Amazon, but I think this is important.  </li>
            <li>I picked it up and starting using again and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Scratching or wanting to scratch my scalp was also becoming very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and was becoming noticeably thinner at the young age of 42.</li>
            <li>and I really have nothing more to say because I don&#x27;t have time to try to fit into the guidelines of do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts on giving product reviews especially when I have nothing more to say and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice some new growth and in my eyes, some is better than none.</li>
            <li>Great Product ,half of the price</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product - been using for a long time - my hair stylist recommended it for my hair thinning and it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo, my hair feels clean and fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>It came 2 days later, I DID use it..and the first time it did make my hair NOT look AS good as WEN..</li>
            <li>Not sure yet if it works, but arrived in top condition and good quality.</li>
            <li>We have used these products for several years, and just found them on Amazon for a better price!  </li>
            <li>Our thanks to you!!</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and I love the tingle of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>they will also bold face lie right to your face when you call the check on your order.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my hair, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who needs something for their fine hair.</li>
            <li>They really help strengthen fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Does wonders for fine hair and have tried many products which promise the same results.  </li>
            <li>They clean my scalp gently and the conditioner leaves my hair shiny and full.  </li>
            <li>I had very high stress factors of caring for a loved one in cancer decline and death, as well as normal work and children aspects AND having exceptionally high hormones.</li>
            <li>The product was reasonably priced and shipped for free.  </li>
            <li>still experienced lots of shedding and dried my hair out</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a fresh minty smell and has improved the texture of my existing hair.</li>
            <li>on top is now completely covered.</li>
            <li>No this is no overnight miracle, but the results so far have been astonishingly good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>both shampoo and conditioner make your scalp feel fresh, think vicks.</li>
            <li>well worth it when you consider the alternative.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh, been using it for over 2 months</li>
            <li>so be worth the price.</li>
            <li>My stylist read the ingredients and said, \\&quot;This has so many natural ingredients, you could almost drink it!\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth to try.</li>
            <li>We are both pleased with the outcome thus far.</li>
            <li>head&#x27;s skin is fresh, and i feel relax every time i use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Use clear now and my hair looks 100 times better</li>
            <li>By 32 I had a distinct bald spot on the front of my hair line.</li>
            <li>I love the minty smell and soft feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>but the shampoo REALLY dried out my naturally curly and healthy hair !!!</li>
            <li>I have a very full head of hair again, and I attribute it directly to Nioxin!</li>
            <li>Super excited - this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that really improved the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>Product will continue to purchase had long as it&#x27;s available !!</li>
            <li>I originally bought the starter kit, however I really did not like the Scalp Treatment</li>
            <li>but right when I got my package I used it...</li>
            <li>doubt that I will use Amazon.com again unless they make this right.  </li>
            <li>so I know when something does not seem to be the right thing for my body&#x27;s healing.</li>
            <li>My hair is not what it was, but this product has it headed in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it in hopes that eventually my body will right itself and start the regrowth process.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it was shipped undamaged.</li>
            <li>plus so I can get the right amount.</li>
            <li>Really makes my scalp feel revived and clean.</li>
            <li>time the conditioner has a different scent and does not seem to make putting my brush through very easy.</li>
            <li>This is a great value too, they are huge bottles, which will last a VERY long time!</li>
            <li>Very large size for the money.</li>
            <li>So I stopped using this sytem before I received these two very large bottles.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and color treated and my hair looks amazing after I use this.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that started thinning earlier this year.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for dry hair due to highliting &amp; perms.</li>
            <li>just makes my hair grow super fast.  </li>
            <li>I will re evaluate this product in the future, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>n easy to manage since Im all natural</li>
            <li>So far so good.. but only been using it for a month</li>
            <li>I was using #5 previously and LOVED that conditioner.</li>
            <li>Either way, this product has given me back my vibrant, bouncy, beautiful hair and now I get endless compliments and am referred to as a modern day Farrah Fawcett :)</li>
            <li>It has given me healthy, beautiful, thick hair back!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used countless products geared toward thinning fine hair and this duo is a keeper!</li>
            <li>I very much wanted this to help with my thinning hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly and chemical treated hair.  </li>
            <li>They produce the NEW Nioxin in MEXICO and it is NOTHING like the ORIGINAL NIOXIN.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good shampoo and conditioner for thin hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine hair but this caused my hair to shed at a higher rate than normal causing my hair to appear much much thinner.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the system4 is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>It tingles &amp; smells funny.</li>
            <li>This product did not seem to be the same as what I purchased at Ulta, it did not tingle my scalp and there was more hair loss than with the ulta products.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product because it was recommended by my barber.</li>
            <li>The first bottles I bought were from a salon.</li>
            <li>The first two numbers of the code indicate the production year, e.g. 11 is 2011.  </li>
            <li>then it is highly likely to not be authentic Nioxin product.  </li>
            <li>I first tried suppliments for four months without result.</li>
            <li>simply put, I was losing my hair on top</li>
            <li>You owe it to yourself, your career, and your wife (if you are married) to try this.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll look a LOT younger, and you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself because of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now at the 4 month point, it&#x27;s all fuzzy, covered in short, but healthy hairs.</li>
            <li>I noticed the excess hair loss during the first wash itself after I applied the conditioner.</li>
            <li>( I was using wen to make help it from sticking STRAIGHT UP!.</li>
            <li>I at first took this as a sign the product was working.</li>
            <li>When I got a haircut  6 or mote months later my hairstylist mentioned how much better my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>then it was at first.</li>
            <li>How ironic is that for a hair growth product!</li>
            <li>TOO FAST!</li>
            <li>It is noticeably thicker and much healthier!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend using the scalp treatment alone first to see if that manages your hair loss, if not then purchase these two products and try all three together.</li>
            <li>I have been using this more than two weeks, no sign of change, same amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>You get alot for the money, the product is exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>but surely it got better over the next several months.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but some people have funny reactions to monoxidil</li>
            <li>First off  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for several years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin 4 for several years and love the improvement in my scalp.</li>
            <li>I compared the ingredients with the ones on an authentic bottle of Nioxin and they were not the same.</li>
            <li>That shampoo worked at first</li>
            <li>When I first started using it it made my scalp tingle</li>
            <li>It says expect some hair to fall out the first two weeks</li>
            <li>and this is the only system that I trust to help my hair stay healthy.</li>
            <li>Have ordered this several times before, and have always been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and  have bought it at a Local beauty supply.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to others who are interested in thickening their hair to enhance appearance.</li>
            <li>but now I got some overpriced shampoo which makes me smell pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone finally recommended something that works.</li>
            <li>Big volume with the ok price.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>Midway through my first bottle my scalp started breaking out, and I never had that problem before, but because I was having an issue with hair loss and</li>
            <li>I ordered this initially after my hair began suddenly falling out and recently reordered it because I was so impressed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I ve been using it for 2 months ,and I ve been loosing more hair since I started using the nioxin 4 system especially after conditioning</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anyone locally who can beat the price that Amazon has on this shampoo/conditioner combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>probably one of the first things I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This stuff does really help I use it every day with [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]]</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m glad I switched back to Nioxin now.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely has more body since I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin.</li>
            <li>After the first two months my hair was not getting visibly thicker</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>We will  be back to shop for more ....</li>
            <li>Noticed a change the first time I used the shampoo...</li>
            <li>will give you more noticeable instant results.  </li>
            <li>It has improved my self esteem so much!  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to these products at while getting my hair cut (I got &amp;#34;The Works&amp;#34;) at &amp;#34;The Barbers.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I used this product before, it really works well for my scalp and hair!</li>
            <li>Several years ago my hair started breaking and after seeing my doctor it did not seem to be any better.</li>
            <li>but i dont care, im just glad its coming back.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft and flowing!!!!</li>
            <li>And the Scalp Therapy makes my hair easy to comb and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weigh down&amp;#34; my baby fine hair like other conditioners.</li>
            <li>Not like Sasquatch hair, but more like a little more peach fuzz than normal.</li>
            <li>I submitted a quick photo to show how my new growth just looks like &amp;</li>
            <li>as it really help regain the good health of my head cleaning everyday..</li>
            <li>and I noticed clearly that my head was literally sprouting everywhere with new strong hair and growing fast!</li>
            <li>I said sure..as long as i can use it with my WEN.:)</li>
            <li>A few months in now, I am VERY satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Therapy system for a long time now, I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Ok cleanser but hair does not appear thicker and differences between number 3 and 4 not clear would not purchase again</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and manageable without any other styling products which is surprising with my naturally curly-frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to have beautiful n full hair, and I had been using nioxin #3 and later #4 for at least 3-4 years.</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner cleans my hair nicely without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I see others have had success with new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Tip- if you have really dry hair and want even MORE moisture</li>
            <li>Easy on the hair and help prevent further hair lost.  </li>
            <li>(I liked what I had previously</li>
            <li>Although, there is no new hair growth with this product, it still gives the look of more hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the large size this time.</li>
            <li>The bottles are large so I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li>I had to buy separate pumps for them too since they are too large to handle.</li>
            <li>this is large quantity.</li>
            <li>Note the large size.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended and after 18 mo I lose less hair in shower daily and my hair is in great shape.</li>
            <li>As my title says, only half of this duo is great.</li>
            <li>I have notice a definite difference in the volume of my hair since using the Nioxin for fine treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and it makes me look like I actually have hair.</li>
            <li>Im just using the cleanser and conditioner, didnt purchase the extra things that some ppl posted abt and its working fine</li>
            <li>Pretty decent product.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work because my hair is thinning, but I had to stop using it after just 5 weeks - my hair started falling out in large quantities.</li>
            <li>it works really well, my hair started falling out in large quantities over a year ago and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>For years I tried countless products and nothing ever improved the appearance of my hair as much as the Nioxin System 4 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy for Fine Treated Hair Duo does.</li>
            <li>And these bottles were HUGE for the low price.</li>
            <li>When my order arived it had leaked all over the box and bottles making a huge mess and wasting a significant portion of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I started to have so much hair loss , you could see my scalp.</li>
            <li>Im very satistfied and hope to continue using.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>My husband encouraged me to go to the internet to just check to see what I could order and how much it would be.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by my stylist, but I chose to purchase through Amazon, as the price was much lower than the salon price.  </li>
            <li>Product really works.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my hairdresser for putting me onto it.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and arrived in prrrrrfect condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you very much!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>This really seems to work well for me.</li>
            <li>my hairline was racing toward my neck as fast as it would go.</li>
            <li>I really like it...</li>
            <li>It really makes your scalp tingle.  </li>
            <li>makes me feel that something is really happening to preserve my hair and texture.</li>
            <li>Although biotin helped GREATLY, I figured out by accident that it also made my hormonal cystic acne worse.</li>
            <li>I have found the product to be very benifical to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they said it was normal in the first 3-4 weeks and that it meant that the product was working.</li>
            <li>They said it makes the hairs that are ready to fall out, fall out quicker so they can be replaced by stronger thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several choices to fit your hair type and amount of thinning.</li>
            <li>It keeps thinning hair looking and feeling much fuller.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference...</li>
            <li>I bought the whole kit, which includes scalp treatment besides the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>but all the washings after that left a residue just like the cheap shampoos do.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in the thickness of my hair with these two products with the addition of the System 4 Scalp Treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t coming out as much since i started using it.</li>
            <li>The Nioxin conditioner, though, felt really soothing on my scalp, so it wasn&#x27;t as itchy</li>
            <li>This really helps reduce sebum to help hair grow.</li>
            <li>The Nioxin #4 really helps curtail the shedding and keeps the color and condition in shape.</li>
            <li>Now after two months, I am not losing as much hair as I was, and that my hair seems to be filling in those balding spots.  </li>
            <li>My hair was falling out so fast and Nioxin keeps in in my head.</li>
            <li>I have very fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li>This is really helping the fullness of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels much healthier after using this product.</li>
            <li>arived fast too</li>
            <li>Great of thin or thinning hair or just all around - does not leave residue on hair and hair is fuller.  </li>
            <li>This system in conjunction with the scalp treatment really works  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my hair with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really do see a difference in hair texture.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wait a whole year like I did.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It makes getting ready in the morning a snap.</li>
            <li>Very please with it would buy again from seller</li>
            <li>(It looks, smells and feels like the real thing, though.)</li>
            <li>this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin for years and really like it.</li>
            <li>Works really well with thinning hair</li>
            <li>I just really, really, really, really have my doubts as to how legit of a product this is.</li>
            <li>My hair does feel fuller and much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>You just spray that on the scalp, gently massage.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was something else I had done, or too much time in the sun, so</li>
            <li>It also cleans my hair of hair spray, which can really build up.</li>
            <li>I just wonder if this was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>and it was falling out fast.  </li>
            <li>again, this was some reallly fasssst service of a really really grrrrreat product of which I use often.</li>
            <li>I really like both of these items.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner has a very soothing smell and immediately soothes my often itchy scalp (caused by telogen effluvium shedding).  </li>
            <li>I really feel like this has helped my hair look and feel thicker.  </li>
            <li>Very minty like it is working and tingles a bit, but I like that.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a number of years, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see as much hair loss as before.</li>
            <li>The two of these together really thickened up my hair..</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in how much hair was falling out after about 3 months of use.</li>
            <li>The biotin boosted hair production and growth for about 6 months, but hasn&#x27;t done much since.  </li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT FOR THIN HAIR</li>
            <li>This really helps.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Nioxin</li>
            <li>Unusual for Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li>I am wondering if my purchase of Nioxin System 4 is the real thing.</li>
            <li>you use it as directed it really works.</li>
            <li>which is a great plus for my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really improves the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I just really hope its helping me keep the hair I have.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t loss hairs as much as before...</li>
            <li>Nioxin System came within the estimated delivery date window, and it came very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>it really works.  </li>
            <li>Ive been using the real shampoo for months</li>
            <li>I started loosing hair Jan 2012 &amp; by May my hair had really thinned so</li>
            <li>I didnt really think it would help</li>
            <li>This has really helped my scalp.  </li>
            <li>The prescription did not work, but this has helped my scalp so much.  </li>
            <li>the first use my scalp was tingling and felt much cleaner then what my normal shampoo&#x27;s offered.</li>
            <li>Now, all this time later I can honestly say I have a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; head of hair again - finally!!</li>
            <li>nice hair treatment-not too heavy</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s ok because so far my hair is no different</li>
            <li>The hair grew back within 6 months, as full as ever, and for the first time in my life, I am NOT developing split ends, so length is easier to achieve w/fewer maintenance trimmings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for approximately 4 weeks now and am very impressed with its initial results.  </li>
            <li>I almost can&#x27;t wait for a year from now when all the new growth is long :)  </li>
            <li>But WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Not only do I have noticeable new growth, but I lose maybe 10% of what I was losing every shower prior to Nioxin (even the biotin didn&#x27;t help with the loss, it just helped more grow quickly).</li>
            <li>I noticed new hair growth around the forehead and temple area and actually wondered if I was just imagining it or not, but it was true!  </li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t cost any more than the other premium shampoo / conditioner brands we have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased that I went beyond just the Nioxin shampoo and started using some of the other products for hair</li>
            <li>I am sure their idea that women lose hair due to a build-up of testosterone on the scalp has something to it.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i love it, and will never buy any other shampoo or cond.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I was going back on a medication that had caused hair loss for me before.  </li>
            <li>It takes such a small amount and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Even if it didn&#x27;t help my hair grow back, it was still supposedly a good shampoo and conditioner that would at least help me make the most of what hair I had left.</li>
            <li>Make sure you gently rub it gently into your scalp for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I have used this is in the past and liked the way my hair felt fuller, then forgot about it for a while.  </li>
            <li>This product is different than what I bought at the local beauty supply store and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s the real thing...but truthfully wondering.&lt;br /&gt;The  </li>
            <li>I would recommend any one with thinning hair to try the complete system first.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning hair and knew being a bald old lady was in my future.  </li>
            <li>( like i did WHILE my hair grows to lay down from being bleached on top)</li>
            <li>This is not the authentic shampoo, its watered down.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and have lost a lot of hair , this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair fuller and healthy looking .</li>
            <li>and I would just rather spend a little more money and get the real deal.</li>
            <li>Turned softer overnight, and new growth occurrng at a faster rate!</li>
            <li>I have more hair and less thinning (in the patches where I KNOW there is thinning</li>
            <li>Love how my hair feels and I&#x27;m already noticing less hair in my comb.</li>
            <li>I rating this product on behalf of my better half.</li>
            <li>so maybe its just getting older</li>
            <li>and the seller needs to reword his description on this particular</li>
            <li>I recently had a thyroid condition and my hair got super brittle and started falling out.</li>
            <li>This has stopped my hair from falling out and the texture of my hair J&#x27;s steadily improved.</li>
            <li>I am getting older (just turned 48).  </li>
            <li>I bought these large sizes right before I noticed the smaller bottles I had</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and will reorder from this same place later.  </li>
            <li>I used this about ten years ago when my hair first started getting really thin, and it worked great then, but this time around it</li>
            <li>Layer after layer of new growth started to fill in and now 7 months later I have a full head of hair again.</li>
            <li>I did my research and built up to ingesting high doses of biotin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone suffering from it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product and access to it via Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are noticing your hair thinning.</li>
            <li>It works amazing and comes in much bigger bottles then the other stuff.</li>
            <li>I was very skepitcal at first because you dont wanna waste money but its worth the price &amp; 1 of the perks I like is that these bottles are huge so it will definitely last</li>
            <li>It would probably be wonderful as a conditioner for coarse, thick, or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I would also end up with a good amount of hair in my comb, when combing out my wet hair, due to breakage.  </li>
            <li>(Rogaine)in my early 40&#x27;s and while it did not regrow a significant amount of hair, helped prevent as much further loss.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing back in healthy, thick, and strong.</li>
            <li>My hair feels thin and not as strong and healthy as it did with that first initial bottle I bought from the salon.</li>
            <li>Broke out my jeweler&#x27;s loupe just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just wishful thinking, and sure enough, it was at least 30-50% thicker!  </li>
            <li>Great product, and the price is less than half what you would pay at a salon.</li>
            <li>It was tough to comb through after showering, even when using good conditioners.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo makes my original hair excessively dry.</li>
            <li>Really like them so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find a much lower price</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter uses this as well and her hair has grown and looks so much thicker.</li>
            <li>Its rare these days to find something that actually works according to the advertised claims.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, I should mention I am intentionally avoiding products like Rogaine as I have heard that with that product, and similar ones, you have to keep using it once you start, or you go spear bald...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money and the foam part 3 of the treatment dries your hair out and adds some type of static cling to your hair</li>
            <li>We normally purchase them at her hair stylist but they were out</li>
            <li>I color my hair and it hasn&#x27;t felt like normal hair in years until I used the Nioxin System 4 Cleanser and Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li>Only one I&#x27;ve found to be as good, if not better than hoped for.</li>
            <li>It is easiest to buy Nioxin off Amazon since it is not available in many retail stores.</li>
            <li>Now I have a new hairdresser and she too highly recommends Nioxin for hair thinning.</li>
            <li>and when I get my hair cut in another state by other stylists, they always say, \\&quot;you have fine hair, but a lot of it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The scalp therapy, I use about every other time, as I have fine hair and it has a tendency to build up making it a bit greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>I went right back to Nioxin...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and keeps the color true.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference and if I have an episode of breaking hair, I go back to using the full system for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a minty smell, which is not bad at first, but did bother me a little during the day.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect masses of new hair overnight.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my scalp therapy.</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d the bottles as shown in the description--they looked new and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>After finishing the bottle, I noticed new, curly hair, and my visable scalp was filling in.</li>
            <li>After a month I noticed tons of new hair coming in.  </li>
            <li>I do see new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>have wispy  downy new hair.  </li>
            <li>Has helped stop hair loss and now have new growth coming in.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I notice any new hair growing</li>
            <li>I use it together with the foam and have seen new hair growing.</li>
            <li>The new U.S. office is in CA</li>
            <li>He has had new hair growth and loves the way his scalp feels.</li>
            <li>and my wife swears that I have new hair growing on my head.</li>
            <li>Too soon to expect any new hair growth or reduction in hair loss.  </li>
            <li>and I had new growth all over the place.</li>
            <li>My new growth is probably about 3 inches</li>
            <li>I can see new hair growth, my hair is noticeably thicker and it isn&#x27;t stripping my color.  </li>
            <li>but I saw new growth in a week where I had had no hair before.</li>
            <li>The product feels gentle, creates a nice foamy lather (unlike other hair loss shampoos I&#x27;ve tried) and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my scalp which is key for keeping my pores and hair follicles open for hair regrowth.  </li>
            <li>, If your hair is like mine was, you really don&#x27;t have much left to lose, and so much to gain...</li>
            <li>Much to my delight, after 3 months my hair started coming back in, much fuller than it had before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to hope that this helps and is part of the thickening process, but I have purchased a leave-in conditioner to use in addition to this since my hair is super dry and staticky.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with two large barely used products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it leaves my hair very soft afterwards</li>
            <li>I also can use about half the amount of conditioner I normally would use as it is light yet works</li>
            <li>I only wish when my hair first started to thin, right at the widow&#x27;s peak area, I had been able to start using this stuff.</li>
            <li>I paid $100.00 for this exact same thing from my salon.</li>
            <li>But this last time, I noticed a hair stuck to the shower wall (where it goes at first</li>
            <li>This was my first and LAST Amazon.com order.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is light enough to allow several days between washings, yet it still leaves my hair soft even after blow drying.</li>
            <li>Oily + dark thinning hair on a light complexion &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I colored my hair for first time since using it and only lost a dozen strands compared to the 60 i was loosing before i started using it.</li>
            <li>The description on the back of the bottle as to what the product will do for your hair, such as remove DHT (which the authentic one says it will do), is not written on the back of these bottles.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a small price to pay for healthy hair.</li>
            <li>because I really have bare spots -front sides.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this line my hair is soft , and im  nit getting hairs in my sjowrr!</li>
            <li>I bought pumps to go with these because they are pretty big</li>
            <li>Now after my FIRST USE I felt and seen a different.</li>
            <li>for the product itself, I have tried several other shampoo and conditioners that claim to help me retain and grow stronger hair, but I haven&#x27;t found any of them to be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>This the EXACT SAME product for a fraction of the price - the Duo is A STEAL!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered; same size and brand as on site.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a big difference in my hair within the first week.  </li>
            <li>I finally gave up on nioxin and try other biotin products, feel a bit better now.</li>
            <li>were doing the exact opposite of what this system is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and as expected.</li>
            <li>I will say I purchased from COSTSELL on Amazon, so I can&#x27;t say if this is true for other sellers on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>scalp therapy, I have some cool feeling from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros,&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it is reliable than other products.&lt;br /&gt;Cons,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nioxin shampoo and conditioner is very good, but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough yet to actually say I see little hairs coming back.</li>
            <li>Right before My hiar is fully blown dry...</li>
            <li>so I am left with two large bottles of shampoo that will go in the trash.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect your hair to start growing back in fast, because it took a few months for my scalp to get healthy enough before I started noticing new hair growth.</li>
            <li>6 months later, my hair has grown several inches and is much much thicker!!</li>
            <li>I went from really thick, super curly, frizzy hair (I called it my Jew-Fro lol), to very thin, somewhat straight hair.  </li>
            <li>products may work for you, of course, but clearly there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; type of guarantee.</li>
            <li>Wish they would make that clear</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser/conditioner in a 33 oz., but I clearly did not think about how much the actual amount of 33 oz.</li>
            <li>Mine is hereditary and this and Rogaine have so far helped me to not lose my hair like my relatives did.</li>
            <li>no longer am loosing that much hair, only the regulat amount.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never possible to really know what causes hair shedding</li>
            <li>Now she is not prone to just pushing any old hair care product.</li>
            <li>and i developed split ends which I have never had before.</li>
            <li>i was like WOW.</li>
            <li>and I smelt like moldy old mint...</li>
            <li>and my hair continues to fall out in considerable amounts.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that I can really say that it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Total waste of money on an expensive product that is doing me more harm than good.</li>
            <li>Now my scalp is completely healed--no dandruff, no dermatitis, no itching....</li>
            <li>So far this product seems to do what it states.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and fuller</li>
            <li>It has kept it soft and fuller looking.</li>
            <li>I started using Nioxin on the recommendation of my doctor and it really brought back my confidence.  </li>
            <li>i purchased the complete nioxin system number 4 cleanser, scalp therapy, scalp treatment, and diamax spray.</li>
            <li>i have highlighted hair and have been highlighting it for 9 years, i am 25 years old now.</li>
            <li>it wasnt until i used this system together for a week straight that my highlights all of a sudden started having a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li>but instead i have suffered so much, not only with my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s workig so far, I noticed the conditioner is made in the USA while the shampoo is made in Mexico.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a secret, it&#x27;s public record.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m too old for these chemicals, (61 with thinning hair)</li>
            <li>This combo made my hair appear fuller, but ultimately didn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell.</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old, and my hair is growing while others my age hair are falling out.</li>
            <li>after many weeks of reading reviews on these products i finally decided to give in because my bestie&#x27;s wedding is in a few months</li>
            <li>containers have &#x27;labels&#x27; and no lot codes..whereas the prior purchases had the Lettering &#x27;painted&#x27; onto the bottle and the &#x27;lot code&#x27; on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the prior formulations and will go back to the local store next time or contact the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product before, but I don&#x27;t think I gave it a chance to work - it does seem to add a more voluminous look, but as all products such as these, you need to stick to the regimen for a few months.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and my hair if thick and my scalp is healthy.  </li>
            <li>but I continuo to lose it, but more slowly.</li>
            <li>I began to notice my hair thinning slowly, but surely, around age 27.</li>
            <li>Not painful, but odd. 2.</li>
            <li>My hair is still fine, but I no longer have excessive hair in my comb, nor do I have spots where I feel like I can see my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I bought previously similar item from beauty supply store, and the cleanser was more concentrated, even different color(more vibrant green)!</li>
            <li>After about 4 months I started to see tiny hairs coming up in between my longer older hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed fewer strands in my hairbrush after my first washing and after a month I noticed that number was down considerably and new hairs were growing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;6 weeks ago, when getting what hair I had left trimmed, the hair lady, that has been doing my wife&#x27;s families hair since she was in junior high, suggested I try this stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and long.</li>
            <li>my hair has really started growing in and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I went to a new stylist at ULTA salon to see what she could do for what was left of my hair (stress, aging, heredity, pool chemicals)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen new growth but believe it definitely helps in keeping the hair I still have.  </li>
            <li>I decided to stop using the Nioxin, as that was the only new product I was using.  </li>
            <li>this is the only product that stops the hair from falling out, and then begins to grow new hair.  </li>
            <li>I really have to say it was the combination of Nioxin and Minoxidil that made such a big difference as compared to Minoxidil alone.</li>
            <li>I always had thick hair, then around a two years ago the top of my head or crown area became sparse, like pattern balding, which runs in female side of my family.  </li>
            <li>I started taking blood pressure medicine about three months ago and started to experience major hair thinning and some hair loss.</li>
            <li>after a month of vitamins and no other luck with seeing any improvement with my thinning/hair loss</li>
            <li>According to my stylist, the trick is to use the shampoo and conditioner exclusively, no other brands of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Checked the status of my order again today, Reena for sure lied because it still shows that it hasnt shipped - Amazon SUCKS!  </li>
            <li>I began having major hair loss a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li>No other product has worked that she has found.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something major, in my book.</li>
            <li>Upon my dermatologist recommendation I have been using Nioxin products for years and will use no other brand.  </li>
            <li>I usually pay way more for the smaller size than the larger sizes I got on Amazon</li>
            <li>I would recommend that you go to the Nioxin original website to order your products as i have done in the past.</li>
            <li>It is not for the major hair loss</li>
            <li>I then add a hair oil conditioner when hair wet and clean in winter.&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry, colored hair that sheds!</li>
            <li>, my hair has never been this thick EVER, not even pregnant!</li>
            <li>Large bottles last a long time!</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for several years and my hair has changed completely.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for son whose hair is thinning now that he&#x27;s crossed the big 50 years old.</li>
            <li>and I only washed with it once so far.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil, birth control pills in my shampoo (old Mexican myth), women&#x27;s Rogaine, etc...</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Nioxin even after my hair completely grows back</li>
            <li>So far I have seen a big difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair baby soft, while at the same time making it look thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using a different shampoo and conditioner I noticed that my hair loss had gone back to a normal amount.</li>
            <li>I tried it and liked it but thought it was too expensive.</li>
            <li>My hair now is back to being thick and full!  </li>
            <li>almost tangle free-have one area left side-top back-slight tangles-maybe new, short hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Wow got twice as much as in the salons for a lot less the price.  </li>
            <li>Does not do much for my extra dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My thinning hair is partially due to aging but mostly from my medication that I&#x27;ve been taking over the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li>These are extra large bottles that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>I have always have thin, fine hair, even when I was young.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for three years plus and it has truly helped my extremely fine, thin hair that I have professionally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this duo for little over a month now and can say I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>Works, lost much hair due to illness (bald spot).</li>
            <li>I am a middle aged woman with very thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Went back today to using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue and Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Conditioner that I purchaded early in December.  </li>
            <li>Good for thin, limp hair.</li>
            <li>So at first I got a little bit balder, but within a week after that I noticed peach fuzz on my bald spots, and a LOT of it.</li>
            <li>The first 2 weeks I used it, my hair grew about a half an inch and my bald spot started filling back in.</li>
            <li>First few uses</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a year and my hair is now thick and full again.</li>
            <li>but it was a large chunk of hard earned  money that i just threw away after one week of use, and the money i had to use to purchase the new s.o.s. hair care products.</li>
            <li>I notice there&#x27;s much less hair loss when I shampoo, and my hair feels so much fuller.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is, at least for me, it takes several months for full effect (I&#x27;d say it was about 9 or 10 months for total thickness)</li>
            <li>and i got half as much again of this project as i can buy locally for the same product.</li>
            <li>my thin fine hair does well with this product.</li>
            <li>(just what you DON&#x27;T want with thin, fine hair.)</li>
            <li>I have naturally fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>If your hair is thin &amp; fine.</li>
            <li>This little experiment convinced me that Nioxin really does help.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this thinking that it might help my hair look a little thicker, or at least give it more body.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Loving this product!</li>
            <li> I love both the shampoo and conditioner, makes my hair letter perfect.</li>
            <li> Very happy &amp; absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> stuff, pleasant minty scent...</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant tingle on my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> Both products have a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> Probably the best shampoo and conditioner ever for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> best for my thinning fine hair</li>
            <li> Amazing deal, great savings.  </li>
            <li> good stuff good price</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see how handfuls of hair falling out constantly good.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be patient because I bought the 4 litres after reading all the brilliant reviews online, but I am not taking any more chances.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be good</li>
            <li> Good cleansing and conditioning prep for any scalp treatment.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a great product and I have a reasonably nice head of hair and no bald spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using volumizing hair powders on the thinner spots and a good hair spray.</li>
            <li> I also use the scalp treatment foam that is good too.</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  </li>
            <li> Good product, but incorrect shipment.  </li>
            <li> However, incredibly, while she was preparing to cut my hair, while she was talking, I caught her putting more drops of serum on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF and IT</li>
            <li> I have always loved nioxin products.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deal if these products are genuine.</li>
            <li> Good delivery.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and my doctor suggest me to use</li>
            <li> and it is good</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Good price also.</li>

            <li> What I noticed immediately was that my hair looked and felt fuller, and the conditioner was good at detangling and making my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy this system because of the good reviews about Nioxin.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Feels good, clean, best price anywhere.</li>
            <li> I went from a full head of awesome hair to a thinnig nightmare with a bald spot forming in the front portion of my scalp.  </li>

            <li> Great shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy with how this is thickening and even helping with new growth for my hair!!</li>
            <li> It has made an amazing difference from the time I started using it.</li>
            <li> Thank  your for sending me this great buy and huge bottles of Nioxin.  </li>
            <li> Product is amazing--</li>
            <li> These products are amazing.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product about a year ago; she&#x27;d been using it herself and her hair looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> ALL of their products are amazing and have SAVED my hair.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and solved my thinning hair problem.  </li>
            <li> And as effective as Nioxin is, I couldn&#x27;t deduct a start for smell.  </li>
            <li> The price of the product has soared and it was nice to get some relief with the price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from hair loss or thinning hair, Nioxin is effective if DHT is the cause of the problem.</li>
            <li> will order again, fast and wonderful product!</li>
            <li> It works SO much better than even a prescription ketoconazole shampoo, and smells/feels good.</li>
            <li> reviews most were good</li>
            <li> My hairstylist had used this on my hair &amp; I liked the results.</li>
            <li> She has recorded it many times so must be good.</li>
            <li> It must be used soon after the date code to be effective.  </li>
            <li> awesome price and fast service.</li>
            <li> Used about 1 week- liked because it made my hair feel smooth/</li>
            <li> Really liked how it made my hair feel but not the scalp sores.  </li>
            <li> Good but too many types and sizes</li>
            <li> I liked the mint in the conditioner, i used it for 9 months</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and I haven&#x27;t lost as much hair while using this.</li>
            <li> My head feels nice coming out of the shower, though.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Product is excellent.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that it appears that it has stabilized my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> (The leaf oil and menthol warm it up.)</li>
            <li> The cleanser and shampoo are nice</li>
            <li> My wife is loving this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Really works, worth the money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair grows so much faster, and is so healthy now!!!</li>
            <li> They both are great and the size of the bottles are so worth the price!</li>
            <li> And as always Amazon provided best pricing and super fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I had to go in for a cut and all my new best friend said was</li>
            <li> I love Nioxin and really happy to see it available again.</li>
            <li> Called Nioxin and was told their expired products won&#x27;t hurt our hair but will do nothing to help it.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon customer service is great and quickly offered a refund.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had an experienced hairdresser who recommended I try the Nioxin.  </li>
            <li> I did have to temper my expectations somewhat, but I am more than pleased with what I am seeing!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> Even if I don&#x27;t get new hair growth, I think I&#x27;ve just found my favorite shampoo/conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and recommended to me by the University of Florida after consulting with them about my hair thinning so much.  </li>
            <li> So far, there&#x27;s no miracle shampoo but Nizoral seems to be the best for me.</li>
            <li> The scalp therapy product sure does tingle the scalp and makes your hair nice and</li>
            <li> Great winter fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I honestly believe this product has helped me regrow hair, I can see it along my forehead, and thickening hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li> this shampoo conditioner combination is the best for me for a clear scalp and also for maintaining my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, kind of a minty smell.  </li>
            <li> Sent quickly, well packaged, great price and now my hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> ( so I wont fry it anymore) and My hair is very fine as well.</li>
            <li> and my mom does too, because her hair is very fine and oily</li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin shampoo and conditioner about 3 years ago after my sister-in-law told me about it, she has very fine hair</li>
            <li> I use it every days, and my hair started to stay really strong!</li>
            <li> Feels so good on your scalp, after I use Shampoo and then Conditioner, my hair feels and smells so fresh and minty!</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it really smells good!</li>
            <li> I kept using it though because my sister in law had experienced such great results with it</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin with great results since 2008 when I was first introduced to it by my stylist.  </li>
            <li> I guess I should have known it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> So I told her I didn&#x27;t believe there was anything that could work to help my fine frail thinning hair!</li>
            <li> So nice makes your hair looks ok shinning and feel so clean, I personally love the kind of minty scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very passionate about too many products out there, but for this one I am because it is so amazing!!!  </li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really love this production.</li>
            <li> I purchased a smaller sized set with the scalp therapy and was so impressed</li>
            <li> Love Nioxin system&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE free shipping!</li>
            <li> so I was so upset to be able to literally see my scalp thru my hair when it started to thin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These products take time to show results but I believe they do work better than most others on the market.</li>
            <li> I was most concerned with authenticity.  </li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin in 2007 and am still using it today :)</li>
            <li> Love the tingle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was losing hair rapidly, and this system has stopped most of that.  </li>
            <li> love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Also I have had way more breakage.</li>
            <li> ok, I tried this once before about a month again</li>
            <li> I was just trying to find a better price.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> will buy more when out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed increased hair shedding/thinning for more than a year now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with product have seen results</li>
            <li> I love the minty feel.  </li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I had way more scalp than hair.</li>
            <li> okay, what&#x27;s to lose?</li>
            <li> If my hair went much more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is more than 1/4\\&quot; between any two hairs</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN products for a while now, since i had my hair FRIED from bleaching at the salon, and all of the top of my hair SPLIT off.</li>
            <li> so i read alittle about it, and it said it works better if you use the shampoo( cleanser and scalp</li>
            <li> but it was OK...</li>
            <li> then We all can see YOUR post of how well it did for you too!.:)</li>
            <li> This is the best cleaning system for thinning hair especially for hair that is chemically treated.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser is always amazed that my bleach/highlighted hair remains so healthy, and I&#x27;m sure that these Nioxin products are a part of that.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the tingly feel that you get on your scalp when using these products...</li>
            <li> I would have been able to purchase just one for the cost of the two at the store.</li>
            <li> I just love Nioxin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> , I got a cute pixie</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I told you\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> and I am extremely satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and has helped in hair replacement after illness and drug related hair loss.</li>
            <li> My hair is in better condition too.</li>
            <li> I love Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> and it does feel like I have more hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how it is after more time.</li>
            <li> Simply the best on the market. .</li>
            <li> My hair fell out more than ever before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthy.  </li>
            <li> , smell was okay</li>
            <li> It made my hair grow longer faster, but the follicles didn&#x27;t increase in thickness by any means, and it dries out my hair more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I do like the tingling sensation and minty smell of the shampoo, but otherwise these are just OK.</li>
            <li> I was really happy to find it at such a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product does not seem to be the authentic Nioxin.</li>
            <li> You have nothing to lose except more hair by not giving it a chance.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product once more and started using it.</li>
            <li> It it looks &amp; feels better.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the fullness of my hair since using this product.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and see if I have better results with continued use.</li>
            <li> will continue to purchase more as needed.</li>
            <li> I love, love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> glad my sister-in-law shared it with me</li>
            <li> Nioxin 4 has a minting scent and a refreshing tingle on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I know that some products do say that you may notice more thinning before it starts working.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my scalp and my hair hasn&#x27;t been softer.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> Now amazon price is comparible to most salons and ULTA.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner really works with hair that is falling</li>
            <li> Just make sure to rinse thoroughly to avoid flaking.</li>
            <li> Make sure you order the correct system as this is meant for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It would be more believable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> They do seem to work ok for now.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> i love this product</li>
            <li> My hair feels fuller and more bouncy.</li>
            <li> My barber bills have gone through the roof. :-).  </li>
            <li> but I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best!</li>
            <li> It is ok.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to read and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> more keeps falling out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I notice a visible difference, but I trust the reputation of this product to keep my hair from thinning more than it already has.</li>
            <li> After 15 years of using it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working anymore</li>
            <li> After about a week, got focused on finding a better way to deal with this because I do like</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product</li>
            <li> Ok then.</li>
            <li> Gives me more confidence</li>
            <li> and I feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> Love it，</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not too impressed with the &amp;#34;scalp cleanser&amp;#34; (who needs a liter of shampoo?), the scalp therapy definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> really works great for thinning hair</li>
            <li> nioxin has been my husbands favorite line for many many years now.  </li>
            <li> Using the cleanser and conditioner has given my hair more body and shine.</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> and I did 3 pumps of cleanser and massaged through my hair from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> and I lather my hair from top to bottom and let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for the better part of 15 years</li>
            <li> I will continue use :-)</li>
            <li> Pleased with both cleanser and scalp therapy conditioner...</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for many years</li>
            <li> colored.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products and Nioxin</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair about twice a week at most.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the shampoo and the tingling from the conditioner.</li>
            <li> With prime I got my product within two days and the whole process was great.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than this to grow your hair</li>
            <li> I would a most call it miraculous.</li>
            <li> have been using it for years now and love the product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I only order on Amazon as its best price.</li>
            <li> 5-6x. :-)</li>
            <li> Not any more.  </li>
            <li> but it is so much better and thicker.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the Nixon bottles and after about 3 months, I noticed more hair loss again even while continued the supplements.  </li>
            <li> Gives hair more body and looks fuller.</li>
            <li> My hair does look fuller and thicker and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I however LOVE the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been reading alot about the Nioxin and found that buyers are pleased with the product if it is made in USA, but not if made in Mexico.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had research it more for the kit.</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you have SUPER fine hair this could be a really good thing for you, it makes your scalp tingle (in a good way, not a bad, burning way)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked :)</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my hair after using though.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love how the makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> As a result I am pulling out more hair.</li>
            <li> From that time I started see my scalp thru hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out even more.  </li>
            <li> conditioner is just ok..</li>
            <li> so it is in your best interest to rule out any medical condition that can be causing your thinning or balding hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Nioxin System because my hair was thinning, and the top of my scalp was peeking through my hair.  </li>
            <li> ive been using this for a while,i love it</li>
            <li> love this products.</li>
            <li> I love using this, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker</li>
            <li> Once I got the hair loss under control, I was able to just use the cleanser/conditioner(scalp therapy).</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it</li>
            <li> The #4 shampoo is great, has a lovely minty smell and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Hair feels thicker and is more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad my niece in Ca.</li>
            <li> My scalp is still on the mend but 90% better than it was after about three months of use.  </li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t needed to buy any more</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product that works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice scents, and rinses out clean.  </li>
            <li> Leaves scalp feeling clean, warm, and tingly.</li>
            <li> It  is gentle for my thinning and very fine hair and keeps it in good condition.</li>
            <li> The sixe is perfect and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> My hair loss has reduced significantly!</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, I got rid of my dry scalp</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent and very nice/effective shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the shipping was so easy.</li>
            <li> It just makes my scalp feel so clean!</li>
            <li> I bought this System #4 after using System #2 because the bulk price was very good compared to buying this same product in a Hair Care product store.</li>
            <li> The bottles are huge and I love that.</li>
            <li> OK, I know writing a review should not be done until I can evaluate how it works, but I think it&#x27;s important to share info about the reason why the product I received may not work as described by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing and minty, rather than overly sweet or floral like many products out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok, I have not tried the thousands of shampoos that are available today.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has helped a ton, and always leaves my hair shiny, soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> My hair is doing fantastic and I love the way it feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I then switched to Nioxin System 4 (since I color my hair), and it&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping;</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good products.</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonable price and prompt service</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe Nioxin  grows new hair, but it sure makes my hair feel thicker and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a really great deal with super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I know this is not a miracle worker, but I will continue use this for sure because I like its fresh mint smell and the cleanness of scalp after wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of shampoo and conditioner and this has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is clean, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> At this price, this is easy to do, compared to the alternatives of either a &amp;#34;rogaine for women&amp;#34; product or hair implants.</li>
            <li> Really, it could be any cheap conditioner that smells good.</li>
            <li> -- it leaves the hair looking healthy and clean -- but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in hair loss side and any improvement in &amp;#34;thinness&amp;#34; is slight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy and always in stock......</li>
            <li> Will keep using, my scalp has never been so clean :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them and now my hair is just amazing.</li>
            <li> When I stop to use the treatment I lost faster and don’t recovery easy.  </li>
            <li> Good only if you own a hair salon</li>
            <li> Whoa, this stuff smells quite strongly of mint and tingles my scalp.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I also started taking a high dose of biotin and a zinc supplement as well.  </li>
            <li> great price free shipping was a better deal than my hairdresser offered me for the same stuff</li>
            <li> Full thicker healthy.</li>
            <li> Liked it at first.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair healthy and full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hands down the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> have a good amount of hair loss,  and Nixon always helps jump start the new growth.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair that needs TLC, and these products provide that.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that has started thinning since I turned 50.</li>
            <li> I can see fine hair along my forehead line growing in...</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nioxin Cleanser, Scalp Treatment &amp; Follicle Booster Level 4, for fine, visibly thinning hair, for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li> B002O0D8P8 Nioxin System 4 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy for Fine Treated Hair Duo 33.8 oz Set]]</li>
            <li> My hair is really fine and doesn&#x27;t grow well</li>
            <li> Suppose to help w/ stopping fine textured hair while preventing loss of hair color for chemically treated hair...</li>
            <li> Everything seemed fine, I felt no difference in my hair, but I kept using the shampoo and conditioner at home.  </li>
            <li> have been using nioxin fro about  1year, hair is  healthier and getting thicker in fine areas around the temple.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my fine hair was stronger fuller and fewer</li>
            <li> These are fine products that have been time tested by my wife and we are regulars on Amazon so we will continue to buy here.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> My beautician uses these products and I continue to use them in hopes of strengthening my fine and thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Gives body to fine hair.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been three days now and my hair appears much fuller and there is more body then ever before!</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo and conditioner about a month,I could see and feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference with in a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just waiting to finish these two huge bottles before I move on to something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a year now and the change is Huge.</li>
            <li> Made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and I can already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> These bottles are huge.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had huge results yet..</li>
            <li> I made a huge mistake by going to Aveda.</li>
            <li> Nioxin was recommended by a friend and have noticed a huge decrease in losing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s huge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nioxin and really appreciate that I can get it through Amazon at such great prices!</li>
            <li> Nothing there in spots about 1.5\\&quot; in diameter but smooth as a babies butt skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it was sulfate free, but its not.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon today because the order I placed yesterday had not been filled or shiiped although the product was shown to be in stock.  </li>
            <li> I have been using NIOXIN 4 for about 3 months now and it has made such a great difference.</li>
            <li> the HAir stays smooth after using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell and tingle of the conditioner and cleanser</li>
            <li> Great product and terrific service!</li>
            <li> im lookin for the pills where can i get them for cheap ???</li>
            <li> these were genuine if you were getting just one bottle and not the set.</li>
            <li> then my known genuine comparable.</li>
            <li> Was totally perplexed when I could not get any of the Conditioner to some out of the bottle by squeezing.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by our hairdresser for my husband which my husband likes and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair out my hair is smooth....</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to give it more months to see more results, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Buying these 2 products together in this size makes it more economical.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product that I will keep using.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to make sure you are getting fresh product by checking the batch code.  </li>
            <li> far as the products go, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pail Mitchell and other quality hair products for years and Nioxin is easily the superior product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing to see new growth, and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Now my scalp shows right through my hair on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> but at this rate I&#x27;d be bald by the end of the first week!!</li>
            <li> Brings hair back to a healthy state!!</li>
            <li> She offered to take the bottles back which I thought was very nice of her.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Wen shampoo and enjoy silky shiny hair that my wonderful hair dresser colors a chunky brown and blond blend.</li>
            <li> Quick easy no problems</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to continue to use it, but that went away in about a week and after a couple of months I could see new hair coming in.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product and how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> The first washing was okay</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin products for years and at 67 years of age I still have a pretty healthy head of hair</li>
            <li> I purchased first at Ulta for much more.  </li>
            <li> This was not the original Nioxin product...  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price either, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> After cancer surgery and radiation treatment, I lost a significant amount of my hair.</li>
            <li> And I just noticed this week that the baby hairs that grow around the crown of my face are filling in and significantly thicker.  </li>
            <li> I truly believe that these are not Nioxin&#x27;s original product.  </li>
            <li> This is not the original Nioxin formula.</li>
            <li> The original formula was changed when they sold the company.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and helps grow new hair after bariatric surgery.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to thoroughly clean the hair and folicles, opening up the folicles and then thoroughly feeding the scalp etc...</li>
            <li> My hair always is squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> Both products leave the hair clean and without the oily building that sometimes comes from cheaper conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves a tingly sensation and leaves my hair feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li> I love these products and was so happy to find these big salon-size bottles at a decent price.</li>
            <li> leaves hair feeling clean and refreshed and a lot fuller after styling.  </li>
            <li> Best with short hair that is trimmed frequently.</li>
            <li> my scalp is clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has completely changed the texture and thickness of my hair- for the better!</li>
            <li> So far I love this product!</li>
            <li> and she has me on a strict hair regimen to try to prevent anymore breakage and hairloss from happening due to the damage that nioxin did in screwing up my beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I really like Nioxin because it seems to stop hair loss which is very important to someone with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon is so easy and orders are delivered right to my home.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that seemed to be falling out more than normal</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I got over my irritation, I calmly searched Amazon and found a Keratin Pump which reviewers say fit the Nioxin one liter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its smells super clean and it&#x27;s also does strip my hair out like others.</li>
            <li> like system 3 much better, this doesnt seem to condition my hair as much.</li>
            <li> I really should stick with that part better...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, but after 5 weeks, I had to stop.</li>
            <li> it shines and looks full.</li>
            <li> tell you my bath drain isn&#x27;t full of hair after I shower anymore.</li>
            <li> I just cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the next bottles from Amazon because of the good price they offered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but it feels good on my scalp, and my hair looks fuller.</li>
            <li> Has worked for me, takes a good 2 months to see baby hair come back in, just be patient.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it really works...</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find it online, much cheaper than at the salon.  </li>
            <li> On my second bottle I started to question if it was doing any good.</li>
            <li> Got it fast and the product was definitely authentic.</li>
            <li> Its really shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I would give it a full 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t contain this ingredient.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is really thick, and I happened to have a pump from another conditioner container that fits perfectly and makes it easier to dispense.  </li>
            <li> , it is too early to tell for my own hair results.</li>
            <li> Send me a return sticker and refund my credit card in full, please</li>
            <li> Love it so much I bought the System 2 for my mom</li>
            <li> At first, the tingling was so strong</li>
            <li> perfect for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found because it makes my scalp healthier and hair feel stronger; BUT don&#x27;t expect your hair to start growing back in fast, because it took many months for my scalp to get healthy enough before I started noticing new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> as described, received quickly</li>
            <li> I also have mild dandruff.</li>
            <li> this product has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Received quickly and product was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipped out product quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for some time,  however, this particular package states that this is Cleanser and Scalp Therapy.  </li>
            <li> The product was received quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair and scalp feeling fresh  and over time leaves your hair looking healthy and much fuller.</li>
            <li> I ordered online and received quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I see a tremendous difference in my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worthy for the money...</li>
            <li> the transaction was very fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> One day a hair stylist who has used Nioxin herself for hair loss over many years highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> my life long hair stylist would always comment on how healthy my hair was and would praise me for being her favorite client who would take such good care of my hair.</li>
            <li> This will be my first time postng a review for a product I did not purchase through Amazon, but I think this is important.  </li>
            <li> I picked it up and starting using again and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Scratching or wanting to scratch my scalp was also becoming very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and was becoming noticeably thinner at the young age of 42.</li>
            <li> and I really have nothing more to say because I don&#x27;t have time to try to fit into the guidelines of do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts on giving product reviews especially when I have nothing more to say and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice some new growth and in my eyes, some is better than none.</li>
            <li> Great Product ,half of the price</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product - been using for a long time - my hair stylist recommended it for my hair thinning and it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, my hair feels clean and fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li> It came 2 days later, I DID use it..and the first time it did make my hair NOT look AS good as WEN..</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it works, but arrived in top condition and good quality.</li>
            <li> We have used these products for several years, and just found them on Amazon for a better price!  </li>
            <li> Our thanks to you!!</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and I love the tingle of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> they will also bold face lie right to your face when you call the check on your order.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my hair, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who needs something for their fine hair.</li>
            <li> They really help strengthen fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for fine hair and have tried many products which promise the same results.  </li>
            <li> They clean my scalp gently and the conditioner leaves my hair shiny and full.  </li>
            <li> I had very high stress factors of caring for a loved one in cancer decline and death, as well as normal work and children aspects AND having exceptionally high hormones.</li>
            <li> The product was reasonably priced and shipped for free.  </li>
            <li> still experienced lots of shedding and dried my hair out</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a fresh minty smell and has improved the texture of my existing hair.</li>
            <li> on top is now completely covered.</li>
            <li> No this is no overnight miracle, but the results so far have been astonishingly good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> both shampoo and conditioner make your scalp feel fresh, think vicks.</li>
            <li> well worth it when you consider the alternative.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, been using it for over 2 months</li>
            <li> so be worth the price.</li>
            <li> My stylist read the ingredients and said, \\&quot;This has so many natural ingredients, you could almost drink it!\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth to try.</li>
            <li> We are both pleased with the outcome thus far.</li>
            <li> head&#x27;s skin is fresh, and i feel relax every time i use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Use clear now and my hair looks 100 times better</li>
            <li> By 32 I had a distinct bald spot on the front of my hair line.</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell and soft feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> but the shampoo REALLY dried out my naturally curly and healthy hair !!!</li>
            <li> I have a very full head of hair again, and I attribute it directly to Nioxin!</li>
            <li> Super excited - this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that really improved the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Product will continue to purchase had long as it&#x27;s available !!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the starter kit, however I really did not like the Scalp Treatment</li>
            <li> but right when I got my package I used it...</li>
            <li> doubt that I will use Amazon.com again unless they make this right.  </li>
            <li> so I know when something does not seem to be the right thing for my body&#x27;s healing.</li>
            <li> My hair is not what it was, but this product has it headed in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it in hopes that eventually my body will right itself and start the regrowth process.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it was shipped undamaged.</li>
            <li> plus so I can get the right amount.</li>
            <li> Really makes my scalp feel revived and clean.</li>
            <li> time the conditioner has a different scent and does not seem to make putting my brush through very easy.</li>
            <li> This is a great value too, they are huge bottles, which will last a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> Very large size for the money.</li>
            <li> So I stopped using this sytem before I received these two very large bottles.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and color treated and my hair looks amazing after I use this.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that started thinning earlier this year.  </li>
            <li> Excellent Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for dry hair due to highliting &amp; perms.</li>
            <li> just makes my hair grow super fast.  </li>
            <li> I will re evaluate this product in the future, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> n easy to manage since Im all natural</li>
            <li> So far so good.. but only been using it for a month</li>
            <li> I was using #5 previously and LOVED that conditioner.</li>
            <li> Either way, this product has given me back my vibrant, bouncy, beautiful hair and now I get endless compliments and am referred to as a modern day Farrah Fawcett :)</li>
            <li> It has given me healthy, beautiful, thick hair back!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless products geared toward thinning fine hair and this duo is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I very much wanted this to help with my thinning hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly and chemical treated hair.  </li>
            <li> They produce the NEW Nioxin in MEXICO and it is NOTHING like the ORIGINAL NIOXIN.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo and conditioner for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine hair but this caused my hair to shed at a higher rate than normal causing my hair to appear much much thinner.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the system4 is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> It tingles &amp; smells funny.</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to be the same as what I purchased at Ulta, it did not tingle my scalp and there was more hair loss than with the ulta products.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product because it was recommended by my barber.</li>
            <li> The first bottles I bought were from a salon.</li>
            <li> The first two numbers of the code indicate the production year, e.g. 11 is 2011.  </li>
            <li> then it is highly likely to not be authentic Nioxin product.  </li>
            <li> I first tried suppliments for four months without result.</li>
            <li> simply put, I was losing my hair on top</li>
            <li> You owe it to yourself, your career, and your wife (if you are married) to try this.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll look a LOT younger, and you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself because of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now at the 4 month point, it&#x27;s all fuzzy, covered in short, but healthy hairs.</li>
            <li> I noticed the excess hair loss during the first wash itself after I applied the conditioner.</li>
            <li> ( I was using wen to make help it from sticking STRAIGHT UP!.</li>
            <li> I at first took this as a sign the product was working.</li>
            <li> When I got a haircut  6 or mote months later my hairstylist mentioned how much better my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> then it was at first.</li>
            <li> How ironic is that for a hair growth product!</li>
            <li> TOO FAST!</li>
            <li> It is noticeably thicker and much healthier!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using the scalp treatment alone first to see if that manages your hair loss, if not then purchase these two products and try all three together.</li>
            <li> I have been using this more than two weeks, no sign of change, same amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> You get alot for the money, the product is exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li> but surely it got better over the next several months.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but some people have funny reactions to monoxidil</li>
            <li> First off  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for several years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin 4 for several years and love the improvement in my scalp.</li>
            <li> I compared the ingredients with the ones on an authentic bottle of Nioxin and they were not the same.</li>
            <li> That shampoo worked at first</li>
            <li> When I first started using it it made my scalp tingle</li>
            <li> It says expect some hair to fall out the first two weeks</li>
            <li> and this is the only system that I trust to help my hair stay healthy.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this several times before, and have always been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and  have bought it at a Local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to others who are interested in thickening their hair to enhance appearance.</li>
            <li> but now I got some overpriced shampoo which makes me smell pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad someone finally recommended something that works.</li>
            <li> Big volume with the ok price.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> Midway through my first bottle my scalp started breaking out, and I never had that problem before, but because I was having an issue with hair loss and</li>
            <li> I ordered this initially after my hair began suddenly falling out and recently reordered it because I was so impressed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I ve been using it for 2 months ,and I ve been loosing more hair since I started using the nioxin 4 system especially after conditioning</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anyone locally who can beat the price that Amazon has on this shampoo/conditioner combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> probably one of the first things I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff does really help I use it every day with [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]]</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m glad I switched back to Nioxin now.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely has more body since I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin.</li>
            <li> After the first two months my hair was not getting visibly thicker</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> We will  be back to shop for more ....</li>
            <li> Noticed a change the first time I used the shampoo...</li>
            <li> will give you more noticeable instant results.  </li>
            <li> It has improved my self esteem so much!  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to these products at while getting my hair cut (I got &amp;#34;The Works&amp;#34;) at &amp;#34;The Barbers.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I used this product before, it really works well for my scalp and hair!</li>
            <li> Several years ago my hair started breaking and after seeing my doctor it did not seem to be any better.</li>
            <li> but i dont care, im just glad its coming back.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft and flowing!!!!</li>
            <li> And the Scalp Therapy makes my hair easy to comb and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weigh down&amp;#34; my baby fine hair like other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Not like Sasquatch hair, but more like a little more peach fuzz than normal.</li>
            <li> I submitted a quick photo to show how my new growth just looks like &amp;</li>
            <li> as it really help regain the good health of my head cleaning everyday..</li>
            <li> and I noticed clearly that my head was literally sprouting everywhere with new strong hair and growing fast!</li>
            <li> I said sure..as long as i can use it with my WEN.:)</li>
            <li> A few months in now, I am VERY satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Therapy system for a long time now, I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Ok cleanser but hair does not appear thicker and differences between number 3 and 4 not clear would not purchase again</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and manageable without any other styling products which is surprising with my naturally curly-frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to have beautiful n full hair, and I had been using nioxin #3 and later #4 for at least 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner cleans my hair nicely without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I see others have had success with new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Tip- if you have really dry hair and want even MORE moisture</li>
            <li> Easy on the hair and help prevent further hair lost.  </li>
            <li> (I liked what I had previously</li>
            <li> Although, there is no new hair growth with this product, it still gives the look of more hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the large size this time.</li>
            <li> The bottles are large so I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> I had to buy separate pumps for them too since they are too large to handle.</li>
            <li> this is large quantity.</li>
            <li> Note the large size.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended and after 18 mo I lose less hair in shower daily and my hair is in great shape.</li>
            <li> As my title says, only half of this duo is great.</li>
            <li> I have notice a definite difference in the volume of my hair since using the Nioxin for fine treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and it makes me look like I actually have hair.</li>
            <li> Im just using the cleanser and conditioner, didnt purchase the extra things that some ppl posted abt and its working fine</li>
            <li> Pretty decent product.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work because my hair is thinning, but I had to stop using it after just 5 weeks - my hair started falling out in large quantities.</li>
            <li> it works really well, my hair started falling out in large quantities over a year ago and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> For years I tried countless products and nothing ever improved the appearance of my hair as much as the Nioxin System 4 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy for Fine Treated Hair Duo does.</li>
            <li> And these bottles were HUGE for the low price.</li>
            <li> When my order arived it had leaked all over the box and bottles making a huge mess and wasting a significant portion of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I started to have so much hair loss , you could see my scalp.</li>
            <li> Im very satistfied and hope to continue using.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> My husband encouraged me to go to the internet to just check to see what I could order and how much it would be.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my stylist, but I chose to purchase through Amazon, as the price was much lower than the salon price.  </li>
            <li> Product really works.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to my hairdresser for putting me onto it.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and arrived in prrrrrfect condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you very much!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> This really seems to work well for me.</li>
            <li> my hairline was racing toward my neck as fast as it would go.</li>
            <li> I really like it...</li>
            <li> It really makes your scalp tingle.  </li>
            <li> makes me feel that something is really happening to preserve my hair and texture.</li>
            <li> Although biotin helped GREATLY, I figured out by accident that it also made my hormonal cystic acne worse.</li>
            <li> I have found the product to be very benifical to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they said it was normal in the first 3-4 weeks and that it meant that the product was working.</li>
            <li> They said it makes the hairs that are ready to fall out, fall out quicker so they can be replaced by stronger thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several choices to fit your hair type and amount of thinning.</li>
            <li> It keeps thinning hair looking and feeling much fuller.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference...</li>
            <li> I bought the whole kit, which includes scalp treatment besides the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but all the washings after that left a residue just like the cheap shampoos do.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in the thickness of my hair with these two products with the addition of the System 4 Scalp Treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t coming out as much since i started using it.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin conditioner, though, felt really soothing on my scalp, so it wasn&#x27;t as itchy</li>
            <li> This really helps reduce sebum to help hair grow.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin #4 really helps curtail the shedding and keeps the color and condition in shape.</li>
            <li> Now after two months, I am not losing as much hair as I was, and that my hair seems to be filling in those balding spots.  </li>
            <li> My hair was falling out so fast and Nioxin keeps in in my head.</li>
            <li> I have very fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is really helping the fullness of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels much healthier after using this product.</li>
            <li> arived fast too</li>
            <li> Great of thin or thinning hair or just all around - does not leave residue on hair and hair is fuller.  </li>
            <li> This system in conjunction with the scalp treatment really works  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my hair with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really do see a difference in hair texture.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait a whole year like I did.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It makes getting ready in the morning a snap.</li>
            <li> Very please with it would buy again from seller</li>
            <li> (It looks, smells and feels like the real thing, though.)</li>
            <li> this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for years and really like it.</li>
            <li> Works really well with thinning hair</li>
            <li> I just really, really, really, really have my doubts as to how legit of a product this is.</li>
            <li> My hair does feel fuller and much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> You just spray that on the scalp, gently massage.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> And fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was something else I had done, or too much time in the sun, so</li>
            <li> It also cleans my hair of hair spray, which can really build up.</li>
            <li> I just wonder if this was the real deal.  </li>
            <li> and it was falling out fast.  </li>
            <li> again, this was some reallly fasssst service of a really really grrrrreat product of which I use often.</li>
            <li> I really like both of these items.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner has a very soothing smell and immediately soothes my often itchy scalp (caused by telogen effluvium shedding).  </li>
            <li> I really feel like this has helped my hair look and feel thicker.  </li>
            <li> Very minty like it is working and tingles a bit, but I like that.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a number of years, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see as much hair loss as before.</li>
            <li> The two of these together really thickened up my hair..</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in how much hair was falling out after about 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> The biotin boosted hair production and growth for about 6 months, but hasn&#x27;t done much since.  </li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT FOR THIN HAIR</li>
            <li> This really helps.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Nioxin</li>
            <li> Unusual for Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if my purchase of Nioxin System 4 is the real thing.</li>
            <li> you use it as directed it really works.</li>
            <li> which is a great plus for my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really improves the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I just really hope its helping me keep the hair I have.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t loss hairs as much as before...</li>
            <li> Nioxin System came within the estimated delivery date window, and it came very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> it really works.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using the real shampoo for months</li>
            <li> I started loosing hair Jan 2012 &amp; by May my hair had really thinned so</li>
            <li> I didnt really think it would help</li>
            <li> This has really helped my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The prescription did not work, but this has helped my scalp so much.  </li>
            <li> the first use my scalp was tingling and felt much cleaner then what my normal shampoo&#x27;s offered.</li>
            <li> Now, all this time later I can honestly say I have a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; head of hair again - finally!!</li>
            <li> nice hair treatment-not too heavy</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s ok because so far my hair is no different</li>
            <li> The hair grew back within 6 months, as full as ever, and for the first time in my life, I am NOT developing split ends, so length is easier to achieve w/fewer maintenance trimmings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for approximately 4 weeks now and am very impressed with its initial results.  </li>
            <li> I almost can&#x27;t wait for a year from now when all the new growth is long :)  </li>
            <li> But WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Not only do I have noticeable new growth, but I lose maybe 10% of what I was losing every shower prior to Nioxin (even the biotin didn&#x27;t help with the loss, it just helped more grow quickly).</li>
            <li> I noticed new hair growth around the forehead and temple area and actually wondered if I was just imagining it or not, but it was true!  </li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t cost any more than the other premium shampoo / conditioner brands we have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased that I went beyond just the Nioxin shampoo and started using some of the other products for hair</li>
            <li> I am sure their idea that women lose hair due to a build-up of testosterone on the scalp has something to it.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i love it, and will never buy any other shampoo or cond.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I was going back on a medication that had caused hair loss for me before.  </li>
            <li> It takes such a small amount and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Even if it didn&#x27;t help my hair grow back, it was still supposedly a good shampoo and conditioner that would at least help me make the most of what hair I had left.</li>
            <li> Make sure you gently rub it gently into your scalp for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used this is in the past and liked the way my hair felt fuller, then forgot about it for a while.  </li>
            <li> This product is different than what I bought at the local beauty supply store and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s the real thing...but truthfully wondering.&lt;br /&gt;The  </li>
            <li> I would recommend any one with thinning hair to try the complete system first.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinning hair and knew being a bald old lady was in my future.  </li>
            <li> ( like i did WHILE my hair grows to lay down from being bleached on top)</li>
            <li> This is not the authentic shampoo, its watered down.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and have lost a lot of hair , this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair fuller and healthy looking .</li>
            <li> and I would just rather spend a little more money and get the real deal.</li>
            <li> Turned softer overnight, and new growth occurrng at a faster rate!</li>
            <li> I have more hair and less thinning (in the patches where I KNOW there is thinning</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels and I&#x27;m already noticing less hair in my comb.</li>
            <li> I rating this product on behalf of my better half.</li>
            <li> so maybe its just getting older</li>
            <li> and the seller needs to reword his description on this particular</li>
            <li> I recently had a thyroid condition and my hair got super brittle and started falling out.</li>
            <li> This has stopped my hair from falling out and the texture of my hair J&#x27;s steadily improved.</li>
            <li> I am getting older (just turned 48).  </li>
            <li> I bought these large sizes right before I noticed the smaller bottles I had</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and will reorder from this same place later.  </li>
            <li> I used this about ten years ago when my hair first started getting really thin, and it worked great then, but this time around it</li>
            <li> Layer after layer of new growth started to fill in and now 7 months later I have a full head of hair again.</li>
            <li> I did my research and built up to ingesting high doses of biotin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone suffering from it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product and access to it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are noticing your hair thinning.</li>
            <li> It works amazing and comes in much bigger bottles then the other stuff.</li>
            <li> I was very skepitcal at first because you dont wanna waste money but its worth the price &amp; 1 of the perks I like is that these bottles are huge so it will definitely last</li>
            <li> It would probably be wonderful as a conditioner for coarse, thick, or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I would also end up with a good amount of hair in my comb, when combing out my wet hair, due to breakage.  </li>
            <li> (Rogaine)in my early 40&#x27;s and while it did not regrow a significant amount of hair, helped prevent as much further loss.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing back in healthy, thick, and strong.</li>
            <li> My hair feels thin and not as strong and healthy as it did with that first initial bottle I bought from the salon.</li>
            <li> Broke out my jeweler&#x27;s loupe just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just wishful thinking, and sure enough, it was at least 30-50% thicker!  </li>
            <li> Great product, and the price is less than half what you would pay at a salon.</li>
            <li> It was tough to comb through after showering, even when using good conditioners.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo makes my original hair excessively dry.</li>
            <li> Really like them so far.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find a much lower price</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter uses this as well and her hair has grown and looks so much thicker.</li>
            <li> Its rare these days to find something that actually works according to the advertised claims.</li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth, I should mention I am intentionally avoiding products like Rogaine as I have heard that with that product, and similar ones, you have to keep using it once you start, or you go spear bald...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money and the foam part 3 of the treatment dries your hair out and adds some type of static cling to your hair</li>
            <li> We normally purchase them at her hair stylist but they were out</li>
            <li> I color my hair and it hasn&#x27;t felt like normal hair in years until I used the Nioxin System 4 Cleanser and Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li> Only one I&#x27;ve found to be as good, if not better than hoped for.</li>
            <li> It is easiest to buy Nioxin off Amazon since it is not available in many retail stores.</li>
            <li> Now I have a new hairdresser and she too highly recommends Nioxin for hair thinning.</li>
            <li> and when I get my hair cut in another state by other stylists, they always say, \\&quot;you have fine hair, but a lot of it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The scalp therapy, I use about every other time, as I have fine hair and it has a tendency to build up making it a bit greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> I went right back to Nioxin...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and keeps the color true.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference and if I have an episode of breaking hair, I go back to using the full system for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minty smell, which is not bad at first, but did bother me a little during the day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect masses of new hair overnight.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my scalp therapy.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d the bottles as shown in the description--they looked new and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> After finishing the bottle, I noticed new, curly hair, and my visable scalp was filling in.</li>
            <li> After a month I noticed tons of new hair coming in.  </li>
            <li> I do see new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> have wispy  downy new hair.  </li>
            <li> Has helped stop hair loss and now have new growth coming in.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I notice any new hair growing</li>
            <li> I use it together with the foam and have seen new hair growing.</li>
            <li> The new U.S. office is in CA</li>
            <li> He has had new hair growth and loves the way his scalp feels.</li>
            <li> and my wife swears that I have new hair growing on my head.</li>
            <li> Too soon to expect any new hair growth or reduction in hair loss.  </li>
            <li> and I had new growth all over the place.</li>
            <li> My new growth is probably about 3 inches</li>
            <li> I can see new hair growth, my hair is noticeably thicker and it isn&#x27;t stripping my color.  </li>
            <li> but I saw new growth in a week where I had had no hair before.</li>
            <li> The product feels gentle, creates a nice foamy lather (unlike other hair loss shampoos I&#x27;ve tried) and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my scalp which is key for keeping my pores and hair follicles open for hair regrowth.  </li>
            <li> , If your hair is like mine was, you really don&#x27;t have much left to lose, and so much to gain...</li>
            <li> Much to my delight, after 3 months my hair started coming back in, much fuller than it had before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to hope that this helps and is part of the thickening process, but I have purchased a leave-in conditioner to use in addition to this since my hair is super dry and staticky.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with two large barely used products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it leaves my hair very soft afterwards</li>
            <li> I also can use about half the amount of conditioner I normally would use as it is light yet works</li>
            <li> I only wish when my hair first started to thin, right at the widow&#x27;s peak area, I had been able to start using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I paid $100.00 for this exact same thing from my salon.</li>
            <li> But this last time, I noticed a hair stuck to the shower wall (where it goes at first</li>
            <li> This was my first and LAST Amazon.com order.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is light enough to allow several days between washings, yet it still leaves my hair soft even after blow drying.</li>
            <li> Oily + dark thinning hair on a light complexion &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I colored my hair for first time since using it and only lost a dozen strands compared to the 60 i was loosing before i started using it.</li>
            <li> The description on the back of the bottle as to what the product will do for your hair, such as remove DHT (which the authentic one says it will do), is not written on the back of these bottles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small price to pay for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> because I really have bare spots -front sides.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this line my hair is soft , and im  nit getting hairs in my sjowrr!</li>
            <li> I bought pumps to go with these because they are pretty big</li>
            <li> Now after my FIRST USE I felt and seen a different.</li>
            <li> for the product itself, I have tried several other shampoo and conditioners that claim to help me retain and grow stronger hair, but I haven&#x27;t found any of them to be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> This the EXACT SAME product for a fraction of the price - the Duo is A STEAL!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered; same size and brand as on site.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a big difference in my hair within the first week.  </li>
            <li> I finally gave up on nioxin and try other biotin products, feel a bit better now.</li>
            <li> were doing the exact opposite of what this system is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and as expected.</li>
            <li> I will say I purchased from COSTSELL on Amazon, so I can&#x27;t say if this is true for other sellers on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> scalp therapy, I have some cool feeling from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros,&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it is reliable than other products.&lt;br /&gt;Cons,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nioxin shampoo and conditioner is very good, but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough yet to actually say I see little hairs coming back.</li>
            <li> Right before My hiar is fully blown dry...</li>
            <li> so I am left with two large bottles of shampoo that will go in the trash.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect your hair to start growing back in fast, because it took a few months for my scalp to get healthy enough before I started noticing new hair growth.</li>
            <li> 6 months later, my hair has grown several inches and is much much thicker!!</li>
            <li> I went from really thick, super curly, frizzy hair (I called it my Jew-Fro lol), to very thin, somewhat straight hair.  </li>
            <li> products may work for you, of course, but clearly there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; type of guarantee.</li>
            <li> Wish they would make that clear</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser/conditioner in a 33 oz., but I clearly did not think about how much the actual amount of 33 oz.</li>
            <li> Mine is hereditary and this and Rogaine have so far helped me to not lose my hair like my relatives did.</li>
            <li> no longer am loosing that much hair, only the regulat amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never possible to really know what causes hair shedding</li>
            <li> Now she is not prone to just pushing any old hair care product.</li>
            <li> and i developed split ends which I have never had before.</li>
            <li> i was like WOW.</li>
            <li> and I smelt like moldy old mint...</li>
            <li> and my hair continues to fall out in considerable amounts.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that I can really say that it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money on an expensive product that is doing me more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Now my scalp is completely healed--no dandruff, no dermatitis, no itching....</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to do what it states.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and fuller</li>
            <li> It has kept it soft and fuller looking.</li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin on the recommendation of my doctor and it really brought back my confidence.  </li>
            <li> i purchased the complete nioxin system number 4 cleanser, scalp therapy, scalp treatment, and diamax spray.</li>
            <li> i have highlighted hair and have been highlighting it for 9 years, i am 25 years old now.</li>
            <li> it wasnt until i used this system together for a week straight that my highlights all of a sudden started having a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> but instead i have suffered so much, not only with my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s workig so far, I noticed the conditioner is made in the USA while the shampoo is made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a secret, it&#x27;s public record.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too old for these chemicals, (61 with thinning hair)</li>
            <li> This combo made my hair appear fuller, but ultimately didn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old, and my hair is growing while others my age hair are falling out.</li>
            <li> after many weeks of reading reviews on these products i finally decided to give in because my bestie&#x27;s wedding is in a few months</li>
            <li> containers have &#x27;labels&#x27; and no lot codes..whereas the prior purchases had the Lettering &#x27;painted&#x27; onto the bottle and the &#x27;lot code&#x27; on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the prior formulations and will go back to the local store next time or contact the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product before, but I don&#x27;t think I gave it a chance to work - it does seem to add a more voluminous look, but as all products such as these, you need to stick to the regimen for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and my hair if thick and my scalp is healthy.  </li>
            <li> but I continuo to lose it, but more slowly.</li>
            <li> I began to notice my hair thinning slowly, but surely, around age 27.</li>
            <li> Not painful, but odd. 2.</li>
            <li> My hair is still fine, but I no longer have excessive hair in my comb, nor do I have spots where I feel like I can see my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I bought previously similar item from beauty supply store, and the cleanser was more concentrated, even different color(more vibrant green)!</li>
            <li> After about 4 months I started to see tiny hairs coming up in between my longer older hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed fewer strands in my hairbrush after my first washing and after a month I noticed that number was down considerably and new hairs were growing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;6 weeks ago, when getting what hair I had left trimmed, the hair lady, that has been doing my wife&#x27;s families hair since she was in junior high, suggested I try this stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and long.</li>
            <li> my hair has really started growing in and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I went to a new stylist at ULTA salon to see what she could do for what was left of my hair (stress, aging, heredity, pool chemicals)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen new growth but believe it definitely helps in keeping the hair I still have.  </li>
            <li> I decided to stop using the Nioxin, as that was the only new product I was using.  </li>
            <li> this is the only product that stops the hair from falling out, and then begins to grow new hair.  </li>
            <li> I really have to say it was the combination of Nioxin and Minoxidil that made such a big difference as compared to Minoxidil alone.</li>
            <li> I always had thick hair, then around a two years ago the top of my head or crown area became sparse, like pattern balding, which runs in female side of my family.  </li>
            <li> I started taking blood pressure medicine about three months ago and started to experience major hair thinning and some hair loss.</li>
            <li> after a month of vitamins and no other luck with seeing any improvement with my thinning/hair loss</li>
            <li> According to my stylist, the trick is to use the shampoo and conditioner exclusively, no other brands of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Checked the status of my order again today, Reena for sure lied because it still shows that it hasnt shipped - Amazon SUCKS!  </li>
            <li> I began having major hair loss a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> No other product has worked that she has found.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something major, in my book.</li>
            <li> Upon my dermatologist recommendation I have been using Nioxin products for years and will use no other brand.  </li>
            <li> I usually pay way more for the smaller size than the larger sizes I got on Amazon</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you go to the Nioxin original website to order your products as i have done in the past.</li>
            <li> It is not for the major hair loss</li>
            <li> I then add a hair oil conditioner when hair wet and clean in winter.&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry, colored hair that sheds!</li>
            <li> , my hair has never been this thick EVER, not even pregnant!</li>
            <li> Large bottles last a long time!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for several years and my hair has changed completely.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for son whose hair is thinning now that he&#x27;s crossed the big 50 years old.</li>
            <li> and I only washed with it once so far.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil, birth control pills in my shampoo (old Mexican myth), women&#x27;s Rogaine, etc...</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Nioxin even after my hair completely grows back</li>
            <li> So far I have seen a big difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair baby soft, while at the same time making it look thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using a different shampoo and conditioner I noticed that my hair loss had gone back to a normal amount.</li>
            <li> I tried it and liked it but thought it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair now is back to being thick and full!  </li>
            <li> almost tangle free-have one area left side-top back-slight tangles-maybe new, short hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Wow got twice as much as in the salons for a lot less the price.  </li>
            <li> Does not do much for my extra dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My thinning hair is partially due to aging but mostly from my medication that I&#x27;ve been taking over the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li> These are extra large bottles that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I have always have thin, fine hair, even when I was young.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for three years plus and it has truly helped my extremely fine, thin hair that I have professionally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this duo for little over a month now and can say I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> Works, lost much hair due to illness (bald spot).</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged woman with very thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Went back today to using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue and Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Conditioner that I purchaded early in December.  </li>
            <li> Good for thin, limp hair.</li>
            <li> So at first I got a little bit balder, but within a week after that I noticed peach fuzz on my bald spots, and a LOT of it.</li>
            <li> The first 2 weeks I used it, my hair grew about a half an inch and my bald spot started filling back in.</li>
            <li> First few uses</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and my hair is now thick and full again.</li>
            <li> but it was a large chunk of hard earned  money that i just threw away after one week of use, and the money i had to use to purchase the new s.o.s. hair care products.</li>
            <li> I notice there&#x27;s much less hair loss when I shampoo, and my hair feels so much fuller.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is, at least for me, it takes several months for full effect (I&#x27;d say it was about 9 or 10 months for total thickness)</li>
            <li> and i got half as much again of this project as i can buy locally for the same product.</li>
            <li> my thin fine hair does well with this product.</li>
            <li> (just what you DON&#x27;T want with thin, fine hair.)</li>
            <li> I have naturally fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin &amp; fine.</li>
            <li> This little experiment convinced me that Nioxin really does help.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this thinking that it might help my hair look a little thicker, or at least give it more body.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to say if it actually thickens my thin hair, but I can tell you that in just a few short washes, my hair is dry - to the point that if I touch it I get that major static head!  </li>
            <li> so your hair fluffs up a little bit rather than laying flat, but if you have too much hair it may not work quite as well.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended it after he told me I was starting to lose my hair from stress and my flat iron.</li>
            <li> It has helped with less fall-out, breakage, and new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I thought I didnt sleep well, or eat well, but I was wrong, no matter how I tried to live a better life style, this nioxin killed all my hair,  nothing changed.</li>
            <li> Also, since having my 3rd child, my hair had been falling out in larger quantities (long after the postpartum loss was done).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the system long enough to see the maximum benefits yet, but I like it well enough to recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to baldness treatments kind of filing them under the category of Snake Oil and political promises.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost about 1/2 my hair in the last year due to several health conditions - fortunately I had very thick hair to start with.  </li>
            <li> and she reassured me that the dryness and unhealthy feeling of my hair was just due to the fact that the shampoo works so good and strips the hair of all the stuff that was on my hair from the other shampoo and conditioners that I was previously using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really works.</li>
            <li> I considered cutting it short but decided to try a different shampoo one more time.  </li>
            <li> He is not sure he has seen any change in hair loss, but, really likes the cleanliness, tingle and smell of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really helps thinning hair or not.  </li>
            <li> and I am just not sure how much it helps on your thinning hair</li>
            <li> It drys fast so just style as usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really helps thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> In the first 2 months I used it EVERY day and as instructed leaving the shampoo on for at least a minute and the conditioner on for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, and I was constantly losing strands, sometimes clumps.</li>
            <li> He has not used this item long enough to notice any difference in the fullness of his hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to rate yet</li>
            <li> I have noticed new growth and little baby hairs popping up on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> Now I recall its maybe my hormone slowing down at the time of 35 years old.</li>
            <li> My resolve is I put a little of my old regular conditioner on over the nioxin conditioner.</li>
            <li> A call to the manufacturer was rejected by the person who answered the phone, saying they would not talk to us since we bought this through a third party on Amazon, and not directly from them!</li>
            <li> This was about the 5th time we replentished the previous &amp;#34;bottles getting near empty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It does dry out the ends of my hair, so I put the conditioner all over my head and then regular conditioner JUST ON THE ENDS.</li>
            <li> I moved into an old house a few years ago with a faulty gas furnace, unbeknown to me, carbon monoxide was silently seeping through the floorboards from the basement, and after 6 months, I had lost 2/3 of my hair!</li>
            <li> This was advertised as a &amp;#34;treatment to encourage hair growth.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s merely a deep cleansing shampoo that stripped my hair of natural oils, and the conditioner is so heavy, (to coat the strands to make it LOOK</li>
            <li> I have beenusing it for a few years love the way it makes my scalp feel and gives my thin hair body</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair is super thin</li>
            <li> Prior to Nioxin, I had to wash my hair every single day because it would get oily.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I actually have new hair growth, but the texture of my hair is fuller and my physician even commented on this.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well for me, but paired with my regular conditioner, I would never go back to other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Since having thyroid cancer and now on daily thyroid medication my shoulder length hair had become very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference right away, in fact if anything I almost thought it made my hair worse than it was because it felt really dry, brittle, etc.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it really reduces hair loss or not, but the amount I ordered is probably at least a year&#x27;s supply, so time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months and its completely destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be switching or trying anything else for a long time if ever.</li>
            <li> it takes a long time to regrow hair.  </li>
            <li> it takes a long time so it must be used faithfully for results.  </li>
            <li> Now that my hair is long, I am still seeing hair fall out.  </li>
            <li> My very thin fine hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li> I purchase Dermatalogica cream locally , but when I saw the price discounted on Amazon I was tempted to buy a larger bottle until I read a review that said a person purchased it and it was watered down......</li>
            <li> After only one month the growing bald spot on my crown is less obvious.</li>
            <li> If you are religious about using it daily, you will notice significantly less hair on your brush in about a month.  </li>
            <li> It seemed thin and wouldn&#x27;t lay right so styling was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Every other product I&#x27;ve used in the past doesn&#x27;t help as much as Nioxin does with dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the rest due to the investment, but def going back to system 3</li>
            <li> Started turning my hair grey!</li>
            <li> My hair has been falling out by handfuls and it&#x27;s due to having a total hysterectomy</li>
            <li> Since I had been getting migraines, I didn&#x27;t immmediately connect this migraine with the Nioxin, even though it was very different from other migraines in that I my head ached all over</li>
            <li> i have very long hair</li>
            <li> Also the texture of my hair changed to be dry and tangled all the time, the nioxin sucked all the oils and moisture from my hair.</li>
            <li> For me, the shampoo and conditioner dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> but it was still dry and flaky from the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This will make your hair so incredibly dry</li>
            <li> but it is REALLY drying and quickly started irritating my scalp even worse.</li>
            <li> The usual mint smelt like mold old mint.</li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned using Nioxin 4 and within a week had minimal loss, back to only loosing a few strands when I shower.</li>
            <li> It also weighs my hair down even if I use just a tiny dot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and slowed down the thinning of my hare but still losing it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon beats the local salon price hands down.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner have improved the hair that I do have and new growth had started to fill in slowly.</li>
            <li> Discarded my previous shampoos and conditioners and this is now my only product to use.</li>
            <li> I also believe it&#x27;s made my hair feel thicker and less hair loss especially when you die your hair.</li>
            <li> Second order in half year.</li>
            <li> I see a difference both wet and dry...</li>
            <li> less hair left in the drain at the end of my shower.  </li>
            <li> But after a few months I started to get all these little sprouts of new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Have tried Bosley&#x27;s but makes my hair feel very dry.</li>
            <li> As long as I use this, my thinning hair (due to autoimmune diseases) looks fuller/thicker.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little dab of shampoo to do the job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for probably about 5 months now, and I only use every other day for the last few months and MY HAIR IS THICKER!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended it to me about a year ago when I complained of thinning hair (part of the new-found wonders of old age).</li>
            <li> The size of the bottles will last at least 6 months - even washing daily.</li>
            <li> As far as the negative reviews, I tend to suppose that some are having an allergic reaction to an ingredient, probably the propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li> I was late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s that time when I started using nioxin.</li>
            <li> I have minimal hair loss; the hair stays cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> expected the cleanser &amp; conditioner to smell like a medicine treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times</li>
            <li> The doctor said it would be permanant since the hair roots had been crushed.</li>
            <li> So be careful that you are ordering the correct item...  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser said it&#x27;ll take until the second bottle to show noticeable results but after a few weeks I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Products were as expected</li>
            <li> Only wish the bottles came with pumps as the bottles are quite heavy to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few months</li>
            <li> think if you are hypothyroid then there&#x27;s just not much that can&lt;br /&gt;be done to thicken the hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; I pasted them below, if you&#x27;re curious.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it till it&#x27;s empty</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife and she seemed to like it although we both did not really observe any thickening of hair.  </li>
            <li> a  few weeks later I tried it again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Routine: I apply the shampoo immediately upon entering and rinsing my hair to get it wet.</li>
            <li> Item was received as expected.</li>
            <li> so I spent a minute searching and found my answers.  </li>
            <li> Proctor and Gamble bought Nioxin Research Laboratories in 2009 and closed the Atlanta Head Quarters.  </li>
            <li> A big waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not really moisturizing and in fact I can&#x27;t even get a comb through my hair after using the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed simply thicker feeling hair.</li>
            <li> I was having such trouble with an itchy scalp that I went to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> A few other hairs showed the same thing!  </li>
            <li> and yes, Nioxin is now manufactured in Mexico amongst a few other countries (for international sales), all not the U.S.  </li>
            <li> 2 major things I have noticed over the course of the past month is considerably less hair in the bath drain, and, not having to wash my hair as often.</li>
            <li> Hair fall is still the same maybe a little less...</li>
            <li> After using the Nioxin system, It was a fuzzy, dry mess.  </li>
            <li> I do seem to loose less hair when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Until 2 years ago, I noticed my hair shedding massively, every time when I use #4 shampoo specially conditioner, I saw my hair hundreds shedding down with water flow to the drain, I was so painful..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t used any other styling products or heat styling products</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and stopped using Nioxin to see how other products match up.</li>
            <li> The effect is what other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> And it will be scary at first...</li>
            <li> The whispy, weak tiny hairs that did manage to grow in the narrowed folicles fell out within a week or so of starting.</li>
            <li> I started using this system for only the past 3-4 weeks and my hair is falling out in clumps</li>
            <li> OFF\\&quot; brand ( as some of the other reviews I read mentioned).</li>
            <li> and she said has passed this info on to her other clients</li>
            <li> but as some other reviewers stated my hair started falling out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive</li>
            <li> and it was thinning due to a thyroid problem.  </li>
            <li> None of there other products work for me</li>
            <li> I lost hair due to stress after my dad passed.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos have synthetic fragrance that I&#x27;m allergic too.  </li>
            <li> I lost my hair due to hormones and when I started using Nioxin my hair stopped falling out..</li>
            <li> It seems to have stopped or extremely  slowed the thinning and receding of my hair since I began using this almost 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hairs in my temple area which I think is due to this product use.</li>
            <li> I have used other Nioxin products I go out of my way to find, but I will never use this again.  </li>
            <li> I will NOT use any other brand of shampoo or conditioner.  </li>
            <li> ive not seen this product fail with those who are willing to keep using it faithfully and wait for it to do</li>
            <li> Purchased for my spouse and He has been using it due to thinning hair for about a month now.  </li>
            <li> Other products I use also do that, so I don&#x27;t think of it as a detriment.</li>
            <li> on to other things.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy build up like other shmpoos</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner to replace the small start up kit I purchased locally.</li>
            <li> , it looked unhealthy, flat and dull, just very blah.  </li>
            <li> I would just say watch very carefully and stop using immediately if you notice your hair getting thinner.</li>
            <li> so not only are they poor at following through on their order but</li>
            <li> But this is always my reaction to a fake product claim  when the reviews are generally positive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin&#x27;s System 4 shampoo and scalp treatment for a couple years now because of thinning and weak hair and a sensitive scalp prone to scaliness even though I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not right for me.</li>
            <li> and it was a little pink, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $10 less than all beauty supply stores and other online sites.</li>
            <li> I really do think this a fake product</li>
            <li> I bought a small kit, the Level 4, because in the last few years I have started putting blond highlights in my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> If used regularly for at least 6 months, hair will regrowth.</li>
            <li> I started showing signs of female pattern hair loss in my late 30&#x27;s, something that runs in my family.</li>
            <li> My hair is long layers past my shoulders</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is, once you stop using it your hair goes back to limp thin feeling.  </li>
            <li> It also has slowed down my hair loss.</li>
            <li> fuller)it weighed my hair down, making it look flatter.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> use every other day or so and have no intention of changing!  </li>
            <li> This set is 33.8oz &amp; lasts me 3-4 months since you only have to use a small amount!</li>
            <li> This particular shampoo gave no tingling sensation whatsoever and left my hair limp and quite unhappy.</li>
            <li> Hair was very lifeless, dull, THIN, and flyaway.  </li>
            <li> This product was not instant in the results but after a few months the lose started to slow down.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nioxin system for less than 2 months and have already noticed a difference in hair growth.  </li>
            <li> 3* times the amount for less money.  </li>
            <li> Significantly less breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li> Have noticed much less hair loss along with softer, healthier feeling hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been less than observant about the nutritional supplements that are supposed to help feed the scalp / folicles, I started out with a 30 day supply, and have used maybe half of it...</li>
            <li> My hair is getting thicker and is falling out less</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of my dermatologist for slight thinning of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for less than a year</li>
            <li> I see less hair on the tub.</li>
            <li> My part is showing a lot less scalp</li>
            <li> It might even be slightly thicker than before.  </li>
            <li> and I notice less hair loss when I use the product</li>
            <li> Had to previously obtain from salon/ beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I took one star off because we still could not get an answer on the product&#x27;s expiration date which is probably some cryptic code hidden somewhere on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Less hair in my brush now .</li>
            <li> I also did use biotin supplements but stopped for a month and a half to test the product itself.</li>
            <li> Black Castor Oil n repeat</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t have ANY ACTIVE ingredients in it to help hair grow or reduce hair loss!</li>
            <li> I seem to be losing less hair as time goes on</li>
            <li> question also is prompted by a previous review I read on AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Seriously can&#x27;t say enough.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is falling off less.</li>
            <li> :( I don’t know what’s happening, and I still have the old one left a little to compare with, maybe different factory??</li>
            <li> Not knowing what else to do, I moved a small amount to a wide mouth jar which allowed me to scoop it out with my finger to put on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t itch just hurt as though I had just had my hair in a tight pony tail and had taken the pony tail out.  </li>
            <li> It was a major disappointment since they used the same brand label.</li>
            <li> If you are disappointed when you first start using it, all I can say is don&#x27;t give up!!  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a set that has the same size bottle and not too small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy</li>
            <li> It just started looking a little fuller, so I am encouraged and plan to continue  using it.</li>
            <li> I tried other product for hair loss and thinning for the past two year</li>
            <li> It smell a little like mint.</li>
            <li> and I think my hair is a little thicker...</li>
            <li> You can tell that No. 4 has either been deluted or is simply too weak.  </li>
            <li> I have little sprouts of hair all over my head growing, so I know this shampoo and scalp therapy is working, now if I could just keep my hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> The bottles are professional size and are so heavy that it is very difficult taking a shower and handling the bottle with one hand; therefore, I went back online with Amazon</li>
            <li> but it was not very healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 months now, and while I&#x27;m in the shower a few hairs always come out.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying that the bald spots are gone, but I am going from polish your scalp type bald, to thin but obviously fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I am going back to my dove shampoo/phyto for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Product is too heavy on hair.</li>
            <li> , it effects my heart, gives me palpitations, so I have trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;Try it out and see.</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair out and made it look like straw......</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a waste of $$ now.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with hair loss.</li>
            <li> May try it again in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I went out of town, and didnt bring it, and my hair was limp to my head.. :</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks of product usage for the thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Have used it a few months.</li>
            <li> It does seem to make my hair a bit limp but you can overcome this by using the Nioxin Volumizing Mouse afterwards.</li>
            <li> In my everlasting quest to pay less, I often buy on Amazon as it&#x27;s usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> The price that I can get both of these products from Amazon is LESS than what I used to pay for one!</li>
            <li> I have fuller looking hair, no dandruff, less breakage and some regrowth after just 2 months!</li>
            <li> Plus the price here on Amazon is WAYYYYY less than in Ulta!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if your hairloss is due to a medical condition, all this product does is mask the symptons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the hair growth is from the Biotin supplement I take, or the shampoo, but I take a medicine that thins my hair a bit and something is making it grow a little.</li>
            <li> These products are terrific for those of us with thinning hair and were much less expensive than buying from salon.</li>
            <li> However, in the past I have used these two products along with the scalp treatment and hairs stopped falling out within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Dried out hair excessively.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that Nioxin gave my hair a little boost and slowly</li>
            <li> From past use of Nioxin products I believe there is suppose to be a tingling sensation that indicates that the shampoo is working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 weeks and already notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what there response was, not sure they still are using it.</li>
            <li> According to Nioxin they do not have any \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; online sellers, but that usually doesn&#x27;t deter me because there are some brick &amp; mortar salons that are authorized dealers that also sell online.  </li>
            <li> Been using nioxin for 6 years and usually would buy it at salons and ulta...</li>
            <li> but when I asked her for a tracking number she said I would get it by the end of the day even though it was the end of business past the deadline for outgoing shipments.  </li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t handle the excessive amount of hair I was loosing.</li>
            <li> She said her mom has no more bald</li>
            <li> No more excess hair in the shower, my brush nor anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 3 months, and am not really sure anything has changed, so I&#x27;ve decided to forgo its use.  </li>
            <li> Using this product for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest at the least that if you use this product, you try a skin test for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Am now leery of buying this product on line, even though usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helped with my scalp, but it is not a magically hair growth solution.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it does, but it has helped me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will ever stop using this product and recommend it to the rest of my family who all have thin/thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone with thin or thinning hair!</li>
            <li> Hence,&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is the product or the length of hair which makes the difference.</li>
            <li> Not sure its helping.</li>
            <li> I am usually a skeptic of these products, but this one truly worked for me.</li>
            <li> Adding on the scalp therapy (it&#x27;s a small pump type bottle)</li>
            <li> I am now dealing with patches of small hairs sticking up all over my head</li>
            <li> Around the same time all of my hair became very thin and would not hold any style.  </li>
            <li> The 33 ounce size will last for months/ I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I went from having very thick, wavy hair that everyone envied to have really thin hair, to the point where my scalp was visible on the upper sides of my head and at the front hairline.</li>
            <li> noticed that the conditioner SEEMED like it wasn&#x27;t as thick as it usually is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nioxin is hard to find in a retail setting</li>
            <li> but I was no longer losing hardly any hair at all.</li>
            <li> seems the shampoo makes it hard to comb through after I wash.</li>
            <li> I will say using it makes my hair appear fuller which is at least something.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t clog the drain) where the follicle met the end, and it looked visibly thicker - at least 30% thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have been loosing my hair in hand fulls for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> Being a female, I was distraught.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did take at least a month to see a change.</li>
            <li> , I found that it made my hair feel and look dirty the next day.</li>
            <li> The conditioner sucks.</li>
            <li> but it sucks.</li>
            <li> , with in 2 weeks my hair was hear covered and started to get so thick , I use it all the time</li>
            <li> But to my dismay my hair loss got worse everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever have thick hair because I never had that to begin with.</li>
            <li> My hair always looked like it was dirty or greasy and flat.  </li>
            <li> Because this Shampoo and Conditioner is so expensive, and because I can&#x27;t find it at my grocery store or drug store, I tried using other products for a while.  </li>
            <li> &amp; you dont need to use alot I had way less shedding today from 2 weeks ago!!!</li>
            <li> Seems expensive, but pricewise is competitive to other retailers!</li>
            <li> I am having serious hair loss issues and the cause can&#x27;t be determined.  </li>
            <li> Big dramatic difference!!</li>
            <li> If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the staff continued to over hydrate me until I gained 50 pounds in 1 week.</li>
            <li> nope, if it suds up, I dont want it, not good for your hair\\</li>
            <li> NOT good for your hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you have thinning hair I don&#x27;t believe there is much you can do about it :(</li>
            <li> but it makes my hair dull, stringy and tangled!</li>
            <li> Last purchased about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with its results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed in the face that a packing slip was not included from the shipper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin&#x27;s System 1 to 4 shampoo and scalp treatment for a 10 years now because of thinning, weak and lost hair begun to note.</li>
            <li> The product is totally artificial and the minty scented ingredients slightly burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I could not get a straight answer from Amazon.com and based on the lies I have been told today</li>
            <li> Probably I would today still have very very thick wavy silky hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> It was thin to begin with</li>
            <li> What a poor way to run a company.  </li>
            <li> the smell is weird (at least, to me).</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair was falling out worse than it was before I used it.  </li>
            <li> Also, my husband thought it smelled terrible - very chemically - could use a scent with the product to make hair not so stinky afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably thin and color-treated.</li>
            <li> This suit do work for people with thin hair and used to perm, I like it.</li>
            <li> In fact, it got worse while I was on it.  </li>
            <li> She explained the technology and research behind it all.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with it</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I purchased this product for to help with thin hair and periodic loss.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who uses Nioxin knows that it ages poorly.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, stringy hair</li>
            <li> Thin hair runs in family.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nioxin System 3 in a salon (approximately Jan. 23) and paid $106 for 3 piece set.  </li>
            <li> i panicked at the sight because ive never experienced that before.</li>
            <li> that runs in my family, women with thin hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin, unhealthy hair or are having a lot of fallout, PLEASE try Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of thin mints... without the calories, of course.</li>
            <li> I still have some hair loss, perhaps it would be worse if I didn&#x27;t use the product.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting really thin .  </li>
            <li> Made my hair worse.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend for women with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to return but really disappointing.</li>
            <li> It might not have the dramatic effect that monoxidil is said to have (this is Rogaine, for instance)</li>
            <li> It has all the bad ingredients in it which are harsh chemicals and sulfates that one is advised not to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from crazy thick hair to noticeably thinning</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it made things worse.</li>
            <li> I understand this treatment only retard the lost hair</li>
            <li> The third step is also horrible, it mattes my hair at the roots so bad, that my hair breaks even if I am using a wide toothed comb!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie to you, but I am merely 6 weeks in, and the difference is dramatic.</li>
            <li> and i was not pleased!!!  </li>
            <li> (I grabbed the wrong bottle, but</li>
            <li> We are talking going from almost shiny bald spots, to merely peeking scalp.</li>
            <li> I started on the treatment being skeptical</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell the weird minty smell anymore at all.</li>
            <li> And that, unfortunately, means these are expired products.</li>
            <li> The bottles are difficult to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Expensive and loaded with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am traveling overseas, so I could not exchange.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I neglected to read the ingredients before purchasing this.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, too.</li>
            <li> For those wondering if this product is fake or legitimate let your fingers do the research.  </li>
            <li> ,I m not sure if I continue using it :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also guessing that some of those who say it is fake are hair professionals and do not want to encourage buying this online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too expensive</li>
            <li> Hopefully, this will eliminate the difficult procedure for dispensing the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Annoying to tame</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner on my VERY thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this might be fake</li>
            <li> I found out the Nioxin SOLD TO PROCTOR &amp; GAMBLE, and it gets worst, Proctor &amp; Gamble CLOSED the NIOXIN Headquarters and FACTORY!</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for years-hair loss is minimal-would be afraid not to use it at this point.</li>
            <li> This is so depressing.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate about my thinning hair</li>
            <li> I was desperate and a hair dresser recommended this</li>
            <li> This product adds thickness volume and body to my very thin hair!</li>
            <li> I use it because my hair was thinning badly (some recommended it), seems to be controlled.  </li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was horrible and doctors could not find anything wrong, no problem with the thyroid, hormonal imbalance, nothing.</li>
            <li> I thought I was receiving the scalp therapy, but shall now have to reorder it separately, which is rather annoying.  </li>
            <li> are crazy to not try it!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> It was devastating.</li>
            <li> It didnt strip out my hair color though, but this is the worst ever hairfall I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel terrible after washing it...like stuck together and tangled  </li>
            <li> I have an auto immune disease called AS and was on Humira injections and my hair loss was terrible.</li>
            <li> My scalp was getting to the point of being miserable</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really works. It tingles &amp; smells funny.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has completely changed the texture and thickness of my hair- for the better! I have minimal hair loss; the hair stays cleaner longer. I am beyond happy. Of note, it took about a year to see these results. Great product! Amazon has the best prices for this. I will never buy at a regular store or salon again.</li>
            <li> Great Price for great products!</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner. its smells super clean and it&#x27;s also does strip my hair out like others. also it&#x27;s cheapest on amazon. will be buying from here for now on.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I really love this production. My hair is clean, shiny and healthy. I purchased a smaller sized set with the scalp therapy and was so impressed I ordered the large size this time.</li>
            <li> Love Nioxin system&lt;br /&gt;See difference after one use</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nioxin system for less than 2 months and have already noticed a difference in hair growth.  Nioxin was recommended to me by a Hair Colorist who had gone through chemo treatments.  My thinning hair is partially due to aging but mostly from my medication that I&#x27;ve been taking over the past 12 years.  I&#x27;ve gone from crazy thick hair to noticeably thinning and I needed help in trying to save my hair from getting any thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected the cleanser &amp; conditioner to smell like a medicine treatment but it doesn&#x27;t.  It leaves my hair shiny and manageable without any other styling products which is surprising with my naturally curly-frizzy hair.  Discarded my previous shampoos and conditioners and this is now my only product to use.</li>
            <li> GREAT price for the quantity of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to be the same as what I purchased at Ulta, it did not tingle my scalp and there was more hair loss than with the ulta products.</li>
            <li> Great product, feels, looks and smells great!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel healthy. I also believe it&#x27;s made my hair feel thicker and less hair loss especially when you die your hair.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product because it was recommended by my barber. I tried it and liked it but thought it was too expensive. I found it on line and will buy it from here from now on. It makes the hair you have healthier and helps it grow. It does not regrow lost hair, however...rather keeps the hair you have.</li>
            <li> like system 3 much better, this doesnt seem to condition my hair as much. I&#x27;ll use the rest due to the investment, but def going back to system 3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy but well worth it. Since having thyroid cancer and now on daily thyroid medication my shoulder length hair had become very dry and brittle. I considered cutting it short but decided to try a different shampoo one more time.  After using the shampoo and conditioner about a month,I could see and feel a huge difference. I love it!</li>
            <li> Friends noticed a difference after the 1st month. Smells great and hair feels healthy</li>
            <li> I started to have so much hair loss , you could see my scalp. , with in 2 weeks my hair was hear covered and started to get so thick , I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.  From past use of Nioxin products I believe there is suppose to be a tingling sensation that indicates that the shampoo is working. This particular shampoo gave no tingling sensation whatsoever and left my hair limp and quite unhappy. Sources say that some suppliers sell out dated stock- maybe that&#x27;s what I received?? Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product You feel it working on your scalp the minute you apply.Im very satistfied and hope to continue using. the transaction was very fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product works--you just have to use it faithfully and understand it will take a while to see results.  Don&#x27;t expect masses of new hair overnight.  My doctor recommended it to me about a year ago when I complained of thinning hair (part of the new-found wonders of old age). I have more hair and less thinning (in the patches where I KNOW there is thinning hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin is hard to find in a retail setting so Amazon is a great source.  The product was reasonably priced and shipped for free.  I LOVE free shipping! And I have to admit it--I am a great fan of Amazon.  There is nothing like browsing through the products--reading reviews (yes, I rely on them), making a selection, taking a moment to check out and receiving the product within a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for years-hair loss is minimal-would be afraid not to use it at this point. Good price, fast shipping; Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I started taking blood pressure medicine about three months ago and started to experience major hair thinning and some hair loss. My hair is straight and long. It was thin to begin with so I was so upset to be able to literally see my scalp thru my hair when it started to thin.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped taking the medicine and was told my hair SHOULD come back but there was no guarentee. :(&lt;br /&gt;I had a friend suggest this product. She used it when her hair fell out and thinned after she had her daughter. I figured I would give it a try..after a month of vitamins and no other luck with seeing any improvement with my thinning/hair loss what did I have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;After the first use my scalp was tingling and felt much cleaner then what my normal shampoo&#x27;s offered. The cleanser has a mint scent but after your hair drys the mint smell goes away. I also can use about half the amount of conditioner I normally would use as it is light yet works very well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been three days now and my hair appears much fuller and there is more body then ever before! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like after a month. So far I love this product!</li>
            <li> thank you great price</li>
            <li> The best shampoo ever and conditioner the product is excelent</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Works great.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on your scalp, after I use Shampoo and then Conditioner, my hair feels and smells so fresh and minty!</li>
            <li> good stuff good price</li>
            <li> These products take time to show results but I believe they do work better than most others on the market.</li>
            <li> Great Product ,half of the price what your beauty salon charges</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I have been using it for years and my hair if thick and my scalp is healthy.  Would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair.  Mine is hereditary and this and Rogaine have so far helped me to not lose my hair like my relatives did.</li>
            <li> not working as hair loss, I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Best hair cleanser system I have ever used. I will never buy anything else. The first 2 weeks I used it, my hair grew about a half an inch and my bald spot started filling back in. 6 months later, my hair has grown several inches and is much much thicker!!</li>
            <li> The Nioxin system has helped restore my post menopausal thinning scalp. I have been using this product now for 2 years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> as described, received quickly</li>
            <li> Great product, awesome price!</li>
            <li> I was loosing a lot of hair, when I started using the shampoo I noticed a great improvement and no longer am loosing that much hair, only the regulat amount.</li>
            <li> My husband encouraged me to go to the internet to just check to see what I could order and how much it would be.  I paid $100.00 for this exact same thing from my salon. This is an outrage. I not only will order from this company again I have told anyone who would listen.  Shame on people who price gouge! What goes around comes back to you.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and helps grow new hair after bariatric surgery.</li>
            <li> I was most concerned with authenticity.  I am having serious hair loss issues and the cause can&#x27;t be determined.  In desperation, I went to my local salon and paid $50 for a 10oz. bottle of shampoo and 10oz. bottle of conditioner.  In this purchase, it is *3* times the amount for less money.  So I was worried about authenticity but the ingredient listing on both products are the same as what came from my salon.  And my hair feels the same as the salon bought product.  I will say I purchased from COSTSELL on Amazon, so I can&#x27;t say if this is true for other sellers on Amazon.  I went ahead and bought another liter set from this same seller immediately because for the price this can&#x27;t be beat.  As for the product itself, I am waiting patiently for results.  I will say using it makes my hair appear fuller which is at least something.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, I got rid of my dry scalp</li>
            <li> Great system!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of my hair after giving birth to my son.  I started using Nioxin in 2007 and am still using it today :)&lt;br /&gt;#one happy customer</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my stylist, but I chose to purchase through Amazon, as the price was much lower than the salon price.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 weeks and already notice a difference.  According to my stylist, the trick is to use the shampoo and conditioner exclusively, no other brands of shampoo and conditioner.  At this price, this is easy to do, compared to the alternatives of either a &amp;#34;rogaine for women&amp;#34; product or hair implants.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using nioxin. The first bottles I bought were from a salon. I noticed a huge difference with in a week. When I ran out of those bottles I bought these off Amazon. My hair feels thin and not as strong and healthy as it did with that first initial bottle I bought from the salon. I really do think this a fake product and I would just rather spend a little more money and get the real deal. And dear Amazon, I want my money back!</li>
            <li> I had already been using this product &amp; spending a fortune to buy it. Amazon had the best prices, I checked everywhere. They always save me money!</li>
            <li> My scalp feels Cleaner and so does my hair.  Nice scents, and rinses out clean.  Really like them so far.</li>
            <li> Nioxin Cleanser and Scalp Therapy are great for itch relief from psoriasis.  Do not use the scalp treatment!  Can&#x27;t live without my scalp therapy.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Product really works.  Whether results are permanent I don&#x27;t care,  as my hair looks fuller each time I use.  Love the tingle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was losing hair rapidly, and this system has stopped most of that.  Thanks to my hairdresser for putting me onto it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work-my hair has not had any change. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with delivery and product</li>
            <li> very very good for hair, grow for hair!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and arrived in prrrrrfect condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;and, thank you again!</li>
            <li> I bought previously similar item from beauty supply store, and the cleanser was more concentrated, even different color(more vibrant green)!:( I don’t know what’s happening, and I still have the old one left a little to compare with, maybe different factory??:(</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel wonderful</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months and its completely destroyed my hair. I&#x27;ve always had fine hair but this caused my hair to shed at a higher rate than normal causing my hair to appear much much thinner. I read this can initially happen but I don&#x27;t see how handfuls of hair falling out constantly good. Also the texture of my hair changed to be dry and tangled all the time, the nioxin sucked all the oils and moisture from my hair. I don&#x27;t used any other styling products or heat styling products so I know its from the nioxin. Also I have had way more breakage. I will never recommend this product for anyone to use and wish I never would have bought it.</li>
            <li> ok, I tried this once before about a month again and here we go again! This item also appears to be a knockoff. Made in Mexico &amp; has a sticker on the side of the bottle. The one I&#x27;ve been purchasing locally was made in the USA and has the labeling imprinted on the bottle. I was just trying to find a better price. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> nioxin system 4 cleaner is great. love it. will buy more when out. Went threw Amazon and had excellent service. Have used Amazon many times and have always had great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 months now, and while I&#x27;m in the shower a few hairs always come out.  But this last time, I noticed a hair stuck to the shower wall (where it goes at first so it doesn&#x27;t clog the drain) where the follicle met the end, and it looked visibly thicker - at least 30% thicker.  Broke out my jeweler&#x27;s loupe just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just wishful thinking, and sure enough, it was at least 30-50% thicker!  A few other hairs showed the same thing!  Super excited - this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that really improved the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Nioxin products are just great! I have thinning hair and stopped using Nioxin to see how other products match up. I went right back to Nioxin... hair is a lot healthier (I have been coloring my hair for 25 years). Significantly less breakage and shedding. You can feel it working as it tingles on your scalp and smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but I can&#x27;t continue. It&#x27;s never possible to really know what causes hair shedding but when I use this, it seems to double my hair shed.  I&#x27;m a 40+ woman so maybe its just getting older but I&#x27;ve noticed increased hair shedding/thinning for more than a year now. I also have mild dandruff. Hair shedding started to increase again a couple months ago so I was trying different shampoos again.  So far, there&#x27;s no miracle shampoo but Nizoral seems to be the best for me.</li>
            <li> excellent product for thinning hair</li>
            <li> The stuff works!!!!  Its rare these days to find something that actually works according to the advertised claims. Believe me, the Nioxin system 4 cleanser and scalp therapy liter set works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin since my hair started falling out in 2005.  Probably the only reason  I still have hair.</li>
            <li> ordered this for our friends that both have thinning hair.  Not sure what there response was, not sure they still are using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. Wish it did. It also weighs my hair down even if I use just a tiny dot. It would probably be wonderful as a conditioner for coarse, thick, or dry hair. I gave it two stars because it really smells good!</li>
            <li> A+ Product as arrived as description, no problems at all, the Shampoo is awesome! I use it every days, and my hair started to stay really strong! I would recommend this to everyone with hair problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nioxin and really appreciate that I can get it through Amazon at such great prices!</li>
            <li> Awesome experience and product</li>
            <li> OK, I know writing a review should not be done until I can evaluate how it works, but I think it&#x27;s important to share info about the reason why the product I received may not work as described by the manufacturer.  I rec&#x27;d the bottles as shown in the description--they looked new and arrived on time. However, no batch code printed anywhere on the bottles.  Nioxin product has a 3-year shelf life so it&#x27;s important to make sure you are getting fresh product by checking the batch code.  The first two numbers of the code indicate the production year, e.g. 11 is 2011.  The three numbers following that number is the day of the year (001  through 365) that the product was manufactured.  Sometimes a batch code has a dash, in which case the two digits after the dash determine the production year (e.g. -10 is 2010)and there is no way to tell the actual day of the year in this format.  If a product does not have a batch code on it then it is highly likely to not be authentic Nioxin product.  According to Nioxin they do not have any \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; online sellers, but that usually doesn&#x27;t deter me because there are some brick &amp; mortar salons that are authorized dealers that also sell online.  However, I refuse to use accept product that is suspect in origin.</li>
            <li> Hair was thinning..... this product has helped tremendously.  I have bought it three times now and have a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with product have seen results</li>
            <li> This really seems to work well for me. My hair looks and feels thicker.</li>
            <li> Have noticed much less hair loss along with softer, healthier feeling hair. Cooling ingredient stimulates my scalp and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was told that it would help with thinning hair.  It did NOT.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  I love the minty feel.  It&#x27;s a greT price as well.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Very good price for the size bottles and product is very good.</li>
            <li> Awesome service, and what a great price for the product!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I lost 2/3 of my hair all at once. I was in the ICU last year for pneumonia. If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the staff continued to over hydrate me until I gained 50 pounds in 1 week. I was like the Pillsbury Doughboy. My face and entire head was swollen, along with the rest of my body. It was a nightmare, and caused an additional 2 week stay. I saw a dermatologist that said I had telogen effuvium. I was told Rogain wouldn&#x27;t help and that causes scalp itching. The doctor said it would be permanant since the hair roots had been crushed. It was devastating. I first tried suppliments for four months without result. Nioxin was on sale, and although the bottle offered wasn&#x27;t for my hair type, I bought it. After finishing the bottle, I noticed new, curly hair, and my visable scalp was filling in. Additionally my hair actually grew. I then bought the Nioxon formula 4 in the liter set. It&#x27;s $10 less than all beauty supply stores and other online sites. I&#x27;m continuing to see new growth, and very satisfied. It&#x27;s got a fresh minty smell and has improved the texture of my existing hair. I&#x27;m a convert! 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> For starters. I am very skeptical when it comes to baldness treatments kind of filing them under the category of Snake Oil and political promises. However this product came recommended by my wife&#x27;s hair stylist. Even if it didn&#x27;t help my hair grow back, it was still supposedly a good shampoo and conditioner that would at least help me make the most of what hair I had left. And it didn&#x27;t cost any more than the other premium shampoo / conditioner brands we have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So simply put, I was losing my hair on top my hairline was racing toward my neck as fast as it would go. I had way more scalp than hair. I started thinning probably 10 years ago, and just didn&#x27;t think any thing would work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 weeks ago, when getting what hair I had left trimmed, the hair lady, that has been doing my wife&#x27;s families hair since she was in junior high, suggested I try this stuff. Now she is not prone to just pushing any old hair care product. She is known to be a stickler for only recommending things that do what they are supposed to. So I figured, okay, what&#x27;s to lose? If my hair went much more I was going to shave it all off and go spear bald anyway... So I got the level 4 shampoo, conditioner, and the level 3 spray stuff (I grabbed the wrong bottle, but oh well) and she threw in the dietary supplements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on this stuff and how it works. It is supposed to thoroughly clean the hair and folicles, opening up the folicles and then thoroughly feeding the scalp etc... The effect is what other reviewers have noted. And it will be scary at first... The whispy, weak tiny hairs that did manage to grow in the narrowed folicles fell out within a week or so of starting. So at first I got a little bit balder, but within a week after that I noticed peach fuzz on my bald spots, and a LOT of it. I am now 6 weeks after starting the program, and I must say, the bald spot in front / on top is now completely covered. I no longer sweep whatever hairs I have left over the spot to cover it. Yes I can still see scalp. I won&#x27;t lie to you, but I am merely 6 weeks in, and the difference is dramatic. We are talking going from almost shiny bald spots, to merely peeking scalp. Same thing with the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, If your hair is like mine was, you really don&#x27;t have much left to lose, and so much to gain... You owe it to yourself, your career, and your wife (if you are married) to try this. You&#x27;ll look a LOT younger, and you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself because of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED AT THE 4 MONTH MARK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started on the treatment being skeptical, I had my wife take photos of my bald spots with the camera on my phone. Nothing there in spots about 1.5\\&quot; in diameter but smooth as a babies butt skin. Now at the 4 month point, it&#x27;s all fuzzy, covered in short, but healthy hairs. I had her zoom in this time to the same spots. I don&#x27;t think there is more than 1/4\\&quot; between any two hairs now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying that the bald spots are gone, but I am going from polish your scalp type bald, to thin but obviously fuzzy. No this is no overnight miracle, but the results so far have been astonishingly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been less than observant about the nutritional supplements that are supposed to help feed the scalp / folicles, I started out with a 30 day supply, and have used maybe half of it... I really should stick with that part better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I should mention I am intentionally avoiding products like Rogaine as I have heard that with that product, and similar ones, you have to keep using it once you start, or you go spear bald... I did have to temper my expectations somewhat, but I am more than pleased with what I am seeing! And so is my wife!</li>
            <li> The products seems to be working.  I have been using this for a few months and my hair may not be that much fuller, however, it has grown faster than it had been.</li>
            <li> I started using this system for only the past 3-4 weeks and my hair is falling out in clumps and i developed split ends which I have never had before. I noticed the excess hair loss during the first wash itself after I applied the conditioner. I thought I just need time to adjust to the system, but no sir, with the rate of hair fall, I will go bald in the next couple of months. It didnt strip out my hair color though, but this is the worst ever hairfall I have ever had in my life. Hair is every where. I didnt notice the severity until my coworkers told me that I had strands all over the back of my shirt. I wanted to be patient because I bought the 4 litres after reading all the brilliant reviews online, but I am not taking any more chances. I am going back to my dove shampoo/phyto for thin hair. The third step is also horrible, it mattes my hair at the roots so bad, that my hair breaks even if I am using a wide toothed comb! Test run it with a sample or buy the cheaper version $30, before you jump in!</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN products for a while now, since i had my hair FRIED from bleaching at the salon, and all of the top of my hair SPLIT off. ( I was using wen to make help it from sticking STRAIGHT UP!. I went to ANOTHER salon and they did a NON perm color on me ( so I wont fry it anymore) and My hair is very fine as well. she asked me what i used. I told her WEN. She said that is great stuff, I used it until i started using NIOXIN. I was like \\&quot; nope, if it suds up, I dont want it, not good for your hair\\&quot; I thought. She finally conviced me to TRY the follical booster. I said sure..as long as i can use it with my WEN.:) I saw a difference in that product alone! i was like WOW. so i read alittle about it, and it said it works better if you use the shampoo( cleanser and scalp therapy)...I was on amazon one day and looked it up...had a moment and hit..\\&quot;BUY\\&quot;. I thought OH NO what did I do? that might be a \\&quot; KNOCK OFF\\&quot; brand ( as some of the other reviews I read mentioned). I thought oh well, we shall see...&lt;br /&gt;  It came 2 days later, I DID use it..and the first time it did make my hair NOT look AS good as WEN..but it was OK...then I kept using it though( i DID buy the dang LITER). I used it and on the third time...BAM! My hair FEELS like hair, and I hope it does what it says..( the stoping hair from falling out part) because alittle of the stuff goes ALONG ways..I dont have to use a lot..and after buying this size, I will be using it for some time. I really like it...&lt;br /&gt;Tip- if you have really dry hair and want even MORE moisture( like i did WHILE my hair grows to lay down from being bleached on top) i just used a SHINE spray Right before My hiar is fully blown dry...and BAM...shiney hair that looks and feels like hair....im Sold....If you are thinking of buying this and have hesitation...do like i did and just hit the..\\&quot;buy\\&quot; button..then We all can see YOUR post of how well it did for you too!.:)</li>
            <li> Received quickly and product was just as advertised.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Been using nioxin for 6 years and usually would buy it at salons and ulta... Thought I&#x27;d trust Amazon but right when I got my package I used it... The usual mint smelt like mold old mint. I&#x27;m horrified because I didn&#x27;t realize it till it was in my hair.. Washed it out and even used different shampoo to get out the scent but it didn&#x27;t work and I smelt like moldy old mint... AWFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin shampoo and conditioner for 15 years.  I am a middle aged woman with very thinning hair.  It has definitely helped.  This is a great value too, they are huge bottles, which will last a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best shampoo and conditioner that I have ever used. My former thinning, fragile and lifeless hair has come back to life. After only one month the growing bald spot on my crown is less obvious. I&#x27;ve used Pail Mitchell and other quality hair products for years and Nioxin is easily the superior product!</li>
            <li> I very much wanted this to help with my thinning hair but unfortunately it made things worse. Within 2 weeks my hair my hairloss had increased. I at first took this as a sign the product was working. But to my dismay my hair loss got worse everyday. So after 3 months I stopped using this. After a week of using a different shampoo and conditioner I noticed that my hair loss had gone back to a normal amount. Now my scalp shows right through my hair on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and my hair has been shedding even more than before! Not only that but it makes my hair dull, stringy and tangled! Horrible product! I wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> This is a great price for these products</li>
            <li> This is the best cleaning system for thinning hair especially for hair that is chemically treated.  It really makes your scalp tingle.  It is best to also get the scalp treatment to use with it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> After weight loss surgery I lost a lot of hair.  My brother, had the same problem after his surgery the year before, he was advised to use this shampoo by his doctor.  I noticed fewer strands in my hairbrush after my first washing and after a month I noticed that number was down considerably and new hairs were growing.  When I got a haircut  6 or mote months later my hairstylist mentioned how much better my hair looked.  I told her about the shampoo and she said has passed this info on to her other clients</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it will grow your hair back, and I don&#x27;t think that is its intention, but it will stop your hair from falling out. I had meds that made my hair fall out. I stopped the meds and started using this shampoo as recommended by my stylist. Instead of pulling out numerous strands of hair like I always have I only have 2 or 3 come out since using this shampoo and my hair is growing back in. I thought it was sulfate free, but its not. This will be my third purchase of this shampoo and I am the type that is always looking for that perfect shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair that needs TLC, and these products provide that. My hairdresser is always amazed that my bleach/highlighted hair remains so healthy, and I&#x27;m sure that these Nioxin products are a part of that. I LOVE the tingly feel that you get on your scalp when using these products...makes me feel that something is really happening to preserve my hair and texture. The scent is refreshing and minty, rather than overly sweet or floral like many products out there.&lt;br /&gt;I like!</li>
            <li> Thank you, great price. awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a while they are very good products that help with the cleaning and protection of your hair</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that has started thinning since I turned 50. This shampoo and conditioner has helped the situation since I started using it a month ago. People asked me if I got my hair cut or did something different to my hair which I did not. It just started looking a little fuller, so I am encouraged and plan to continue  using it.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my thining hair. Love it! And these bottles were HUGE for the low price. I would have been able to purchase just one for the cost of the two at the store.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon today because the order I placed yesterday had not been filled or shiiped although the product was shown to be in stock.  When I spoke with their CSR - Reena she said it was shipped today but when I asked her for a tracking number she said I would get it by the end of the day even though it was the end of business past the deadline for outgoing shipments.  When I pressed her she began to backtrack.  I am very disappointed that I could not get a straight answer from Amazon.com and based on the lies I have been told today doubt that I will use Amazon.com again unless they make this right.  I will be checking the order daily until it is received and will post updates daily until I get a satisfactory answer or confirmation of the shipment.  Checked the status of my order again today, Reena for sure lied because it still shows that it hasnt shipped - Amazon SUCKS!  SO I checked the status on my order yet again this morning, it has now been 5 days since I placed my order, and yet again it still has not been shipped.  What a poor way to run a company.  This was my first and LAST Amazon.com order.  The customer service rep, Reena, also told me the order was being shipped 3 days ago so not only are they poor at following through on their order but they will also bold face lie right to your face when you call the check on your order.</li>
            <li> I have used this before.  IT&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> I began having major hair loss a couple of years ago. I am female, mind you. I went from really thick, super curly, frizzy hair (I called it my Jew-Fro lol), to very thin, somewhat straight hair.  I had very high stress factors of caring for a loved one in cancer decline and death, as well as normal work and children aspects AND having exceptionally high hormones. I attribute my hairloss to that combo. Regardless, I needed to do something before I just shaved my head! I did my research and built up to ingesting high doses of biotin. Although biotin helped GREATLY, I figured out by accident that it also made my hormonal cystic acne worse. So back to the drawing board, I tried the Nioxin line. A few months in now, I am VERY satisfied with the results. I almost can&#x27;t wait for a year from now when all the new growth is long :)  It is very effective. Not only do I have noticeable new growth, but I lose maybe 10% of what I was losing every shower prior to Nioxin (even the biotin didn&#x27;t help with the loss, it just helped more grow quickly). Things to note: 1. both shampoo and conditioner make your scalp feel fresh, think vicks. Not painful, but odd. 2. massaging the scalp during both shampoo and conditioner steps is a key aspect to their effectiveness. 3. the smell is weird (at least, to me). It&#x27;s a minty smell, which is not bad at first, but did bother me a little during the day. My resolve is I put a little of my old regular conditioner on over the nioxin conditioner. Really, it could be any cheap conditioner that smells good. I don&#x27;t smell the weird minty smell anymore at all. And as effective as Nioxin is, I couldn&#x27;t deduct a start for smell.  4. if you don&#x27;t have acne issues, you may want to try this topical Nioxin line as well as adding the Biotin vitamin to your regimen. ...Hope this helped. To happy, healthy hair and feeling good about yourself! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have been using for about 10 years.  The price of the product has soared and it was nice to get some relief with the price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Started turning my hair grey!</li>
            <li> Great product and price  buy it</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that started thinning earlier this year.  I found this product and thought it would be just what I needed however after using it for a couple of weeks I noticed that my hair was falling out worse than it was before I used it.  I quit and went back to a different shampoo/conditioner for thinning hair and after about a week the hair loss almost stopped.  There is no way I would ever use this product again.</li>
            <li> I can´t get enough of it! I just love Nioxin and my mom does too, because her hair is very fine and oily, she agrees this is the best shampoo ever...</li>
            <li> I have been using NIOXIN 4 for about 3 months now and it has made such a great difference. My hair is getting thicker and is falling out less then it was at first. Seller shipped out product quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Love this product!</li>
            <li> After using this Shampoo and condition, i am seeing lesser hairloss during my shower.  the HAir stays smooth after using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is the best for thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years. By buying it through Amazon I saved over 60% of the cost at our local store.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be good but as some other reviewers stated my hair started falling out. I don&#x27;t believe that you should have to watch massive amounts hit the floor while you wait to grow hair. Forget it. Thank goodness I stopped using it and the hair loss stopped. How ironic is that for a hair growth product!</li>
            <li> I have found the product to be very benifical to my hair.  I have used the product exculsivie for over two years and find it to be very good.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the system4 is hard to find in stores.  I bought this because my hair is super thin and I was balding. This has done wonders on my head!</li>
            <li> Product is too heavy on hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work because my hair is thinning, but I had to stop using it after just 5 weeks - my hair started falling out in large quantities. I contacted the company and they said it was normal in the first 3-4 weeks and that it meant that the product was working. They said it makes the hairs that are ready to fall out, fall out quicker so they can be replaced by stronger thicker hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, but after 5 weeks, I had to stop. I just couldn&#x27;t handle the excessive amount of hair I was loosing. I&#x27;ve been off Nioxin for 1 week, and the loss has not stopped. This is so depressing.</li>
            <li> I use this with diamax and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;m so glad my stylist recommended it. Arrived right on time &amp;&#x27;twas delivered perfectly! Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like Nioxin because it seems to stop hair loss which is very important to someone with thinning hair.  Ordering from Amazon is so easy and orders are delivered right to my home.</li>
            <li> I had to say it because I was a non believer I had researched everything and found out that if I used Monoxidil I would grow a beard! I went to a new stylist at ULTA salon to see what she could do for what was left of my hair (stress, aging, heredity, pool chemicals), I got a cute pixie and she told me her mother had cancer treatment and actually had BALD PATCHES and she recommended Nioxin. So I told her I didn&#x27;t believe there was anything that could work to help my fine frail thinning hair! She said her mom has no more bald patches.&lt;br /&gt; I used it 3-4 times a week for 2 months; shampoo, conditioner and mousse and I noticed clearly that my head was literally sprouting everywhere with new strong hair and growing fast! I had to go in for a cut and all my new best friend said was \\&quot;I told you\\&quot; :)&lt;br /&gt;There are several choices to fit your hair type and amount of thinning. I HAD TO CUT BACK TO ONCE A WEEK USE OR MY HAIR GROWS OUT OF THE PIXIE TOO FAST! I used #4&lt;br /&gt;You are crazy to not try it!!</li>
            <li> No frizzy hair.. smells great it shines and looks full.</li>
            <li> I love this Nioxin System 4, My hair feels great once I use it.  Will order this again once I get low.</li>
            <li> Good cleansing and conditioning prep for any scalp treatment.  Cleans well and after conditioning leaves my hair tangle-free.  Does not do much for my extra dry hair.  I haven&#x27;t seen new growth but believe it definitely helps in keeping the hair I still have.  No more excess hair in the shower, my brush nor anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I&#x27;ve been using Nixon for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I think that speaks for itself.  The fragrance , and the results  are why I keep purchasing this wonderful produce.  To me it&#x27;s second To NONE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s from Mexico now and it is not the same formula.  I wish I had known.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and was becoming noticeably thinner at the young age of 42. It was tough to comb through after showering, even when using good conditioners.  I would also end up with a good amount of hair in my comb, when combing out my wet hair, due to breakage.  My hair dresser recommend Nioxin.  I have been using this shampoo for several years and my hair has changed completely.  It is noticeably thicker and much healthier!  My hair is still fine, but I no longer have excessive hair in my comb, nor do I have spots where I feel like I can see my scalp.  I recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing thinning hair.  If you go to the Nioxin website, you can find the formula best for your hair type.  I gave it 4 stars because it is pricey!</li>
            <li> I love  Nioxin!  it&#x27;s the only product that keeps my scalp manageable.  Every other product I&#x27;ve used in the past doesn&#x27;t help as much as Nioxin does with dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and scalp therapy do not work as well without the scalp treatment.  I have been using the cleanser and scalp therapy, alone, for four weeks and my hair continues to fall out in considerable amounts.  However, in the past I have used these two products along with the scalp treatment and hairs stopped falling out within a few days.  I would recommend using the scalp treatment alone first to see if that manages your hair loss, if not then purchase these two products and try all three together.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of my dermatologist for slight thinning of my hair.  I used this for about 3 months, and am not really sure anything has changed, so I&#x27;ve decided to forgo its use.  Also, my husband thought it smelled terrible - very chemically - could use a scent with the product to make hair not so stinky afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been using this more than two weeks, no sign of change, same amount of hair loss. I know this is not a miracle worker, but I will continue use this for sure because I like its fresh mint smell and the cleanness of scalp after wash!</li>
            <li> So nice makes your hair looks ok shinning and feel so clean, I personally love the kind of minty scent</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Beware my hair thinning, chemically treated friends! In my everlasting quest to pay less, I often buy on Amazon as it&#x27;s usually cheaper. This time, however, I yet again learn that you &amp;#34;get what you pay for&amp;#34;. (sigh) And that, unfortunately, means these are expired products. Not only is this shampoo/conditioner set expired, it&#x27;s been expired for 7 years. Yes, SEVEN years. Called Nioxin and was told their expired products won&#x27;t hurt our hair but will do nothing to help it.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon customer service is great and quickly offered a refund.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better products on the market for thinning hair!  It totally helped my hair and I feel like it has a massaging effect when I shampoo and condition as instructed.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product to her minimize hair loss related to a medical condition.  She swears by this product.  No other product has worked that she has found.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably thin and color-treated. For years I tried countless products and nothing ever improved the appearance of my hair as much as the Nioxin System 4 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy for Fine Treated Hair Duo does. It truly makes my hair double in volume. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> You get alot for the money, the product is exactly how it was described. I can see some results already. I have only used it for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to get this. He is not sure he has seen any change in hair loss, but, really likes the cleanliness, tingle and smell of the shampoo. And, this is the best price when using amazon.prime.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;I have a good amount of hair loss,  and Nixon always helps jump start the new growth.  I have always trusted Nixon products...!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this duo for little over a month now and can say I really like it so far. While I can&#x27;t say my hair is thicker, I can -without a doubt- tell you my bath drain isn&#x27;t full of hair after I shower anymore. That&#x27;s something major, in my book. I should say that I am also taking the supplement daily, but I am not using the folicle booster/whatever it&#x27;s called. &#x27;Just the shampoo and conditioner, hairsprays and supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 major things I have noticed over the course of the past month is considerably less hair in the bath drain, and, not having to wash my hair as often. The conditioner is light enough to allow several days between washings, yet it still leaves my hair soft even after blow drying. Prior to Nioxin, I had to wash my hair every single day because it would get oily. Oily + dark thinning hair on a light complexion &#x3D; nothing good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed:)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nioxin products since 2007. If you are suffering from hair loss or thinning hair, Nioxin is effective if DHT is the cause of the problem. The Nioxin products combined with a regimen of Propecia have helped my immensely. It&#x27;s costly, but well worth it when you consider the alternative. Best of luck to you!</li>
            <li> This suit do work for people with thin hair and used to perm, I like it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for less than a year and I am extremely satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I use every other day or so and have no intention of changing!  It works!  I always had thick hair, then around a two years ago the top of my head or crown area became sparse, like pattern balding, which runs in female side of my family.  Around the same time all of my hair became very thin and would not hold any style.  My hair always looked like it was dirty or greasy and flat.  I noticed immediately that Nioxin gave my hair a little boost and slowly but surely it got better over the next several months.  My hair now is back to being thick and full!  My crown is still not quite all the way there but there is a big improvement and I no longer have to do a &amp;#34;comb-over&amp;#34; style.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  Only downfall is, at least for me, it takes several months for full effect (I&#x27;d say it was about 9 or 10 months for total thickness)</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product and how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> This did nothing to regrow hair.  In fact, it got worse while I was on it.  The product is totally artificial and the minty scented ingredients slightly burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. Packaging was great. Received shipment promptly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> it works really well, my hair started falling out in large quantities over a year ago and nothing helped. I washed and conditioned using Nioxin 4 and within a week had minimal loss, back to only loosing a few strands when I shower. Night and day to what  i was going through. I colored my hair for first time since using it and only lost a dozen strands compared to the 60 i was loosing before i started using it. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Upon my dermatologist recommendation I have been using Nioxin products for years and will use no other brand.  It  is gentle for my thinning and very fine hair and keeps it in good condition.</li>
            <li> My friend and hair stylist suggested I use the System 4 products years ago as she was noting some thinning in my hair (in my 40s).  She explained the technology and research behind it all.  I have used them ever since.  I am now 56 and when I get my hair cut in another state by other stylists, they always say, \\&quot;you have fine hair, but a lot of it.\\&quot;  I think that&#x27;s proof it works.  I always notice that my hairline does not recede at all.  I&#x27;ll always use this product.</li>
            <li> These products do not leave any residue build up on your hair. It keeps thinning hair looking and feeling much fuller.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, been using it for over 2 months haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference... Hair fall is still the same maybe a little less...</li>
            <li> I tried other product for hair loss and thinning for the past two year and I couldn&#x27;t find the one that worked for me. This is the only one that I can really say that it does what it is suppose to do. When I wash my hair I see less hair on the tub. I use the number 4 because it is for people who color their hair.  I love the scent. It smell a little like mint. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of week now.</li>
            <li> This product is thinned out and not like the salon product. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent product.  Not sure if it really helps thinning hair or not.  Sometimes you just can&#x27;t fight nature.  The scalp therapy product sure does tingle the scalp and makes your hair nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive and I am just not sure how much it helps on your thinning hair so be worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and has helped in hair replacement after illness and drug related hair loss.</li>
            <li> I can see fine hair along my forehead line growing in...I&#x27;m really pleased that I went beyond just the Nioxin shampoo and started using some of the other products for hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, pleasant minty scent...</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nioxin Cleanser, Scalp Treatment &amp; Follicle Booster Level 4, for fine, visibly thinning hair, for about 2 years now. I starting losing my hair about 30 years ago. I went from having very thick, wavy hair that everyone envied to have really thin hair, to the point where my scalp was visible on the upper sides of my head and at the front hairline. It was horrible and doctors could not find anything wrong, no problem with the thyroid, hormonal imbalance, nothing. When I went through menopause my hair got even thinner, and I would have some hair stylists start suggesting a wig, which I did not want. One day a hair stylist who has used Nioxin herself for hair loss over many years highly recommended it. I bought a small kit, the Level 4, because in the last few years I have started putting blond highlights in my medium brown hair. After about 4 months I started to see tiny hairs coming up in between my longer older hair. My hair is in better condition too. I look forward to using the product and I have very good instincts and I am into holistic healing, so I know when something does not seem to be the right thing for my body&#x27;s healing. I love Nioxin products. Now I have a new hairdresser and she too highly recommends Nioxin for hair thinning. It might not have the dramatic effect that monoxidil is said to have (this is Rogaine, for instance) but some people have funny reactions to monoxidil, it effects my heart, gives me palpitations, so I have trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;Try it out and see. I am sure their idea that women lose hair due to a build-up of testosterone on the scalp has something to it. I only wish when my hair first started to thin, right at the widow&#x27;s peak area, I had been able to start using this stuff. Probably I would today still have very very thick wavy silky hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I have been using this for years.  Recently tried to switch, but within days my hair starting thinning again. After only a week of being back on the system, I can tell it is once again starting to work.  And as always Amazon provided best pricing and super fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the system for almost 2 months and I have noticed a difference in my hair.  My part is showing a lot less scalp and it does feel like I have more hair. It might even be slightly thicker than before.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how it is after more time.</li>
            <li> Hair was very lifeless, dull, THIN, and flyaway.  Hair immediately felt healthier.  My hair is not what it was, but this product has it headed in the right direction.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for years and I highly recommend it!!!! I use the chemically treated Nioxin and it never fades my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;It takes about a month until you notice a difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> Simply the best on the market. . . Ok, I have not tried the thousands of shampoos that are available today. I have thinning and treated hair.</li>
            <li> Very good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> First off  I love this product and have been using it for some time,  however, this particular package states that this is Cleanser and Scalp Therapy.  It is not.... it is actually cleanser and conditioner.  I thought I was receiving the scalp therapy, but shall now have to reorder it separately, which is rather annoying.  So be careful that you are ordering the correct item...  and the seller needs to reword his description on this particular item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ASIN:B002O0D8P8 Nioxin System 4 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy for Fine Treated Hair Duo 33.8 oz Set]]</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair out and made it look like straw......since it was opened I can not return it so I am left with two large bottles of shampoo that will go in the trash. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole kit, which includes scalp treatment besides the shampoo and conditioner. My hair fell out more than ever before. Total waste of money on an expensive product that is doing me more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nixoin on and off for years. I enjoy the smell and tingle of the conditioner and cleanser and I notice less hair loss when I use the product</li>
            <li> My hairdresser said it&#x27;ll take until the second bottle to show noticeable results but after a few weeks I can tell the difference. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product does make my hair feel and look thicker.  It&#x27;s healthy.  My color seems to be staying longer, too.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this for the last five years or so.  Easy on the hair and help prevent further hair lost.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The bottles are difficult to squeeze. I guess manufacturers don&#x27;t always do product testing!  Truly, I have to push the Conditioner against the wall of the shower in order to create the pressure needed to release the product.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.  It is supposed to be very good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the conditioner SEEMED like it wasn&#x27;t as thick as it usually is.  I wondered&lt;br /&gt;if it was diluted but it could&#x27;ve been my imagination.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning to the degree where you could see my scalp - I had to do something, so my stylist recommended Nioxin. I started using it about 4 years ago and I love it!! At first, the tingling was so strong I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to continue to use it, but that went away in about a week and after a couple of months I could see new hair coming in. Now, all this time later I can honestly say I have a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; head of hair again - finally!! And, as an added bonus - I no longer get dandruff! My scalp has never been healthier and my hair is in really good condition too!</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product - been using for a long time - my hair stylist recommended it for my hair thinning and it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING</li>
            <li> I noticed thinning hair with age and bought this product to try. After a month I noticed tons of new hair coming in.  It will probably take a year for it to grow in but I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Expensive and loaded with chemicals.  I was very disappointed with it.  I will not buy it again.  The first washing was okay, smell was okay but all the washings after that left a residue just like the cheap shampoos do.  Not happy with it so I gave the rest to the hubby to finish it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly and chemical treated hair.  For me, the shampoo and conditioner dry and frizzy. It does smell great and my scalp feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and I am very happy with how this is thickening and even helping with new growth for my hair!!</li>
            <li> Good product at an excellent price!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in the thickness of my hair with these two products with the addition of the System 4 Scalp Treatment. It made my hair grow longer faster, but the follicles didn&#x27;t increase in thickness by any means, and it dries out my hair more than I&#x27;d like. I used this about ten years ago when my hair first started getting really thin, and it worked great then, but this time around it just makes my hair grow super fast.  It says it&#x27;s for color/chemically treated hair, but it makes my hair color fade faster than I&#x27;d like. I do like the tingling sensation and minty smell of the shampoo, but otherwise these are just OK. I&#x27;m just waiting to finish these two huge bottles before I move on to something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used expensive salon shampoos and conditioners and Nioxin #4 is better then all of them. It works amazing and comes in much bigger bottles then the other stuff. I recently had a thyroid condition and my hair got super brittle and started falling out. This shampoo and conditioner has helped a ton, and always leaves my hair shiny, soft and smelling great. I wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have notice a definite difference in the volume of my hair since using the Nioxin for fine treated hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for several years.  I was really happy to find it at such a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Using this product for the past 15 years.  It&#x27;s not a guarantee that you will see hair return, especially if you are pushing your senior years.  It still have lots of hair loss each time I shampoo.  However, it is a great product and I have a reasonably nice head of hair and no bald spots.</li>
            <li> This a good price for a great product.  My wife loves it.  It takes such a small amount and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin 4 for several years and love the improvement in my scalp. It has made an amazing difference from the time I started using it.</li>
            <li> This product does not seem to be the authentic Nioxin. There are no lot numbers on the bottles. I compared the ingredients with the ones on an authentic bottle of Nioxin and they were not the same. The description on the back of the bottle as to what the product will do for your hair, such as remove DHT (which the authentic one says it will do), is not written on the back of these bottles. There is no &amp;#34;trademark&amp;#34; insignia on the Nioxin names on the  bottles. It is distributed by a company called Wella.</li>
            <li> I do not do reviews...but for this I had to!  After the second day I could tell the difference in the texture of my hair. By the fourth day I went from having fistfulls of hair in my hand when I would run it through my hair after a shower to literally one strand! I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with the product. That doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.  You have nothing to lose except more hair by not giving it a chance.</li>
            <li> I had surgery that i lost quite a bit of my hair. This has maintained my hair and improved the quality. It has come back a bit but it isn&#x27;t a miracle shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, people are asking about if its made in USA or Mexico, they are all made in Mexico, but packaged and shipped from Canada or the USA. The cap colour doesn&#x27;t say where its from.</li>
            <li> My hair has been falling out by handfuls and it&#x27;s due to having a total hysterectomy and i don&#x27;t take any hormone medications so the nioxin was recommended to me by my stylist and it&#x27;s helping. My hair isn&#x27;t coming out as much since i started using it. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd purchase of this duo item. Last purchased about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with its results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed in the face that a packing slip was not included from the shipper.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the products go, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> will order again, fast and wonderful product!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these products for years.  Scalp therapy feels so good and the shampoo is great.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and keeps the color true.</li>
            <li> Have been using Nioxin for years..Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I like it!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything. My hair is really fine and doesn&#x27;t grow well, my scalp acts up all the time, but this has changed my life! About 4 months ago I started with the conditioner and Pura d&#x27;Or shampoo to help my hair grow. That shampoo worked at first but it is REALLY drying and quickly started irritating my scalp even worse. The Nioxin conditioner, though, felt really soothing on my scalp, so it wasn&#x27;t as itchy but it was still dry and flaky from the shampoo. Recently I threw out the Pura d&#x27;Or shampoo and switched to the Nioxin shampoo, plus started using the scalp therapy. Now my scalp is completely healed--no dandruff, no dermatitis, no itching.... and my hair is growing faster than it ever has before. It works SO much better than even a prescription ketoconazole shampoo, and smells/feels good. Can&#x27;t recommend enough!!!</li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin shampoo and conditioner about 3 years ago after my sister-in-law told me about it, she has very fine hair and it was thinning due to a thyroid problem.  I have fine hair that seemed to be falling out more than normal, it looked unhealthy, flat and dull, just very blah.  When I first started using it it made my scalp tingle and it was a little pink, but I figured it meant that it was working.  I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference right away, in fact if anything I almost thought it made my hair worse than it was because it felt really dry, brittle, etc.  I kept using it though because my sister in law had experienced such great results with it and she reassured me that the dryness and unhealthy feeling of my hair was just due to the fact that the shampoo works so good and strips the hair of all the stuff that was on my hair from the other shampoo and conditioners that I was previously using.  I am so glad that I stuck with the Nioxin!!!  It has been a godsend!!!  I just cannot say enough good things about it.  It has made my hair stronger, shinier, fuller, and the strands of hair feel thicker.  I get complimented all the time about how shiny and healthy it looks!  I noticed new hair growth around the forehead and temple area and actually wondered if I was just imagining it or not, but it was true!  If you are disappointed when you first start using it, all I can say is don&#x27;t give up!!  Keep using it!!  It will take some time to see some difference, but believe me, you will see it!!!  I&#x27;m not very passionate about too many products out there, but for this one I am because it is so amazing!!!  I absolutely love it!!!  It has given me healthy, beautiful, thick hair back!!!</li>
            <li> I order Nioxin because I always use it. It was a great bargain and I  can not beat the price I will be reordering again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin System 4 for over a year or so. My hair. Started getting noticeably thinner from aging, perming, coloring, etc. The shampoo and conditioner have improved the hair that I do have and new growth had started to fill in slowly. I don&#x27;t think I will ever have thick hair because I never had that to begin with. This has stopped my hair from falling out and the texture of my hair J&#x27;s steadily improved. None of there other products work for me and I&#x27;ve bought them all. I&#x27;ve started using volumizing hair powders on the thinner spots and a good hair spray. But this shampoo and conditioner is a keeper. I won&#x27;t be switching or trying anything else for a long time if ever.</li>
            <li> The product was received quickly and as described.  Very happy with my purchase and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> This really helps reduce sebum to help hair grow. When I combined it with a paleo diet and supplemented with Fermented Cod Liver Oil I have had the best results in years. Feels good, clean, best price anywhere.</li>
            <li> Products were as expected</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Product will continue to purchase had long as it&#x27;s available !!&lt;br /&gt;Love the way it&#x27;s cleanse the scalp intensively😘😘</li>
            <li> Used it an my hair was falling out when washing my hair!  Read reviews most were good so thought I&#x27;d try it. Big mistake! !!! It says expect some hair to fall out the first two weeks but at this rate I&#x27;d be bald by the end of the first week!!</li>
            <li> Great product for thinning hair.  Makes your scalp tingle and have seen results in only 4 weeks. Very pleased with price and not a lot of product is needed for each application.  Would recommend for anyone ,male or female, with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this is the only system that I trust to help my hair stay healthy. This product actually makes it look like I have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This stopped has definitely helped</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the Nixon 4 for colored hair. I have been loosing my hair in hand fulls for at least 20 years. The shower drain was clogged every time I washed my hair. This product was not instant in the results but after a few months the lose started to slow down. I have been using it for a year now and the change is Huge. I highly recommend it. Just remember to be patient.</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to do what it states.  I do see new hair growth.  I will re evaluate this product in the future, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I lighten my hair regularly and have bouts of shedding. The Nioxin #4 really helps curtail the shedding and keeps the color and condition in shape. I then add a hair oil conditioner when hair wet and clean in winter.&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry, colored hair that sheds!</li>
            <li> I had used this product for several years, but stopped taking it for several months, when I noticed severe thinning of my hair that hadn&#x27;t been there before. I was losing hair constantly every shampoo and couldn&#x27;t cover the balding spots. Being a female, I was distraught. I purchased this product once more and started using it. It took a month of use before I started noticing my hair loss wasn&#x27;t as noticeable as before. Now after two months, I am not losing as much hair as I was, and that my hair seems to be filling in those balding spots.  I purchased the next bottles from Amazon because of the good price they offered. I told my friend about the purchase and she also ordered the same. I also use the scalp treatment foam that is good too.</li>
            <li> Made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Good for thin, limp hair. Stimulates the scalp</li>
            <li> Without this product I feel I would be bald. My hair was falling out so fast and Nioxin keeps in in my head. Don;t ask me how, I just know it does</li>
            <li> My hairstylist had used this on my hair &amp; I liked the results. So I decided to buy it to use between visits &amp; I can definitely tell a difference in my hair. It it looks &amp; feels better.</li>
            <li> I have very fine/thin hair. This shampoo/conditioner cleans my hair nicely without weighing it down. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair started falling out while using Nioxin. I switched back to Nexus Vitatress and my hair stopped falling out.  I suggest you do the same if your hair falls out...while using Nioxin; a pro-hair-growth product.</li>
            <li> Thank  your for sending me this great buy and huge bottles of Nioxin.  This is a very good product and recommended to me by the University of Florida after consulting with them about my hair thinning so much.  Great product.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Delivered with satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This is really helping the fullness of my hair. I lost hair due to stress after my dad passed. It thinned and wouldn&#x27;t grow. Now my hair is feeling thicker and starting to grow again. My sister and step mom use it too. I am a 41 yo woman that never had any problems with my hair. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> like the way it feels dont know if it helps with hair thinning</li>
            <li> Suppose to help w/ stopping fine textured hair while preventing loss of hair color for chemically treated hair...but it is my understanding that any shampoo w/ sulfates (among others) tends to strip the chemically colored pigments out of the hair!</li>
            <li> Very good product, does as advertized.</li>
            <li> Product got here promptly.  My hair feels much healthier after using this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  Have ordered this several times before, and have always been satisfied.  Awesome....will continue ordering this product from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin products for years and at 67 years of age I still have a pretty healthy head of hair</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this cleansing system. It invigorates my scalp and gives body to lifeless hair. I&#x27;m a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> my thin fine hair does well with this product. I usually pay way more for the smaller size than the larger sizes I got on Amazon</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly. I am pleased with the fullness of my hair since using this product. The bottles are large so I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over 10 years and has stopped balding spot on crown of my head. Does what it says it does with regular daily use.</li>
            <li> Stops hair from falling out.  Only drawback if you discontinue use , hair falls out again... but all in all a Great product.</li>
            <li> great shampoo, love the way my hair feels after I wash/condition.  I am taking Biotin, and using the hair booster.  I see some baby hairs, so hoping it is working....</li>
            <li> Good product, but incorrect shipment.  I ordered the number 4 as shown in the picture, but I received the number 6.  Unfortunately, I am traveling overseas, so I could not exchange.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for son whose hair is thinning now that he&#x27;s crossed the big 50 years old. (He wanted earphones.)</li>
            <li> My hair always is squeaky clean.  And the Scalp Therapy tingles on my scalp and softens my hair.  Only wish the bottles came with pumps as the bottles are quite heavy to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like it used to, it&#x27;s just a waste of $$ now.</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo and conditioner. We&#x27;ve been using these for 6 years as a family. Very good for the hair!! We love Nioxin!</li>
            <li> While I have not seen any hair re-growth, it seemed to have prevented additional loss. I will continue to use it and see if I have better results with continued use.</li>
            <li> The only thing my wife says works for her colored hair without washing out the color. She has recorded it many times so must be good.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent and very nice/effective shampoo and conditioner. Both products leave the hair clean and without the oily building that sometimes comes from cheaper conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I purchased this product for to help with thin hair and periodic loss.  I like the shampoo -- it leaves the hair looking healthy and clean -- but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in hair loss side and any improvement in &amp;#34;thinness&amp;#34; is slight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products may work for you, of course, but clearly there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; type of guarantee.</li>
            <li> love it! will continue to purchase more as needed. arived fast too</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great of thin or thinning hair or just all around - does not leave residue on hair and hair is fuller.  Great service!</li>
            <li> have wispy  downy new hair.  it takes a long time to regrow hair.  grows back like baby hair.</li>
            <li> I love, love this shampoo. My hair stylist recommended it after he told me I was starting to lose my hair from stress and my flat iron. It&#x27;s hands down the best shampoo I have ever used. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well for me, but paired with my regular conditioner, I would never go back to other shampoo. It&#x27;s only been a few months and I can already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner! I&#x27;ve notice some new growth and in my eyes, some is better than none. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This system in conjunction with the scalp treatment really works  glad my sister-in-law shared it with me it worked for her too</li>
            <li> The nioxin shampoo did wonders for my hair. My hair is fuller and thicker than it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li> I love this product and  have bought it at a Local beauty supply. The price that I can get both of these products from Amazon is LESS than what I used to pay for one! Love saving money!</li>
            <li> Made my scalp itch so I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and thoroughly met my expectations.  I recommend this product to others who are interested in thickening their hair to enhance appearance.</li>
            <li> These are extra large bottles that will last you a long time. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Nioxin has regrown my hair and I recommend using all three stages:  shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels and I&#x27;m already noticing less hair in my comb.</li>
            <li> Having a scent allergy, I cannot use floral scented products.  Nioxin 4 has a minting scent and a refreshing tingle on the scalp.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Thinning hair. Need to use it.</li>
            <li> nice hair treatment-not too heavy</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this shampoo, so I gave it a try.  Probably the best shampoo and conditioner ever for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin&#x27;s System 4 shampoo and scalp treatment for a couple years now because of thinning and weak hair and a sensitive scalp prone to scaliness even though I have oily skin.  Other shampoos have synthetic fragrance that I&#x27;m allergic too.  This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found because it makes my scalp healthier and hair feel stronger; BUT don&#x27;t expect your hair to start growing back in fast, because it took many months for my scalp to get healthy enough before I started noticing new hair growth.  I have to use it every day, or my hair gets stringy the next day.  I think Nioxin&#x27;s Scalp Activating Treatment 4 has also helped (it&#x27;s like mousse).  I do recommend it, just be patient for results!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my hair with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I think if you are hypothyroid then there&#x27;s just not much that can&lt;br /&gt;be done to thicken the hair.</li>
            <li> This feels good, smells good, and works great! It really helps with my hair, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who needs something for their fine hair.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for over a month and see no difference! don&#x27;t waste your money and the foam part 3 of the treatment dries your hair out and adds some type of static cling to your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin now for over 15 years. I lost my hair due to hormones and when I started using Nioxin my hair stopped falling out.. .I&#x27;m 60 now and can not use anything else.. I pray they never stop making this product... Penny&#x27;s use to carry it but not any longer...</li>
            <li> Used it for about 3 months and didn&#x27;t notice ANY difference in hair fall</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see in time if it works</li>
            <li> I really do see a difference in hair texture.  Would definitely recommend this product if your hair is thinning.&lt;br /&gt;It did take at least a month to see a change.</li>
            <li> I have always have thin, fine hair, even when I was young.  So I bought this thinking that it might help my hair look a little thicker, or at least give it more body.  After using it for almost a year, I noticed that my hair was getting thinner and I actually have some bald spots now.  I cannot say that the Nioxin is what caused it. I am getting older (just turned 48).  I just know that this didn&#x27;t start until after I started using this system.  I know that some products do say that you may notice more thinning before it starts working.  I thought maybe that was what was happening, but I just kept getting thinner and thinner.  I would just say watch very carefully and stop using immediately if you notice your hair getting thinner. Don&#x27;t wait a whole year like I did.</li>
            <li> I know this product works if you use it regularly. I have used since I had chemo. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using Nioxin for 2 years. I love the product. My hair has grown &amp; my hairdresser always comments on the health of my hair! Will reorder! Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner.  I&#x27;ve used Nioxin shampoo and conditioner before and like how they work.</li>
            <li> This product was a great deal compared to salon prices. I have used it for a couple of years and am so happy with my purchase. It makes getting ready in the morning a snap.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years now, works for me, will recommend it to anybody, try it and see for yourself</li>
            <li> This will be my first time postng a review for a product I did not purchase through Amazon, but I think this is important.  Several years ago my hairdresser suggested this line of products, and she used some type of Nioxin serum on my scalp at the salon.  Everything seemed fine, I felt no difference in my hair, but I kept using the shampoo and conditioner at home.  When I was about halfway through the bottles (12 oz maybe), I started getting a migraine.  Since I had been getting migraines, I didn&#x27;t immmediately connect this migraine with the Nioxin, even though it was very different from other migraines in that I my head ached all over and I was throwing up.  I decided to stop using the Nioxin, as that was the only new product I was using.  However, I still ended up going to the hospital where they gave me morphine and an antihistamine.  The pain finally subsided and I went home.  A month or so later I went back to the hairdresser.  She asked me about the Nioxin and I explained what happened.  She offered to take the bottles back which I thought was very nice of her.  However, incredibly, while she was preparing to cut my hair, while she was talking, I caught her putting more drops of serum on my scalp.  I stopped her immediately, but the harm was done. The next day I was back at hospital.  I would suggest at the least that if you use this product, you try a skin test for a few days.  Until these reactions I had ever had an allergic reaction to a hair product.</li>
            <li> Great product and terrific service!</li>
            <li> This is a great value!  It arrived on time and in good condition. I love the way it feels on my scalp and my hair hasn&#x27;t been softer.</li>
            <li> Very please with it would buy again from seller</li>
            <li> The scalp therapy was very good but the shampoo REALLY dried out my naturally curly and healthy hair !!!</li>
            <li> they had to be counterfeit. they didn&#x27;t work the same, smell the same, or have the same labeling as the items form a regular store.</li>
            <li> My only concern was that these bottles did not not a date code.  Anyone who uses Nioxin knows that it ages poorly.  It must be used soon after the date code to be effective.  I can only hope that the product in the bottles is not a knock-off.  (It looks, smells and feels like the real thing, though.)</li>
            <li> this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Thought this was the hair grow stuff.  Turns out I need the scalp therapy instead..  Wish they would make that clear but now I got some overpriced shampoo which makes me smell pretty.</li>
            <li> Have used this product intermittently for years. If used regularly for at least 6 months, hair will regrowth. Leaves scalp feeling clean, warm, and tingly. Great winter fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Second order in half year. It works. Now I may order another set for my friend. Her hair has same problem as I had.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I purchased first at Ulta for much more.  I will return to purchase here instead.  It leaves a tingly sensation and leaves my hair feeling so clean.  The shampoo does feel like it might strip your hair so you may want to use another shampoo in between washes.</li>
            <li> If you saw the before and after results of my mothers hair you, would definitely be a believer in this product.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product that works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the pray foam. It has stopped my hair from falling out to a minimum and it is also thicker.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine from a salon and I only washed with it once so far..... But WOW!!! I have thin, stringy hair and it&#x27;s soft and flowing!!!! You can feel a tingling feeling when the conditioner is in. Even if I don&#x27;t get new hair growth, I think I&#x27;ve just found my favorite shampoo/conditioner!!! My hair looks so healthy and feels amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly believe this product has helped me regrow hair, I can see it along my forehead, and thickening hair on top of my head. I will never stop using Nioxin or taking the supplements. I recommend them to any women that says she thinks she&#x27;s going bald...like I felt I was. I&#x27;m extremly happy with items.</li>
            <li> I moved into an old house a few years ago with a faulty gas furnace, unbeknown to me, carbon monoxide was silently seeping through the floorboards from the basement, and after 6 months, I had lost 2/3 of my hair! (Not to mention my short-term memory, and damage to my central nervous system.) But this is a review about shampoo! I LOVE these Nioxin products, all of them!! I have a very full head of hair again, and I attribute it directly to Nioxin! I use their System 4, for noticeably thinning chemically treated hair. (No pun intended.) I have the shampoo \\&quot;Cleanser\\&quot;, the conditioner \\&quot;Scalp Therapy\\&quot;, \\&quot;Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Bliss Thermal Protector\\&quot; (so you don&#x27;t burn your hair drying it) their mousse, \\&quot;Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Bodifying Foam\\&quot; and finally their hair spray, \\&quot;Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Niospray Power Hold\\&quot;. IT WORKS!!! I take it all with me when I go to get a haircut. My stylist read the ingredients and said, \\&quot;This has so many natural ingredients, you could almost drink it!\\&quot; I pasted them below, if you&#x27;re curious.

            <li> I say it&#x27;s ok because so far my hair is no different then when I was not using it.. I will keep using it till it&#x27;s empty and hopefully something will happen.. I need fullness and body in my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for years and really like it. Leaves hair and scalp feeling fresh  and over time leaves your hair looking healthy and much fuller. It seems to have stopped or extremely  slowed the thinning and receding of my hair since I began using this almost 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I neglected to read the ingredients before purchasing this. I have colored hair and it stripped the color out. It made my hair feel terrible after washing it...like stuck together and tangled  (just what you DON&#x27;T want with thin, fine hair.) It has all the bad ingredients in it which are harsh chemicals and sulfates that one is advised not to use. NOT good for your hair. It was expensive, too. I would not buy this again. Now I&#x27;m stuck with two large barely used products. I had to buy separate pumps for them too since they are too large to handle.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Has helped stop hair loss and now have new growth coming in.</li>
            <li> i love it. I recommend this to any and everybody ! im lookin for the pills where can i get them for cheap ???</li>
            <li> This was not the original Nioxin product...  it is a Knock off and i was not pleased!!!  I would recommend that you go to the Nioxin original website to order your products as i have done in the past.</li>
            <li> As long as I use this, my thinning hair (due to autoimmune diseases) looks fuller/thicker.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent breakage</li>
            <li> I have always loved nioxin products. Thin hair runs in family. Stylist recommended when I initially tried. Had to previously obtain from salon/ beauty supply. Now amazon price is comparible to most salons and ULTA. Product is amazing-- this is large quantity. Seems expensive, but pricewise is competitive to other retailers! Ps-- i also take biotin supplement daily to help with hair health.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Price too.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the gift</li>
            <li> Works really well with thinning hair</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo and conditioner for thin hair. The price is excellent also.  You only have to use a little dab of shampoo to do the job so it will last forever. Will buy again1</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair grew back after cancer treatments with the help of Nioxin.  Great product</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner really works with hair that is falling</li>
            <li> My hair showed signs of improvement. However I also take Biotin. So it may be both.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser and conditioner. Just make sure to rinse thoroughly to avoid flaking. Make sure you order the correct system as this is meant for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> have been using nioxin fro about  1year, hair is  healthier and getting thicker in fine areas around the temple.  using as my regular shampoo .</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife and she seemed to like it although we both did not really observe any thickening of hair.  I took one star off because we still could not get an answer on the product&#x27;s expiration date which is probably some cryptic code hidden somewhere on the bottle.  A call to the manufacturer was rejected by the person who answered the phone, saying they would not talk to us since we bought this through a third party on Amazon, and not directly from them!</li>
            <li> Excellent value. I just really, really, really, really have my doubts as to how legit of a product this is. This is an excellent deal if these products are genuine. It would be more believable these were genuine if you were getting just one bottle and not the set. The local salons sell a smaller bottle of just one of these products for the price of these two massive bottles in this set. Lot/batch numbers vary a bit I&#x27;m sure but these also seemed to be just a bit different consistency and smell then my known genuine comparable. They do seem to work ok for now. Time will tell I guess.</li>
            <li> Note the large size. Good only if you own a hair salon</li>
            <li> I love Nioxin and really happy to see it available again. My hair does feel fuller and much easier to manage. In Fact, I am now using the Hair Spray and the Thickening Spray. You just spray that on the scalp, gently massage. It drys fast so just style as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but it feels good on my scalp, and my hair looks fuller.</li>
            <li> I have stress related hair loss.  First few uses I noticed my fine hair was stronger fuller and fewer strains were falling out.  I have used the product for two months and like the results.  I have shorter hairs in my temple area which I think is due to this product use.</li>
            <li> We have used these products for several years, and just found them on Amazon for a better price!  Our thanks to you!!</li>
            <li> These products were recommended to me by my hair stylist. I decided to look for them online and was amazed at the price. I ordered online and received quite quickly. These products are amazing. They really help strengthen fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost about 1/2 my hair in the last year due to several health conditions - fortunately I had very thick hair to start with.  My boss bought me this shampoo in an effort to maybe help the regrowth process.  I can&#x27;t say that I notice any new hair growing but what I do have seems noticeably thicker/fuller to the touch.  I&#x27;ll keep using it in hopes that eventually my body will right itself and start the regrowth process.</li>
            <li> On time!!love the product!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and fuller</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and your price was the best!!</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a great product and received on time.  Will order from this seller again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product and seller, will buy again and recomend to others. Received in record time.</li>
            <li> I love these products and was so happy to find these big salon-size bottles at a decent price.</li>
            <li> works great. I&#x27;ve been using Nioxon for a&lt;br /&gt;approximately 6 months. My hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Great to get these sizes.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with hair loss. My hair is long, and I was constantly losing strands, sometimes clumps. This product was recommended and has made all the difference. I&#x27;m so glad someone finally recommended something that works. My hair loss has reduced significantly!</li>
            <li> easy and always in stock......price is great!</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and have lost a lot of hair , this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair fuller and healthy looking . I read some did not like the smell but i don&#x60;t mind it has a minty smell to me . Less hair in my brush now .</li>
            <li> Good delivery. But dose not work that well for me this time. Big volume with the ok price. It&#x27;s worth to try.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these products. We normally purchase them at her hair stylist but they were out so I looked it up here.  I was surprised to find a much lower price and we ordered it. These are fine products that have been time tested by my wife and we are regulars on Amazon so we will continue to buy here.</li>
            <li> awesome price and fast service. Love this product</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin system 3 but decided to use 4 this time. I am happy with this purchase but it may not be for my hair type. I am going back to Nioxin 3.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it works, but arrived in top condition and good quality.</li>
            <li> It works!! I use it together with the foam and have seen new hair growing.</li>
            <li> This will make your hair so incredibly dry it&#x27;s unreal. I&#x27;ll never put this on my head ever again.</li>
            <li> i love this product and i got half as much again of this project as i can buy locally for the same product. great packaging. great service. i will order again.</li>
            <li> Already working. My hair feels fuller and more bouncy. Only one wash, so will check in after a month.</li>
            <li> My barber bills have gone through the roof. :-).  Too soon to rate.</li>
            <li> This product actually helps!</li>
            <li> Sent quickly, well packaged, great price and now my hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Product as described. And fast shipping. Had the shampoo on my doorstep 3 days after ordering it.</li>
            <li> its a great product, and at a great price</li>
            <li> I did not realize that shampoo meant to thicken hair may explode the hairshaft and cause dryness and color loss.  I usually use Wen shampoo and enjoy silky shiny hair that my wonderful hair dresser colors a chunky brown and blond blend. After using the Nioxin system, It was a fuzzy, dry mess.  And the color went brassy.  I thought maybe it was something else I had done, or too much time in the sun, so a  few weeks later I tried it again.  Same result.  I have used other Nioxin products I go out of my way to find, but I will never use this again.  Definitely not right for me.</li>
            <li> FRAST SERVICE, AND PRODUCT WORKS WELL.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful shampoo and conditioner.  My hair was thinning with menopause and this has been wonderful to help thicken my hair again.</li>
            <li> These bottles are huge.  Amazing deal, great savings.  As to whether it works, I&#x27;m hopeful but as I just finished chemo I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping or not.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  The price was right and it was shipped undamaged. I will order this product again when it needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner on my VERY thin hair. It has kept it soft and fuller looking. It also cleans my hair of hair spray, which can really build up. I don&#x27;t believe that my hair looks thicker but I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I have psoriatic arthritis with involvement in my scalp and this shampoo conditioner combination is the best for me for a clear scalp and also for maintaining my color treated hair. i love the smell too and the tingling feeling it imparts on my scalp! My husband also uses it for his thinning hair and flaky scalp. It is simply the best!</li>
            <li> Works, lost much hair due to illness (bald spot). Has worked for me, takes a good 2 months to see baby hair come back in, just be patient. I also did use biotin supplements but stopped for a month and a half to test the product itself. Yes, it worked without supplements. Will keep using, my scalp has never been so clean :)</li>
            <li> it keeps your hair from falling out. Full thicker healthy. Might regrow. Just know its working.I will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product about a year ago; she&#x27;d been using it herself and her hair looked amazing.  I notice there&#x27;s much less hair loss when I shampoo, and my hair feels so much fuller. Love this!</li>
            <li> I see a tremendous difference in my hair and Im so happy that I just bought the products for my mother for christmas!</li>
            <li> I will NOT use any other brand of shampoo or conditioner.  When I was 47 and going through a stressful period, my once~thick hair was falling out.  Friends recommended Nioxin for that, and I&#x27;ve been a user ever since.  The hair grew back within 6 months, as full as ever, and for the first time in my life, I am NOT developing split ends, so length is easier to achieve w/fewer maintenance trimmings.  Not a big fan of the eucalyptus smell, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It is ok.  i do not see a big differenct.</li>
            <li> I like Nioxin.  I just wonder if this was the real deal.  Am now leery of buying this product on line, even though usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before. Be sure to read and follow the instructions. Helped a lot with thinning hair related to my thyroid problem.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy again. still experienced lots of shedding and dried my hair out</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and delivery</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it really works...my hair has really started growing in and it lasts a long time. Its great</li>
            <li> It  just made my hair frizzy and more keeps falling out.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for a year and I think my hair is a little thicker...Thank you for your product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I notice a visible difference, but I trust the reputation of this product to keep my hair from thinning more than it already has.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good products.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and my doctor suggest me to use so I tried it and it is good</li>
            <li> Liked it at first. But, noticed hair falling out again after continued use.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate about my thinning hair I thought I was going to have to buy a wig.  I started using Nioxin on the recommendation of my doctor and it really brought back my confidence.  I don&#x27;t believe it will GROW hair, but it makes the hair I have look fuller!  I would recommend it to anyway with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I started showing signs of female pattern hair loss in my late 30&#x27;s, something that runs in my family. I started using Minoxidil (Rogaine)in my early 40&#x27;s and while it did not regrow a significant amount of hair, helped prevent as much further loss. After 15 years of using it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working anymore so discontinued it. After 3 months, my hair was falling out in spades and was truley panicked. Before considering wigs or hair transplant, I decided to start using Nioxin step 4 shampoo and conditioner plus resumed Minoxidil 5% (females are supposed to use 3%, but can use 5%). Much to my delight, after 3 months my hair started coming back in, much fuller than it had before. I really have to say it was the combination of Nioxin and Minoxidil that made such a big difference as compared to Minoxidil alone. The Nioxin removes DHT from the scalp which prevents hair follicles in the resting phase from regrowing. I cannot say if it works alone to help regrow hair, but defrinately makes a difference when combined with Minoxidil!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nioxin System 3 in a salon (approximately Jan. 23) and paid $106 for 3 piece set.  Used about 1 week- liked because it made my hair feel smooth/almost tangle free-have one area left side-top back-slight tangles-maybe new, short hair growth.  Purchased the System 4 on Amazon January 27 because I really have bare spots -front sides. Used the 3 for about a week-then when I received the System 4 started using it. So have used about 3 weeks.  Have had scalp sores for about a week now.  Really liked how it made my hair feel but not the scalp sores.  May try it again in a few weeks.  Went back today to using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue and Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Conditioner that I purchaded early in December.  Wish I had my &amp;#34;vinegar&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner with me.  Have tried Bosley&#x27;s but makes my hair feel very dry.</li>
            <li> after many weeks of reading reviews on these products i finally decided to give in because my bestie&#x27;s wedding is in a few months and i am the maid of honor and i wanted my hair to be thicker and longer by wedding time. i purchased the complete nioxin system number 4 cleanser, scalp therapy, scalp treatment, and diamax spray. i have highlighted hair and have been highlighting it for 9 years, i am 25 years old now. my life long hair stylist would always comment on how healthy my hair was and would praise me for being her favorite client who would take such good care of my hair. it wasnt until i used this system together for a week straight that my highlights all of a sudden started having a lot of breakage. i panicked at the sight because ive never experienced that before. i called my stylist and told her what happened and she has me on a strict hair regimen to try to prevent anymore breakage and hairloss from happening due to the damage that nioxin did in screwing up my beautiful hair. i had used the nioxin tablets years ago before they discontinued them and they were great so i thought this system would work but instead i have suffered so much, not only with my hair but it was a large chunk of hard earned  money that i just threw away after one week of use, and the money i had to use to purchase the new s.o.s. hair care products. ...tears...</li>
            <li> Was totally perplexed when I could not get any of the Conditioner to some out of the bottle by squeezing. Not knowing what else to do, I moved a small amount to a wide mouth jar which allowed me to scoop it out with my finger to put on my scalp.  After about a week, got focused on finding a better way to deal with this because I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoke with Nioxin Customer Service today who explained that the one Liter bottles REQUIRES a pump.  I was irritated to be informed (within the context that they do not provide Customer Service for their products bought on-line) that had I bought my Conditioner at a Salon this would have been explained to me at point of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I got over my irritation, I calmly searched Amazon and found a Keratin Pump which reviewers say fit the Nioxin one liter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just ordered and we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> i have very long hair and it was falling out fast.  that runs in my family, women with thin hair.  this is the only product that stops the hair from falling out, and then begins to grow new hair.  it takes a long time so it must be used faithfully for results.  ive not seen this product fail with those who are willing to keep using it faithfully and wait for it to do it&#x27;s thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and slowed down the thinning of my hare but still losing it.  Don&#x27;t know what else to do so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> Both of these are great products.  I continue to buy them when I run out.</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product and I really have nothing more to say because I don&#x27;t have time to try to fit into the guidelines of do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts on giving product reviews especially when I have nothing more to say and no time to spend here thinking up stuff beyond the basic facts ...again, this was some reallly fasssst service of a really really grrrrreat product of which I use often. Ok then.</li>
            <li> If you are one who needs to see instant result then you may want to try something else. I know everyone has different results so I can only share mine. I purchased the 4 for my mother as a&lt;br /&gt;gift because of the great results that I&#x27;ve had using this product. My hair tends to fall out greatly since the age of 14- I am now 24. I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil, birth control pills in my shampoo (old Mexican myth), women&#x27;s Rogaine, etc... And nothing worked! After using the 3 for about 2-3 months I began to see spiky hairs around my hairline on my forehead. With continued use it kept growing and filling out my problem areas. I will continue to use Nioxin even after my hair completely grows back and I&#x27;m not looking like a fuzzy puppy anymore. I submitted a quick photo to show how my new growth just looks like &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; after 6 months of continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Routine: I apply the shampoo immediately upon entering and rinsing my hair to get it wet. Massage into problem areas. I use about 30% of my shower time with the shampoo on, and then 70% with conditioner. Still massaging the conditioner into the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware ladies! You may get some excess hair on your face, shoulders, and back. Not like Sasquatch hair, but more like a little more peach fuzz than normal.</li>
            <li> My hair appears thicker and fuller. Although, there is no new hair growth with this product, it still gives the look of more hair.  I have an extra system so I will never be without it. Gives me more confidence and I feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> Excellent combination. Works great, hair feels great.</li>
            <li> Love it， Now I dont have any dandruff</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair! This is the best price you&#x27;ll ever find on these items too!</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> I just got this shampoo/conditioner. Im very pleased with this product! Since I&#x27;ve been using this line my hair is soft , and im  nit getting hairs in my sjowrr! I do have volume! My hair does seem thicker!</li>
            <li> Smells great and does the job!</li>
            <li> I have used the product before and it meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and buying it at the hair salon where I get my hair cut.  I was pleased to find it online, much cheaper than at the salon.  It definitely works reducing post menopause hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li> Within a very short time, you can see and feel a difference....perfect for thin, fine hair. Turned softer overnight, and new growth occurrng at a faster rate! Will keep this on a the &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; list!</li>
            <li> You can tell that No. 4 has either been deluted or is simply too weak.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s workig so far, I noticed the conditioner is made in the USA while the shampoo is made in Mexico. I wish they were both made here.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works good. Very large size for the money.</li>
            <li> I order this product &amp; recieved it July.31 2015 I started the 1st wash Aug.2 2015 &amp; today which is Aug.16 was ny 2nd &amp; I must say I see a difference already. I was very skepitcal at first because you dont wanna waste money but its worth the price &amp; 1 of the perks I like is that these bottles are huge so it will definitely last &amp; you dont need to use alot I had way less shedding today from 2 weeks ago!!! Once I apply the conditioner I put a plastic cap on n get under the dryer bout 10 mins followed by Black Castor Oil n repeat it makes my hair so soft n easy to manage since Im all natural</li>
            <li> I really like both of these items.  They clean my scalp gently and the conditioner leaves my hair shiny and full.  The size of the bottles will last at least 6 months - even washing daily.</li>
            <li> I am African American and I have been using Nioxin for ashort couple of weeks. I us it every couple of days. So far I have seen a big difference in my hair. The texure and it seems like it is filling in. I will send another review in a month.</li>
            <li> Item was received as expected. No issues.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery.  Awesome product for thinning hair.  Have used it for years and it really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not too impressed with the &amp;#34;scalp cleanser&amp;#34; (who needs a liter of shampoo?), the scalp therapy definitely makes a difference. Contrary to the directions, I use it as a leave in conditioner for my scalp and I can notice the thinning areas of my hair thicken up. If you are religious about using it daily, you will notice significantly less hair on your brush in about a month.  Make sure you gently rub it gently into your scalp for a few minutes. I wait about five minutes and then run a comb through my hair. In conjunction with the scalp cleanser, I also use daily  Nature Valley Skin, Hair, and Nails vitamins (Walmart Brand). I believe using both has a synergistic effect in terms of minimizing the amount of hair I lose.</li>
            <li> I was desperate and a hair dresser recommended this so I gave it a try. Midway through my first bottle my scalp started breaking out, and I never had that problem before, but because I was having an issue with hair loss and a hair dresser recommended it I kept going with the 3 step process. On my second bottle I started to question if it was doing any good. SO I started researching. I found out the Nioxin SOLD TO PROCTOR &amp; GAMBLE, and it gets worst, Proctor &amp; Gamble CLOSED the NIOXIN Headquarters and FACTORY! They produce the NEW Nioxin in MEXICO and it is NOTHING like the ORIGINAL NIOXIN.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is still recovering from using this product, I would never recommend it to anyone. I doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t have ANY ACTIVE ingredients in it to help hair grow or reduce hair loss! I am now using a product that has Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner works great for thinning hair. I highly recommend to anyone suffering from it. This system works, but you have to buy the entire line.</li>
            <li> My review:  I like it.  My FYI:  I was afraid this might be fake so I spent a minute searching and found my answers.  For those wondering if this product is fake or legitimate let your fingers do the research.  Proctor and Gamble bought Nioxin Research Laboratories in 2009 and closed the Atlanta Head Quarters.  The new U.S. office is in CA and yes, Nioxin is now manufactured in Mexico amongst a few other countries (for international sales), all not the U.S.  It&#x27;s not a secret, it&#x27;s public record.  As for as if the product changed, I don&#x27;t know, probably.  It is what it is now.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this initially after my hair began suddenly falling out and recently reordered it because I was so impressed.  The shampoo/conditioner has a very soothing smell and immediately soothes my often itchy scalp (caused by telogen effluvium shedding).  The product feels gentle, creates a nice foamy lather (unlike other hair loss shampoos I&#x27;ve tried) and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my scalp which is key for keeping my pores and hair follicles open for hair regrowth.  I have naturally fine, thin hair and I also highlight it with bleach.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my wife. This was about the 5th time we replentished the previous &amp;#34;bottles getting near empty&amp;#34;. My wife loves the Nioxin brand as it does a great job on her hair.</li>
            <li> Great smelling product!  I seem to be losing less hair as time goes on and my hair feels thicker.  Large bottles last a long time!</li>
            <li> I would never buy this product though Amazon again.  It doesn&#x27;t work like buying it from a salon.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by our hairdresser for my husband which my husband likes and it smells fantastic. Great price on Amazon and will be ordering from again. He has not used this item long enough to notice any difference in the fullness of his hair.</li>
            <li> Works great!! The only problem with it is, once you stop using it your hair goes back to limp thin feeling.  I went out of town, and didnt bring it, and my hair was limp to my head.. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i love it, and will never buy any other shampoo or cond.</li>
            <li> great price free shipping was a better deal than my hairdresser offered me for the same stuff really works great for thinning hair</li>
            <li> I really feel like this has helped my hair look and feel thicker.  It has a pleasant tingle on my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> Nioxin shampoo and conditioner is very good, but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough yet to actually say I see little hairs coming back.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner seems to work fine. Can&#x27;t tell if it really reduces hair loss or not, but the amount I ordered is probably at least a year&#x27;s supply, so time will tell.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and as expected.</li>
            <li> Loving this product! My hair is doing fantastic and I love the way it feels on my scalp. Can&#x27;t beat the price either, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> is working just as it says very pleased</li>
            <li> This is the only product that stops the itching scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Been using it for years...and when I saw the price for both on the liter size, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!!! Got it fast and the product was definitely authentic. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my spouse and He has been using it due to thinning hair for about a month now.  He has had new hair growth and loves the way his scalp feels. We all have hair growth over a month but my spouse has hair is growing in the spot that was thinning.  We are both pleased with the outcome thus far.</li>
            <li> nioxin has been my husbands favorite line for many many years now.  It has helped him with his hair a lot.  Loves the smell.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I&#x27;ve tried other types of shampoo and conditioner and this has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product over a month ago. The 33 ounce size will last for months/ I have very thin hair. Using the cleanser and conditioner has given my hair more body and shine. I would recommend this hair product/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and still waiting for results. However people have noticed a difference on my scalp but I guess I&#x27;m waiting to see if my crown hairline grows back.</li>
            <li> I ve been using it for 2 months ,and I ve been loosing more hair since I started using the nioxin 4 system especially after conditioning ,I m not sure if I continue using it :(</li>
            <li> I bought pumps to go with these because they are pretty big and it makes it easier, plus so I can get the right amount. Now after my FIRST USE I felt and seen a different. My hair looked and felt thicker. I don&#x27;t know if it is the illusion of what the system does to your hair, but it does something and I love it... My hair is long layers past my shoulders and I did 3 pumps of cleanser and massaged through my hair from top to bottom. It smells good too. Very minty like it is working and tingles a bit, but I like that. Then after I wash that out I do 3 or 4 pumps of conditioner and I lather my hair from top to bottom and let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes...When I wash my hair out my hair is smooth.... Getting out of the shower the scent and tingling stays for alittle, but you see a difference. I see a difference both wet and dry... I guess I will have to give it more months to see more results, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anyone locally who can beat the price that Amazon has on this shampoo/conditioner combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I have tried several other shampoo and conditioners that claim to help me retain and grow stronger hair, but I haven&#x27;t found any of them to be worthwhile.  I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for the better part of 15 years and I don&#x27;t see anything changing anytime soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 1 year now and my wife swears that I have new hair growing on my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this System #4 after using System #2 because the bulk price was very good compared to buying this same product in a Hair Care product store. I&#x27;ve used it for overt 2 months without any noticeable change. Maybe I&#x27;ll try Rogaine?</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I have baby fine hair and it makes me look like I actually have hair. It also has slowed down my hair loss.</li>
            <li> This was advertised as a &amp;#34;treatment to encourage hair growth.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s merely a deep cleansing shampoo that stripped my hair of natural oils, and the conditioner is so heavy, (to coat the strands to make it LOOK fuller)it weighed my hair down, making it look flatter.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does wonders for fine hair and have tried many products which promise the same results.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. ALL of their products are amazing and have SAVED my hair. If you have thin, unhealthy hair or are having a lot of fallout, PLEASE try Nioxin products. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them and now my hair is just amazing.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone with thinning hair. I&#x27;ve used it for a number of years, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> SAW NO RESULTS AS ADVERTIZED</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> These products are terrific for those of us with thinning hair and were much less expensive than buying from salon.</li>
            <li> These products were recommended to me by a friend who used them after her pregnancy when she started loosing hair.  Both products have a pleasant fragrance.  It has taken several months to see a big difference in hair growth, but it is there.  I am very happy with these products!</li>
            <li> I have fuller looking hair, no dandruff, less breakage and some regrowth after just 2 months! I will continue use :-) especially since I have been getting compliments!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop hair from thinning, but does make your remaining feel thicker.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner on the market for regrowth! I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helped with my scalp, but it is not a magically hair growth solution. And to my knowledge does not prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li> I love both the shampoo and conditioner, makes my hair letter perfect.</li>
            <li> Have been having a problem with hair loss for some time and been advised by a physician to try Nioxin.  Pleased with both cleanser and scalp therapy conditioner...leaves hair feeling clean and refreshed and a lot fuller after styling.  Too soon to expect any new hair growth or reduction in hair loss.  I would recommend this products to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years and it is really great</li>
            <li> I have little sprouts of hair all over my head growing, so I know this shampoo and scalp therapy is working, now if I could just keep my hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser and conditioner. Using them makes my scalp tingle like its reviving it and my hair. I color my hair and it hasn&#x27;t felt like normal hair in years until I used the Nioxin System 4 Cleanser and Scalp Therapy. I would recommend this product to everyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Good but too many types and sizes</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using it for many years and I truly believe it has saved my thinning hair!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for three years plus and it has truly helped my extremely fine, thin hair that I have professionally colored.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products and Nioxin is THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality product. I have been using this for three years and will continue.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Lost chunks of hair after a divorce. I have been using this product for about a year and my hair is now thick and full again. Thank you Nioxin!</li>
            <li> Been buying this for 10 years (paying Salon prices) - probably one of the first things I purchased on Amazon. This the EXACT SAME product for a fraction of the price - the Duo is A STEAL!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these two products for 6 months and love the way my hair and scalp feel!  It makes my hair baby soft, while at the same time making it look thicker and fuller.  I&#x27;ve used countless products geared toward thinning fine hair and this duo is a keeper!</li>
            <li> So far so good.. but only been using it for a month and I wash my hair about twice a week at most. I haven&#x27;t had huge results yet.. BUT it does wonderful on my curly and colored hair. I love the smell of the shampoo and the tingling from the conditioner. I would definitely buy this product from Amazon as its about 20 bucks cheaper on here then in stores. With prime I got my product within two days and the whole process was great.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, my hair feels clean and fresh and soft.  The scalp therapy, I use about every other time, as I have fine hair and it has a tendency to build up making it a bit greasy looking.  Other products I use also do that, so I don&#x27;t think of it as a detriment.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than this to grow your hair I use it all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and it has definitely helped with my hair loss. I don&#x27;t see as much hair loss as before. I don&#x27;t think it leaves my hair very soft afterwards but I use MoroccanOil after my showers to restore the shine and softness.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too old for these chemicals, (61 with thinning hair) but my scalp could not handle this product. A big waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, and the price is less than half what you would pay at a salon.</li>
            <li> This stuff does really help I use it every day with [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] The two of these together really thickened up my hair..Its really shiny and healthy. Couldn’t be happier!</li>
            <li> When Nioxin System 1 stopped working for me, I thought it was because they changed the formula so I switched to Aveda Invati and lost quite a bit of hair in 8 weeks. I then switched to Nioxin System 4 (since I color my hair), and it&#x27;s working great so far. I made a huge mistake by going to Aveda. It did not work at all. But, I&#x27;m glad I switched back to Nioxin now. I hope it works like this for a while.</li>
            <li> Great product does what it claims</li>
            <li> This is the best hair care product on the market! I would recommend it to anyone. I would a most call it miraculous.</li>
            <li> Does help but is drying to hair. Best with short hair that is trimmed frequently.</li>
            <li> only shampoo and conditioner i use.  cheaper than buying at a salon</li>
            <li> have been using it for years now and love the product. The sixe is perfect and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner if you have thinning hair and color treat your hair. My stylist recommended and after 18 mo I lose less hair in shower daily and my hair is in great shape. I love it. I only order on Amazon as its best price.</li>
            <li> Very happy &amp; absolutely love the smell. Reminds me of thin mints... without the calories, of course. I shampoo 3x a week &amp; condition 5-6x. :-)</li>
            <li> This product works.  My hair was falling out from stress.  Not any more.  It still falls out but it is so much better and thicker. Good price also.</li>
            <li> This product has help my hair grow. I also used the scalp treatment from Nioxin as well.  My hair is also getting thicker.</li>
            <li> My beautician uses these products and I continue to use them in hopes of strengthening my fine and thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered; same size and brand as on site.  Would order this product again.  Nioxin is a good product</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin system 4 is an excellent product. Keeps hair healthy.Gives body to fine hair.Love it.Promotes growth of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I was going back on a medication that had caused hair loss for me before.  Also, since having my 3rd child, my hair had been falling out in larger quantities (long after the postpartum loss was done). I noticed a difference in how much hair was falling out after about 3 months of use. To be fair, I also started taking a high dose of biotin and a zinc supplement as well.  The biotin boosted hair production and growth for about 6 months, but hasn&#x27;t done much since.  I ran out of the Nixon bottles and after about 3 months, I noticed more hair loss again even while continued the supplements.  I just bought my second order of Nixon.  As far as the negative reviews, I tend to suppose that some are having an allergic reaction to an ingredient, probably the propylene glycol.  So if you get a rash from some soaps and shampoos, you may have an allergy to propylene glycol.  (found this out from our pediatric Dr.)  I would give it a full 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t contain this ingredient.  I&#x27;m also guessing that some of those who say it is fake are hair professionals and do not want to encourage buying this online. But this is always my reaction to a fake product claim  when the reviews are generally positive.  It has worked for me and for that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff was recommended by my stylist 2 years ago.  I have fine, thinning hair and knew being a bald old lady was in my future.  My hair now looks and feels fuller and even my husband notices the difference.  Not sure what it does, but it has helped me.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT FOR THIN HAIR</li>
            <li> Great products. Gives hair more body and looks fuller. Not sure if it really helps thinning hair.  I still have some hair loss, perhaps it would be worse if I didn&#x27;t use the product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will continue to do so</li>
            <li> This really helps. I use it every day with Mynoxidrin [[ASIN:B00Q5KMX5O Mynoxidrin - Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Formula Nourishes and Strengthens Thinning Hair and Promotes Hair Growth!]] and my hair has never been thicker or healthier!</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonable price and prompt service</li>
            <li> I liked the mint in the conditioner, i used it for 9 months and i do not see an improvement to my hair . on to other things.</li>
            <li> Great product! Noticed a big difference in my hair within the first week.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy build up like other shmpoos</li>
            <li> Good product for thinning hair</li>
            <li> i have used this product for several years! I love the results! My hair no longer appears to be thinning. Thanks, Nioxin</li>
            <li> I was losing a lot of hair every day.  Nioxin was recommended by a friend and have noticed a huge decrease in losing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who has noticed hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> Buying these 2 products together in this size makes it more economical.  I am not sure that I actually have new hair growth, but the texture of my hair is fuller and my physician even commented on this.  I see others have had success with new hair growth.  I imagine the variability in hair growth results is related to the type of hair loss. The conditioner is really thick, and I happened to have a pump from another conditioner container that fits perfectly and makes it easier to dispense.  I also use smaller containers to put in my gym bag.l</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to me as my hair is thinning. My hair does look fuller and thicker and I love the way it smells. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely has more body since I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Hesitantly I tried Nioxin after I had my baby and my hair was falling out in chunks. I originally bought the starter kit, however I really did not like the Scalp Treatment, I found that it made my hair feel and look dirty the next day. I however LOVE the shampoo and conditioner. In the first 2 months I used it EVERY day and as instructed leaving the shampoo on for at least a minute and the conditioner on for 3 minutes. After the first two months my hair was not getting visibly thicker but I was no longer losing hardly any hair at all. I could also tell my hair was growing longer and I had new growth all over the place. I&#x27;ve been using for probably about 5 months now, and I only use every other day for the last few months and MY HAIR IS THICKER! I can feel it when I pull it back to a pony, my hair has never been this thick EVER, not even pregnant! My new growth is probably about 3 inches and I&#x27;m just so pleased with the results. I&#x27;m not sure if I will ever stop using this product and recommend it to the rest of my family who all have thin/thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this is in the past and liked the way my hair felt fuller, then forgot about it for a while.  My hair was getting really thin .  I picked it up and starting using again and am very pleased with the results.  Makes your hair healthy and full. It took a while to come . over a week.  Unusual for Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> This could work for some, maybe not others.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is too early to tell for my own hair results.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for dry hair due to highliting &amp; perms. Brings hair back to a healthy state!! Only one I&#x27;ve found to be as good, if not better than hoped for.</li>
            <li> Really makes my scalp feel revived and clean. Only time will tell if it does what it claims it will do.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to rate yet</li>
            <li> This product is different than what I bought at the local beauty supply store and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s the real thing...but truthfully wondering.&lt;br /&gt;The  color and texture of both solutions are different from prior purchases. (I liked what I had previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;The containers have &#x27;labels&#x27; and no lot codes..whereas the prior purchases had the Lettering &#x27;painted&#x27; onto the bottle and the &#x27;lot code&#x27; on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the prior formulations and will go back to the local store next time or contact the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This question also is prompted by a previous review I read on AMAZON. I purchase Dermatalogica cream locally , but when I saw the price discounted on Amazon I was tempted to buy a larger bottle until I read a review that said a person purchased it and it was watered down...... I am wondering if my purchase of Nioxin System 4 is the real thing. Send me a return sticker and refund my credit card in full, please</li>
            <li> My hairdresser asked what I was using on my hair because it felt thicker.  It has helped with less fall-out, breakage, and new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Мне нравится и шампунь и кондиционер , я пользуюсь им уже 3 года . И в дальнейшем буду покупать его .  Волосы после мытья такие шелковистые и пышные !!!</li>
            <li> I have beenusing it for a few years love the way it makes my scalp feel and gives my thin hair body</li>
            <li> Is this Nioxin by this Seller, Made in USA or Mexico?  I have been reading alot about the Nioxin and found that buyers are pleased with the product if it is made in USA, but not if made in Mexico.  They say it is a different formula. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe Nioxin  grows new hair, but it sure makes my hair feel thicker and in good condition.  It takes a few weeks of product usage for the thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Therapy system for a long time now, I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;If you use it as directed it really works.</li>
            <li> I have used them twice &amp; my hair feels thicker &amp; fuller already. I  hope they continue. I wish I had research it more for the kit. I also need scalp therapy &amp; scalp conditioner..</li>
            <li> Nice and good price. Delivery promptly. Satisfied.</li>
            <li> This combo made my hair appear fuller, but ultimately didn&#x27;t do much for it. If you have SUPER fine hair this could be a really good thing for you, it makes your scalp tingle (in a good way, not a bad, burning way) so your hair fluffs up a little bit rather than laying flat, but if you have too much hair it may not work quite as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this productfor about 6 months now.  What a differenct that I noticed to my hair.  It is no longer thinningr fallin out.  My hair seems healthier and thicker.  This product is a must for anyone experiencing hair loss!</li>
            <li> I have been using both shampoo and conditioner since 6/2/14 when I received my shipment. I have already noticed a difference. My problem was not severe but I felt like I could see my scalp a lot because my hair was thinning around the crown. I have noticed new growth and little baby hairs popping up on the crown of my head. Annoying to tame but any growth is awesome. I also feel like my hair is softer and fuller which is a great plus for my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair care routine consist of this shampoo and conditioner and I alternate with Mane and Tail shampoo which I bought from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Really improves the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> Great price , wife&#x27;s happy. We will  be back to shop for more ....</li>
            <li> After cancer surgery and radiation treatment, I lost a significant amount of my hair. I have been using this product for a year now and I can truly say it has made a difference.  My hair is growing back in healthy, thick, and strong. Prior to using the product my hair was beginning to grow in but it was not very healthy.  Someone recommended this product to me and I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin&#x27;s System 1 to 4 shampoo and scalp treatment for a 10 years now because of thinning, weak and lost hair begun to note. I recovered 2/3 to my hair. I understand this treatment only retard the lost hair but I continuo to lose it, but more slowly. When I stop to use the treatment I lost faster and don’t recovery easy.  Don&#x27;t expect your hair to start growing back in fast, because it took a few months for my scalp to get healthy enough before I started noticing new hair growth. I have to use it every two days.</li>
            <li> Great system  Have used for years</li>
            <li> items came as described, will order again when I need it again</li>
            <li> my friend introduced this product to me.&lt;br /&gt;my head&#x27;s skin is fresh, and i feel relax every time i use it.</li>
            <li> This product adds thickness volume and body to my very thin hair! I definitely recommend this to anyone with thin or thinning hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin with great results since 2008 when I was first introduced to it by my stylist.  Amazon beats the local salon price hands down.  Highly recommend the product and access to it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and in good shape! It works wonderfully and I haven&#x27;t lost as much hair while using this. My 15 year old daughter uses this as well and her hair has grown and looks so much thicker. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this!  My hair is super soft and I love the tingle of the conditioner.  My hair is long and color treated and my hair looks amazing after I use this.  I&#x27;m hooked :)</li>
            <li> best for my thinning fine hair</li>
            <li> Wow got twice as much as in the salons for a lot less the price.  This is a really great deal with super fast shipping.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> When my hair was short, this duo seemed to work in keeping my hair from&lt;br /&gt;falling out.  Now that my hair is long, I am still seeing hair fall out.  Hence,&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is the product or the length of hair which makes the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for awhile now and this is the best deal I have found for both the shampoo &amp; conditioner. Hard to find a set that has the same size bottle and not too small. The bottles are huge and I love that. I just save my smaller bottles from before and then just refill them. Thanks.</li>
            <li> very good product love it!</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin &amp; fine. This will definitely help it!!  My hair grows so much faster, and is so healthy now!!!</li>
            <li> Too early to tell. I&#x27;ve only used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are noticing your hair thinning. It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Have used it a few months. Not sure its helping. Love the feel of my hair after using though. So soft.</li>
            <li> Whoa, this stuff smells quite strongly of mint and tingles my scalp.  After about 5 weeks of use I haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of difference in the thickness of my hair.  My head feels nice coming out of the shower, though.  Guess that&#x27;s somethin&#x27;.  This was recommended by a friend who found it did work for her, though.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I feel it helps reduce hair loss.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - I&#x27;ve been useing it almost a year and see positive results!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for approximately 4 weeks now and am very impressed with its initial results.  Noticed a change the first time I used the shampoo...less hair left in the drain at the end of my shower.  My hair looks fuller and feels healthier.  And I just noticed this week that the baby hairs that grow around the crown of my face are filling in and significantly thicker.  I am usually a skeptic of these products, but this one truly worked for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with these products!  After only 3 months or so, I have seen a big difference.  I can see new hair growth, my hair is noticeably thicker and it isn&#x27;t stripping my color.  Love it so much I bought the System 2 for my mom and she is seeing similar results in about 2 months.  Adding on the scalp therapy (it&#x27;s a small pump type bottle) will give you more noticeable instant results.  Seriously can&#x27;t say enough.  It has improved my self esteem so much!  Plus the price here on Amazon is WAYYYYY less than in Ulta!</li>
            <li> Have used Nioxin for years and these both came with pumps which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Love how the makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Made my hair worse.  Use clear now and my hair looks 100 times better</li>
            <li> Tried something else touted by a TV dr.  Big mistake.  Had to get back to what I knww workedbest</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My hair actually feels and looks fuller.  I love the smell, kind of a minty smell.  Overall a great product that I will keep using.  My hair feels and looks healthier.  I bought the #4 set.</li>
            <li> Great item! Just as promised. Would reorder from this business again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it works for me but I can&#x27;t stop using this.&lt;br /&gt;With scalp therapy, I have some cool feeling from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros,&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it is reliable than other products.&lt;br /&gt;Cons,&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product before, but I don&#x27;t think I gave it a chance to work - it does seem to add a more voluminous look, but as all products such as these, you need to stick to the regimen for a few months.  I&#x27;ve been having hair loss again, so I bought this cleanser/conditioner in a 33 oz., but I clearly did not think about how much the actual amount of 33 oz. is - it&#x27;s huge.  The bottles are professional size and are so heavy that it is very difficult taking a shower and handling the bottle with one hand; therefore, I went back online with Amazon and I ordered a trio shower dispenser, which I&#x27;ve been wanting for some time anyway.  Hopefully, this will eliminate the difficult procedure for dispensing the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up Review:  I have been using these two products faithfully now since February, and my hair is still falling out.  I truly believe that these are not Nioxin&#x27;s original product.  I agree with the reviewer who states that this \\&quot;is not the same formula\\&quot;.  I also noticed that the smell is different from the Nioxin I have bought in the salon.  I do not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo and conditioner along with the Rogaine foam about a year ago and I can honestly say that it appears that it has stabilized my hair loss.  I even feel like this combination has restored some of my hair on the front area that was receding.  I am staying with this combination until I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s helping me but so far I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
            <li> Love this product and the shipping was so easy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin System 4 for about 2 years now. Each time the shampoo and conditioner smelled the same.&lt;br /&gt;This time the conditioner has a different scent and does not seem to make putting my brush through very easy. As a result I am pulling out more hair. Can&#x27;t figure out what changed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. You will notice a difference in the thickness of your hair if you use this on a regular basis. It does seem to make my hair a bit limp but you can overcome this by using the Nioxin Volumizing Mouse afterwards.</li>
            <li> Good and effective prosuct for skull cleaning and protection.  I will try to buy it over and over again as it really help regain the good health of my head cleaning everyday..</li>
            <li> I used to have beautiful n full hair, and I had been using nioxin #3 and later #4 for at least 3-4 years. I was late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s that time when I started using nioxin. Until 2 years ago, I noticed my hair shedding massively, every time when I use #4 shampoo specially conditioner, I saw my hair hundreds shedding down with water flow to the drain, I was so painful.. From that time I started see my scalp thru hair on top of my head. I thought I didnt sleep well, or eat well, but I was wrong, no matter how I tried to live a better life style, this nioxin killed all my hair,  nothing changed. I finally gave up on nioxin and try other biotin products, feel a bit better now. Now I recall its maybe my hormone slowing down at the time of 35 years old. So if that&#x27;s the reason, this nioxin will not help.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year.  The trick with Nioxin is to KEEP USING.  You will eventually notice thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I use it because my hair was thinning badly (some recommended it), seems to be controlled.  very good product, excellent price.</li>
            <li> I rating this product on behalf of my better half. Thanks</li>
            <li> Ok cleanser but hair does not appear thicker and differences between number 3 and 4 not clear would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Good products.  Makes my hair curly.</li>
            <li> I bought these large sizes right before I noticed the smaller bottles I had were doing the exact opposite of what this system is supposed to do.  My hair was falling out even more.  So I stopped using this sytem before I received these two very large bottles.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all.  Used for three months.  Dried out hair excessively.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair fall in check..but dries out my hair..I have fine hair..I had keratin treatment done n my hair is grown out about 6 inches..this shampoo makes my original hair excessively dry. .the conditioner is just ok..</li>
            <li> I was introduced to these products at while getting my hair cut (I got &amp;#34;The Works&amp;#34;) at &amp;#34;The Barbers.&amp;#34;  I like the way it makes my hair feel and how the conditioner makes my scalp feel. (The leaf oil and menthol warm it up.)</li>
            <li> I used this product before, it really works well for my scalp and hair!</li>
            <li> Best..I have fine hair.  It is the oil I seem to have difficulty with.  I tried baking soda etc.  This the best shampoo.  my hair is gleaming..my scalp is clean.</li>
            <li> As Described, Well Packaged, Promptly Shipped. Thanks</li>
            <li> After years on differing medications my hair was falling out and thinning dramatically.  This stuff is restoring the luster and thickness.  I would recommend it to anyone that truly cares for their hair.</li>
            <li> It just makes my scalp feel so clean! I am suffering from hair loss and I just really hope its helping me keep the hair I have.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for years after having numerous problems with a severe scalp condition and loss of hair.  This is an awesome product.  I&#x27;m 54 years old, and my hair is growing while others my age hair are falling out.</li>
            <li> I love this product,and I can count on getting what I want from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Quick easy no problems</li>
            <li> Great price and love the product!!!</li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to say if it actually thickens my thin hair, but I can tell you that in just a few short washes, my hair is dry - to the point that if I touch it I get that major static head!  The conditioner is not really moisturizing and in fact I can&#x27;t even get a comb through my hair after using the conditioner.  I&#x27;m going to hope that this helps and is part of the thickening process, but I have purchased a leave-in conditioner to use in addition to this since my hair is super dry and staticky.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and solved my thinning hair problem.  It not only plumps up the hair shaft with moisture expanding each strand to maximize fullness, it also corrects any issues with your scalp that may cause premature fall out.  I started using this product in August.  I noticed that my scalp was inflammed and it hurt.  It didn&#x27;t itch just hurt as though I had just had my hair in a tight pony tail and had taken the pony tail out.  At the same time I noticed my hair coming out in excess, during showers and when I just ran my fingers through it.  It seemed thin and wouldn&#x27;t lay right so styling was a nightmare.  I went from a full head of awesome hair to a thinnig nightmare with a bald spot forming in the front portion of my scalp.  One of my former students who is a hair dresser saw my plea for help on facebook and recommended the product to me.  I have color treated and highlighted hair and this product does not strip my color at all.  It also has UV filters to safeguard your hair and scalp from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  Unfortunately, if your hairloss is due to a medical condition, all this product does is mask the symptons so it is in your best interest to rule out any medical condition that can be causing your thinning or balding hair.  For me it appeared to be an allergy that was causing psoriosis.  Either way, this product has given me back my vibrant, bouncy, beautiful hair and now I get endless compliments and am referred to as a modern day Farrah Fawcett :)</li>
            <li> I start using this shampoo and conditioner for 3 months... I think it&#x27;s worthy for the money... I didn&#x27;t loss hairs as much as before... Great buy...</li>
            <li> Good bargain - Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> After 1 year of use, I didn&#x27;t notice a change</li>
            <li> I bought this Nioxin System because my hair was thinning, and the top of my scalp was peeking through my hair.  Being a female, I want to have thicker looking hair and also decrease the loss of hair if possible.  I&#x27;ve been using this system for about 4 weeks.  What I noticed immediately was that my hair looked and felt fuller, and the conditioner was good at detangling and making my hair shiny.  I&#x27;m still losing hair with each shampoo, but I&#x27;m hoping the amount of hair loss will decrease as my scalp gets healthier.  I haven&#x27;t used the system long enough to see the maximum benefits yet, but I like it well enough to recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nioxin System came within the estimated delivery date window, and it came very well packaged.  I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and will reorder from this same place later.  The price at Amazon.com is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some months now.  Someone gave me a bottle of shampoo and conditioner and when I saw your prices, I snapped them up.  They work well.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and shampoo are nice however i haven&#x27;t noticed if it is actually helping with hair restoration and regeneration. I still have quite a bit of hair falling out by the end of my washes.</li>
            <li> love this! it really works.  takes a while to see the results - but I saw new growth in a week where I had had no hair before.</li>
            <li> ive been using this for a while,i love it</li>
            <li> love this products. I&#x27;ve use them for over 5 years and can&#x27;t change them. This was a great deal for the two bottles and hope i can keep finding it for the price I did on Amazon. I would recommend for women with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner to replace the small start up kit I purchased locally. They both are great and the size of the bottles are so worth the price! I will definately re-order when I&#x27;m out again!</li>
            <li> This is not the authentic shampoo, its watered down. Ive been using the real shampoo for months and this is not it.</li>
            <li> Nioxin did not make my hair feel or look any thicker. My hair is the same as it was prior to using the shampoo/conditioner and I used the product regularly for months. Unfortunately, if you have thinning hair I don&#x27;t believe there is much you can do about it :(</li>
            <li> I love using this, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker but I definatly noticed a difference.  I&#x27;m leary to try Rogaine since I&#x27;ve heard horror stories of what happens once you stop using it.  It is not for the major hair loss but if you have some thinning it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I began to notice my hair thinning slowly, but surely, around age 27. By 32 I had a distinct bald spot on the front of my hair line. I started using nioxin after a recommendation from my hairdresser. After a few weeks I noticed simply thicker feeling hair. But after a few months I started to get all these little sprouts of new hair growth. Layer after layer of new growth started to fill in and now 7 months later I have a full head of hair again. It does dry out the ends of my hair, so I put the conditioner all over my head and then regular conditioner JUST ON THE ENDS. I give it a 110% satisfation endorsement!</li>
            <li> Several years ago my hair started breaking and after seeing my doctor it did not seem to be any better. Luckily I had an experienced hairdresser who recommended I try the Nioxin.  I would recommend any one with thinning hair to try the complete system first. Once I got the hair loss under control, I was able to just use the cleanser/conditioner(scalp therapy). It really does make a difference and if I have an episode of breaking hair, I go back to using the full system for a short period of time. I have recommended it to people in a much younger age bracket and it has worked just as well. It is easiest to buy Nioxin off Amazon since it is not available in many retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nioxin #4 shampoo &amp; conditioner for about 6 months. I started loosing hair Jan 2012 &amp; by May my hair had really thinned so I decided to buy this system because of the good reviews about Nioxin. I immediately noticed more volume after the 1st use! This set is 33.8oz &amp; lasts me 3-4 months since you only have to use a small amount! This is my 2nd time ordering &amp; it will not be my last! This price is the best deal I have found online.</li>
            <li> As my title says, only half of this duo is great. The conditioner sucks. I wanted to love it but it sucks. I was using #5 previously and LOVED that conditioner. I think I will go back to it. The #4 shampoo is great, has a lovely minty smell and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I have an auto immune disease called AS and was on Humira injections and my hair loss was terrible. My dermatologist, rheumatologist and hair dresser said to try Nioxin. I didnt really think it would help but it did! I am now dealing with patches of small hairs sticking up all over my head but i dont care, im just glad its coming back. Im just using the cleanser and conditioner, didnt purchase the extra things that some ppl posted abt and its working fine</li>
            <li> They sent the product quickly, it was well packed and an excellent value for the money! I will use them again!!</li>
            <li> Nioxin is amazing stuff!! Works great!!</li>
            <li> When my order arived it had leaked all over the box and bottles making a huge mess and wasting a significant portion of the shampoo. Too much trouble to return but really disappointing.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty good. I definitely have to use the conditioner of it seems the shampoo makes it hard to comb through after I wash. I&#x27;m not sure if the hair growth is from the Biotin supplement I take, or the shampoo, but I take a medicine that thins my hair a bit and something is making it grow a little. So that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!  After about 3 months, I could see the difference in the thickness of my hair.  Also had problems with my haip falling out...it helped that too!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over a month now.  Hair feels thicker and is more manageable.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Because this Shampoo and Conditioner is so expensive, and because I can&#x27;t find it at my grocery store or drug store, I tried using other products for a while.  My hair fell out even faster.  This little experiment convinced me that Nioxin really does help.  I&#x27;m back to using Nioxin and have gone up to System 4 .  I do seem to loose less hair when I use it.  And the Scalp Therapy makes my hair easy to comb and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weigh down&amp;#34; my baby fine hair like other conditioners.</li>
            <li> My very thin fine hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s been in years. I am so glad my niece in Ca. Told me about it. I would recommend it to any 60+ lady like me. I love the minty smell and soft feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my scalp.  I was having such trouble with an itchy scalp that I went to a dermatologist.  The prescription did not work, but this has helped my scalp so much.  My scalp was getting to the point of being miserable it was so itchy.  Scratching or wanting to scratch my scalp was also becoming very embarrassing.  My scalp is still on the mend but 90% better than it was after about three months of use.  I still haven&#x27;t needed to buy any more and I wash my hair daily because of my scalp issues.</li>
            <li> This is not the original Nioxin formula. The original formula was changed when they sold the company. Now, it&#x27;s made in Mexico. It was a major disappointment since they used the same brand label.</li>
            <li> My wife is loving this shampoo. Her hair is falling off less. Big dramatic difference!!</li>
            <li> Really works, worth the money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for awhile so knew I&#x27;d be happy with it.  was most happy with the price.  Product was quality and arrived within time promised and was well packaged</li>
    </ol>
