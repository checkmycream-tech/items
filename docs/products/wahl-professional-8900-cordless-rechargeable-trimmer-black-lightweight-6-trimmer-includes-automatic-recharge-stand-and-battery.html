            <li>GOOD .RELIABLE TRIMMER</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I will try another as it is an exceptional clipper and am hoping this is a defect.</li>
            <li>She has been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am very, very pleased.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, very pleased with my trimmer.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the way they first came out of package</li>
            <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist and love these trimmers!</li>
            <li>and it didnt have any kind of part that lets you choose the length of your beard.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the very BEST &amp;#34;T&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Nice to not have a cord.</li>
            <li>have been all-around impressed and in love with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>They work great and the adjustable feature make them quick and precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to carry with you, works well in the salon, no hassle of cords!</li>
            <li>In fact, I have not been able to find one in stores but Amazon had it.</li>
            <li>so I was able to&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have known about the adjust a&lt;br /&gt;cut product available for the trimmers</li>
            <li>They are better than that</li>
            <li>A stylist &#x27;Must Have&#x27; Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the adjustable Wahl 3156 trimmer guide comb with it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>nothing else needs to be said:)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I could not be more satisfied in the product.</li>
            <li>Heck, shipping for the guide comb costs more than the comb itself.</li>
            <li>Works Great ,Good price Thanks so much</li>
            <li>Works ok not as powerful as I would of liked.</li>
            <li>After becoming dissatisfied with the cheap Walmart type trimmers, I am glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>If you have old school 80&#x27;s type hair like me, it works great on your hairline and for your sideburns.</li>
            <li>so I was really needing some good trimmers.</li>
            <li>Batteries can be found at any good radio controlled model store and the motor came from Wahl at an incredibly reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My husband is hooked on cordless trimmers and this one is not so easy to find anymore.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is strong and durable.  </li>
            <li>, otherwise assume it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to replace an old, reliable, USA made product with an identical one!!!  </li>
            <li>It works fine and doesnt pull or tug.</li>
            <li>The info on the product was detailed</li>
            <li>ordered with FREE shipping.</li>
            <li>This has Ni-Cad batteries, no charge light on the trimmer or on the charge stand.  </li>
            <li>The charger and shaver both did not have led light to indicate it was charging.  </li>
            <li>Other than the batteries, it was great for many years of use, so I knew to buy a Wahl trimmer again.</li>
            <li>originally purchased this trimmer in December 2011.</li>
            <li>Great tool I&#x27;ve been using for years but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for as long as I need it too.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s a perfect small, rechargeable</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a clean shaven face</li>
            <li>Gets into those tight spots for nice clean lines, and sits in a nice charger.</li>
            <li>I am a  new amazon customer and am very satisfied with my first transaction.</li>
            <li>Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have thrown the box away so quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a barber,I put a T wide blade on these and they are amazing!</li>
            <li>i love this new trimmer except for one issue.</li>
            <li>In the packaging review I also mentioned that Amazon&#x27;s packaging was awesome as always but the Wahl packaging left the unit in pieces loose inside it&#x27;s box.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase and got it just a few days after ordering it.</li>
            <li>The Ni-Cad batteries do not seem powerful.  </li>
            <li>,so I could get right to trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>A no frills hair clipper the wades right thru the toughest hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right for trimming a beard.</li>
            <li>I have also not had to charge the battery since it first arrived, exactly 1 month ago, and I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 times a week for full shaves.</li>
            <li>Much more powerful and cleaner cut than buying same size multipurpose trimmer with all the attachments I never use!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I gladly purchased it again knowing that it would last another 15!</li>
            <li>I have been using this about 5 times a month since I charged it for the first time</li>
            <li>Should have bought this the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the first to have this problem.</li>
            <li>I purchased one about 3 years ago and after many uses it finally stopped working.  </li>
            <li>The first one of these I got was a gift to me by my now ex-wife.  </li>
            <li>Charge held for 5 minutes on first charge.</li>
            <li>have yet to recharge it from the first time I charged it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it one time and worked great although a little loud.</li>
            <li>Does a good job and has a very long lasting battery.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>impressed with the precision cutting blades.</li>
            <li>Is this really a Wahl?</li>
            <li>One inch blade makes straight lines a slower business.</li>
            <li>Gets very close without pinching or snagging.  </li>
            <li>hair is really corse</li>
            <li>Most trimmers I see in stores nowadays are gigantic affairs meant to mow down huge swaths of body hair, or maybe for making a mohawk if you&#x27;ve still got enough hair for that.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one thinking my old one wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore but was surprised to find that the old trimmer was still good and the fault was with the old charger.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do; nothing more and nothing less!</li>
            <li>it works exactly like a professional neck trimmer is supposed to work.</li>
            <li>SO i bought the set of trimmer guides that amazon says is frequently bought with this product, thinking logically that it was for this product.</li>
            <li>This simple, well-executed product has netted Wahl a loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok so i wanted to buy a more expensive beard trimmer because buying cheaper ones havent worked for me.</li>
            <li>So I will stick to the same exact wall product!</li>
            <li>I know that professional barbers and the cool kids would never stoop to using such a thing, but if you need it, be forewarned and remember to buy it.</li>
            <li>Instead, I opened it up to find that a little cleaning and a dab of white grease was all that was needed to return it to enthusiastic trimming.</li>
            <li>It was no where the quality of my new Whal.</li>
            <li>Now I could have probably just bought a new battery</li>
            <li>Wow, it took a month !</li>
            <li>Had the first one for ...... since the mid 90&#x27;s?</li>
            <li>Does the job for my short hair cut and to keep my back edge clean in the interim of hair appts</li>
            <li>Clearly this product had been returned and put in a new box and resealed.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the new charger powered up both old and new trimmers.</li>
            <li>My old one came with one but the new ones don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>but I figured new, sharp blades would be worth the added price.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li>In September 2012 the trimmer died completely.</li>
            <li>Now, in May 2014, it completely died again, but it&#x27;s not covered under warranty this time.</li>
            <li>And they are loud.</li>
            <li>Given to my daughter (professional stylist) as a gift</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace my old, battery operated Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>Since I already had one from my old Wahl, I didn&#x27;t need another trimmer guide comb.</li>
            <li>A professional quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>I really hoped this trimmer would last at least 5 to 10 years, since I try to take good care of my belongings, but I&#x27;ve been let down.</li>
            <li>This is my second one (first lasted about 8 years with regular use)</li>
            <li>The new charger is not as heavy as the first one but the clipper has that new zip to it.</li>
            <li>Wahl has always been the professional standard.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my 20 something year old 8900 which finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the new one a short time, I will update this if I have problems</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it for a $30 plastic-encased motor and battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, powerful, and provides a reasonably close shave for my coarse, tough facial hair.</li>

            <li> Now I could have probably just bought a new battery</li>
            <li> Wow, it took a month !</li>
            <li> Had the first one for ...... since the mid 90&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> Does the job for my short hair cut and to keep my back edge clean in the interim of hair appts</li>
            <li> Clearly this product had been returned and put in a new box and resealed.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the new charger powered up both old and new trimmers.</li>
            <li> My old one came with one but the new ones don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> but I figured new, sharp blades would be worth the added price.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li> In September 2012 the trimmer died completely.</li>
            <li> Now, in May 2014, it completely died again, but it&#x27;s not covered under warranty this time.</li>
            <li> And they are loud.</li>
            <li> Given to my daughter (professional stylist) as a gift</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my old, battery operated Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Since I already had one from my old Wahl, I didn&#x27;t need another trimmer guide comb.</li>
            <li> A professional quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I really hoped this trimmer would last at least 5 to 10 years, since I try to take good care of my belongings, but I&#x27;ve been let down.</li>
            <li> This is my second one (first lasted about 8 years with regular use)</li>
            <li> The new charger is not as heavy as the first one but the clipper has that new zip to it.</li>
            <li> Wahl has always been the professional standard.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my 20 something year old 8900 which finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the new one a short time, I will update this if I have problems</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it for a $30 plastic-encased motor and battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, powerful, and provides a reasonably close shave for my coarse, tough facial hair.</li>
            <li> how long this thing will last, but at this point my total cost of ownership is somewhere in the neighborhood of two bucks a year, inflation-adjusted.</li>
            <li> So that was an extra complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is one of those items you want to work for a long time - the wahl trimmer delivers.  </li>

            <li> Appears smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been a hairdresser for 30 years and have used wahl trimmers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the pop-up trimmer part of assorted Norelco cordless shavers (ones that look &amp; cost something like [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO this one]]) for the last 7 or 8 years after having problems (ingrown hairs, razor burn, and the like) with other shaving methods.</li>
            <li> I have not had it very long</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very sharp, and the quality of the functioning components, meaning switch, motor, and cutting head are full professional quality.</li>
            <li> The box itself was sealed, but everything inside was very loose.</li>
            <li> This is a solid, heavy duty trimmer and the battery lasts forever.  </li>

            <li> &gt; Trimmer-wise, at about an inch wide</li>
            <li> Tried to use it a week later and it is completely dead.</li>
            <li> My husband is in the military and I cut his hair every Sunday like clockwork.  </li>

            <li> Read other reviews.</li>
            <li> the cutting blade also looks very small compared to most trimmers</li>

            <li> Charge it fully - 24 hours - then unplug it until it slows down.  </li>
            <li> HOLDS CHARGE FOR LESS THAN 10MINS.</li>
            <li> We had other trimmers but the head was too big to finish up the side burn area and behind the ears.</li>
            <li> and its been a few months.</li>
            <li> As instructed, after charging I ran the clipper until it was dead.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the cutting blade is very sharp and dosen&#x27;t work well in sencetive areas.</li>
            <li> I have ordered at least 10 doe friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to give 1 star to the product itself, but I don&#x27;t know how else to go about this.</li>

            <li> It was disgusting and clearly used.</li>

            <li> Product completely failed after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> It would not charge and shaved poorly for the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an expensive accessory, but a pain to have to order separately.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works ok not as powerful as I would of liked.</li>
            <li> Everything ok except cord useless in Australian plug and it V was 120 input</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased trimmers at places like Walmart or Kmart in the past but they always break or lose charge within the first year.  This trimmer is strong and durable.  It was recommended to me by a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li> For all of you out there who use Wahl products..this is a good one. My husband is hooked on cordless trimmers and this one is not so easy to find anymore. In fact, I have not been able to find one in stores but Amazon had it. It does exactly what it says it will do; nothing more and nothing less!</li>
            <li> Since Mary trims my neck line for me she loves the way it fits in her hand and she&lt;br /&gt;was impressed with the precision cutting blades. I also am impressed with the cut&lt;br /&gt;and the power of the trimmer. I am a  new amazon customer and am very satisfied with my first transaction. The info on the product was detailed so I was able to&lt;br /&gt;buy exactly what I was looking for. Delivery was on time and I received everything&lt;br /&gt;I ordered with FREE shipping. I would have liked to have known about the adjust a&lt;br /&gt;cut product available for the trimmers so I could have ordered them at the same&lt;br /&gt;time,so I could get right to trimming my beard. Once again my wife was impressed&lt;br /&gt;with how well groomed my beard looked due to the quality of the trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser so I was really needing some good trimmers. Unfortunately with this one, as soon as I started using it, it was nipping my clients necks randomly.  Causing red irritated skin for my clients, also it didn&#x27;t cut the hair as well as it should. I don&#x27;t suggest getting this product it works very poorly.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the way they first came out of package looks like they were already used and packaging was sloppy it was kinda just thrown into a box it. the cutting blade also looks very small compared to most trimmers</li>
            <li> 2nd one my husband has had, he loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the pop-up trimmer part of assorted Norelco cordless shavers (ones that look &amp; cost something like [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO this one]]) for the last 7 or 8 years after having problems (ingrown hairs, razor burn, and the like) with other shaving methods. When my second Norelco died, I decided it was time to switch, and tried out this Wahl at the recommendation of my hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been all-around impressed and in love with this trimmer. It&#x27;s inexpensive, powerful, and provides a reasonably close shave for my coarse, tough facial hair. I have also not had to charge the battery since it first arrived, exactly 1 month ago, and I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 times a week for full shaves. This simple, well-executed product has netted Wahl a loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, May 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this trimmer in December 2011. In September 2012 the trimmer died completely. It simply would not turn on. I mailed the trimmer in for repair under the 1 year warranty, and it came back working again. Now, in May 2014, it completely died again, but it&#x27;s not covered under warranty this time. I opened it up with a screwdriver but didn&#x27;t see anything obviously wrong; maybe I&#x27;ll try my hand at rebuilding the whole thing - but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it for a $30 plastic-encased motor and battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consequently I&#x27;ve changed my 5-star rating to a 3-star rating. When it works, it works quite well, but it seems that they&#x27;re just not building &#x27;em like they used to. I really hoped this trimmer would last at least 5 to 10 years, since I try to take good care of my belongings, but I&#x27;ve been let down.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my trimmer that I had for 15 years and was amazed that WAHL was still making the same model!  I gladly purchased it again knowing that it would last another 15!</li>
            <li> it works exactly like a professional neck trimmer is supposed to work. I don&#x27;t like a clean shaven face so when I use this instead of a razor I have a one-day growth. That&#x27;s perfect for me. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have owned these in the past and last quite awhile this time only lasted a week and half already threw out box so won&#x27;t bother to return them</li>
            <li> Holds a charge and works great.  This is my second one (first lasted about 8 years with regular use) and I would buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this about 5 times a month since I charged it for the first time and I have not had to charge it again since then and its been a few months. It works fine and doesnt pull or tug. No problems or complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber,I put a T wide blade on these and they are amazing! I adjusted the blade for  a closer cut and they give the cleanest edges!</li>
            <li> ok so i wanted to buy a more expensive beard trimmer because buying cheaper ones havent worked for me. I got this one and it didnt have any kind of part that lets you choose the length of your beard. Its just the shaver. SO i bought the set of trimmer guides that amazon says is frequently bought with this product, thinking logically that it was for this product. Well those guides are for hair clippers, not beard trimmers. So that was an extra complete waste of money. I&#x27;m just disappointed I can&#x27;t get what i want and i&#x27;m really disappointed in amazon for presenting this product with the hair clipper guides. They are better than that</li>
            <li> I know the Whal name is a respected product in the hair care business. It&#x27;s the brand of choice in shops everywhere. Had a Conair before. It was no where the quality of my new Whal. Should have bought this the first time.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction was total shock.  Wahl has always been the professional standard.  This has Ni-Cad batteries, no charge light on the trimmer or on the charge stand.  Nothing to indicate it is charging or charged at all.  The Ni-Cad batteries do not seem powerful.  In the packaging review I also mentioned that Amazon&#x27;s packaging was awesome as always but the Wahl packaging left the unit in pieces loose inside it&#x27;s box.  Is this really a Wahl? Is this a Joke?</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Much more powerful and cleaner cut than buying same size multipurpose trimmer with all the attachments I never use!</li>
            <li> I had my last one for 25yrs. So I will stick to the same exact wall product! I will recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy to carry with you, works well in the salon, no hassle of cords! A stylist &#x27;Must Have&#x27; Enjoy! --amber, los angeles, hairstylist !</li>
            <li> Does a good job and has a very long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> One word, super-quality. This trimmer is very sharp, and the quality of the functioning components, meaning switch, motor, and cutting head are full professional quality. After becoming dissatisfied with the cheap Walmart type trimmers, I am glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to give 1 star to the product itself, but I don&#x27;t know how else to go about this. I received my trimmer with HAIRS IN IT!!!! It was disgusting and clearly used. The box itself was sealed, but everything inside was very loose. Clearly this product had been returned and put in a new box and resealed. Awful quality control. Read other reviews. I&#x27;m not the first to have this problem.</li>
            <li> Replaced my 20 something year old 8900 which finally wore out.  It is so nice to be able to replace an old, reliable, USA made product with an identical one!!!  No &amp;#34;Improvements&amp;#34; needed here!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my girlfriend! Shipping was on time and everything works great! Good buy!</li>
            <li> A no frills hair clipper the wades right thru the toughest hair.  My wife has cut my hair for 50 years and says this is the best. (&lt;br /&gt;Actually my wife hates cutting my hair)</li>
            <li> I had a Wahl trimmer that I finally died after 12 years of daily use.  This 8900 trimmer is great, but the one i was replacing was a bit wider and i have to get used to that.  I am happy with my purchase and got it just a few days after ordering it.</li>
            <li> A very good trimmer that I have been using for years. I bought a second one thinking my old one wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore but was surprised to find that the old trimmer was still good and the fault was with the old charger. The picture doesn&#x27;t show the charger that comes with it but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the new charger powered up both old and new trimmers.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice little trimmer.  I purchased one about 3 years ago and after many uses it finally stopped working.  That is why I am buying the second one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the very BEST &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; Edger that I have ever used!  It&#x27;s easier to hold onto because of its square shape as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of those items you want to work for a long time - the wahl trimmer delivers.  The first one of these I got was a gift to me by my now ex-wife.  The trimmer lasted longer then the wife did.  After about 15-20 years of abuse it finally stopped taking a charge.  Now I could have probably just bought a new battery but I figured new, sharp blades would be worth the added price.  I don&#x27;t use this every day but I do use it a lot.  Be sure to get the adjustable Wahl 3156 trimmer guide comb with it.  My old one came with one but the new ones don&#x27;t.  They work great and the adjustable feature make them quick and precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advise for long battery life?  Charge it fully - 24 hours - then unplug it until it slows down.  Repeat for 15 years.</li>
            <li> Appears smaller than expected</li>
            <li> HOLDS CHARGE FOR LESS THAN 10MINS. DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Received on time. Charged over night. Charge held for 5 minutes on first charge. Recharged all day. Charge held for 3 minutes on second use. This is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great tool I&#x27;ve been using for years but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for as long as I need it too.</li>
            <li> This is a solid, heavy duty trimmer and the battery lasts forever.  If you have old school 80&#x27;s type hair like me, it works great on your hairline and for your sideburns.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair and used one of these for years.  It was time for a replacement so we picked one that worked well.</li>
            <li> As instructed, after charging I ran the clipper until it was dead. Wow, it took a month ! Now it will only hold a 30 second charge. I will try another as it is an exceptional clipper and am hoping this is a defect. It looks as though I will have to pay for shipping etc. to get a &#x27;partial refund&#x27;. Where is the warranty?</li>
            <li> Product completely failed after 2 uses. The charger and shaver both did not have led light to indicate it was charging.  It would not charge and shaved poorly for the money!</li>
            <li> One inch blade makes straight lines a slower business. And they are loud.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer. Given to my daughter (professional stylist) as a gift and she uses daily. She has been very pleased with it. I may buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> This is my second 8900. Had the first one for ...... since the mid 90&#x27;s? My battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I love it. The new charger is not as heavy as the first one but the clipper has that new zip to it. I am very, very pleased. I&#x27;ve only had the new one a short time, I will update this if I have problems, otherwise assume it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I work in a research lab and have used this model to shave areas on mice.  It works great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, the power switch is a bit counter-intuitive...</li>
            <li> i love this new trimmer except for one issue. I wish that the power cord could be disconnected to enable the holder to stay  on a shelf without the power cord dangling....</li>
            <li> I was going to buy one of these when my 20+ years old copy began working poorly. Instead, I opened it up to find that a little cleaning and a dab of white grease was all that was needed to return it to enthusiastic trimming. Mine has stood up to a lot of of use. Over the years I&#x27;ve replaced the battery maybe five times and the motor once. Batteries can be found at any good radio controlled model store and the motor came from Wahl at an incredibly reasonable price. I have no idea how long this thing will last, but at this point my total cost of ownership is somewhere in the neighborhood of two bucks a year, inflation-adjusted. You can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Trimmer-wise, at about an inch wide it&#x27;s just right for trimming a beard. Most trimmers I see in stores nowadays are gigantic affairs meant to mow down huge swaths of body hair, or maybe for making a mohawk if you&#x27;ve still got enough hair for that. For a beard, this is the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see another reviewer saying that now the adjustable depth guide gizmo is an accessory that you need to buy separately. I know that professional barbers and the cool kids would never stoop to using such a thing, but if you need it, be forewarned and remember to buy it.</li>
            <li> Works Great ,Good price Thanks so much</li>
            <li> GOOD .RELIABLE TRIMMER</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Wahl, nothing else needs to be said:) I love it. Gets very close without pinching or snagging.  It puts up with the wear and abuse of a salon tool.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my old, battery operated Wahl trimmer. Other than the batteries, it was great for many years of use, so I knew to buy a Wahl trimmer again. Only this time, a rechargeable version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more satisfied in the product. I use it for face, body and even to trim my hair. For me, it&#x27;s a perfect small, rechargeable timmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most buyers would want to get a trimmer guide comb for it. Since I already had one from my old Wahl, I didn&#x27;t need another trimmer guide comb.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and love these trimmers!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my stylist. Gets into those tight spots for nice clean lines, and sits in a nice charger. She loves it.</li>
            <li> A professional quality trimmer. Nice to not have a cord. Don&#x27;t know why Wahl doesn&#x27;t include the guide comb. It&#x27;s not an expensive accessory, but a pain to have to order separately. Heck, shipping for the guide comb costs more than the comb itself. Otherwise, very pleased with my trimmer.</li>
            <li> My husband likes to have his hair as short as possible so he cuts it once a week. We had other trimmers but the head was too big to finish up the side burn area and behind the ears. This one does the trick beautifully!</li>
            <li> Does the job for my short hair cut and to keep my back edge clean in the interim of hair appts</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the cutting blade is very sharp and dosen&#x27;t work well in sencetive areas.</li>
            <li> I have been a hairdresser for 30 years and have used wahl trimmers for a long time. These are working very good , I have them at work. they get used a lot. They arrived on time and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and have used this product for years. I have ordered at least 10 doe friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer.  He uses it regularly and raves about it every time he does.  Good value.</li>
            <li> A+ transaction! Good product!</li>
            <li> Used it one time and worked great although a little loud. Tried to use it a week later and it is completely dead. Charger is working but trimmers will not turn on. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have thrown the box away so quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband is in the military and I cut his hair every Sunday like clockwork.  We had these for months now and they work great.  I have no complains at all towards Wahl, they are the go to people for hair cutters.</li>
            <li> I have not had it very long but it&#x27;s what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to recharge it from the first time I charged it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really corse and I would guess if I want it to cut any closer I would have to use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;So over all I have to say that I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really...</li>
