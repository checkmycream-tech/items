            <li>It is best to apply it with fingers, as a brush or a sponge absorbs too much of the product!</li>

            <li>Wish it worked better!</li>
            <li>looks amazing</li>
            <li>I love their Bright Skin Radiance Nectar and my face is no longer blotchy</li>
            <li>Nice product but nothing more.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel nicely tightened though and maybe with more use would have more benefits</li>
            <li>Very light feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>And works phenomenal on my skin :)</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this as much as I love their CC cream, so i am giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>and it soon became my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>Light and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients which include Vit C (and an spf of 20).</li>
            <li>I do use this over loreal magic lumi primer if I&#x27;m going to be wearing it all day for work thru evening.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t wear a finishing powder or anything over it and get no shine , I love this product</li>
            <li>I researched and found Lumene (sold in most drugstores).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more \\&quot;one color\\&quot; now).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not feeling led to buy more in a lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too sure about this.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it would work better if I got a lighter shade.</li>
            <li>I tried it on as soon as it arrived and was excited because I&#x27;ve tried so many different BB creams and this one was said to be the best...</li>
            <li>Best tip is to use products from nose out to ears and always upwards not to drag skin downwards and make things saggy.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fine alone if your just running out doing your basics and don&#x27;t wanna look made up.</li>
            <li>It goes on fine</li>
            <li>It matches with my skin tone and gives a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>The consistency is rich and creamy, with no streaking.  </li>
            <li>I am using the medium shade and find the color and coverage (more than tinted moisturizer, less than a full-coverage foundation)  to be very nice.  </li>
            <li>Not tested on animals, no whitening, it contains SPF, non-greasy, full coverage.</li>
            <li>this is more a use your fingers application and fast.</li>
            <li>If my face is too shiny, I&#x27;ll lightly dust Bare Minerals on top of that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than the $30 natural premium beauty brands in term of coverage and texture!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any big blemishes most of the time, so the lighter/medium  coverage is fine.</li>
            <li>It rubs right off with hugs, drips off if sweaty, and just didn&#x27;t have any staying power.</li>
            <li>this is somewhere between your normal drug store BB and a light foundation</li>
            <li>It has SPF in it, and it really gives your skin a hint of color and your face glows!</li>
            <li>first was Estee Lauder, which worked well but didn&#x27;t blow me away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty tan and</li>
            <li>I also love their Vitamin C Beauty Drops (oil capsules used daily for 28-days)</li>
            <li>But then my husband and I were at an outdoor market when it was hot and humid.</li>
            <li>Enter my search that found tons of positive reviews for Lumene.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in 2 colors, and the medium is very dark for my fair skin on my hand and on my face until blended completely in and absorbed.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have that complete lightweight feel but not as heavy as a foundation , it dries almost instantly so the best way to put this on centre of the nose to the ear</li>
            <li>The color is very light and chalky, the coverage was minimal.  </li>
            <li>it all stays very well without the heaviness of foundation.  </li>
            <li>As for long-term effects, it&#x27;s too soon to say, but my skin does feel very well hydrated.  </li>
            <li>as much as 40% off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also a bit too much moisturizing</li>
            <li>I really like how this product goes on and how it looks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did cover well without using too much product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since initially trying it, I&#x27;ve gotten more sun and developed a nicer tan.</li>
            <li>The cost of this is between the other two, although I paid more than the Amazon price locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this at my local CVS Pharmacy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use it under my eyes for concealing dark circles if it had better staying power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish it worked better!es for concealing dark circles if it had better staying power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>biggest gripe was that I was wearing a white tee and quickly found that it doesn&#x27;t set well.</li>
            <li>loved many of the Korean BB creams, but I did not like the whitening, not the fact that it is near impossible to find one not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>you get a little more coverage</li>
            <li>A little dewiness is okay but not to the point of looking oily.  </li>
            <li>It looks very orange at first, but then that somehow goes away if you rub it in enough.</li>
            <li>Just a drop gives a very natural even coverage.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is the clear winner of the three.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday over a light moisturizer and add a touch of primer.  </li>
            <li>This color would match well on someone who has done a good share of fake tanning....</li>
            <li>then the other side then your forehead in that way it uses very little product looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t rub it in well enough or have it on long enough to be fully absorbed?  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to wear a lot of make up and it looks natural and improves skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>In fact I can barely tell I have it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Chinese and 58-yrs. old and don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time on my 60 year old combination skin.  </li>
            <li>my skin tone looks natural that I can wear it alone just for that basic simple lip gloss and mascara look, or with primer to make it my daily makeup in place of foundation.</li>
            <li>as far as any long term anti-aging effects-who knows?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a naturally oil girl in a highly dry climate I have no problem with looking shiny or oily with this product nor do I get cakey appearance.</li>

            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used my usual setting spray or any powder though because I quickly found this product disappointing and decided to not spend more time on</li>
            <li> Slightly oily in the T-zone and normal everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I tend to get very oily late in the day, but I&#x27;m not having that problem with this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> For me, this product went on too dry.</li>
            <li> but as said, was too dry for my liking.</li>
            <li> but it was money wasted because I won&#x27;t likely wear it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is extremely waterey and streaky.  </li>
            <li> It covers well including some dark spots and redness.  </li>
            <li> I think a lot of the negative reviews are simply trying to put it on all over and blend it with brush</li>
            <li> Have been trying different BB creams lately (Olay, DHC, Loreal, Kohls store brand),</li>
            <li> He looks at me and tells me my make-up is streaking down my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a B, maybe a B+ if it was less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say half the tube is water.  </li>
            <li> Medium is a little dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I spent 10+ years as a beauty consultant and have tried various foundations and BB and CC creams, expensive and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> Product compliments were excessive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we have to keep trying different products until it works for us.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews but was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Southeastern descent, for reference, I have a bit of an olive undertone and usually wear medium beige tones...</li>
            <li> Being that the color was dark for my skin, I warmed it up in my fingers to apply it thinly</li>
            <li> Maybe because of the SPF but so dry, it was difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> It is rather thick in it&#x27;s consistency.</li>
            <li> , poor coverage tinted moisturizers instead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sadly, I didn&#x27;t think this was even mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for me, this product is not a keeper.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this BB cream. It has just enough coverage without looking unnatural on my skin. I am in my 60&#x27;s and I do not want to look over done.</li>
            <li> This is about the nicest of the American BB creams on the market, it does what it says it will!  It lasts a long time on my 60 year old combination skin.  It is best to apply it with fingers, as a brush or a sponge absorbs too much of the product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It has SPF in it, and it really gives your skin a hint of color and your face glows! LOVE it &amp; will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Shipped in 2 days!!! And works phenomenal on my skin :)</li>
            <li> I use this everyday over a light moisturizer and add a touch of primer.  It covers well including some dark spots and redness.  I add  blush, lip gloss, eyeliner  and eyebrow pencil and I am good to go for the day.  If I am going out in the evening I will add a bit of powder to set everything and except for the lip gloss it all stays very well without the heaviness of foundation.  I am in my 60&#x27;s so this is BB cream does a lot.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this BB cream. It matches with my skin tone and gives a smooth finish. It also has a good coverage. I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  Have used it before and I like the look and feel of it.  Don&#x27;t have to wear a lot of make up and it looks natural and improves skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> Product compliments were excessive. Nice product but nothing more.</li>
            <li> This is my third BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first was Estee Lauder, which worked well but didn&#x27;t blow me away.  I&#x27;d give it a B, maybe a B+ if it was less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Garnier BB Cream, what a disaster.  It is extremely waterey and streaky.  I&#x27;d say half the tube is water.  The color is very light and chalky, the coverage was minimal.  I&#x27;d give it an F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Garnier disaster I did a lot of research and found that Lumene was getting rave reviews including the Good Housekeeping pick for BB creams.  I am using the medium shade and find the color and coverage (more than tinted moisturizer, less than a full-coverage foundation)  to be very nice.  The consistency is rich and creamy, with no streaking.  I tend to get very oily late in the day, but I&#x27;m not having that problem with this BB cream.  As for long-term effects, it&#x27;s too soon to say, but my skin does feel very well hydrated.  The cost of this is between the other two, although I paid more than the Amazon price locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is the clear winner of the three.</li>
            <li> Perfect for every day. It doesn&#x27;t look heavy at all.  In fact I can barely tell I have it on. I don&#x27;t have any big blemishes most of the time, so the lighter/medium  coverage is fine. The color is also a good match. I&#x27;m pretty tan and the darker shade looks great. The best part of this stuff is that my skin looks great after I wash it off at the end of the day. So I&#x27;m guessing that the skin care ingredients in it actually work.</li>
            <li> Ignore the inflated price here. This RETAILS for $14.99, not the $24 they are asking here.&lt;br /&gt;Looking online for a Western BB cream, this is actually the highest rated one out there. The BB craze came from South Korea, and when it came to America, they misinterpreted it and made greasy, poor coverage tinted moisturizers instead.&lt;br /&gt;I loved many of the Korean BB creams, but I did not like the whitening, not the fact that it is near impossible to find one not tested on animals. Enter my search that found tons of positive reviews for Lumene. It&#x27;s sold in CVS and Walgreens and often on sale as much as 40% off.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in 2 colors, and the medium is very dark for my fair skin on my hand and on my face until blended completely in and absorbed. It looks very orange at first, but then that somehow goes away if you rub it in enough. It will still make a fairskinned person look\\&quot;tan\\&quot; or orange if not rubbed into skin enough. I don&#x27;t love this as much as I love their CC cream, so i am giving it 4 stars. Not tested on animals, no whitening, it contains SPF, non-greasy, full coverage. It has everything you want in a BB cream. Give it a try. If it&#x27;s not for you, you can always return it! It&#x27;s even better than the $30 natural premium beauty brands in term of coverage and texture!</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this to me 2-3 years ago. I originally purchased this at my local CVS Pharmacy and it soon became my favorite foundation. Light and not greasy at all! Love the ingredients which include Vit C (and an spf of 20). When I could no longer find it at CVS Amazon came to the rescue!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a sale and I will say 100% this is my go to BB cream if you take something&#x27;s into consideration this is somewhere between your normal drug store BB and a light foundation you get a little more coverage it doesn&#x27;t have that complete lightweight feel but not as heavy as a foundation , it dries almost instantly so the best way to put this on centre of the nose to the ear then the other side then your forehead in that way it uses very little product looks amazing. I think a lot of the negative reviews are simply trying to put it on all over and blend it with brush this is more a use your fingers application and fast. I&#x27;m a naturally oil girl in a highly dry climate I have no problem with looking shiny or oily with this product nor do I get cakey appearance. I do use this over loreal magic lumi primer if I&#x27;m going to be wearing it all day for work thru evening. But it&#x27;s fine alone if your just running out doing your basics and don&#x27;t wanna look made up. However my personal experience alone this product has a 6-8 hour window of perfection applied just to the skin but with a primer I can go 7am-9pm looks amazing, I don&#x27;t wear a finishing powder or anything over it and get no shine , I love this product it&#x27;s a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not trying to cover age spots or a lot of redness , or imperfections , it like it gives that glow evens out my skin tone looks natural that I can wear it alone just for that basic simple lip gloss and mascara look, or with primer to make it my daily makeup in place of foundation. My favourite when we travel cause I can take one product for everything. If your looking to cover up a lot this product isn&#x27;t for you without a concealer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this at Walgreen anymore and it&#x27;s perfect for me..</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz featured an episode on Artic sea ingredients (sea buckhorn, artic cloudberry, lingonberry, etc.) for good skin.  I researched and found Lumene (sold in most drugstores).  I&#x27;ve tried numerous products from them and while some worked, some didn&#x27;t.  I love their Bright Skin Radiance Nectar and my face is no longer blotchy (I still have freckles but I&#x27;m more \\&quot;one color\\&quot; now).  I also love their Vitamin C Beauty Drops (oil capsules used daily for 28-days) and I do this every quarter.  I&#x27;m Chinese and 58-yrs. old and don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet.  Have been trying different BB creams lately (Olay, DHC, Loreal, Kohls store brand), and, I like Lumene best (medium works best for me).  Some BB creams are cakey on my face but Lumene does not give me that \\&quot;pancake\\&quot; look.  Depending on the shine on my face that morning (I wash with Olay cleanser and follow up with Loreal pore minimizer),  I&#x27;ll apply Revlon&#x27;s Photoready concealer (004 medium), and then I&#x27;ll blend in the Lumene BB cream.  If my face is too shiny, I&#x27;ll lightly dust Bare Minerals on top of that.  A little dewiness is okay but not to the point of looking oily.  I carry a powder compact with me and use that during the day to remove shine or use oil blotter sheets.  Lumene works for me and I hope it&#x27;ll work for you too.  Unfortunately, we have to keep trying different products until it works for us.  Best tip is to use products from nose out to ears and always upwards not to drag skin downwards and make things saggy.</li>
            <li> Color luckily is good for me but I can see that being a problem for lighter skin, I am a medium/light. Also a bit too much moisturizing so I look shiny. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product goes on and how it looks. But then my husband and I were at an outdoor market when it was hot and humid. He looks at me and tells me my make-up is streaking down my face. Yikes! Maybe I didn&#x27;t rub it in well enough or have it on long enough to be fully absorbed?  I will continue to use it, just not in those conditions again.</li>
            <li> Just a drop gives a very natural even coverage.  Very light feeling on the skin.  Brightens up the complexion. Does not look like you are wearing anything</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews but was pretty disappointed. I tried it on as soon as it arrived and was excited because I&#x27;ve tried so many different BB creams and this one was said to be the best... I spent 10+ years as a beauty consultant and have tried various foundations and BB and CC creams, expensive and inexpensive. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t think this was even mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 2 stars because some of the ingredients have good skin benefits and it smells great and was packaged nicely. Lol, that&#x27;s all I really liked about it. Well, and the price of course but it was money wasted because I won&#x27;t likely wear it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 02 Medium was quite orange on me. I&#x27;m of Southeastern descent, for reference, I have a bit of an olive undertone and usually wear medium beige tones... This color would match well on someone who has done a good share of fake tanning.... Noticeably orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination oily skin. Slightly oily in the T-zone and normal everywhere else. For me, this product went on too dry. Maybe because of the SPF but so dry, it was difficult to blend. Being that the color was dark for my skin, I warmed it up in my fingers to apply it thinly but still it didn&#x27;t apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe was that I was wearing a white tee and quickly found that it doesn&#x27;t set well. It rubs right off with hugs, drips off if sweaty, and just didn&#x27;t have any staying power. I hadn&#x27;t used my usual setting spray or any powder though because I quickly found this product disappointing and decided to not spend more time on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did cover well without using too much product but as said, was too dry for my liking. It made my skin feel nicely tightened though and maybe with more use would have more benefits but I&#x27;m not feeling led to buy more in a lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since initially trying it, I&#x27;ve gotten more sun and developed a nicer tan. I tried this again but the hue was still just too orange. I&#x27;d use it under my eyes for concealing dark circles if it had better staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uploaded some photos for reference. Unfortunately, for me, this product is not a keeper. Hopefully this might help someone. Wish it worked better!es for concealing dark circles if it had better staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uploaded some photos for reference. Unfortunately, for me, this product is not a keeper. Hopefully this might help someone. Wish it worked better!</li>
            <li> smells good. covers well like base make up. doesn&#x27;t cake smear clump in creases. Not b b creme, my make up.</li>
            <li> Not too sure about this.  It goes on fine and I wear it under blush when I don&#x27;t want to use a lot of make up&lt;br /&gt;but as far as any long term anti-aging effects-who knows?</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Medium is a little dark for my skin tone. Perhaps it would work better if I got a lighter shade. It is rather thick in it&#x27;s consistency.</li>
