    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product works great and has no smell!</li>
            <li>The fact that it is also odorless is a wonderful bonus as is the fact I do not feel like a need to take a shower afterwards to remove the chemicals from my nails and skin.</li>
            <li>best nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li>It is cruelty-free, which is awesome for those of us who are conscientious consumers.</li>
            <li>Received very quickly, in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>The BEST nail polish remover I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s GREAT.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as great as they say it is.</li>
            <li>Works great....</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I think this stuff works great</li>
            <li>Wife says it works great no smell</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>though otherwise when i was there for the holidays i would&#x27;ve snatched up some more !!</li>
            <li>And Tate&#x27;s is very kind to this</li>
            <li>This product effectively takes off nail polish!  </li>
            <li>SO EFFECTIVELY!  </li>
            <li>AND UNLESS THE COMPANY PUTS UP SOME REAL, AUTHENTIC DATA &amp; EVIDENCE OF ITS PRODUCT CONTENTS, PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS ITEM (&amp; THE SCAMMING COMPANY</li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>This wonderful company that makes it (Tate&#x27;s) just needs to find a better LEAKPROOF bottle for it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ridiculously good.</li>
            <li>Good for the environment.</li>
            <li>In good conscience I can no longer recommend this or any Tate&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and feel that it does a good job removing nail polish.</li>
            <li>very very satisfied</li>
            <li>IF IT WERE SAFE I&#x27;D HAPPILY BUY IT BY THE GALLONS.</li>
            <li>if i wasn&#x27;t sold before i sure am now because its destiny !</li>
            <li>THAT THIS PRODUCT IS A TOXIC SCAM COMPOSED OF TOP RACING FUEL!</li>
            <li>RACING FUEL IS A PHENOMENAL SOLVENT!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>It takes a vigilant attitude to deliberately not use chemicals on the skin or to ingest them deliberately or unknowingly; our nails get overlooked -- they absorb chemicals each time we paint or polish them, which means more work for the liver!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I really love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>so I will continue to buy this just because it saves time by removing nail polish so quickly and feels like it&#x27;s actually good for my nails!</li>
            <li>w/Tate&#x27;s which is just as effective if not</li>
            <li>AS MUCH AS I LIKED</li>
            <li>However, my question for Tate&#x27;s: Are these just odorless mineral spirits (like the kind a person uses to remove oil paints from paint brushes?)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover for three years and it really is the best.</li>
            <li>I feel like the people around me are nice (?)</li>
            <li>Completely ODORLESS .. perfect for people with LUPUS and stomach disorders concerning problems with fumes and odors.</li>
            <li>Way better than those that do not contain acetate at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>this works SO much better than acetate type removers.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>MOSTLY METHANOL (AS PER WIKIPEDIA), WHICH ARE THE 2 CHEMICAL COMPONENTS DISCOVERED BY THE CHEMIST REVIEWER&#x27;S ANALYSIS.</li>
            <li>WHEN I READ THAT, I BEGAN RESEARCHING &amp; LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS COMPANY&#x27;S PRODUCTS, BUSINESS TACTICS &amp; REPUTATION.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GLAD</li>
            <li>NOW THAT I NEVER BOUGHT MORE THAN 2 BOTTLES OF THIS PRODUCT,</li>
            <li>Most nail polish removers will also sting if there are any hangnails, cuts, etc, but Tate&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff works.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is non-toxic.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also have an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating with the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li>This product contains TOXIC ingredients and is marketed as being safe.  </li>
            <li>Since I have allergies to many odors, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for odorless products.</li>
            <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Incredible to know that there is a natural way for most anything - we don&#x27;t have to use toxic substances.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying having polish on my nails since I have found non toxic products.</li>
            <li>For this price I think they should of wrapped it better.</li>
            <li>Simply the BEST nail polish remover - ever.</li>
            <li>I love that this product has no odor.  </li>
            <li>This remove is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>but I love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this when I was pregnant and was looking for something safe to remove my nail polish, and it got the job done!</li>
            <li>and i was happy to be using something natural.  </li>
            <li>Kind of spendier, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Safe for pregnant women, men don&#x27;t mind anymore when you do your nails, safe around babies and pets.  </li>
            <li>Used a method I found on YouTube with Tate&#x27;s and within 20 minutes, my nails were clean and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Works very quickly and no smell, will buy again.</li>
            <li>It does not smell strong, but does smell like chlorine in a pool.</li>
            <li>So, if you are trying to remove a dark shade, it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li>It removes polish just fine.</li>
            <li>RECOMMEND ITS USE BY PREGNANT WOMEN OR ON CHILDREN!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it removes polish quickly and with no almost no odor.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quick removal too!  </li>
            <li>works great with traditional nail polish, very quick at removal.  </li>
            <li>i called the company because i could not believe that it was acetone free.</li>
            <li>&amp; I feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>It would be great (and ethical) of this company if they would disclose the particular minerals in this product.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product from the VitaminShoppe I believe (online)</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this nail polish remover because it says it&#x27;s oderless.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is fantastic and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>HAD ABOUT THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li>I used One-Stop Beauty Source as a seller and they did an awesome job packing it, taping it and putting it in a thick rolled up bubble wrap envelope which was placed in another bubble wrap envelope for mailing</li>
            <li>More people should know about this product, it works a whole lot better than store bought removers and the old polish comes off so easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great at removing nail polish, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing I can</li>
            <li>There is a mild smell, but doesn&#x27;t compare to smell of acetone.</li>
            <li>Tate&#x27;s is so quick.</li>
            <li>It works much better than regular polish remover and no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>IT SEEMED TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE FOR SO LONG &amp;</li>
            <li>I no longer have dried-out nails after using it, it doesn&#x27;t require five million cotton balls, and the polish comes off pretty easily and quickly without having to use much.  </li>
            <li>This is truly odor free and somehow works BETTER than the regular nail polish you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li>But when I discovered the company&#x27;s located right here in Ohio I decided it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>It does not sting your hang nails or delicate cuticle and it is good for your nails!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing - it takes polish off much faster than the standard drugstore removers, and it leaves your nails feeling stronger than before.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s acetone free and so natural!  </li>
            <li>I would say that is not true; it does not have as strong an odor as most nail polish removers do, but it still smells.  </li>
            <li>But it does take polish off fast!</li>
            <li>Update, still love it all these years later.</li>
            <li>and i grabbed the bottle and sure enough it is...</li>
            <li>This works so much better than the regular polish removers you buy in the stores.</li>
            <li>The effectiveness of the nail polish remover is not diminished by the fact that this is a natural, odor free product.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Nail polish comes off almost instantly, no matter how many coats you have on.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I wish I knew the ingredients, but at the same time I&#x27;m sure this is much better than what&#x27;s in my nail polish and regular polish remover.</li>
            <li>After some nine months since the first post ... users are still giving this product five stars and Amazon is still selling it.  </li>
            <li>Odorless mineral spirits are mineral spirits that have been further refined to remove the more toxic aromatic compounds…</li>
            <li>many years later.</li>
            <li>I have tried acetone free polish removers and natural removers....and they are nothing like Tate&#x27;s nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what i am looking for.  </li>
            <li>With Tate&#x27;s, I only have to go through two bottles a year because one solution-soaked cotton ball will often be able to take care of all 10 of my nails.</li>
            <li>I HOPE THE CULPRITS GET CAUGHT &amp; PUNISHED FOR HARMING INNOCENT PEOPLE FOR SO LONG.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I was absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li>the packaging is great for dispensing but leaks if left in any position other than upright.  </li>
            <li>For example, I don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;minerals&amp;#34; which are listed on this product would smell like pure acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>more so &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry them out as much as acetone does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a natural product it really got off all nail polish quick.  </li>
            <li>It can be hard to find a good nail polish remover that has no gelatin and doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Very neatly, no smell and it didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>It paid of to try, it really removes nail polish fast.</li>
            <li>Basically, it does work and it works fast, by you will need to hydrate your nails afterwords if you don&#x27;t want them to peel or split because of dryness.</li>
            <li>b/c I don&#x27;t need to use as much of this as I do when using acetone (which evaporates very quickly).&lt;br</li>
            <li>KNOW WHAT COMPRISES THE FUEL REQUIRED FOR TOP FUEL DRAG RACING??</li>
            <li>THANKS TO THAT PERSON FOR POSTING IT</li>
            <li>THAT REALLY</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S WHAT IT REALLY IS.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really does seem to work faster then anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for those seeking to rid their homes (and make-up bags!)</li>
            <li>but I have to say it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a really pricey and</li>
            <li>it was very helpful during my pregnancy using this product to avoid any toxic smells.</li>
            <li>Tate&#x27;s really is odorless and all-natural.</li>
            <li>works really well and</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s naturally derived (from minerals I think, though I would like to know the actual source)</li>
            <li>THAT THE CONSUMER PUBLIC HAS BEEN DUPED WITH CLAIMS OF NATURAL &amp; SAFE INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li>Natural my ass, Tate&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers said, it takes off polish effortlessly and with no nasty odors.  </li>
            <li>Not a single chemist I contacted could identify a human contact-safe odorless solvent that could do anything more than remove nail polish, and none of these were what they could describe as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;made from pure minerals\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I received the bottle and it was only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>This removed my nail polish better than any other nail polish remover I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new nail polish remover and after much research, I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I do remember that it shipped at a snails pace to my home in Texas, but again I did not purchase this item from the particular seller listed.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I particularly like the fact that it does not have an obnoxious odor.</li>
            <li>AT THE HIGH PRICE</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural!!  </li>
            <li>the bottle is a little smaller than I anticipated, but overall I am still happy with my buy...</li>
            <li>I was wrong: Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover is great.</li>
            <li>I wish it were more widely avaialbe &amp; that it cost less, but in any case I think it&#x27;s worth a splurge every now &amp; again.</li>
            <li>AS A WHOLE, APPARENTLY)!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance and chemical smells, and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t small at all and love that there aren&#x27;t harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It has no smell, so I can safely use it in the same room as other family members without offending anyone.</li>
            <li>I am chemically sensitive and when I first heard there was such a product that wasn&#x27;t toxic, I purchased some.  </li>
            <li>The price here is pretty accurate, but when I finish my little 5 once bottle, I am ordering a second.</li>
            <li>The last one I had fit my cruelty-free criteria, but it dried out my nails and would not remove my nail polish easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover, and it works really well!  </li>
            <li>Obviously those of us who are willing to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a NATURAL remover, its because we want to know what we are using is safe.</li>
            <li>It got rid of the old, raggedy, chipped nail polish that I had on my fingers.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to completely saturate my cotton ball the way I do with acetone nail polish removers.  </li>
            <li>34;TATE&#x27;S NATURAL CONDITIONER&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Not only does it really remove nail polish, it is not harmful to them.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I called Tate&#x27;s directly and tried to get some info on the products ingredients.</li>
            <li>Shameful to toss the word natural around without backing it up.</li>
            <li>Not only is it indeed odorless, it got the job on my nail polish really fast.</li>
            <li>It is completely odorless and works as well as any of it&#x27;s counterparts laden with harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It did not so the job with the natural nail polish</li>
            <li>I paint my nails at least once a week (often more than that) - so I use a LOT of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>NO, I do NOT believe it to be natural in any way.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it four stars is because the company says that it is made of natural minerals but will not specify which ones.</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra cost if you have breathing sensitivities and the smell of traditional polish remover upsets your lungs.</li>
            <li>This thing works like magic, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong unpleasant smell, or any at all!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>expensive, but a bottle lasts a long time because it takes a much smaller amount to take off even multiple coats.- great product!!</li>
            <li>this product quickly warped a bottle made of a less sturdy plastic, and it completely dissolved the sponge when I tried to refill one of those containers that has a sponge for your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But just be aware that it’s likely not “healthier” than regular acetone remover.</li>
            <li>It really is odorless, and removed my red nail polish instantly!</li>
            <li>The only nail polish remover I use now is Tate&#x27;s The Natural Miracle - Odorless Nail Polish Remover, because it is odorless, there is NO acetone and ALL NATURAL ingredients, ladies, so no toxic fumes to annoy</li>
            <li>It takes off the nail polish quickly and completely with very little odor.</li>
            <li>However, please note that this product contains methanol and nitromethane as major ingredients based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy analyses.  </li>
            <li>it takes off all my nail polish with one cotton ball easily where as regular polish removers usually took 2-3 soaked cotton balls to get all my polish off...</li>
            <li>barely smells</li>
            <li>But the point is, Tate&#x27;s actually removed blood-red nailpolish, without damaging the colors or as far as I can tell, the fibers.</li>
            <li>Polish comes right off, even dark colors and glitter!</li>
            <li>no strong odor and works better than conventional ones.</li>
            <li>;) BY SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE A FORMER TATE&#x27;S EMPLOYEE &amp; THAT ALL THE PRODUCTS ARE REPACKAGED KNOCKOFFS CONTAINING OTHER CHEAPER BRAND PRODUCTS, &amp; THAT THE  NAIL POLISH REMOVER IS (</li>
            <li>This stuff is expensive (small bottle for $12) but it is amazing &amp; worth buying.</li>
            <li>It takes polish off super fast, even my usual dark colors.</li>
            <li>Tate&#x27;s does not dry out my nails and it has no odor.</li>
            <li>Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep guide to safe cosmetics gives acetone a score of 3; mineral spirits gets a slightly worse score of 4.</li>
            <li>Better than no good acetone nail polish remover with all those chemicals!</li>
            <li>The remover lasts a long time and so far I have not had to use a lot of the product to remove 2-3 layers of nail polish (ULTA brand, Essie, Sally Hansen ect.)</li>
            <li>Chemical manufacturers have developed a low odor version of mineral turpentine which contains less of the highly volatile shorter hydrocarbons.</li>
            <li>It also does not dry out my nails like traditional remover.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Like everyone else, I think this stuff works great</li>
            <li> Wife says it works great no smell</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> though otherwise when i was there for the holidays i would&#x27;ve snatched up some more !!</li>
            <li> And Tate&#x27;s is very kind to this</li>
            <li> This product effectively takes off nail polish!  </li>
            <li> SO EFFECTIVELY!  </li>
            <li> AND UNLESS THE COMPANY PUTS UP SOME REAL, AUTHENTIC DATA &amp; EVIDENCE OF ITS PRODUCT CONTENTS, PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS ITEM (&amp; THE SCAMMING COMPANY</li>
            <li> Best of all, it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> This wonderful company that makes it (Tate&#x27;s) just needs to find a better LEAKPROOF bottle for it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculously good.</li>
            <li> Good for the environment.</li>
            <li> In good conscience I can no longer recommend this or any Tate&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and feel that it does a good job removing nail polish.</li>
            <li> very very satisfied</li>
            <li> IF IT WERE SAFE I&#x27;D HAPPILY BUY IT BY THE GALLONS.</li>
            <li> if i wasn&#x27;t sold before i sure am now because its destiny !</li>
            <li> THAT THIS PRODUCT IS A TOXIC SCAM COMPOSED OF TOP RACING FUEL!</li>
            <li> RACING FUEL IS A PHENOMENAL SOLVENT!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> It takes a vigilant attitude to deliberately not use chemicals on the skin or to ingest them deliberately or unknowingly; our nails get overlooked -- they absorb chemicals each time we paint or polish them, which means more work for the liver!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I really love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> so I will continue to buy this just because it saves time by removing nail polish so quickly and feels like it&#x27;s actually good for my nails!</li>
            <li> w/Tate&#x27;s which is just as effective if not</li>
            <li> AS MUCH AS I LIKED</li>
            <li> However, my question for Tate&#x27;s: Are these just odorless mineral spirits (like the kind a person uses to remove oil paints from paint brushes?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover for three years and it really is the best.</li>
            <li> I feel like the people around me are nice (?)</li>
            <li> Completely ODORLESS .. perfect for people with LUPUS and stomach disorders concerning problems with fumes and odors.</li>
            <li> Way better than those that do not contain acetate at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> this works SO much better than acetate type removers.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> MOSTLY METHANOL (AS PER WIKIPEDIA), WHICH ARE THE 2 CHEMICAL COMPONENTS DISCOVERED BY THE CHEMIST REVIEWER&#x27;S ANALYSIS.</li>
            <li> WHEN I READ THAT, I BEGAN RESEARCHING &amp; LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS COMPANY&#x27;S PRODUCTS, BUSINESS TACTICS &amp; REPUTATION.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GLAD</li>
            <li> NOW THAT I NEVER BOUGHT MORE THAN 2 BOTTLES OF THIS PRODUCT,</li>
            <li> Most nail polish removers will also sting if there are any hangnails, cuts, etc, but Tate&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff works.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is non-toxic.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also have an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating with the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li> This product contains TOXIC ingredients and is marketed as being safe.  </li>
            <li> Since I have allergies to many odors, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for odorless products.</li>
            <li> and I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Incredible to know that there is a natural way for most anything - we don&#x27;t have to use toxic substances.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying having polish on my nails since I have found non toxic products.</li>
            <li> For this price I think they should of wrapped it better.</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST nail polish remover - ever.</li>
            <li> I love that this product has no odor.  </li>
            <li> This remove is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> but I love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was pregnant and was looking for something safe to remove my nail polish, and it got the job done!</li>
            <li> and i was happy to be using something natural.  </li>
            <li> Kind of spendier, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Safe for pregnant women, men don&#x27;t mind anymore when you do your nails, safe around babies and pets.  </li>
            <li> Used a method I found on YouTube with Tate&#x27;s and within 20 minutes, my nails were clean and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Works very quickly and no smell, will buy again.</li>
            <li> It does not smell strong, but does smell like chlorine in a pool.</li>
            <li> So, if you are trying to remove a dark shade, it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> It removes polish just fine.</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND ITS USE BY PREGNANT WOMEN OR ON CHILDREN!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it removes polish quickly and with no almost no odor.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quick removal too!  </li>
            <li> works great with traditional nail polish, very quick at removal.  </li>
            <li> i called the company because i could not believe that it was acetone free.</li>
            <li> &amp; I feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> It would be great (and ethical) of this company if they would disclose the particular minerals in this product.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from the VitaminShoppe I believe (online)</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this nail polish remover because it says it&#x27;s oderless.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> HAD ABOUT THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> I used One-Stop Beauty Source as a seller and they did an awesome job packing it, taping it and putting it in a thick rolled up bubble wrap envelope which was placed in another bubble wrap envelope for mailing</li>
            <li> More people should know about this product, it works a whole lot better than store bought removers and the old polish comes off so easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great at removing nail polish, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing I can</li>
            <li> There is a mild smell, but doesn&#x27;t compare to smell of acetone.</li>
            <li> Tate&#x27;s is so quick.</li>
            <li> It works much better than regular polish remover and no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMED TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE FOR SO LONG &amp;</li>
            <li> I no longer have dried-out nails after using it, it doesn&#x27;t require five million cotton balls, and the polish comes off pretty easily and quickly without having to use much.  </li>
            <li> This is truly odor free and somehow works BETTER than the regular nail polish you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> But when I discovered the company&#x27;s located right here in Ohio I decided it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It does not sting your hang nails or delicate cuticle and it is good for your nails!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - it takes polish off much faster than the standard drugstore removers, and it leaves your nails feeling stronger than before.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s acetone free and so natural!  </li>
            <li> I would say that is not true; it does not have as strong an odor as most nail polish removers do, but it still smells.  </li>
            <li> But it does take polish off fast!</li>
            <li> Update, still love it all these years later.</li>
            <li> and i grabbed the bottle and sure enough it is...</li>
            <li> This works so much better than the regular polish removers you buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of the nail polish remover is not diminished by the fact that this is a natural, odor free product.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Nail polish comes off almost instantly, no matter how many coats you have on.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I wish I knew the ingredients, but at the same time I&#x27;m sure this is much better than what&#x27;s in my nail polish and regular polish remover.</li>
            <li> After some nine months since the first post ... users are still giving this product five stars and Amazon is still selling it.  </li>
            <li> Odorless mineral spirits are mineral spirits that have been further refined to remove the more toxic aromatic compounds…</li>
            <li> many years later.</li>
            <li> I have tried acetone free polish removers and natural removers....and they are nothing like Tate&#x27;s nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i am looking for.  </li>
            <li> With Tate&#x27;s, I only have to go through two bottles a year because one solution-soaked cotton ball will often be able to take care of all 10 of my nails.</li>
            <li> I HOPE THE CULPRITS GET CAUGHT &amp; PUNISHED FOR HARMING INNOCENT PEOPLE FOR SO LONG.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li> the packaging is great for dispensing but leaks if left in any position other than upright.  </li>
            <li> For example, I don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;minerals&amp;#34; which are listed on this product would smell like pure acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> more so &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry them out as much as acetone does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a natural product it really got off all nail polish quick.  </li>
            <li> It can be hard to find a good nail polish remover that has no gelatin and doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Very neatly, no smell and it didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> It paid of to try, it really removes nail polish fast.</li>
            <li> Basically, it does work and it works fast, by you will need to hydrate your nails afterwords if you don&#x27;t want them to peel or split because of dryness.</li>
            <li> b/c I don&#x27;t need to use as much of this as I do when using acetone (which evaporates very quickly).&lt;br</li>
            <li> KNOW WHAT COMPRISES THE FUEL REQUIRED FOR TOP FUEL DRAG RACING??</li>
            <li> THANKS TO THAT PERSON FOR POSTING IT</li>
            <li> THAT REALLY</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S WHAT IT REALLY IS.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really does seem to work faster then anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for those seeking to rid their homes (and make-up bags!)</li>
            <li> but I have to say it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a really pricey and</li>
            <li> it was very helpful during my pregnancy using this product to avoid any toxic smells.</li>
            <li> Tate&#x27;s really is odorless and all-natural.</li>
            <li> works really well and</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s naturally derived (from minerals I think, though I would like to know the actual source)</li>
            <li> THAT THE CONSUMER PUBLIC HAS BEEN DUPED WITH CLAIMS OF NATURAL &amp; SAFE INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li> Natural my ass, Tate&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, it takes off polish effortlessly and with no nasty odors.  </li>
            <li> Not a single chemist I contacted could identify a human contact-safe odorless solvent that could do anything more than remove nail polish, and none of these were what they could describe as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;made from pure minerals\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I received the bottle and it was only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> This removed my nail polish better than any other nail polish remover I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new nail polish remover and after much research, I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I do remember that it shipped at a snails pace to my home in Texas, but again I did not purchase this item from the particular seller listed.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that it does not have an obnoxious odor.</li>
            <li> AT THE HIGH PRICE</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural!!  </li>
            <li> the bottle is a little smaller than I anticipated, but overall I am still happy with my buy...</li>
            <li> I was wrong: Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover is great.</li>
            <li> I wish it were more widely avaialbe &amp; that it cost less, but in any case I think it&#x27;s worth a splurge every now &amp; again.</li>
            <li> AS A WHOLE, APPARENTLY)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance and chemical smells, and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t small at all and love that there aren&#x27;t harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell, so I can safely use it in the same room as other family members without offending anyone.</li>
            <li> I am chemically sensitive and when I first heard there was such a product that wasn&#x27;t toxic, I purchased some.  </li>
            <li> The price here is pretty accurate, but when I finish my little 5 once bottle, I am ordering a second.</li>
            <li> The last one I had fit my cruelty-free criteria, but it dried out my nails and would not remove my nail polish easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover, and it works really well!  </li>
            <li> Obviously those of us who are willing to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a NATURAL remover, its because we want to know what we are using is safe.</li>
            <li> It got rid of the old, raggedy, chipped nail polish that I had on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to completely saturate my cotton ball the way I do with acetone nail polish removers.  </li>
            <li> 34;TATE&#x27;S NATURAL CONDITIONER&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Not only does it really remove nail polish, it is not harmful to them.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I called Tate&#x27;s directly and tried to get some info on the products ingredients.</li>
            <li> Shameful to toss the word natural around without backing it up.</li>
            <li> Not only is it indeed odorless, it got the job on my nail polish really fast.</li>
            <li> It is completely odorless and works as well as any of it&#x27;s counterparts laden with harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It did not so the job with the natural nail polish</li>
            <li> I paint my nails at least once a week (often more than that) - so I use a LOT of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> NO, I do NOT believe it to be natural in any way.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars is because the company says that it is made of natural minerals but will not specify which ones.</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra cost if you have breathing sensitivities and the smell of traditional polish remover upsets your lungs.</li>
            <li> This thing works like magic, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong unpleasant smell, or any at all!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> expensive, but a bottle lasts a long time because it takes a much smaller amount to take off even multiple coats.- great product!!</li>
            <li> this product quickly warped a bottle made of a less sturdy plastic, and it completely dissolved the sponge when I tried to refill one of those containers that has a sponge for your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But just be aware that it’s likely not “healthier” than regular acetone remover.</li>
            <li> It really is odorless, and removed my red nail polish instantly!</li>
            <li> The only nail polish remover I use now is Tate&#x27;s The Natural Miracle - Odorless Nail Polish Remover, because it is odorless, there is NO acetone and ALL NATURAL ingredients, ladies, so no toxic fumes to annoy</li>
            <li> It takes off the nail polish quickly and completely with very little odor.</li>
            <li> However, please note that this product contains methanol and nitromethane as major ingredients based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy analyses.  </li>
            <li> it takes off all my nail polish with one cotton ball easily where as regular polish removers usually took 2-3 soaked cotton balls to get all my polish off...</li>
            <li> barely smells</li>
            <li> But the point is, Tate&#x27;s actually removed blood-red nailpolish, without damaging the colors or as far as I can tell, the fibers.</li>
            <li> Polish comes right off, even dark colors and glitter!</li>
            <li> no strong odor and works better than conventional ones.</li>
            <li> ;) BY SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE A FORMER TATE&#x27;S EMPLOYEE &amp; THAT ALL THE PRODUCTS ARE REPACKAGED KNOCKOFFS CONTAINING OTHER CHEAPER BRAND PRODUCTS, &amp; THAT THE  NAIL POLISH REMOVER IS (</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive (small bottle for $12) but it is amazing &amp; worth buying.</li>
            <li> It takes polish off super fast, even my usual dark colors.</li>
            <li> Tate&#x27;s does not dry out my nails and it has no odor.</li>
            <li> Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep guide to safe cosmetics gives acetone a score of 3; mineral spirits gets a slightly worse score of 4.</li>
            <li> Better than no good acetone nail polish remover with all those chemicals!</li>
            <li> The remover lasts a long time and so far I have not had to use a lot of the product to remove 2-3 layers of nail polish (ULTA brand, Essie, Sally Hansen ect.)</li>
            <li> Chemical manufacturers have developed a low odor version of mineral turpentine which contains less of the highly volatile shorter hydrocarbons.</li>
            <li> It also does not dry out my nails like traditional remover.</li>
            <li> I have other Natural Nail Polish Removers, like the Karma Organic one, who ALL list their ingredients on their bottles, which is what I was expecting with this</li>
            <li> : All natural, odorless, does not sting, extremely efficient for removing all types of nail polish, including the glitter ones.</li>
            <li> You use very little and one swipe gets all the polish off and it really IS odorless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not Odorless Mineral Spirits, I use two different types of that in my art and neither removes polish, I was told it had to be a polar solvent)</li>
            <li> I bought this product trusting the product&#x27;s reviews I read, but I need to confess I was a little unsure that a natural product would remove nail polish effortlessly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from this one small detail, I highly recommend this nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out my nails like OTHER polish removers.</li>
            <li> It also did not dry out my nails or hands as other products have.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of dark OPI colors that are really difficult to remove with every other polish remover I&#x27;ve tried, and Tate&#x27;s wipes it clean with just a few quick swipes.  </li>
            <li> wish i had discovered this product long ago.</li>
            <li> BUT NOW THAT MY 2ND BOTTLE IS ALMOST EMPTY</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a nail polish remover like this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minimal liquid escaped but only within the dense packaging ~not the seller&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li> The remover has absolutely no smell which is terrific.  </li>
            <li> It also has multiple uses other than for nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to other removers.  </li>
            <li> It works so fast to remove thick dark polish without smears but leaves nails dry, brittle and white.</li>
            <li> The product is oil-based so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t dry or peeling either.  </li>
            <li> It does dry my nails just a bit, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> However, it makes my fingertips feel very dry and pruny (like when you&#x27;re in a bath too long) afterward.</li>
            <li> I was completely done in seven minutes instead of the usual thirty plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to typical nail polish remover again.</li>
            <li> my cuticles actually look LESS dry today!  </li>
            <li> The only downfall to this product is the price, it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> have not worn nail polish in a very long time due to the smell of the polish and the remover.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> ; is a petroleum-derived clear, transparent liquid used as a common organic solvent in painting and decorating. ...</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no odor and it takes off nail polish effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it for a few years, and tried an organic polish remover recently.</li>
            <li> DUE TO THE UNAPPEALING HIGH PRICE)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive for such a small bottle, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I am still using this, but I was taking my polish off in the tub the other night and a bit of the removed squeezed off the cotton pad in to water.</li>
            <li> and like the other reviews.... it is oderless.</li>
            <li> I even used the other day to remove a &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> IT DISSOLVES NAIL POLISH (&amp; OTHER PLASTICS)</li>
            <li> They failed to respond to my inquiries and I will not be buying this stuff, nor supporting this company anymore.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was still a bit skeptical that it would work like some of the reviews had said, but I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> so it did not leak or damage other mail.  </li>
            <li> however, it&#x27;s extremely drying for nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> It removes my polish swiftly, and isn&#x27;t greasy like other organic removers.</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical of natural, &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; polish remover - the ones I had tried simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It does work in removing the nail polish from your finger nails, but the size is not really worth the price you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product along with a few of the other Tate&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Also, I agree that it is odd that there&#x27;s no ingredients list</li>
            <li> Little to no odor</li>
            <li> It took the polish off but severely dried my hands and nails.</li>
            <li> but it has to be better than the horrible smelling \\&quot;non acetone\\&quot; nail polish removers that I have used from other brands.</li>
            <li> There was no strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this remover truly odorless, but it also works just as well as its less expensive smelly counterparts.</li>
            <li> This removed my nail polish quicker than any other natural remover I have, but I am very skeptical of a company who does not list ingredients on their bottles...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe the ingredients they list (which are few and vague) are the ingredients that they actually use in their products.</li>
            <li> I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have all those bad chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> its a small town in ohio where my boyfriend is from</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the ingredients they use</li>
            <li> I usually do my nails every week</li>
            <li> The bottle may be small but it lasts a lot longer than it appears</li>
            <li> BUT IT&#x27;S CERTAINLY NOT HEALTHY &amp;</li>
            <li> Including water based nail polishes that I usually spend a ton of time removing using rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> My husband usually complains of the smell when I&#x27;m doing my nails, but did not even say a word when I was using this remover.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just have blind faith in local businesses</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it hardly took any of the remover to get off all my polish, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had with it was that it dried my nails badly.</li>
            <li> Only down side is the price &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d find a product that had very few, if not \\&quot;any\\&quot; harmful chemicals that removed nail polish!</li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews online (including the BBB), I have reason to believe this company is very dishonest and sketchy.</li>
            <li> plus, my husband loves it because he used to hate the chemical smell of regular nail polish remover...  </li>
            <li> SADLY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;WOW, AM I DISAPPOINTED, SAD, APPALLED &amp; OUTRAGED TO FIND REPORTS ON THE INTERNET (ESPECIALLY THE CHEMIST&#x27;S REVIEW ON THIS PAGE</li>
            <li> WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
            <li> This bothers me because there are plenty of minerals that are dangerous and toxic, and I don&#x27;t want to expose myself to them.</li>
            <li> So weird!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of purchasing nail polish remover for this price, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> , I have to use at least 3 solution-soaked cotton balls, and that stuff smells awful.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the polish I ordered because of the smell</li>
            <li> item was thinly wrapped (nail polish remover!!!)</li>
            <li> WHAT A (DANGEROUS) HOAX!!</li>
            <li> in summary, if you want something that works well and doesn’t smell horrible, Tate’s fits the bill.</li>
            <li> , I know the reason sounds horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this. It takes polish off super fast, even my usual dark colors. It also does not dry out my nails like traditional remover. However, it makes my fingertips feel very dry and pruny (like when you&#x27;re in a bath too long) afterward. It drives me nuts. So weird! That is why I took one star off. Also, I agree that it is odd that there&#x27;s no ingredients list and it can feel drying.    Update: I am still using this, but I was taking my polish off in the tub the other night and a bit of the removed squeezed off the cotton pad in to water. Well, it actually ate up the plastic tub a bit. The plastic now feels bumpy, like it melted. Natural my ass, Tate&#x27;s!!! But it does take polish off fast! Buyer beware. I took another star off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to typical nail polish remover again. It&#x27;s ridiculously good.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of purchasing nail polish remover for this price, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.  There is a mild smell, but doesn&#x27;t compare to smell of acetone.</li>
            <li> It got rid of the old, raggedy, chipped nail polish that I had on my fingers.  Very neatly, no smell and it didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic and worth every penny. i called the company because i could not believe that it was acetone free. it removed my OPI and Essie polishes faster than any remover ive ever used! and like the other reviews.... it is oderless. all my friends use it now.  Update, still love it all these years later. Does not dry out my nails like OTHER polish removers. I had this glittery sparkly nail polish on in Dec for the holidays and ONE cotton ball got it ALL off. And believe it or not....my cuticles actually look LESS dry today!  The funniest thing... i showed my boyfriend the bottle, and he goes \\&quot;mara this is from Willoughby\\&quot; and i grabbed the bottle and sure enough it is... its a small town in ohio where my boyfriend is from and we had no idea. so bizzare. if i wasn&#x27;t sold before i sure am now because its destiny ! lol. They don&#x27;t have a store there though otherwise when i was there for the holidays i would&#x27;ve snatched up some more !!</li>
            <li> The only downfall to this product is the price, it is a little pricey. I am not sure of the ingredients they use but it has to be better than the horrible smelling \\&quot;non acetone\\&quot; nail polish removers that I have used from other brands. I originally purchased this product from the VitaminShoppe I believe (online) but they are no longer selling this product. I do remember that it shipped at a snails pace to my home in Texas, but again I did not purchase this item from the particular seller listed.&lt;br /&gt;It barely smells and that is if you hold the cotton ball up to your nose (which I do not recommend anyone to do that with chemicals). The remover lasts a long time and so far I have not had to use a lot of the product to remove 2-3 layers of nail polish (ULTA brand, Essie, Sally Hansen ect.) I also did not have a problem with the remover drying my nails, however after every pedicure (before a nail polish application) I use cuticle oil...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- works, no chemical odor&lt;br /&gt;cons- price</li>
            <li> I bought this product trusting the product&#x27;s reviews I read, but I need to confess I was a little unsure that a natural product would remove nail polish effortlessly. It paid of to try, it really removes nail polish fast. So, if you are trying to remove a dark shade, it&#x27;s just perfect. The only issue I had with it was that it dried my nails badly. Basically, it does work and it works fast, by you will need to hydrate your nails afterwords if you don&#x27;t want them to peel or split because of dryness.</li>
            <li> This product effectively takes off nail polish!  Way better than those that do not contain acetate at the drugstore.  It&#x27;s GREAT.  Little to no odor and it&#x27;s natural!!  It&#x27;s a MUST.</li>
            <li> this works SO much better than acetate type removers. wish i had discovered this product long ago. expensive, but a bottle lasts a long time because it takes a much smaller amount to take off even multiple coats.- great product!!</li>
            <li> This works so much better than the regular polish removers you buy in the stores. It takes off the nail polish quickly and completely with very little odor. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have all those bad chemicals in it. Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This removed my nail polish better than any other nail polish remover I&#x27;ve ever used!  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s acetone free and so natural!  It&#x27;s pretty expensive for such a small bottle, but a little goes a long way and I don&#x27;t have to completely saturate my cotton ball the way I do with acetone nail polish removers.  I usually do my nails every week so I will continue to buy this just because it saves time by removing nail polish so quickly and feels like it&#x27;s actually good for my nails!</li>
            <li> This product works great and has no smell! The effectiveness of the nail polish remover is not diminished by the fact that this is a natural, odor free product. It is worth the extra cost if you have breathing sensitivities and the smell of traditional polish remover upsets your lungs.</li>
            <li> OH M GEE!!  The BEST nail polish remover I have ever experienced.  Doesn&#x27;t small at all and love that there aren&#x27;t harmful chemicals.  All of my nail polishes come off with ease... Even glitter is a bit easier to remove than the traditional target or sally hansen stuff.  I even used the other day to remove a &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; tattoo my daughter places on her leg before dance pictures.  Worked like a charm and i was happy to be using something natural.  Will buy again... very very satisfied</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive (small bottle for $12) but it is amazing &amp; worth buying. I polish my nails a lot &amp; have been using 100% acetone for yrs but I like to alternate it on occasion w/Tate&#x27;s which is just as effective if not more so &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry them out as much as acetone does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. I love that it&#x27;s naturally derived (from minerals I think, though I would like to know the actual source) &amp; I feel comfortable using it. I wish it were more widely avaialbe &amp; that it cost less, but in any case I think it&#x27;s worth a splurge every now &amp; again. The bottle may be small but it lasts a lot longer than it appears b/c I don&#x27;t need to use as much of this as I do when using acetone (which evaporates very quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE APRIL 2017 -&lt;br /&gt;WOW, AM I DISAPPOINTED, SAD, APPALLED &amp; OUTRAGED TO FIND REPORTS ON THE INTERNET (ESPECIALLY THE CHEMIST&#x27;S REVIEW ON THIS PAGE WHICH NOW MAKES ME BELIEVE THEY&#x27;RE NOT RUMORS OR SLANDER) THAT THIS PRODUCT IS A TOXIC SCAM COMPOSED OF TOP RACING FUEL! KNOW WHAT COMPRISES THE FUEL REQUIRED FOR TOP FUEL DRAG RACING?? UP TO 90% NITROMETHANE &amp; THE REST MOSTLY METHANOL (AS PER WIKIPEDIA), WHICH ARE THE 2 CHEMICAL COMPONENTS DISCOVERED BY THE CHEMIST REVIEWER&#x27;S ANALYSIS. THANKS TO THAT PERSON FOR POSTING IT, IT&#x27;S FINALLY ANSWERED NAGGING CURIOSITY &amp; SUSPICIONS I&#x27;VE HAD ABOUT THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS. NO WONDER IT DISSOLVES NAIL POLISH (&amp; OTHER PLASTICS) SO EFFECTIVELY!  THERE&#x27;S A REVIEW AT MAKEUPALLEY.COM (I THINK UNDER &amp;#34;TATE&#x27;S NATURAL CONDITIONER&amp;#34;) BY SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE A FORMER TATE&#x27;S EMPLOYEE &amp; THAT ALL THE PRODUCTS ARE REPACKAGED KNOCKOFFS CONTAINING OTHER CHEAPER BRAND PRODUCTS, &amp; THAT THE  NAIL POLISH REMOVER IS (AND I QUOTE) &amp;#34;JUST A TYPE OF RACING FUEL&amp;#34;!  WHEN I READ THAT, I BEGAN RESEARCHING &amp; LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS COMPANY&#x27;S PRODUCTS, BUSINESS TACTICS &amp; REPUTATION. DESPICABE!! I&#x27;M GLAD NOW THAT I NEVER BOUGHT MORE THAN 2 BOTTLES OF THIS PRODUCT, AS MUCH AS I LIKED HOW WELL IT WORKED, I NEVER NEEDED TO BUY OR USE A LOT (DUE TO THE UNAPPEALING HIGH PRICE) BUT NOW THAT MY 2ND BOTTLE IS ALMOST EMPTY I WAS CONSIDERING BUYING ANOTHER....ONLY TO BECOME FURIOUS NO LONGER AT THE HIGH PRICE BUT INSTEAD BY THE IDEA THAT THE CONSUMER PUBLIC HAS BEEN DUPED WITH CLAIMS OF NATURAL &amp; SAFE INGREDIENTS THAT REALLY AREN&#x27;T. WHAT A (DANGEROUS) HOAX!! I HOPE THE CULPRITS GET CAUGHT &amp; PUNISHED FOR HARMING INNOCENT PEOPLE FOR SO LONG. IT&#x27;S A SHAME ABOUT THIS POLISH REMOVER - IT SEEMED TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE FOR SO LONG &amp; SADLY THAT&#x27;S WHAT IT REALLY IS. RACING FUEL IS A PHENOMENAL SOLVENT! IF IT WERE SAFE I&#x27;D HAPPILY BUY IT BY THE GALLONS. BUT IT&#x27;S CERTAINLY NOT HEALTHY &amp; I ESPECIALLY WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND ITS USE BY PREGNANT WOMEN OR ON CHILDREN! UNTIL AND UNLESS THE COMPANY PUTS UP SOME REAL, AUTHENTIC DATA &amp; EVIDENCE OF ITS PRODUCT CONTENTS, PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS ITEM (&amp; THE SCAMMING COMPANY AS A WHOLE, APPARENTLY)! WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was pregnant and was looking for something safe to remove my nail polish, and it got the job done! It really is odorless, and removed my red nail polish instantly! Only down side is the price &#x3D;( The price here is pretty accurate, but when I finish my little 5 once bottle, I am ordering a second.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its claims. There is absolutely no odor and it takes off nail polish effortlessly. Most nail polish removers will also sting if there are any hangnails, cuts, etc, but Tate&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Have use this product for years. Not only does it really remove nail polish, it is not harmful to them.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, it takes off polish effortlessly and with no nasty odors.  I wear a lot of dark OPI colors that are really difficult to remove with every other polish remover I&#x27;ve tried, and Tate&#x27;s wipes it clean with just a few quick swipes.  Love it!  So worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff works. I bought a second bottle after having tried the ol drugstore standby and hating the red smears all over my hands. However, my question for Tate&#x27;s: Are these just odorless mineral spirits (like the kind a person uses to remove oil paints from paint brushes?) That freaks me out...&lt;br /&gt;I called Tate&#x27;s directly and tried to get some info on the products ingredients. They failed to respond to my inquiries and I will not be buying this stuff, nor supporting this company anymore. It works so fast to remove thick dark polish without smears but leaves nails dry, brittle and white. It&#x27;s scary. It might be toxic. It sure smells weird. I would not reccomend this to a friend and I am hesitant to use what I have left of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the company touts how family and consumer oriented they are on the label. Check out the comments on this review, you&#x27;ll see that they are fond of ignoring the inquiries of their consumers, even if they are big fans as I once was.&lt;br /&gt;I had to change my rating of this item as I am concerned about the ingredients they use. Shameful to toss the word natural around without backing it up. I&#x27;m looking elsewhere, Tate&#x27;s. And I hope you look elsewhere too, consumers!</li>
            <li> Like the idea that this is unscented and has no chemicals however there is room in improving their packing material for shipment--leaked both times shipped.</li>
            <li> it works and it&#x27;s unscented. Yay!</li>
            <li> I got this bottle and for $12.45 you would think the damn ingredients would be on the bottle. Obviously those of us who are willing to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a NATURAL remover, its because we want to know what we are using is safe. I have other Natural Nail Polish Removers, like the Karma Organic one, who ALL list their ingredients on their bottles, which is what I was expecting with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not list them? The company goes on and on about what it DOES NOT contain, yet only put \\&quot;made with minerals\\&quot; on their label....BS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say... This removed my nail polish quicker than any other natural remover I have, but I am very skeptical of a company who does not list ingredients on their bottles...shame on you tate&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Best of all, it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as great as they say it is. You use very little and one swipe gets all the polish off and it really IS odorless.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d find a product that had very few, if not \\&quot;any\\&quot; harmful chemicals that removed nail polish! I was wrong: Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover is great. It takes a vigilant attitude to deliberately not use chemicals on the skin or to ingest them deliberately or unknowingly; our nails get overlooked -- they absorb chemicals each time we paint or polish them, which means more work for the liver! Bummer!</li>
            <li> Love that it is non-toxic.  It removes polish just fine.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works! it takes off all my nail polish with one cotton ball easily where as regular polish removers usually took 2-3 soaked cotton balls to get all my polish off...plus, my husband loves it because he used to hate the chemical smell of regular nail polish remover...  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new nail polish remover and after much research, I decided to purchase this product. I will admit I was still a bit skeptical that it would work like some of the reviews had said, but I was willing to give it a try. The first time I used this product I was absolutely amazed. It removed my red nail polish with no effort. I was completely done in seven minutes instead of the usual thirty plus. It also did not dry out my nails or hands as other products have. The fact that it is also odorless is a wonderful bonus as is the fact I do not feel like a need to take a shower afterwards to remove the chemicals from my nails and skin. This is the only nail polish remover I ever buy and I pray that Tate&#x27;s never discontinues this product.</li>
            <li> The only nail polish remover I use now is Tate&#x27;s The Natural Miracle - Odorless Nail Polish Remover, because it is odorless, there is NO acetone and ALL NATURAL ingredients, ladies, so no toxic fumes to annoy/poison your hubby, pets or yourself. It does not sting your hang nails or delicate cuticle and it is good for your nails!  I had been looking for a nail polish remover like this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: All natural, odorless, does not sting, extremely efficient for removing all types of nail polish, including the glitter ones. Safe for pregnant women, men don&#x27;t mind anymore when you do your nails, safe around babies and pets.  Good for the environment. It also has multiple uses other than for nails.  No preservatives, no sulfates, no oils, not tested on animals, I also found out that Tate&#x27;s company has been around since 1932!  What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: only ONE. the packaging is great for dispensing but leaks if left in any position other than upright.  I used One-Stop Beauty Source as a seller and they did an awesome job packing it, taping it and putting it in a thick rolled up bubble wrap envelope which was placed in another bubble wrap envelope for mailing so it did not leak or damage other mail.  Minimal liquid escaped but only within the dense packaging ~not the seller&#x27;s fault.  This wonderful company that makes it (Tate&#x27;s) just needs to find a better LEAKPROOF bottle for it.  I keep mine in a ziplock bag in case it tips over accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this one small detail, I highly recommend this nail polish remover.  Thank you Amazon for selling it as I have not seen it elsewhere, yet.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: In good conscience I can no longer recommend this or any Tate&#x27;s product.  They would not respond to my inquiry or provide a Material Safety Data Sheet.  They cannot substantiate the claims made on the label.  They can&#x27;t even provide the information a parent would need to give Poison Control in case of accidental ingestion.  They also have an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating with the Better Business Bureau.  Not a single chemist I contacted could identify a human contact-safe odorless solvent that could do anything more than remove nail polish, and none of these were what they could describe as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;made from pure minerals\\&quot;.  One of these professionals I spoke with works in the cosmetic industry with an emphasis on nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great at removing nail polish, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing I can say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTW it&#x27;s not Odorless Mineral Spirits, I use two different types of that in my art and neither removes polish, I was told it had to be a polar solvent)</li>
            <li> Better than no good acetone nail polish remover with all those chemicals!</li>
            <li> I like it! and there is literally no odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover for three years and it really is the best. Takes nail polish off in no time. Also, when I ordered it it came in like two days even though I picked standard shipping, so kudos for that.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  Nail polish comes off almost instantly, no matter how many coats you have on.  A winner!</li>
            <li> Works great....and I especially like that it is cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> Not only is it indeed odorless, it got the job on my nail polish really fast. Including water based nail polishes that I usually spend a ton of time removing using rubbing alcohol. It really does seem to work faster then anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product takes your nail polish off easier than with regular nail polish remover.  I like that it does not smell and is non-toxic.  I will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> best nail polish remover. no strong odor and works better than conventional ones.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! My husband usually complains of the smell when I&#x27;m doing my nails, but did not even say a word when I was using this remover. It does not smell strong, but does smell like chlorine in a pool. It is expensive, but it hardly took any of the remover to get off all my polish, so it should last a while. I wish I knew the ingredients, but at the same time I&#x27;m sure this is much better than what&#x27;s in my nail polish and regular polish remover.</li>
            <li> Now I can remove my gel polish at home, instead of going to the salon and getting it off with a Dremel sander and acetone. Tate&#x27;s is so quick. Used a method I found on YouTube with Tate&#x27;s and within 20 minutes, my nails were clean and healthy looking. Tate&#x27;s does not dry out my nails and it has no odor. I found it at a health products store and it is the only nail polish remover I will buy now.</li>
            <li> This product removed finger nail polish efficiently as advertised.  However, please note that this product contains methanol and nitromethane as major ingredients based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy analyses.  I would urge any prospective buyer to search the internet for the MSDS/SDS forms for methanol and nitromethane and read the health warnings presented in these documents before making a final decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 4-21-16:  After some nine months since the first post ... users are still giving this product five stars and Amazon is still selling it.  This product contains TOXIC ingredients and is marketed as being safe.  Please do not use this product.  I am a chemist.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Since I have allergies to many odors, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for odorless products. Not only is this remover truly odorless, but it also works just as well as its less expensive smelly counterparts.</li>
            <li> works well for removing polish and is relatively odorless, especially compared to acetone based removers. however, it&#x27;s extremely drying for nails and cuticles. my nails have never peeled before and 3 of my nails are peeling now after using this remover maybe 3-4 times in the last 2 months. i would recommend karma naturals&#x27; nail polish removers over this.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is completely odorless and works as well as any of it&#x27;s counterparts laden with harmful chemicals.  I highly recommend it for those seeking to rid their homes (and make-up bags!) of toxins.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks used. Ingredients are covered by dome sticker.  Even though the substance erases nail polish I wouldn&#x27;t  buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I think this stuff works great and I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other observations: this product quickly warped a bottle made of a less sturdy plastic, and it completely dissolved the sponge when I tried to refill one of those containers that has a sponge for your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been suspicious about the lack of ingredients listed on the Tate&#x27;s bottle for a while. I called the company in 2012 and they were unwilling to tell me what&#x27;s in it. I now believe Tate&#x27;s is a petroleum-based substance called &amp;#34;mineral spirits.&amp;#34; Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep guide to safe cosmetics gives acetone a score of 3; mineral spirits gets a slightly worse score of 4. Acetone is &amp;#34;not likely to be carcinogenic&amp;#34; while mineral spirits is a &amp;#34;possible human carcinogen.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia&#x27;s &amp;#34;White Spirit” article: &amp;#34;White spirit (UK) or mineral spirits (US), also known as &amp;#34;paint thinner,&amp;#34; is a petroleum-derived clear, transparent liquid used as a common organic solvent in painting and decorating. ... Chemical manufacturers have developed a low odor version of mineral turpentine which contains less of the highly volatile shorter hydrocarbons. Odorless mineral spirits are mineral spirits that have been further refined to remove the more toxic aromatic compounds… .&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, if you want something that works well and doesn’t smell horrible, Tate’s fits the bill. But just be aware that it’s likely not “healthier” than regular acetone remover. They both contain VOCs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love &amp;#60;3,&lt;br /&gt;Erin</li>
            <li> works great with traditional nail polish, very quick at removal.  It did not so the job with the natural nail polish I use though.</li>
            <li> Wife says it works great no smell</li>
            <li> I am chemically sensitive and when I first heard there was such a product that wasn&#x27;t toxic, I purchased some.  I still buy it today...many years later. Incredible to know that there is a natural way for most anything - we don&#x27;t have to use toxic substances.  More people should know about this product, it works a whole lot better than store bought removers and the old polish comes off so easily.  Go for it!!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> hope to be contacted bef this posts...item was thinly wrapped (nail polish remover!!!) it leaked...about two tsps were lost. soaked enclosed paper</li>
            <li> I researched non toxic nail products online before buying . This one was recommended and I agree. Since I am using all non toxic products, my nails no longer hurt when I remove the polish. Additionally, my nails are no longer breaking and peeling since I am polishing them. I am enjoying having polish on my nails since I have found non toxic products.</li>
            <li> This thing works like magic, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong unpleasant smell, or any at all!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that some reviewers are concerned about the ingredients. I have a similar doubt. But when I discovered the company&#x27;s located right here in Ohio I decided it&#x27;s worth a try. And I&#x27;m not disappointed. Sometimes I just have blind faith in local businesses b/c I feel like the people around me are nice (?), I know the reason sounds horrible but I have to say it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> PROS: I have tried acetone free polish removers and natural removers....and they are nothing like Tate&#x27;s nail polish remover. I thought it was a really pricey and the bottle is a little smaller than I anticipated, but overall I am still happy with my buy...cause it works!  CONS: The bottle leaks during shipment. I only received a portion of the nail polish remover (substantial amount is gone) but it works so well I&#x27;ve let it slide (twice) before. The packaging is an issue though.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle and it was only 3/4 full. For this price I think they should of wrapped it better.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s exactly what i am looking for.  it was very helpful during my pregnancy using this product to avoid any toxic smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fussy about my nails, but I AM about my lungs.  And Tate&#x27;s is very kind to this asthmatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation after a spill, I have used this product on a wool-and-silk oriental carpet.  (don&#x27;t judge me!  I got it at a consignment shop!),  But the point is, Tate&#x27;s actually removed blood-red nailpolish, without damaging the colors or as far as I can tell, the fibers.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find a good nail polish remover that has no gelatin and doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  The last one I had fit my cruelty-free criteria, but it dried out my nails and would not remove my nail polish easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Tate&#x27;s Nail Polish Remover, and it works really well!  I no longer have dried-out nails after using it, it doesn&#x27;t require five million cotton balls, and the polish comes off pretty easily and quickly without having to use much.  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I get headaches from chemical exposure. I love this product, it removes polish quickly and with no almost no odor. I&#x27;ve been buying it for a few years, and tried an organic polish remover recently. It was not even close in terms of performance, so I came back to Tate&#x27;s to stock up. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The remover has absolutely no smell which is terrific.  It took the polish off but severely dried my hands and nails.</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical of natural, &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; polish remover - the ones I had tried simply didn&#x27;t work. This stuff is amazing - it takes polish off much faster than the standard drugstore removers, and it leaves your nails feeling stronger than before. It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST nail polish remover - ever. Completely ODORLESS .. perfect for people with LUPUS and stomach disorders concerning problems with fumes and odors.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails at least once a week (often more than that) - so I use a LOT of nail polish remover. With Tate&#x27;s, I only have to go through two bottles a year because one solution-soaked cotton ball will often be able to take care of all 10 of my nails. The product is oil-based so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the regular smelly stuff from Sally Hansen, CVS, etc., I have to use at least 3 solution-soaked cotton balls, and that stuff smells awful. AND it dries out my nails, unlike Tate&#x27;s! Tate&#x27;s really is odorless and all-natural. I cannot recommend it enough. P.S. It is cruelty-free, which is awesome for those of us who are conscientious consumers.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product along with a few of the other Tate&#x27;s products. But after reading the reviews online (including the BBB), I have reason to believe this company is very dishonest and sketchy. I don&#x27;t believe the ingredients they list (which are few and vague) are the ingredients that they actually use in their products. For example, I don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;minerals&amp;#34; which are listed on this product would smell like pure acetone nail polish remover. YES, it works. NO, I do NOT believe it to be natural in any way. I encourage you to research this company before buying.</li>
            <li> For a natural product it really got off all nail polish quick.  My nails aren&#x27;t dry or peeling either.  There was no strong smell.  I really love this!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this nail polish remover because it says it&#x27;s oderless.  I would say that is not true; it does not have as strong an odor as most nail polish removers do, but it still smells.  It does work in removing the nail polish from your finger nails, but the size is not really worth the price you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I love that this product has no odor.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance and chemical smells, and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> This remove is fantastic!  Not only does it not have the chemical smell, it&#x27;s quick removal too!  I&#x27;ll never go back to other removers.  Kind of spendier, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It removes my polish swiftly, and isn&#x27;t greasy like other organic removers. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> This is truly odor free and somehow works BETTER than the regular nail polish you get at the drug store. I got it to keep at my desk at work to fix my polish on my lunch break. It&#x27;s definitely expensive so I reccomend still using the regular stuff when you can.  But, if you have stubborn polish or need not to have an odor - this is your product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and feel that it does a good job removing nail polish. I particularly like the fact that it does not have an obnoxious odor. The reason I gave it four stars is because the company says that it is made of natural minerals but will not specify which ones. This bothers me because there are plenty of minerals that are dangerous and toxic, and I don&#x27;t want to expose myself to them. It would be great (and ethical) of this company if they would disclose the particular minerals in this product.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly, in perfect condition.  Works very quickly and no smell, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has no smell, so I can safely use it in the same room as other family members without offending anyone. Polish comes right off, even dark colors and glitter! It works much better than regular polish remover and no nasty chemicals. It does dry my nails just a bit, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased several nail items hoping the smell had been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I have not worn nail polish in a very long time due to the smell of the polish and the remover.&lt;br /&gt;Well I was disappointed in the polish I ordered because of the smell but I love this.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well and the smell is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I could find a nail polish that didn&#x27;t smell, I would be an even happier camper.</li>
