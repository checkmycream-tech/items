            <li>recommende by a friend with great looking hair!</li>
            <li>Yes I am very happy with amazon.com.</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>Redken Spray Starch 15 Heat styling Spray is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Great product--</li>
            <li>It is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It was a great product.</li>
            <li>Also works great when curling my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Found it here after months, and my hair looks amazing again!</li>
            <li>Good company.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Redking could rethink this as it seems to be a popular product and people claim the replacement one is not as good</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky but does keep it in shape, love it!</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It gives both shaping and holding to my \\&quot;do.\\&quot; Plus, no build-up, so my hair stays healthy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Was glad to</li>
            <li>So many times I find a product I like</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, won&#x27;t curl my super fine (uggg!)</li>
            <li>it on-line since it was no longer available in local&lt;br /&gt;stores/salons.  </li>
            <li>I had originally sent redken a message that I could not find it in any salons around here.</li>
            <li>A lot of people ask where I get it cut and a good cut is necessary, every two to three weeks--but a great product goes a long way to achieving the right look.</li>
            <li>This is a super, super product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is silver (I don&#x27;t like to consider it gray), straight, and fine.  </li>
            <li>t the right amount of hold for me.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m on the right track.  </li>
            <li>Loved it but not worth a 60 dollar fortune.</li>
            <li>It is sticky, but it&#x27;s \\&quot;starch\\&quot; so that is to be expected and since it holds well, you honestly shouldn&#x27;t expect it to have a run your hands through it feeling (this works great for people whos hair has a hard time holding a curl as well).</li>
            <li>I bought several bottles because I love it, and I heard it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li>It sets your hair without drying it, it&#x27;s easy to comb through and it really does the job of setting the curl - plus it adds VOLUME, which is my constant quest.</li>
            <li>The product is great for very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>i didnt use that much either.</li>
            <li>to much expansive for that</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair but don&#x27;t like to leave it that way.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your help in this matter.</li>
            <li>I was just in a wedding and the hair stylist used it when curling my hair, usually my hair only holds curl for about an hour before it falls, but a day later, my hair still looks great.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product when a hair stylist used this on my non-curl-holding Asian hair.</li>
            <li>I wear it pretty darn short</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s getting very hard to find - better stock up!</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair that will not adhere to my curling iron without a little help.  </li>
            <li>This stuff not only protects hair from heat-styling, but it also gives it a thicker texture which makes styling easier and gives it better grip when using a curling or flat iron...plus, it has something in it that gives some hold or control because when you flat iron or use a curling iron, the style lasts longer and retains the shape.</li>
            <li>There are many, many reviews from past users of #15 that are unhappy and want this product reinstated.  </li>
            <li>when i straightened my hair, for the first time, steam came out of my straightener.it made my hair sticky that i had trouble running my fingers through it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have super curly hair and this helps tame it down so well.</li>
            <li> She used it to keep my long and loose curls to stay for the wedding</li>
            <li> I recently had trouble finding it locally.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult to straighten hair, since it&#x27;s super thick and curly/frizzy, but with this stuff my hair actually stays straight for longer than an hour after I straighten it !</li>
            <li> I find that using a shine spray or a tiny bit of anti-frizz product afterwards will help soften your hair up a little and not be as sticky and starchy.</li>
            <li> Then it returned, probably due to consumer demand.</li>
            <li> I hope it has not been discontinued, as it was previously.</li>
            <li> I like a style with a little bounce.</li>
            <li> I use a little before each curl with my tool and it holds it all day.</li>
            <li> So I have been using spray starch for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and an extremely upset, to say the least, that Redken has discontinued making it.  </li>
            <li> I use it in addition to a heat protectant because it doesn&#x27;t specifically say anywhere that it is a heat protectant, so I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with getting your style to say for longer than a minute!</li>
            <li> It holds thick hair with minimum use.  </li>
            <li> it gave my hair a nasty crunchy feeling, and i dont think it really helped with straightening or heat protection.</li>
            <li> THAT IS ON THE THIN SIDE</li>
            <li> unfortunately it is discontinued.  </li>
            <li> The products that they &amp;#34;recommend&amp;#34; using as a &amp;#34;substitute&amp;#34; do not work and are useless.  </li>
            <li> I have very difficult to curl hair.</li>
            <li> this stuff was horrible and it smelled disgusting.</li>

            <li> It is for my mother and she loves it...unfortunately it is discontinued.  Perhaps Redking could rethink this as it seems to be a popular product and people claim the replacement one is not as good</li>
            <li> I actually use this to finish my hair, instead of hairspray. It gives both shaping and holding to my \\&quot;do.\\&quot; Plus, no build-up, so my hair stays healthy. I recently had trouble finding it locally. I hope it has not been discontinued, as it was previously. Then it returned, probably due to consumer demand. Time will tell....</li>
            <li> I have very difficult to straighten hair, since it&#x27;s super thick and curly/frizzy, but with this stuff my hair actually stays straight for longer than an hour after I straighten it ! In fact, it will stay until my next wash! It is sticky, but it&#x27;s \\&quot;starch\\&quot; so that is to be expected and since it holds well, you honestly shouldn&#x27;t expect it to have a run your hands through it feeling (this works great for people whos hair has a hard time holding a curl as well). I use it in addition to a heat protectant because it doesn&#x27;t specifically say anywhere that it is a heat protectant, so I&#x27;m not sure.

            <li> Great product--I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
            <li> The product is great for very thick hair.  It holds thick hair with minimum use.  It is a great product.  I hear that the company stopped manufacturing it.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. If they ever discontinue it I&#x27;m killing myself. It sets your hair without drying it, it&#x27;s easy to comb through and it really does the job of setting the curl - plus it adds VOLUME, which is my constant quest. Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only protects hair from heat-styling, but it also gives it a thicker texture which makes styling easier and gives it better grip when using a curling or flat iron...plus, it has something in it that gives some hold or control because when you flat iron or use a curling iron, the style lasts longer and retains the shape. In a way it&#x27;s almost like a hairspray/thermal protection hybrid.</li>
            <li> I am constantly ordering this for my Mom who is using it \\&quot;to lift up roots\\&quot;. She swears by it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  Was glad to&lt;br /&gt;find it on-line since it was no longer available in local&lt;br /&gt;stores/salons.  Of course, it was more expensive to buy&lt;br /&gt;on-line especially with the shipping charge.  I may have&lt;br /&gt;to consider using a different styling product in the future.</li>
            <li> t the right amount of hold for me.  I bought several bottles because I love it, and I heard it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> to much expansive for that</li>
            <li> Put rollers in my hair and spray.  It works so well.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky but does keep it in shape, love it! recommende by a friend with great looking hair!</li>
            <li> I have very difficult to curl hair. So I have been using spray starch for a few years now. I have naturally straight hair but don&#x27;t like to leave it that way. I like a style with a little bounce. I recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with getting your style to say for longer than a minute!</li>
            <li> I had originally sent redken a message that I could not find it in any salons around here. Did they know who carried it or could I get it. They simple said it is still being made and everyone had it.  Well that was their customer service.!  So I wrote back and said I will go to Amazon, which I did. Yes I am very happy with amazon.com. you all have always come thru with my needs and request.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, won&#x27;t curl my super fine (uggg!) hair without it. Protects and sets curls.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair that will not adhere to my curling iron without a little help.  This does the trick - however, I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the salons and that is the reason I looked online.  So many times I find a product I like and they discdontinue it.  Thanks for your help in this matter.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was discontinued. Returned and got lots of money back. It was a great product. Loved it but not worth a 60 dollar fortune. Good company. Returned my money.</li>
            <li> I was just in a wedding and the hair stylist used it when curling my hair, usually my hair only holds curl for about an hour before it falls, but a day later, my hair still looks great. She used it to keep my long and loose curls to stay for the wedding and it did and then plus.  I would definitely recommend  it to spray on your hair before curling (she did this in sections).</li>
            <li> I first came across this product when a hair stylist used this on my non-curl-holding Asian hair. This stuff is amazing! Totally keeps everything in place. I even use it sometimes to keep unruly baby hairs out of my face at the gym.</li>
            <li> This is a super, super product.  Have used it for years and an extremely upset, to say the least, that Redken has discontinued making it.  The products that they &amp;#34;recommend&amp;#34; using as a &amp;#34;substitute&amp;#34; do not work and are useless.  There are many, many reviews from past users of #15 that are unhappy and want this product reinstated.  Redken are you listening???</li>
            <li> This product is great! It works like hair spray but is a heat protectant too! I have super curly hair and this helps tame it down so well. Also works great when curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. I ran out and was told it was discontinued. Found it here after months, and my hair looks amazing again! Please NEVER discontinue it!</li>
            <li> Redken Spray Starch 15 Heat styling Spray is wonderful!  And it&#x27;s getting very hard to find - better stock up!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It works great on my fine hair.  Hope red ken continues to make it.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT IN CONJUNCTION WITH BLOWN AWAY TO PROVIDE FULLNESS WITHOUT STICKINESS.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FOR HAIR THAT IS ON THE THIN SIDE</li>
            <li> My hair is silver (I don&#x27;t like to consider it gray), straight, and fine.  Redken products help keep it the way I like it.  I wear it pretty darn short and I get lots of compliments on it--primarily from women, so I think I&#x27;m on the right track.  A lot of people ask where I get it cut and a good cut is necessary, every two to three weeks--but a great product goes a long way to achieving the right look.</li>
            <li> It does what I wanted it to do. I use a little before each curl with my tool and it holds it all day. Doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky.</li>
