            <li>I agree with other reviews that this lotion smells wonderful ,but tanning it is a diferent story.</li>
            <li>spreads easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally picky about what my tanning lotion smells like because I don&#x27;t like most of them, but this one smells so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>I like the top of the line designer skin products but for my money, this is one to get because of the much more reasonable price...</li>
            <li>Just started using this, I adore this lotion, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Amazing fragrance and leaves your skin incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>If you need more bronzer, which sometimes I do if I don&#x27;t go tanning as much, just get some bronzer drops and add it to the lotion.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had way better smelling lotions it doesn&#x27;t leave much of an after tan smell.</li>
            <li>the kind of person who cant tan naturally</li>
            <li>slight cool tingle great for staying cool</li>
            <li>This lotion is super yummy</li>
            <li>It arrived extremely quick and it was sealed and everything.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>He thought it was new perfume and told me to use it more.</li>
            <li>I look forward to next time and am a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li>It is my favorite Designer Skin lotion thus far...</li>
            <li>I paid nearly $60 for this lovely stuff from Desert Sun Tanning.</li>
            <li>does have a nice bronze color, more of a natural sun glow rather than a bronzer though, not very cooling as it states.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite one by far! (:</li>
            <li>I prefer the other&#x27;s smell to this one although this to smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and even has a little bit of &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; afterwards.  </li>
            <li>makes my tan last a looooong time :)</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future</li>
            <li>but I still really like this lotion!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Exact product as in the salons.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, not like some other tanning lotion that when you get out of the tanning bed you smell like a burnt chicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell was a little strong for m, but my daughter thought it was fine.</li>
            <li>you such a great deep dark tan and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>, i really couldnt tell that their were any bronzers in the lotion deff wont be buying agin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in color</li>
            <li>However, I wanted to try and the cost is much cheaper then the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>The label sayes cooling, I couldn&#x27;t really tell</li>
            <li>and they had reasonable prices with prompt service</li>
            <li>: This bottle had discoloration &amp; different consistency from the original bottle from the salon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked better than the other two lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li>A whole lot cheaper here than in salons, more than half price.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells amazing and got me past my tanning plateau.</li>
            <li>Not worth more than $20.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many packets of tanning lotion and almost none live up to their claims, other than tingle lotions do tingle.</li>
            <li>The cooling effect is an odd sensation for sure.</li>
            <li>So happy I found it here for less than half the cost, and its absolutely the same stuff!</li>
            <li>I have alergicdermatitis and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>im 22 years old</li>
            <li>I have always used the purple bottle which is believe dark cooling bronzer anti-aging and firming formula, no other name, but settled on this one after not being able to find the other.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t tan to be super dark, just enough to keep a natural color</li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t tan to be super dark, just enough to keep a natural color</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion un the past and if you are someone who tans and doesn&#x27;t burn I highly suggest it.  </li>
            <li> Received sooner than expected, bottle was full, and less expensive than buying at a tanning salon, definitely recommend buying tanning lotions from here!</li>
            <li> Plus it definitely does the job of getting you DARK!</li>
            <li> The lotion has absolutely no after tan odor.</li>
            <li> (Experience from myself &amp; other</li>
            <li> I will not buy any other product after using this.</li>
            <li> It does not have the cooling effect like it says, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> if i used it every day or every other day for 15 min</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was half of what the salon wanted to charge her by the way.</li>
            <li> The girl I talked to said this had a slight cooling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a small package at my local tanning salon, and I got 4 tans out of the small package.</li>
            <li> &amp; when it&#x27;s $54 in the salon &amp; half that price on amazon....</li>
            <li> Little to expancive to pay what is not.</li>
            <li> I suggest that to anyone before buying a lotion you&#x27;re not familiar with is to go find the product in a store and see what you think of the smell and</li>
            <li> and I was very dark.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other lotion from anywhere else ever!!</li>
            <li> I tan once a week year round.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but was happily surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li> I have even used it in the sun a few times too!</li>
            <li> ; I am VERY disappointed , it is not at all similar , I will say the place I ordered this product from was very professional</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle, which I like.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is addicted to tanning salons and begged me to order this for her.</li>
            <li> but I could feel the chilling tingle.</li>
            <li> so thats extremely disappointing</li>
            <li> Even after tanning it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> U won&#x27;t b disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate smelling like lotion or perfume.  </li>
            <li> It is kinda greasy and leaves your hands a awful orange color which I do not like :-(</li>

            <li> slight cool tingle great for staying cool while summer tanning, it smells pretty good and leaves you with a nice brown not orange tan.</li>

            <li> i just tried out this yesterday, i didnt feel any cooling at all so thats extremely disappointing but the lotion smells amazing, i really couldnt tell that their were any bronzers in the lotion deff wont be buying agin</li>
            <li> I like the top of the line designer skin products but for my money, this is one to get because of the much more reasonable price...spreads easily it has kind of a thnner texture than many. I have no burnt aftersmell after tanning with this.</li>
            <li> I tan once a week year round. At first I was nervous about the smell but once applied it smells really good! Even after tanning it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I don&#x27;t lose color between weekly tanning appointments. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in color but I don&#x27;t tan to be super dark, just enough to keep a natural color otherwise I&#x27;d be rather pasty. Overall I would recommend it!</li>

            <li> This lotion is super yummy it smells like a smoothie! I love the cooling effect on the skin because I am very light and rosy so everyone knows when I go tanning but this helps!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite tanning lotions. However, I wanted to try and the cost is much cheaper then the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Some places try and scam you on tanning lotions! But this was great results were excellent! Iam almost black.it works excellent! Will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> I REALLY Appreciated the great customer service! They deserve their well-earned ranking on 95%+!!!!I would definitely do business again! I look forward to next time and am a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve NEVER burned when using this lotion in the tanning beds.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion un the past and if you are someone who tans and doesn&#x27;t burn I highly suggest it.  This is a strong lotion and will cause anyone with fair skin to fry. This lotion smells great and give a nice deep tan.</li>
            <li> Just started using this, I adore this lotion, so far so good. Will update if anything changes. The cooling effect is an odd sensation for sure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I love the smell, the awesome tan it helps create and everything about it! It&#x27;s my absolute favorite! I have even used it in the sun a few times too! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion! Smells amazing, not like some other tanning lotion that when you get out of the tanning bed you smell like a burnt chicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot cheaper on amazon then in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great! Like fruity starburst! This is a great price for the size bottle you receive. The label sayes cooling, I couldn&#x27;t really tell but I still really like this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Don&#x27;t feel any cooling essence. Not worth more than $20. I&#x27;ve bought many packets of tanning lotion and almost none live up to their claims, other than tingle lotions do tingle. So now I look for moisture and scent. This has both.</li>
            <li> I compared the Believe In Me bottle to the same bottle from a licensed salon &amp; these are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: This bottle had discoloration &amp; different consistency from the original bottle from the salon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B: These bottles are blacklisted &amp; SHOULD ONLY BE SOLD IN SALONS not on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C: DO NOT USE! Can create spotted spots &amp; discoloration on your skin! (Experience from myself &amp; other consumers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read this please only purchase these salon lotions from A TANNING SALON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May look &amp; smell the same as salon lotions but THEY ARE NOT THE SAME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I have used this product more than once and am very satisfied with the results. Would definitely recommend to you to try it yourself.</li>
            <li> Great product. Amazing fragrance and leaves your skin incredibly soft! I will not buy any other product after using this.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that this lotion smells wonderful ,but tanning it is a diferent story.I used this at list 6 times and I don&#x27;t see any color change.Little to expancive to pay what is not.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait and leave a review until after I had used the product more than once. I&#x27;m in love! It arrived extremely quick and it was sealed and everything. I went to a regular tanning salon to smell and talk to the clerks about their products. The girl I talked to said this had a slight cooling and it smelled yummy. I love the after smell and the cooling isn&#x27;t over bearing. I won&#x27;t buy a lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell good because I would love to smell like when I come out. My oblivious boyfriend said I even smelled nice each time I used it... He thought it was new perfume and told me to use it more. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to go into the tanning bed and come out feeling like a pop-sickle but I could feel the chilling tingle. Besides in the store it was $54 on here it was $24. I was more than happy to save 30 bucks especially on something that I was able to preview before I committed. I suggest that to anyone before buying a lotion you&#x27;re not familiar with is to go find the product in a store and see what you think of the smell and the clerks should know what they are talking about. I won&#x27;t buy any other lotion from anywhere else ever!!</li>
            <li> Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Great Tan&lt;br /&gt;good price</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Received sooner than expected, bottle was full, and less expensive than buying at a tanning salon, definitely recommend buying tanning lotions from here!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to lotion.  The scent is subtle, which I like.  I hate smelling like lotion or perfume.  It goes on easily, has a nice cooling agent, and a bit of a bronzer.  If you need more bronzer, which sometimes I do if I don&#x27;t go tanning as much, just get some bronzer drops and add it to the lotion.  Simple as that!</li>
            <li> does have a nice bronze color, more of a natural sun glow rather than a bronzer though, not very cooling as it states. i&#x27;ve had way better smelling lotions it doesn&#x27;t leave much of an after tan smell. i probably wont buy it again though.</li>
            <li> This product smells really nice! I&#x27;ve used a small package at my local tanning salon, and I got 4 tans out of the small package. And every time I came out of the bed, I looked 1 shade darker! It really works! This is my absolute favorite one by far! (:</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this tanning lotion. It is my favorite Designer Skin lotion thus far...and I&#x27;ve tried many! Plus it definitely does the job of getting you DARK!</li>
            <li> The ppl at Designer Skin sent me a message via email and said that &amp;#34;this brand  is similar to Believe.&amp;#34; I am VERY disappointed , it is not at all similar , I will say the place I ordered this product from was very professional and they had reasonable prices with prompt service I would but from them again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have tryed many of designer skin products  and are really good. But this one is the best&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Gives you such a great deep dark tan and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and even has a little bit of &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; afterwards.  No orange hands.  A whole lot cheaper here than in salons, more than half price.  On my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have always used the purple bottle which is believe dark cooling bronzer anti-aging and firming formula, no other name, but settled on this one after not being able to find the other.  I prefer the other&#x27;s smell to this one although this to smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> It does not have the cooling effect like it says, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to based on other reviews.  It has a nice fragrance.  It works for me and is way cheaper buying it here over buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! &amp; when it&#x27;s $54 in the salon &amp; half that price on amazon.... Come on! Why wouldn&#x27;t you order it?</li>
            <li> I was using Obsidian before this lotion and I recently ran out I decided to try a packet of believe in me. Let me tell you I used it twice and I was very dark. It worked better than the other two lotions I have tried. I was also going in the tanning bed for 15 minutes on a level one bed. The smell of the lotion I think is not the greatest but I can stand the smell. I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> im 22 years old and ive been using this product since my senior prom! i love it and im the kind of person who cant tan naturally and this gives me the kick start i need. if i used it every day or every other day for 15 min i get &amp;#34;Hispanic dark&amp;#34; for lack of better terms and i am ghost white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and I&#x27;m still in love with this product. I have alergicdermatitis and very sensitive skin and this is the only tanning cream I can use because of the cooling agent in it, the smell is amazing and it&#x27;s moisturizers are very good for your skin. I just love it!</li>
            <li> This smells yummy!! It is kinda greasy and leaves your hands a awful orange color which I do not like :-(</li>
            <li> I love the way Believe in Me smells. I&#x27;ve been a fan for years of this product. Beautiful bronzer than works amazingly!</li>
            <li> Exact product as in the salons. It has a bronzer in it and it feels good on the skin, not greasy at all. It also has a great cooling sensation so it helps to keep you cool if you were using it in the hot sunshine, or in a tanning bed in the summertime. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing and got me past my tanning plateau. It makes your skin feel incredible and gives the prettiest tan. The lotion has absolutely no after tan odor. I love this lotion and would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. I&#x27;m generally picky about what my tanning lotion smells like because I don&#x27;t like most of them, but this one smells so good. And gave me a great tan to boot :)</li>
            <li> I paid nearly $60 for this lovely stuff from Desert Sun Tanning. So happy I found it here for less than half the cost, and its absolutely the same stuff!</li>
            <li> It still has somewhat of a smell. It does not make you skin feel greasy after using it. It&#x27;s okay</li>
