            <li>The Clean + Easy cloth waxing strips made it so easy to cut the size/shape I needed.  </li>

            <li>Makes it easier to catch that spot next go-round for that good contact.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>I got these strips to use with my MOOM sugaring product since I quickly learned that the cloth strips that came with MOOM would be a fraction of what I needed to get the job done right.  </li>
            <li>The roll is HUGE and I really feel like I am getting my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth $12.</li>
            <li>I bought it last week and the texture is really makes you feel as though you are using those strips that come with good waxing products.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I usually make my own wax (sugar), saves me money, but I need a canister to put it in :) hence the Aloe Vera wax.  </li>
            <li>so I used more strips doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very convenient, just cut and use!</li>
            <li>and I love that the roll is so big.  </li>
            <li>I am ready to reorder soon!</li>
            <li>I am able to fold it and use the back side.</li>
            <li>It lasts longer this way because you&#x27;re not wasting as much if you cut them right.  </li>
            <li>I really like these wax strips they work pretty well</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t use the strip as much</li>
            <li>The deliver was mega fast, and the cloth really fix in the wax, removing everything,</li>

            <li>Works very well with home made waxes.</li>
            <li>I purchased the same kind again about a year later and found the issue occurred</li>
            <li>These strips work better than the other products we have tried.  </li>
            <li>and I can cut it to any length with a decent pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>More efficient than using cloth scraps or other generic wax strips.</li>
            <li>and this roll would be very useful lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>Later I decided to just go to a salon and let them do it, figuring the cost wouldn&#x27;t be that much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>This roll is pretty long</li>
            <li>This arrived unexpected, I did not order it</li>
            <li>I have wax my legs, armpits, face, and bikini area twice now; and I barely made a dent off the roll!  </li>
            <li>Ive been using Sally wax, The wax are good for over a month, unfortunately, the cloths not!</li>
            <li>I bought the muslin cloth ones, (more brown in color) to start waxing myself again and found that the wax starts to come through the muslin cloth ones on your first was strip and thought that maybe I just got a bad batch.  </li>

            <li> Probably will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d very thin &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li> however long I want.  </li>
            <li> I like how i can control how short, long, or wide i can cut it to.  </li>
            <li> the wax does not bleed through the strip after single use.</li>
            <li> These are white which I assume means bleached and the muslin cloth ones aren&#x27;t, but these are just as sturdy and and don&#x27;t have little fibers that peel off everywhere when I cut strips to use.</li>
            <li> You only need to apply little wax to get what you need off.  </li>
            <li> wide strip</li>
            <li> When cutting the roll into strips, it is CLEAN; not like the Muslims strips that has strings of it coming off.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave little linty bits behind if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t always get good wax contact in awkward spots.</li>
            <li> area.&lt;br /&gt;The benefit of waxing yourself is you can do it just the way  you want and in as big or small of an area as you think should be done</li>
            <li> But that could&#x27;ve just been me waxing the wrong way seeing  has how it was my first time doing it myself.</li>
            <li> and I like having the option of cutting the strip to exactly the length that I need.</li>
            <li> This product has cut my waxing time practically in half!</li>
            <li> thick, heavy duty strips.</li>
            <li> They are thick so no seepage.</li>
            <li> Not as thin as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Way less painful.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> It seemed to me to be expensive for what it was</li>
            <li> Is it supposed to smell this bad?</li>

            <li> My mom bought a roll of these for me probably 10 years ago and I loved them.

I bought the muslin cloth ones, (more brown in color) to start waxing myself again and found that the wax starts to come through the muslin cloth ones on your first was strip and thought that maybe I just got a bad batch.  I purchased the same kind again about a year later and found the issue occurred and I couldn&#x27;t use the strip as much so I used more strips doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I just used them yesterday to wax my legs and under-arms and they came out great.&lt;br /&gt;These are smoother and the wax doesn&#x27;t run through the strip as with the others. These are white which I assume means bleached and the muslin cloth ones aren&#x27;t, but these are just as sturdy and and don&#x27;t have little fibers that peel off everywhere when I cut strips to use. Maybe tomorrow or sometime in the week I&#x27;ll get to my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;The benefit of waxing yourself is you can do it just the way  you want and in as big or small of an area as you think should be done and you save money if you have the time.</li>
            <li> It works well- and unlike the muslin it leaves no lint! Easy to cut into desired lengths and even widths.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d very thin &amp; easy to work with. I like this waxing paper better than the tan ones I bought.</li>
            <li> These work incredibly well and last much longer than you can ever imagine.</li>
            <li> Great price. Quick shipping. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace strip packs since I can cut the size I need for what I&#x27;m waxing. This doesn&#x27;t leave little linty bits behind if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t always get good wax contact in awkward spots. Makes it easier to catch that spot next go-round for that good contact.</li>
            <li> I only used it twice, but I like the result. I don&#x27;t have much to say about this product, it&#x27;s really good. The only thing that bothers me is the price, I wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do! Will probably last me a lifetime! 😊</li>
            <li> Very convenient, just cut and use! More efficient than using cloth scraps or other generic wax strips. Probably will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> i can make my own strips, cheaper, easy to cut , doesnt fall apart , good size for the money</li>
            <li> These strips work better than the other products we have tried.  Easy to use and you can pick your size</li>
            <li> Ive been using Sally wax, The wax are good for over a month, unfortunately, the cloths not! I need smth bigger!! The deliver was mega fast, and the cloth really fix in the wax, removing everything, even better the ones that comes with my wax! i will be getting another one soon!</li>
            <li> very good quality, take it from me, I&#x27;m a licensed pro</li>
            <li> This roll is pretty long and it&#x27;s great because I can cut them in to the size I want them. I wax once a month and this roll would be very useful lasting a long time. I definitely recommend this product to the regular waxers outthere.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! can use it more than once. I can also cut it to any size I want which is great! I would buy again. LOOOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it since last 4 years and it works great. You may cut it to your desired size for waxing at different areas.</li>
            <li> Perfect product... I do waxing at home, this is really a superb product... I can the cut the strips as per my requirement and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This arrived unexpected, I did not order it but Amazon was very helpful in getting my order straightened out. I am going to rate it anyway since it WAS in my care for a short time. It seemed to me to be expensive for what it was but I am not an expert and did not need the product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work out for me and waxing kind of hurt.</li>
            <li> I love that I can cut these to size I like.  It lasts longer this way because you&#x27;re not wasting as much if you cut them right.  I still have so much left and I have waxed a lot with these including my boyfriend&#x27;s back and my legs so I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> this is not the muslin (have use once. never again! just didn&#x27;t work for me) this roll is exactly the kind of material that came &amp;#34;stock&amp;#34; with my wax kit.  happy happy!</li>
            <li> I really like these wax strips they work pretty well and I like having the option of cutting the strip to exactly the length that I need. However sometimes the wax won&#x27;t stick to the strip so I had to pull it off - OUCH. But that could&#x27;ve just been me waxing the wrong way seeing  has how it was my first time doing it myself. Anyway i really love these and will continue to use them</li>
            <li> Great product.  The roll works very well because I can cut the strips however long I want.  They are easy to use and I love that the roll is so big.  This is definitely worth $12.</li>
            <li> The biggest roll of waxing cloth I&#x27;ve ever bought. This will take me forever to use on my face. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I bought it last week and the texture is really makes you feel as though you are using those strips that come with good waxing products.</li>
            <li> Great product for at home waxing!  Can cut to size easily for the perfect size.  The roll will last a while! I use sugar waxing, which was perfect with this product.</li>
            <li> These are strong and works wonderfully while waxing. Awesome product. I make my own homemade wax and these go with it perfect.</li>
            <li> bought this because of all the good reviews and they&#x27;re right. Thanks for all your help. I&#x27;m gonna to stick to this product from now on</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s so nice to be able to cut the size strip you want. Quality strips. Not as thin as I was expecting. Holds warm wax really well. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> after reading the review, i decided to try this waxing strips. i have been using muslins for years. this strip is so much better than the muslin strip. it is easier to cut, leaves no wax on skin.</li>
            <li> Works really good with any good wax.  Also you can cut it into desired shapes you want. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different wax strips. These are my favorite so far. They are thick so no seepage. The wax adheres well to the paper and it is easy to use. I like being able to cut it the way I want, so I always choose roll. Like another poster mentioned, this has no dangling strings like you encounter when you cut muslin. Definitely a re-buy for me. I&#x27;ve already ordered a second roll for backup!</li>
            <li> Great like always,I am recommending  to everyone,who do waxing for job and just for using home,so just try it and you&#x27;ll be hapy</li>
            <li> Works great. Can even reuse maybe up to 4 times.  grabs the wax and hair.  Good amount.  Use this so much  I am ready to reorder soon!</li>
            <li> Smell? Is it supposed to smell this bad?</li>
            <li> Good buy. Works well and saves buying by the roll.</li>
            <li> I love this roll! It is not pre-cut, it is a roll that you cut in pieces for your size choice.  Saves me money from the pre-cut strips you get at the Salon stores.  I like how i can control how short, long, or wide i can cut it to.  When cutting the roll into strips, it is CLEAN; not like the Muslims strips that has strings of it coming off. The best thing about it, its the only wax paper cloth I know of that actually CLINGS to the wax!!  You only need to apply little wax to get what you need off.  I have wax my legs, armpits, face, and bikini area twice now; and I barely made a dent off the roll!  This is a must have!  Since I have the best sisters in the world I&#x27;m going to send them each one on their birthdays!  The wax I use is suddenly smooth aloe Vera, i like the warmer(suddenly smooth wax warmer: purchased in sally&#x27;s). I usually make my own wax (sugar), saves me money, but I need a canister to put it in :) hence the Aloe Vera wax.  Hope this helps for those who are debating to buy this roll for waxing.  It will save you money. TIP: Put it in a clean place (WRAP IN SARAN WRAP/ LARGE ZIP LOG BAG) to not attract dirt or hair; I have a box with all my waxing needs and store it in a safe place until i need it.</li>
            <li> ITS A GOOD IDEA TO BUY IN THIS BUNDLE, IF YOU ARE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT WAXES ALL THE TIME AND EVEN IF YOUR NOT A  WAXER, THIS WILL LAST FOREVER.  THE QUALITY IS GOOD,</li>
            <li> I will buy again.  Works better then muslin strips.  Way less painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this roll for my home waxing needs. I can cut whatever size I need and this is much more economical.</li>
            <li> i just got it and use it once. is perfect i can cut whatever size i am gonna use.&lt;br /&gt;the wax works perfectly with the strip.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for all body waxing. Also since these are not pre cut you can cut it per your requirement.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my home wax kit. Nice fabric, very gentle on skin. Nice 3&amp;#34; wide strip and I can cut it to any length with a decent pair of scissors. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> thick, heavy duty strips. the wax does not bleed through the strip after single use. I am able to fold it and use the back side.</li>
            <li> This product has cut my waxing time practically in half! I love that I can cut the length and amount I want, which allows me to maximize the use of the strips. Excellent quality, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product fully met the expectations. Definitely would buy this again once running low. Works very well with home made waxes.</li>
