            <li>good razor, for the price it cant be beat.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad i did!</li>
            <li>Has a nice weight for shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this works much better for me.</li>
            <li>No cuts, good feeling and incredibly cheap.  </li>
            <li>I been using disposable razors most of  the time</li>
            <li>it works better with the one blade than those three layer ones.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it as a beginner razor, or maybe as a  spare, or a travel razor if you have a better one.  </li>
            <li>I liked it very much</li>
            <li>good razor love to get back to what i started shaving with many years ago.</li>
            <li>The threads that screw the 3 pieces together function fine with now threading issues.</li>
            <li>The metal is cheap but machined to a good enough quality that it functions well.</li>
            <li>Four stars because the price was not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The razor was about $3.00 and the blades for it are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Its a good product for very little money I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>He cut himself a few times getting used to it LOL</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and the replacement blades are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>and they get messed up on the first use..</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The razor is somewhat small for large hands but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Too much aggressive for my skin</li>
            <li>it arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Easy to unscrew to replace the razor and hasn&#x27;t rusted despite being left in the shower constantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but is extremely sturdy and feels well made.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say if you are buying these you are most likely on a budget, or giving wet shaving a try.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well it performed.</li>
            <li>When the blade is old, I open it a little (like an adjustment) and the shave is more aggressive.</li>
            <li>I have Mercury Razor Shaver which costs near 40$.</li>
            <li>Good for travel, camping, and any place you want to shave without worrying about damaging your expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>Time will tell how long this little cheap special will last but for its price and for what I expected, it works.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not sharp anymore.</li>
            <li>The light weight makes them hard to shave with, you are trying to do the work, not letting the razor do the work.</li>

            <li> I been using disposable razors most of  the time and they get messed up on the first use.. I&#x27;m glad I found this bad boy,  it works better with the one blade than those three layer ones. At least for me. The razor was about $3.00 and the blades for it are pretty cheap. Im gonna update this in a couple of months to see what happens as for now I liked it very much</li>
            <li> good razor, for the price it cant be beat. I would recommend this as an introduction to a double edge.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Easy to unscrew to replace the razor and hasn&#x27;t rusted despite being left in the shower constantly.</li>
            <li> Four stars because the price was not bad at all. Product was as described but not very high quality, which I expected. I wanted to try this style of razor so it served its purpose and I&#x27;ve no major complaints.</li>
            <li> Its a good product for very little money I am satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone else</li>
            <li> I like this item a lot.  However I gave it a rating of 4 Stars because it does not have the blade adjusting dial on it and the head unscrews entirely from the handle.  With the cost of shaving going up for the newer single blade razors, it was time for me to revert back to the old days razor at a much cheaper price of blades and still be the same if not better results.  I still will recommend this razor to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Review of the razor as sold through niceEshop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor for this price.  Nothing was bent or broken on arrival.  Has a nice weight for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in 14 days from China.</li>
            <li> took forever and a day to get here, but it got here, it was inexpensive and does the job.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job well I like it now I just need to switch blade it&#x27;s not sharp anymore.</li>
            <li> it is fine, can&#x27;t screw up old school....cheaper than the stupid disposable ones!!!</li>
            <li> Too much aggressive for my skin</li>
            <li> I first learned how to shave on a razor like this and ordered this because all the blade replacements of the disposable kind are outrageously priced these days... You can&#x27;t beat the classics!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well it performed. Great weight, great price, and it arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using one of these razors, the price was right on this model so i purchased it and I am so glad i did! I will never go back to a conventional razor again. Try a safety razor and feel the difference in your shave and your wallet.</li>
            <li> good razor love to get back to what i started shaving with many years ago.</li>
            <li> Hubby likes the razor. He cut himself a few times getting used to it LOL</li>
            <li> I have Mercury Razor Shaver which costs near 40$. Surprisingly this works much better for me. No cuts, good feeling and incredibly cheap.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these for under $6. Let&#x27;s just say if you are buying these you are most likely on a budget, or giving wet shaving a try. These are $3 specials. The metal is cheap but machined to a good enough quality that it functions well. There are some minor scratches in the finish on the head and plate but you&#x27;re not spending a fortune now.  I like the space between the safety bar and he head. It&#x27;s wide enough and has 4 holes through the plate that allow spent foam and stubble to wash through without getting stuck or clogged up. The threads that screw the 3 pieces together function fine with now threading issues. Time will tell how long this little cheap special will last but for its price and for what I expected, it works. Good for travel, camping, and any place you want to shave without worrying about damaging your expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> If you buy into the infomercials at night with an overweight pawn dealer selling razors this is for you. I bought these as X-Mas gift for a few people to turn them onto traditional safety razor shaving. I turned them all onto updating their tetanus shots. The light weight makes them hard to shave with, you are trying to do the work, not letting the razor do the work. They are also very short and therefore harder to control.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a beginner razor, or maybe as a  spare, or a travel razor if you have a better one.  Just remember to keep the screw lubed (petroleum jelly works well) and that it is basically disposable.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try it, because of the thousands of shavers to choose from had no idea if I would like it or not so why spend a lot of money. Best shaver I ever used. The replacement mechanism is a little different from the traditional hinge open screw types, but I happen to prefer it. When the blade is old, I open it a little (like an adjustment) and the shave is more aggressive.</li>
            <li> I received my razor in about a week  The razor is somewhat small for large hands but it does a good job.  ..kinda nostalgic. I will definitely order a butterfly double edge for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> Rather than buy Gillette mach 3 or other various razors, buy one of these.  The shave is smooth and the replacement blades are very inexpensive.  I would say around 10 cents a piece.</li>
            <li> Really simple and not much to say about. It works as described, and I have nothing bad to say about it. It&#x27;s cheap, but is extremely sturdy and feels well made. Well balanced too.</li>
            <li> Pulled my hair while shaving poor quality product</li>
