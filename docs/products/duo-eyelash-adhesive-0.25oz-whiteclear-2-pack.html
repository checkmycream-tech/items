            <li>not as good as they recommended</li>
            <li>To get any remaining adhesive off your face, a good make up remover</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work good</li>
            <li>This adhesive is so easy to apply!!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love!!!!!,</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product, does everything the company said it would do.  </li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and i must say, it works amazing.</li>
            <li>nice and sticky..easy to use..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll never know until I have my own make- up artist.</li>
            <li>By far the best lash glue out there!!!!!</li>
            <li>clear cleans up the best..</li>
            <li>I love this glue, it helps my lashes stay on all day.</li>
            <li>It is almost magic.</li>
            <li>My mother and my sister also want to have one pair, now I will purchase more...</li>
            <li>I will for sure be getting more from here.</li>
            <li>One of the better lash adhesives.</li>
            <li>My niece love it</li>
            <li>It worked okay...</li>
            <li>JUST MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>glad i got the two packaged deal</li>
            <li>All in all, I love this eye lash glue</li>
            <li>I love it and probably going to stick with it.</li>
            <li>I am definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This product is great, It lasted the whole 24hrs if not longer even slept with them in and did not fall off</li>
            <li>My favorite lash glue... really easy to use package,</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t, try a light skin safe oil or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and very shining.</li>
            <li>really good and fast shipping they also have 2 products together</li>
            <li>Very rarely do I have to put eyeliner on top to hide the glue on the lashband.</li>
            <li>Works fine for what it&#x27;s purpose is.</li>
            <li>Liked real well,packaging a bit smashed,but product was not damaged.</li>
            <li>was happy with the quality of this product, but would definitely go with waterproof if you anticipate any allergies/tears/extreme laughing.</li>
            <li>but the glue does stick the eyelashes really good they did last all day.</li>
            <li>While easy to apply and fast to dry, I felt like this adhesive did a good job of staying, but didn&#x27;t stick as strong as the Ardell glue.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly, but as I said not too quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for good eyelash glues for a long time</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot of glue to get a strong hold.</li>
            <li>It works perfect and last all day long for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that the glue is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have the same kind</li>
            <li>adhesive definitely dries clear - something that is great for those who are a bit heavy-handed/clumsy when putting on lashes (like me).</li>
            <li>Love the way that it dries completely clear.  </li>
            <li>Have been wearing false eyelashes for years and this is the best adhesive I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Oh, and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>she was using it right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a one star since it was delivered super fast.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how easy it was to apply.</li>
            <li>i ordered this because of the great reviews i tried it 3 times but it only lasted for one day, i was using hair glue prior to this and that last for more then a week probably even longer</li>
            <li>They were fast and they work just as well as the ones I had bought form stores, but much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>It takes a little while for it to set, which is good if you need to make adjustments when it&#x27;s already on.</li>
            <li>After viewing many tutorials and reading the reviews for this prdoduct, I finally had the opportunity to get my hands on Duo</li>
            <li>Simply apply a small amount to your lash strip, give it a couple of seconds to get tacky and the lash applies perfectly.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had hoped for in an eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I ever purchased this eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>I used this on someone else for the first time a couple months ago</li>
            <li>, this is the first time that it happened to me</li>
            <li>prefer this to spirit gum for small accents because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, and it&#x27;s safe for around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and better than the dark tone.</li>
            <li>Very Durable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best adhesive on the market for artificial lashes.</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>It does not hold very well.</li>
            <li>The glue in 3 days fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other glues that held better under the circumstances.</li>
            <li>Peel the adhesive off the rhinestones, clean the rhinestones well, and put them away until next time.</li>
            <li>this is the one to get because it doesn&#x27;t take long to get tacky and it works quickly!</li>
            <li>i would strongly advise anyone to use a brush applicator to put the glue onto your precious false lashes.</li>
            <li>nice small tip</li>
            <li>so you can use it for individual lashes or for full.</li>
            <li>EASY TO APPLY IF YOU READ DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li>I am new to lashes</li>
            <li>Both of the tubes were very old and watery....</li>
            <li>I got a 2 adhesives for 3 dollars more than what i would usually buy for just 1</li>
            <li>Easy to apply to lash and holds firmly.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S TACKY BEFORE APPLYING THE EYELASHES if not it WILL MAKE A HUGE MESS on your eyelid.</li>
            <li>I always use this glue for my face, it dries clear stays on all day, and works for gems too.</li>
            <li>Duo goes on clear and as it dries it blends with your skin tone...</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and it dries clear</li>
            <li>I had/have no problem with it not drying clear for me.</li>
            <li>it becomes clear.</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE NOT HAD ANY LOSS OF MY NATURAL LASHES.</li>
            <li>so I can go natural</li>
            <li>The only downside was the glue was very liquid.</li>
            <li>And I will say, yes the glue IS indeed white right out of the tube, but it does dry clear.</li>
            <li>I get the white which turns to clear.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to a anyone who needs the glue to dry clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very forgiving unlike black adhesives.</li>
            <li>be careful not to squeeze too much out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Adhesive lasts long.</li>
            <li>On the flip side, Ardell glue is also very difficult for me to get off my eyes; this glue came off my eyelids pretty easily and comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>

            <li> Dries clear, and doesn&#x27;t get tacky like some other types of adhesive.  </li>
            <li> What I do though just to be safe, I use a thin lip brush or toothpick and CAREFULLY, as you don&#x27;t want to get this glue in your eye, run a little glue along the lash strip after it&#x27;s already on.</li>
            <li> I almost refuse to use other glues only because I have always had this glue work.</li>
            <li> not good enough,and it said clear the one I receive is white...</li>
            <li> black eyelashes with white glue?</li>
            <li> I cant say if the glue truly works as reviewed by others because it made such a mess of my lashes</li>
            <li> However they were not a fast delivery...</li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Never ever had a problem with them falling off, yet still really easy to remove without damaging your real lashes unlike a lot of the other types that are like terrible rubber cement!</li>
            <li> Really only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> It has never let me down.</li>
            <li> and I must say other lash adhesives just don&#x27;t compare to DUO!</li>
            <li> But to speed it up, I put a dab on a post-it or piece of paper while I do my other make-up or my hair, and let it get a little tacky before I apply it to the lash strip.</li>
            <li> but anything longer is not healthy for your eyes, my reason for switching is cause you tend to loose eye lashes..</li>
            <li> They also have black but any mistakes are not forgiving in the black.</li>
            <li> I like the dark for fake eyelashes, but I use the clear for adhering crystals and other accents around my eyes or my daughter&#x27;s eyes for costumes.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> Sorry folks...it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter whether I buy a clear product or the one with color.  </li>
            <li> apply rhinestone accents, you put a bit of the glue on the accent, give it a couple seconds to get tacky, then press and hold it in place for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing false eyelashes again.</li>
            <li> Let me say that the two times i have attempted to use this it has made a mess!</li>
            <li> like glueing little rhinestone stuff on my face during festivities..which btw is everyday here in Las Vegas!!..</li>
            <li> Omg in my surprise the glue is small</li>
            <li> I purchased this adhesive because of the high reviews, and it is absolutely worthless.</li>

            <li> This adhesive is so easy to apply!! Helps keeps my eyelashes from falling off! Lol</li>
            <li> The best lash glue ever!</li>
            <li> My favorite lash glue... really easy to use package, nice small tip so you can use it for individual lashes or for full. Never ever had a problem with them falling off, yet still really easy to remove without damaging your real lashes unlike a lot of the other types that are like terrible rubber cement!</li>
            <li> Does not work. I purchased this adhesive because of the high reviews, and it is absolutely worthless. Worst eyelash adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used. Or rather, tried to use. It doesn&#x27;t even get tacky enough for lashes to stick on.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS GLUE DAILY AND I HAVE NOT HAD ANY LOSS OF MY NATURAL LASHES. EASY TO APPLY IF YOU READ DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> I love this glue, it helps my lashes stay on all day. Very rarely do I have to put eyeliner on top to hide the glue on the lashband.</li>
            <li> not as good as they recommended</li>
            <li> Very good glue for lashes.  Dries clear, and doesn&#x27;t get tacky like some other types of adhesive.  Really only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!!!!!, Very Durable And Very Easy To Work With! Also Great Price For Two Packages! A Must Buy!</li>
            <li> By far the best lash glue out there!!!!! Stays on until you take it off!!! Which is def what you want!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product, does everything the company said it would do.  Have been wearing false eyelashes for years and this is the best adhesive I have ever used!  Great company to deal with.  Would definately buy from them again!</li>
            <li> Works fine for what it&#x27;s purpose is.</li>
            <li> Duo eyelash adhesive is one of the easiest kinds to find and it&#x27;s inexpensive and very popular. I like the dark for fake eyelashes, but I use the clear for adhering crystals and other accents around my eyes or my daughter&#x27;s eyes for costumes.&lt;br /&gt;To apply rhinestone accents, you put a bit of the glue on the accent, give it a couple seconds to get tacky, then press and hold it in place for a few seconds. It will stay on until you remove it. Peel the adhesive off the rhinestones, clean the rhinestones well, and put them away until next time. To get any remaining adhesive off your face, a good make up remover does the trick for me. If that doesn&#x27;t, try a light skin safe oil or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this to spirit gum for small accents because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, and it&#x27;s safe for around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> My go to lash adhesive! I trust Duo implicitly. It has never let me down. It is almost magic. I love it!</li>
            <li> everybody knows this brand..nice and sticky..easy to use..clear cleans up the best..i use it for all sorts of stuff besides eyelashes..like glueing little rhinestone stuff on my face during festivities..which btw is everyday here in Las Vegas!!..lol..</li>
            <li> Liked real well,packaging a bit smashed,but product was not damaged. Would recommend this product to a anyone who needs the glue to dry clear.</li>
            <li> Let me say that the two times i have attempted to use this it has made a mess! i would strongly advise anyone to use a brush applicator to put the glue onto your precious false lashes. I cant say if the glue truly works as reviewed by others because it made such a mess of my lashes i had to throw them out. I will try applying the glue to a applicator brush and then to my next pair of falsies and repost what the outcome was. For now, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> not good enough,and it said clear the one I receive is white...black eyelashes with white glue? make no sense&lt;br /&gt;I never going to order this brand</li>
            <li> They were fast and they work just as well as the ones I had bought form stores, but much cheaper!! However they were not a fast delivery...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best adhesive on the market for artificial lashes. I&#x27;ve tried others and they burn my eyes or don&#x27;t stay on well. I get the white which turns to clear. They also have black but any mistakes are not forgiving in the black.</li>
            <li> Works great, absolutely love this glue and wouldn&#x27;t use another brand.</li>
            <li> I always use this glue for my face, it dries clear stays on all day, and works for gems too. I almost refuse to use other glues only because I have always had this glue work.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 days of outdoor carnival with medium lashes. Worked very well.</li>
            <li> perfect glue for falsies</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and very shining. My mother and my sister also want to have one pair, now I will purchase more...</li>
            <li> I got a 2 adhesives for 3 dollars more than what i would usually buy for just 1 &amp; it&#x27;s WATERPROOF. I loveeee. I will for sure be getting more from here.</li>
            <li> After viewing many tutorials and reading the reviews for this prdoduct, I finally had the opportunity to get my hands on Duo and I must say other lash adhesives just don&#x27;t compare to DUO! Duo goes on clear and as it dries it blends with your skin tone...so no worries there. It&#x27;s very forgiving unlike black adhesives. Simply apply a small amount to your lash strip, give it a couple of seconds to get tacky and the lash applies perfectly. And when I say it adheres...it adheres! I will NEVER try another lash adhesive...I&#x27;m sold on Duo!</li>
            <li> I ordered the dual Duo adhesive because it was supposed to be the waterproof one. I received the order and this is not the one that I have ordered. This item is cheaper at Walmart. Not satisfied at all!!! I am going to return this garbage tomorrow. I have the same kind and it doesn&#x27;t work good, why will I buy things that I knew not good at all? I&#x27;m giving it a one star since it was delivered super fast.</li>
            <li> I use fake lashes a lot and usually go with the glue that comes with the Ardell lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This adhesive definitely dries clear - something that is great for those who are a bit heavy-handed/clumsy when putting on lashes (like me). While easy to apply and fast to dry, I felt like this adhesive did a good job of staying, but didn&#x27;t stick as strong as the Ardell glue. On the flip side, Ardell glue is also very difficult for me to get off my eyes; this glue came off my eyelids pretty easily and comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to note - I didn&#x27;t anticipate it, but I got teary-eyed during my night out (didn&#x27;t actually cry) and the adhesive started peeling from the inside corner. I&#x27;ve used other glues that held better under the circumstances. Besides that, it had stayed.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the quality of this product, but would definitely go with waterproof if you anticipate any allergies/tears/extreme laughing.</li>
            <li> One of the better lash adhesives. Love the way that it dries completely clear.  Easy to apply to lash and holds firmly.</li>
            <li> really good and fast shipping they also have 2 products together which is great My niece love it she was using it right away</li>
            <li> It worked okay... it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had hoped for in an eyelash glue. It does not hold very well.</li>
            <li> The glue in 3 days fast shipping. It was the first time I ever purchased this eyelash glue. Omg in my surprise the glue is small but I guess the videos where I seen it they looked bigger but its not a big deal but the glue does stick the eyelashes really good they did last all day. JUST MAKE SURE IT&#x27;S TACKY BEFORE APPLYING THE EYELASHES if not it WILL MAKE A HUGE MESS on your eyelid.</li>
            <li> I used this to put rhinestones on my face for halloween and it worked perfectly and cleaned up nicely too.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use it all the time and it dries clear so I can go natural and you can&#x27;t notice the glue.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this purchase. Oh, and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works perfect. be careful not to squeeze too much out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Adhesive lasts long. Did not give me any rashes .. glad i got the two packaged deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for good eyelash glues for a long time but i came across this because everyone on youtube seems to be using it. I bought this one and i must say, it works amazing. The only downside was the glue was very liquid. Other than that the glue is amazing!</li>
            <li> Sorry folks...it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter whether I buy a clear product or the one with color.  I just can&#x27;t get the hang of applying lashes.  I have to rate it a 3 star out of fairness.  It may be the best product since sliced bread but I&#x27;ll never know until I have my own make- up artist.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing false eyelashes again. And I will say, yes the glue IS indeed white right out of the tube, but it does dry clear. I had/have no problem with it not drying clear for me. It takes a little while for it to set, which is good if you need to make adjustments when it&#x27;s already on. But to speed it up, I put a dab on a post-it or piece of paper while I do my other make-up or my hair, and let it get a little tacky before I apply it to the lash strip. You really don&#x27;t need a lot of glue to get a strong hold. What I do though just to be safe, I use a thin lip brush or toothpick and CAREFULLY, as you don&#x27;t want to get this glue in your eye, run a little glue along the lash strip after it&#x27;s already on. It dries fairly quickly, but as I said not too quick. All in all, I love this eye lash glue, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It works perfect and last all day long for me. I love it and probably going to stick with it.</li>
            <li> I used this on someone else for the first time a couple months ago and I was surprised at how easy it was to apply. It dries quickly and better than the dark tone. If you&#x27;re in a hurry this is the one to get because it doesn&#x27;t take long to get tacky and it works quickly!</li>
            <li> i ordered this because of the great reviews i tried it 3 times but it only lasted for one day, i was using hair glue prior to this and that last for more then a week probably even longer but anything longer is not healthy for your eyes, my reason for switching is cause you tend to loose eye lashes..i give this product a 3 star for its gentle on the eye lashes and once its dried it becomes clear.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time using DUO adhesive. I am new to lashes but I knew by going with this adhesive, I would not be disappointed. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase. Will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> The bride looked beautiful.</li>
            <li> i ordered this but the glue that arived is diffrent, i ordered DUO adhesive and i got Ardell lash grip, this is the first time that it happened to me so i don&#x27;t know what to do?</li>
            <li> Both of the tubes were very old and watery....they had to be thrown out.....very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the glue was a lot smaller than i thought but it has lasted.&lt;br /&gt;a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This product is great, It lasted the whole 24hrs if not longer even slept with them in and did not fall off</li>
