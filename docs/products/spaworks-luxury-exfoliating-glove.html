            <li>Great cheap glove I used it on my face and my body</li>
            <li>Nice loofah glove.</li>
            <li>Instead of having to change hands to wash each side of your both, you should consider getting one Korean Bath Mitt for each hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received compensation in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>â€œI received this product in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li>I find for me that I still like to use the shower sponge to get a good lather and do some more vigorous scrubbing, then follow up with this exfoliating mitt.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this on a product promotion to test it to see how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;These would make a nice gift for Birthdays or holidays.</li>
            <li>more effective than poufs and loofahs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use a self tanning product you need to exfoliate prior to use, and these spa mitts are perfect for your pre-tan scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I able to use it all over my body with ease.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing to use it for is on my arms.</li>
            <li>I also like that it has a loop on the end, so that I am able to hang it up once I am done.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this exfoliating bath mitt.</li>
            <li>Glad I read the reviews that helped me with my purchase.</li>
            <li>LOVE the way my skin looks and feels since I have been using it.  </li>
            <li>am extremely pleased with this Exfoliating Bath Mitt and giving it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work ok,</li>
            <li>I love how these mitts work.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift to be able to share my experiences while reviewing this product.</li>
            <li>It is easy to get on and off your hand and be able to wash your face with it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m always interested in finding new ways to keep my skin clean and healthy, so I was really happy to have a chance to get this through a promotion in order to provide an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to rinse all the soap out</li>
            <li>It fit my hand well and even had room to spare.</li>
            <li>but if it was softer I don&#x27;t feel like it would get my face as clean as what it does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that there is a sturdy loop attached, so it&#x27;s very easy to hang up to dry on one of the hooks of my shower</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job of getting off the dead skin cells, leaving soft and smooth clean skin in their place!  </li>
            <li>When this mit arrived I was incredibly dismayed at the cheap quality it was in comparison to the &amp;#34;Hammam glove by Kae&amp;#34; that I had purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>It also dries fairly quickly as well.</li>
            <li>When I first took this out of the package I didn&#x27;t think it seemed like it would be anything special.  </li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I also have found use for it on my neck and shoulders and my legs while using a body scrub this can be used on sensitive skin as it is not as abrasive as most cleansing products out there.</li>
            <li>It actually feels really good to scrub gently with the mitt all over my body.  </li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li>I use my normal face wash on this glove and noticed that the glove really lathers up my face wash nicely, better than what a washcloth does.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really gets my pores clean and my face looks cleaner.</li>
            <li>and I love the little loop to be able to hang it up on my shower curtain rings.</li>
            <li>I got compliments after first use</li>
            <li>Not only will your skin look radiate after you use your Korean Bath Mitt, but it will make your skin more youthful looking while improving circulation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying adding this into my regular shower routine.  </li>
            <li>The gloves stays put and does a good job at removing my dead skin.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, and this glove combined with some body scrub is the perfect combination at getting all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li>Works very well and a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>mitt itself is nicely made - the elastic cuff is thick and does a good job of keeping the mitt on my hand, even when wet.  </li>
            <li>I was initially put off because it seems very light weight and almost soft</li>
            <li>That really helps if I am using the glove to exfoliate my body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The elastic band holds it in place really well, which allows me to exfoliate every bit of my body that is within arm&#x27;s reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to bring all those hairs to attention right before your shave them gone.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if your looking for a quality made exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Simply add this to a basket with other bath essentials and you have a nice gift.</li>
            <li>I love this Exfoliating glove, I keep mine in the shower and each day I place a little bit of cleanser inside the mit, work it into a lather and begin to rub in circular movements.</li>
            <li>Better yet, you might want to replace your Korean Bath Mitt every few months.  </li>
            <li>received a sample in exchange for testing and offering my unbiased review and I can honestly say that I will never own a nylon scrubbie again!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fabric is too thin to do any good.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure that the shower is hot enough so that the glove takes off the dead skin.</li>
            <li>This Hammam Bath Mitt is my new go to Exfoliating product when I take my showers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels so soft and looks so soft and clear.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after using this mitt.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft after using it and I could tell it exfoliated my skin.</li>
            <li>With just one use of this bath mitt so much of the dry flaky has been asked away leaving my skin looking shiny and new again.</li>
            <li>The texture is rough, but not uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft but has just the right amount of texture to remove makeup or dead skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can see in the photos both my hand in the mitt and just holding onto to give clear idea of how big it is.  </li>
            <li>When you want to polish your skin, but don&#x27;t want to use a rough salt scrub, you really want to use the Luxury Exfoliating Korean Bath Mitt.  </li>
            <li>in other words it doesn&#x27;t have the texture that would make you think it would really exfoliate your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive for a loofah, but it feels very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>glove even has a hoop to allow me to hang it so that it can dry completely, which keeps bacteria from forming.</li>

            <li> haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to know how well it will work to reduce the dimples in my thighs, but I am hopeful that with continued use I will see a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> so with this Exfoliating Hammam Bath Mitt!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thin and flexible and a little of my body wash goes a long way, as it remains on the surface and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I especially like to use the glove around my nose where my dry and dead skin is the worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel rough or anything...</li>
            <li> Seriously my skin feels so soft when I use this to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> As the dead skin flows down the drain, your skin is left looking fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;It has a little loop to hang it up after you used it so that it can dry.  </li>
            <li> I also am a fan of the little hook to hang it up in the shower or bath after using so it can dry out.</li>
            <li> If you have a large hand, you might find it difficult to get it into your Korean Bath Mitt.  </li>
            <li> have been using a nylon scrubbie and found that a lot of the body wash would get lost in the folds and end up down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>

            <li> I typically use a synthetic shower sponge to lather up with liquid bath soap.  </li>
            <li> This is where I have gotten off a lot of my dead skin, and in return I am a lot less itchy.</li>
            <li> I would prefer if it would be a little softer than what it is</li>

            <li> It looks like it can be washed in the washer periodically to disinfect it, however, I&#x27;m not sure that I would put it in the dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sktrendz even designed it with a small fabric loop</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so there is plenty of extra room in the mitt, but not so much as to be awkward.  </li>
            <li> I was really wrong (and I hate admitting that)!  </li>

            <li> Removes dry / dead skin and makeup completely from my face. I use my normal face wash on this glove and noticed that the glove really lathers up my face wash nicely, better than what a washcloth does. I like that the glove has a stretchy elastic part that holds snugly onto my wrist. That really helps if I am using the glove to exfoliate my body. The gloves stays put and does a good job at removing my dead skin. I especially like to use the glove around my nose where my dry and dead skin is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove even has a hoop to allow me to hang it so that it can dry completely, which keeps bacteria from forming. I like the feel of the glove against my skin..it&#x27;s soft but has just the right amount of texture to remove makeup or dead skin. I was provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Nice loofah glove. It feels very nice. Just make sure that the shower is hot enough so that the glove takes off the dead skin. It&#x27;s a little expensive for a loofah, but it feels very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you use a self tanning product you need to exfoliate prior to use, and these spa mitts are perfect for your pre-tan scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in dry climates or dry indoor air, this will prep your skin so that any lotion or oil can seep into your parched skin.&lt;br /&gt; Added benefit...small circular massaging might help keep cellulite at bay for some women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, after about 2 weeks I noticed smoother thighs with less dimpling.&lt;br /&gt;Much more effective than poufs and loofahs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

            <li> I absolutely love this exfoliating glove! I have really dry skin, and this glove combined with some body scrub is the perfect combination at getting all the dead skin off. I able to use it all over my body with ease. It also dries fairly quickly as well. My favorite thing to use it for is on my arms. This is where I have gotten off a lot of my dead skin, and in return I am a lot less itchy. I also like that it has a loop on the end, so that I am able to hang it up once I am done. I would highly recommend this product if your looking for a quality made exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this exfoliating bath mitt. My skin has been extremely dry and flaky over the past couple months from the winter weather. With just one use of this bath mitt so much of the dry flaky has been asked away leaving my skin looking shiny and new again. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Loves the way the skin gets exfoliated...so smooth...and skin absorbs lotion....gets rid of all the dead skins</li>
            <li> Just as the reviewers said it would be! My skin is so soft after using this mitt. Glad I read the reviews that helped me with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been missing out until now. Best investment for clean smooth skin!</li>
            <li> When this mit arrived I was incredibly dismayed at the cheap quality it was in comparison to the &amp;#34;Hammam glove by Kae&amp;#34; that I had purchased in the past. I was not ordering to replace my other mit, but to get another one for my yoga bag.  The Spaworks glove is cheap material that will never exfoliate like my Kae gloves does!! There is no comparison in the quality and the function.</li>
            <li> Fabric is too thin to do any good.  Threw it out after 5 or 6 uses.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft! I got compliments after first use</li>
            <li> When you want to polish your skin, but don&#x27;t want to use a rough salt scrub, you really want to use the Luxury Exfoliating Korean Bath Mitt.  Gentle enough to use every day, but exfoliating enough to slough off dull-looking dead skin.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  Just slip your hand into the Korean Bath Mitt, add some soap, and rub away on your arms, legs, neck, back, and all over your body.  As the dead skin flows down the drain, your skin is left looking fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash away the oil and grease that causes blackheads and acne.  Loosen ingrown hair and prevent blemishes.  Get a super-close shave when you use the Korean Bath Mitt before you shave under your arms, your legs, and even before your man shaves his face.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to bring all those hairs to attention right before your shave them gone.  Not only will your skin look radiate after you use your Korean Bath Mitt, but it will make your skin more youthful looking while improving circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a little loop to hang it up after you used it so that it can dry.  It looks like it can be washed in the washer periodically to disinfect it, however, I&#x27;m not sure that I would put it in the dryer.  Better yet, you might want to replace your Korean Bath Mitt every few months.  If you have a large hand, you might find it difficult to get it into your Korean Bath Mitt.  Instead of having to change hands to wash each side of your both, you should consider getting one Korean Bath Mitt for each hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received compensation in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This Hammam Bath Mitt is my new go to Exfoliating product when I take my showers!&lt;br /&gt;The elastic band holds it in place really well, which allows me to exfoliate every bit of my body that is within arm&#x27;s reach.&lt;br /&gt;Sktrendz even designed it with a small fabric loop so I can hang on my towel bar with a shower hook to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a nylon scrubbie and found that a lot of the body wash would get lost in the folds and end up down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;Not so with this Exfoliating Hammam Bath Mitt!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thin and flexible and a little of my body wash goes a long way, as it remains on the surface and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;I never realized how much dead skin was remaining on my skin until I used this mitt!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the way my skin looks and feels since I have been using it.  My skin is soft, smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to know how well it will work to reduce the dimples in my thighs, but I am hopeful that with continued use I will see a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample in exchange for testing and offering my unbiased review and I can honestly say that I will never own a nylon scrubbie again!&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this Exfoliating Bath Mitt and giving it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look and feel ahhhhhhh-mazing!  Seriously my skin feels so soft when I use this to exfoliate.  When I first took this out of the package I didn&#x27;t think it seemed like it would be anything special.  It doesn&#x27;t feel rough or anything...in other words it doesn&#x27;t have the texture that would make you think it would really exfoliate your skin.  Wow!  I was really wrong (and I hate admitting that)!  You can use this on your body or face and it is great for exfoliating after using self-tanners.  This is the best exfoliating glove/cloth I have ever used...hands down!&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for examination and review.</li>
            <li> I love this Exfoliating glove, I keep mine in the shower and each day I place a little bit of cleanser inside the mit, work it into a lather and begin to rub in circular movements. I also have found use for it on my neck and shoulders and my legs while using a body scrub this can be used on sensitive skin as it is not as abrasive as most cleansing products out there. Plus you don&#x27;t need any fancy attachments or batteries! â€œI received this product in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> Works wonders! I was initially put off because it seems very light weight and almost soft but once you use it it works perfectly at exfoliating!</li>
            <li> Great cheap glove I used it on my face and my body</li>
            <li> I typically use a synthetic shower sponge to lather up with liquid bath soap.  I&#x27;ve been doing that for years and it seems to work ok, but I&#x27;m always interested in finding new ways to keep my skin clean and healthy, so I was really happy to have a chance to get this through a promotion in order to provide an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mitt itself is nicely made - the elastic cuff is thick and does a good job of keeping the mitt on my hand, even when wet.  I&#x27;m really enjoying adding this into my regular shower routine.  I find for me that I still like to use the shower sponge to get a good lather and do some more vigorous scrubbing, then follow up with this exfoliating mitt.  The texture is rough, but not uncomfortably so.  It actually feels really good to scrub gently with the mitt all over my body.  It does a wonderful job of getting off the dead skin cells, leaving soft and smooth clean skin in their place!  It&#x27;s nice that there is a sturdy loop attached, so it&#x27;s very easy to hang up to dry on one of the hooks of my shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see in the photos both my hand in the mitt and just holding onto to give clear idea of how big it is.  I have small hands, so there is plenty of extra room in the mitt, but not so much as to be awkward.  This will definitely be part of my cleansing routine from now on!</li>
            <li> Great premium exfoliating glove. I love how these mitts work. Your skin feels so soft and looks so soft and clear.I ordered this on a product promotion to test it to see how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;These would make a nice gift for Birthdays or holidays. Simply add this to a basket with other bath essentials and you have a nice gift.I also am a fan of the little hook to hang it up in the shower or bath after using so it can dry out.</li>
            <li> This is a great mitt. It is easy to get on and off your hand and be able to wash your face with it. I feel like it really gets my pores clean and my face looks cleaner. I would prefer if it would be a little softer than what it is but if it was softer I don&#x27;t feel like it would get my face as clean as what it does. This is easy to rinse all the soap out and I love the little loop to be able to hang it up on my shower curtain rings. I received this as a gift to be able to share my experiences while reviewing this product.</li>
            <li> I like this exfoliating glove. My skin felt soft after using it and I could tell it exfoliated my skin. I also like that it comes with a loop so it can hang dry. The only thing I worried about was it felt a little too thin to me so that is why I am giving it four stars and not five. It fit my hand well and even had room to spare. It does do what it was intended for. I bought this product with a discount and have been using it about every three days or so. I use it with my regular body wash. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Works very well and a reasonable price!</li>
