            <li>I am happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a win win situation.</li>
            <li>Best preventative aging trick ever :)</li>
            <li>And the good news is that you can use on any body part and in your hair also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a number of oils and butters from this vendor and all my orders have been of very good quality product, very fresh and arrive promptly.</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>Washes out easily, and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li>but the labeling is tricky, that&#x27;s how they are able to get by with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this oil</li>
            <li>Bought this to put onto my hair to make it look healthy.</li>
            <li>great product delivered fast and works better than anything on the marketing today.</li>
            <li>My hair loved it ;)</li>
            <li>I love this 4oz Argan Oil by dr. Adorable for about $15 total.</li>
            <li>The quality of this oil was very evident when I bought from another company.</li>
            <li>Really nice organic oil I can use on my entire body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very good to moisturize, reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark spots, rejuvenate my 50-ish very sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>As usual great products from the Doc</li>
            <li>A small dab on your hands pulled through your hair and great results.</li>
            <li>Fresh and unspoiled, it works very well in my skin care recipe.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these oils are the real deal!</li>
            <li>I store my products in the refrigerator and because they arrive very fresh, they stay fresh until I use the last drop.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that this is 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li>This oil must be very old.</li>
            <li>All this companies products come in clear plastic bottles.</li>
            <li>The other oils I got from this company didn&#x27;t smell right and there should be no smell.</li>
            <li>some Evening prime rose... and let&#x27;s just say they smell and act EXACTLY alike :(</li>

            <li> some Evening prime rose... and let&#x27;s just say they smell and act EXACTLY alike :(</li>
            <li> but when you touch it it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but feels soft and tight, and it has evened out my complexion in just four or five uses daily.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and, after reading other reviews, figured I would give it a try as a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> smells really funky &amp; it&#x27;s thick .</li>
            <li> I ordered two other types of oils from this seller and they all looked the same.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face because I have flaky dry skin and boy</li>
            <li> Well, I have been using it twice a day for a week and haven&#x27;t noticed a single change.</li>
            <li> it is too bad, too because I really had high hopes for an all-natural prodcut to be the one to help get rid of my sometimes flakey skin, but not this one.</li>
            <li> After ordering from other companies and speaking with other sellers this is a very bad practice and a good indication of lack of purity.</li>
            <li> Look for Argan and other oils that are in dark or glass bottles.</li>
            <li> Read label very carefully!</li>
            <li> This is truly the secret for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Smells like a dead fish.</li>
            <li> I looked at this bottle and judged it and said, this might not be pure at all and therefore not good at all, but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money, I&#x27;m not totally sure</li>
            <li> Usually this stuff is expensive.</li>
            <li> Wow... sooo disappointed :(</li>
            <li> The oil is not to bad itself , it&#x27;s just the fact that I  thought I was getting 100% argan oil</li>
            <li> No my hair dies NOT  like it.. :(</li>
            <li> hmmmm smh :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by the  misleading advertising!</li>
            <li> Feels nasty on the skin ; doesn&#x27;t absorb &amp; breaks me out horribly!</li>

            <li> Fresh and unspoiled, it works very well in my skin care recipe.</li>
            <li> I looked at this bottle and judged it and said, this might not be pure at all and therefore not good at all, but I was so wrong. I love this 4oz Argan Oil by dr. Adorable for about $15 total. I use it on my face because I have flaky dry skin and boy does it make my face look like it&#x27;s glowing but when you touch it it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but feels soft and tight, and it has evened out my complexion in just four or five uses daily. This is truly the secret for younger looking skin. I am happy. And the good news is that you can use on any body part and in your hair also. It&#x27;s a win win situation.</li>
            <li> Read label very carefully! This is 100% oil but not 100% Argan oil ! I was very disappointed by the  misleading advertising! The oil is not to bad itself , it&#x27;s just the fact that I  thought I was getting 100% argan oil but the labeling is tricky, that&#x27;s how they are able to get by with it. Don&#x27;t waste you money, I&#x27;m not totally sure but I think this seems to be mixed with olive oil.</li>
            <li> All this companies products come in clear plastic bottles. After ordering from other companies and speaking with other sellers this is a very bad practice and a good indication of lack of purity. The other oils I got from this company didn&#x27;t smell right and there should be no smell. I was also never contacted back and it is 4 months later. Look for Argan and other oils that are in dark or glass bottles. The quality of this oil was very evident when I bought from another company.</li>
            <li> Really nice organic oil I can use on my entire body. I use this product from scalp to toes in lotions and creams I make at home. It&#x27;s been very good to moisturize, reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark spots, rejuvenate my 50-ish very sensitive skin.    I&#x27;ve ordered a number of oils and butters from this vendor and all my orders have been of very good quality product, very fresh and arrive promptly. I only wish they could come in glass v. plastic but that would also increase the price and shipping costs.    I store my products in the refrigerator and because they arrive very fresh, they stay fresh until I use the last drop.</li>
            <li> As usual great products from the Doc</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil</li>
            <li> Well... if you follow my reviews you would have known.. that I gave another company an Awesome Review ;) My hair loved it ;) but... this Aragon oil.. No my hair dies NOT  like it.. :( you my have a different opinion than I... but my thoughts on this company changed... you see some time ago I&#x27;ve purchased some Evening prime rose... and let&#x27;s just say they smell and act EXACTLY alike :( hmmmm smh :( Wow... sooo disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I mix it with castor and olive oils for a hair mask. My hair absolutely loves it! Washes out easily, and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li> smells rancid. This oil must be very old. Smells like a dead fish.</li>
            <li> Bought this to put onto my hair to make it look healthy. A small dab on your hands pulled through your hair and great results.</li>
            <li> I like the non-greasy texture of this oil, but it is not accomplishing what I had hoped it would. I have dry, sensitive skin and, after reading other reviews, figured I would give it a try as a face moisturizer. Well, I have been using it twice a day for a week and haven&#x27;t noticed a single change. it is too bad, too because I really had high hopes for an all-natural prodcut to be the one to help get rid of my sometimes flakey skin, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Usually this stuff is expensive. I mix it 50/50 with grape seed oil for the shower. Best preventative aging trick ever :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these oils are the real deal! Will not buy again</li>
            <li> great product delivered fast and works better than anything on the marketing today. I would recommend this to anyone it is awesome</li>
            <li> smells really funky &amp; it&#x27;s thick . Feels nasty on the skin ; doesn&#x27;t absorb &amp; breaks me out horribly!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this is 100% pure oil. It had no smell at all. I purchased another type of Argan oil product and wanted to experience the oil without additives. I ordered two other types of oils from this seller and they all looked the same. I will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
