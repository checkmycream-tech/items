            <li>I love, love this fragrance never before has so many people, men &amp; women, stopped me to ask what I was wearing.  </li>
            <li>to spray and smells lovely still.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume. :)</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Upon arriving, the perfume was very strong smelling and not at all like the original.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use to fill my infuser (?)</li>
            <li>It smells a little woodsy and sweet, a great mix of good girl.  </li>
            <li>Love it, smells just like the original , price is just right ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>An incredibly unique fragrance; not cloying at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell right, too strong and wood smelling.</li>
            <li>I love the perfume and it is so economical because I don&#x27;t have to buy a new spray bottle every time I need a refill.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it and with the refill you are helping to save the planet</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, when I first tried it I thought whoa way too strong but after a bit it settles into the best scent I have tried.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
            <li>Sexy, mysterious, full of love and energy, tender and agresive at the same time.</li>
            <li>Makes much more sense to buy the refills given that this particular perfume is quite expensive, so I was super pleased!</li>
            <li>And to boot, I saved a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find a refill perfume for my favorite glass decanter and was thrilled when I found Thierry Mugler Womanity.  </li>
            <li>Wow, that&#x27;s a ton of pefume!  </li>
            <li>But was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The color of the perfume is yellow (whereas Womanity is pink) and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original.  </li>

            <li> this is a perfume i was searching for the years. Sexy, mysterious, full of love and energy, tender and agresive at the same time. try it.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells just like the original , price is just right ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> This perfume smells delightful! I was taken aback with the color but it lasts as long as the perfume that I&#x27;ve gotten from Saks. And to boot, I saved a whole lot of money. $$ Will definitely be back for my next refill.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell right, too strong and wood smelling. Purchased it, wore it once, and it&#x27;s been in my drawer ever since.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and fast shipping. Makes much more sense to buy the refills given that this particular perfume is quite expensive, so I was super pleased!</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever!! I get so many complements when I wear it!!</li>
            <li> Upon arriving, the perfume was very strong smelling and not at all like the original.  The color of the perfume is yellow (whereas Womanity is pink) and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original.  This is a fake perfume, not a refill of Womanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller promptly refunded me and said that &#x27;the perfume must have gone bad&#x27;.  I hope Amazon takes this seller off the site.</li>
            <li> I love, love this fragrance never before has so many people, men &amp; women, stopped me to ask what I was wearing.  It smells a little woodsy and sweet, a great mix of good girl.  A little goes a long way, when I first tried it I thought whoa way too strong but after a bit it settles into the best scent I have tried.  My only objection is it&#x27;s a bit pricy but it&#x27;s well worth it and with the refill you are helping to save the planet and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
            <li> An incredibly unique fragrance; not cloying at all.</li>
            <li> The package came as promised. The scent is fair.</li>
            <li> Wow, that&#x27;s a ton of pefume!  Easy to use to fill my infuser (?) to spray and smells lovely still.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical about purchasing. As others mentioned the color is off. But was pleasantly surprised. Smells WONDERFUL!  WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> cheaper than any department store, great product specially for a gift. item arrived in time with no problems I RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> A wonderful smell of erotic and sexy .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even smell like womanity nor was it the correct color.  It was yellow.  The perfume is pink in color.</li>
            <li> Great price. Smells good</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a refill perfume for my favorite glass decanter and was thrilled when I found Thierry Mugler Womanity.  I love the perfume and it is so economical because I don&#x27;t have to buy a new spray bottle every time I need a refill.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase perfume online again- my order was shipped from Fragrance.net  and I received fakes, a yellow substance of some sort and then had to go through all the steps to return. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I can&#x27;t imagine why it had been discontinued</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. :)</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this fragrance. It has a distinctive scent just like all Thierry Mugler collection.</li>
