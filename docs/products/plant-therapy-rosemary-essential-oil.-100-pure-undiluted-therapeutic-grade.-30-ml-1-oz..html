            <li>Satisfied with the product and the delivery</li>
            <li>Sooner the better</li>
            <li>Just started to use the product which felt good and useful.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get great EOs for reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Cannot drink it even when diluted according to the instructions I researched - rubbing on my hands and smelling it works better.</li>
            <li>I have been putting some drops into a tea light and it does scent her room nicely.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Rosemary.</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use this for hair growth!  </li>
            <li>The bottle has a dispenser top that makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I used to bleach and dye my hair, since I have stopped and started using rosemary on the ends I find my hair is becoming healthier.</li>
            <li>Rosemary is nice, and will probably use it as a mixture as I get more familiar with what the various oils are good for.  </li>
            <li>I use essential oils in my homemade cleaning supplies, so it was nice to find a 30ml bottle at a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and stimulating smell.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell to it and is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This stuff works fine.  </li>
            <li>Seems pure &amp; effective for me.</li>
            <li>Strong and fresh smell!</li>
            <li>My bottle of Plant Therapy Rosemary Essential Oil arrived promptly, and the price was great -</li>
            <li>I add this and a few others to Epsom salts to create an awesome bath salt.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, thanks guys.</li>
            <li>This is a great essential oil for the price.</li>
            <li>The bottle is filled, new, and it dispenses easily, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>It was one of my first &amp; favorites!!</li>
            <li>I bought rosemary and lemon oils to blend for a clean house smell.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the bottle came 20% more free</li>
            <li>I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this oil with great success in treating minor burns, rashes and insect bites.</li>
            <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>I hope others have found this true also .</li>
            <li>But ... not as great as other brands we have bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I quick added some rosemary which is antiseptic, antibacterial, anti fungal,</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping as usual, always very satisfied!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s my new favorite combo.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Yes your room might smell like a thanksgiving turkey but who cares, its all worth it.</li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased with.</li>
            <li>Very stimulating and refreshing though it might be too much for some people.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my hair, and I have to say the scent was a little strong, but nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plant Therapy has quickly become my favorite essential oil company, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>Item delivered on time, was as described, much stronger smell than I expected, use sparingly, good price too.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love the Rosemary essential oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several from Plant Therapy &amp; have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is a good essential oil to have in general for circulation and memory.</li>
            <li>This oil is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>Love the brand, its the only one I use now.</li>
            <li>Nice product, is as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased any other Rosemary oil, so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other, but it smells great to me!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Recieved product exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is so much stronger than just freshly cut rosemary.</li>
            <li>Love these essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I use five different ones and love them all.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quick and is high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it in conjunction with peppermint (in some carrieer oil) to rub on my shoulder for joint pain and it cured that right up almost completely too as well as get rid of a mild headache</li>
            <li>I add it to commercial shampoo, and have made my own natural shampoo with it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, Thanks!</li>
            <li>This product will last a good long time.</li>
            <li>It is pure and undiluted.  </li>
            <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li>Prices are very competitive.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Although the seal was not broken, it leaked somehow.</li>
            <li>Bought this based on its stress relieving properties, and it really works.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping no problems just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who wants to try Oils and hasn&#x27;t yet, should.</li>
            <li>This, mixed with an equal portion of peppermint turned out a really nice smelling soap.  </li>
            <li>Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available.</li>
            <li>It is authentic, but didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was half full.received it on time though.</li>
            <li>I got about twice the amount I would have been able to buy for the same price in a health food store, of a similar brand.</li>
            <li>Order 2 different essential oils and love them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil and this company.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>For other purposes, like inhaling to give you a mental lift in the afternoon, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>It may be too strong for some, but you can just dilute with water or other scents in another vessel.  </li>
            <li>They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well.</li>
            <li>so I have been putting a few drops into a qt.size  pan and heating on the stove top then putting a towel over and inhaling</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with the smell of rosemary.  </li>
            <li>I liven in New York City and this helps me deal with every day stress.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told it can also help clear your sinuses, which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be testing out in a few months as it gets colder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You only need a few drops in your warm bath and it melts the days cares away.</li>
            <li>The product is nice and strong-you only need few drops.</li>
            <li>I am just getting started with essential oils, and the synergy blends were my first ones.  </li>
            <li>After weeks of using the oild daily for various and sundry purposes, I still have most of the bottle left...</li>
            <li>and I was totally fine at the end of about an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering essential oils, but I could not be happier with the product.  </li>
            <li>It smelled a little sour but tasted good but even before I was halfway done I knew I had made an error.  </li>
            <li>I drive for my job, and received only positive comments about this from passengers.</li>
            <li>I use this old to burn in my MIL&#x27;s room, she has dementia.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it in homemade salve.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Whenever I talk about the benefits of essential oils with people and how much they have helped my family, I always stress that PT is our go-to brand.</li>
            <li>We really like Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other essential oils from Plant Therapy, and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I received this product half full.</li>
            <li>I just started down the aromatherapy road recently and rosemary is an important one to have.  </li>
            <li>And the quality seems right up there with the other major/pricier brands.  </li>
            <li>Really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Not only that this product is 100% pure essential oil.</li>
            <li>This was a new brand of essential oil for me.</li>
            <li>I diluted it according to the aromatherapy book guidelines and it seemed too strong, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Often the drops of these essential oils are too thick, and do not dispense easily.  </li>
            <li>My rosemary oil was delivered with a loose cap and some of the oil leaked out; the company replaced it with a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I use Rosemary mainly in my hair for its thickening properties as I have very thin, baby fine hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Love it,</li>
            <li> This rosemary oil smells like rosemary, not eucalyptus like so many others.</li>

            <li> Satisfied with the product and the delivery</li>
            <li> Sooner the better</li>
            <li> Just started to use the product which felt good and useful.</li>
            <li> Love that I can get great EOs for reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Cannot drink it even when diluted according to the instructions I researched - rubbing on my hands and smelling it works better.</li>
            <li> I have been putting some drops into a tea light and it does scent her room nicely.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Rosemary.</li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use this for hair growth!  </li>
            <li> The bottle has a dispenser top that makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used to bleach and dye my hair, since I have stopped and started using rosemary on the ends I find my hair is becoming healthier.</li>
            <li> Rosemary is nice, and will probably use it as a mixture as I get more familiar with what the various oils are good for.  </li>
            <li> I use essential oils in my homemade cleaning supplies, so it was nice to find a 30ml bottle at a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and stimulating smell.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell to it and is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fine.  </li>
            <li> Seems pure &amp; effective for me.</li>
            <li> Strong and fresh smell!</li>
            <li> My bottle of Plant Therapy Rosemary Essential Oil arrived promptly, and the price was great -</li>
            <li> I add this and a few others to Epsom salts to create an awesome bath salt.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, thanks guys.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil for the price.</li>
            <li> The bottle is filled, new, and it dispenses easily, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> It was one of my first &amp; favorites!!</li>
            <li> I bought rosemary and lemon oils to blend for a clean house smell.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the bottle came 20% more free</li>
            <li> I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil with great success in treating minor burns, rashes and insect bites.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> I hope others have found this true also .</li>
            <li> But ... not as great as other brands we have bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I quick added some rosemary which is antiseptic, antibacterial, anti fungal,</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping as usual, always very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s my new favorite combo.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my hair, and I have to say the scent was a little strong, but nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plant Therapy has quickly become my favorite essential oil company, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, much stronger smell than I expected, use sparingly, good price too.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several from Plant Therapy &amp; have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is a good essential oil to have in general for circulation and memory.</li>
            <li> This oil is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> Love the brand, its the only one I use now.</li>
            <li> Nice product, is as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased any other Rosemary oil, so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other, but it smells great to me!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Recieved product exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is so much stronger than just freshly cut rosemary.</li>
            <li> Love these essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I use five different ones and love them all.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quick and is high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it in conjunction with peppermint (in some carrieer oil) to rub on my shoulder for joint pain and it cured that right up almost completely too as well as get rid of a mild headache</li>
            <li> I add it to commercial shampoo, and have made my own natural shampoo with it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> It is pure and undiluted.  </li>
            <li> Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> Prices are very competitive.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Although the seal was not broken, it leaked somehow.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on its stress relieving properties, and it really works.  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping no problems just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who wants to try Oils and hasn&#x27;t yet, should.</li>
            <li> This, mixed with an equal portion of peppermint turned out a really nice smelling soap.  </li>
            <li> Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available.</li>
            <li> It is authentic, but didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was half full.received it on time though.</li>
            <li> I got about twice the amount I would have been able to buy for the same price in a health food store, of a similar brand.</li>
            <li> Order 2 different essential oils and love them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil and this company.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For other purposes, like inhaling to give you a mental lift in the afternoon, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> It may be too strong for some, but you can just dilute with water or other scents in another vessel.  </li>
            <li> They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well.</li>
            <li> so I have been putting a few drops into a qt.size  pan and heating on the stove top then putting a towel over and inhaling</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with the smell of rosemary.  </li>
            <li> I liven in New York City and this helps me deal with every day stress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told it can also help clear your sinuses, which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be testing out in a few months as it gets colder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops in your warm bath and it melts the days cares away.</li>
            <li> The product is nice and strong-you only need few drops.</li>
            <li> I am just getting started with essential oils, and the synergy blends were my first ones.  </li>
            <li> After weeks of using the oild daily for various and sundry purposes, I still have most of the bottle left...</li>
            <li> and I was totally fine at the end of about an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering essential oils, but I could not be happier with the product.  </li>
            <li> It smelled a little sour but tasted good but even before I was halfway done I knew I had made an error.  </li>
            <li> I drive for my job, and received only positive comments about this from passengers.</li>
            <li> I use this old to burn in my MIL&#x27;s room, she has dementia.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it in homemade salve.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Whenever I talk about the benefits of essential oils with people and how much they have helped my family, I always stress that PT is our go-to brand.</li>
            <li> We really like Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other essential oils from Plant Therapy, and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this product half full.</li>
            <li> I just started down the aromatherapy road recently and rosemary is an important one to have.  </li>
            <li> And the quality seems right up there with the other major/pricier brands.  </li>
            <li> Really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not only that this product is 100% pure essential oil.</li>
            <li> This was a new brand of essential oil for me.</li>
            <li> I diluted it according to the aromatherapy book guidelines and it seemed too strong, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Often the drops of these essential oils are too thick, and do not dispense easily.  </li>
            <li> My rosemary oil was delivered with a loose cap and some of the oil leaked out; the company replaced it with a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I use Rosemary mainly in my hair for its thickening properties as I have very thin, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product as with the other ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone wanting a quality long lasting essential oil!</li>
            <li> I use essential oils for cleaning, for clearning space of negative energy and bringing in positive energy, and for emotional uplifting.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m 50 and starting too loose some, got intrigued by it.&lt;br /&gt;cant say it did a big difference for my hair</li>
            <li> just a drop to about 24 oz and instead of spending the day holding onto the toilet bowl</li>
            <li> I inhale it deeply whenever I feel mentally sluggish.</li>
            <li> It also works well for minor skin irritations.  </li>
            <li> I had surgery a year and a half ago and one result was major hair loss</li>
            <li> The european stopper is frustrating for some, but because the oil is so concentrated, another type of dropper may give too much.  </li>
            <li> It is everything I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> I mix few drops with jojoba oil for deep hair conditioning mask.</li>
            <li> FYI for those not familiar with aromatherapy take caution, as it cannot be used with people who are prone to seizures.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in other ways too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also added it to some other oils and a carrier to treat cellulite.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to specifics of the product other than to say my concoction does repel insects.</li>
            <li> I  mix this in everything in my baths, with other oils.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is recommended for a lot of common ailments.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying all my essential oils from Plant Therapy as of late.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, other people I&#x27;ve made products for are and it does blend well with mint/peppermint.</li>
            <li> It is half of what they are charging at the stores around my area.</li>
            <li> Added a smidge to shampoo and my hair was limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> I put few drops of rosemary oil into my hair conditioner and about once a week</li>
            <li> I added a few drops to my shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Usually I buy Star West, Nature&#x27;s Alchemy, Oshadi  and Now Foods brands.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle cure but do help in movements of joints and the tired feelings.</li>
            <li> It really saved me from a very miserable day!  </li>
            <li> I had eaten some bad homemade bread.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I prefer another brand that&#x27;s more pricey</li>
            <li> Good quality oil. I diluted it according to the aromatherapy book guidelines and it seemed too strong, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am just getting started with essential oils, and the synergy blends were my first ones.  Rosemary is nice, and will probably use it as a mixture as I get more familiar with what the various oils are good for.  I like the Company, and think their oils are good, according to what I researched prior, they follow the proper protocal for producing the oils, and do not dilute them.  Prices are very competitive.</li>
            <li> very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Always a pleasures! Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I use Plant Therapy&#x27;s Rosemary for so many things.  It is a brain booster as well as allergy helper.  I diffuse Rosemary when I have a sinus headache.  I also use it with Eucalyptus, Peppermint, and Lavender to help with sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Great seller and a great product ☆☆☆☆☆</li>
            <li> beautiful. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this oil.  The bottle is filled, new, and it dispenses easily, which is nice.  Often the drops of these essential oils are too thick, and do not dispense easily.  This one does.  It has a very strong and potent smell, which I happen to like.  It may be too strong for some, but you can just dilute with water or other scents in another vessel.  I think this is a quality product.  Delivered what was described.</li>
            <li> Absolutely My FAVORITE!! Use Rosemary for everything but evening diffusing (need Lavender and Ylang Ylang for that).  Rosemary has so many excellent qualities in addition to a wonderful clean smell.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, much stronger smell than I expected, use sparingly, good price too. will overpower bathroom odors</li>
            <li> My bottle of Plant Therapy Rosemary Essential Oil arrived promptly, and the price was great - I got about twice the amount I would have been able to buy for the same price in a health food store, of a similar brand. Immediately I began using the oil to treat - successfully - a candida albicans condition, and as an an aromatherapy treatment for my father&#x27;s memory loss. Additionally, I have used it to impart a pleasant odor into the fabric of the shuttle bus I drive for my job, and received only positive comments about this from passengers. After weeks of using the oild daily for various and sundry purposes, I still have most of the bottle left...it&#x27;s potent stuff! I recommend Plant Therapy Essential Oils and will order from them again. ~ Dave Pierce, Silverthorne, CO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use this for hair growth!  I added a few drops to my shampoo!  I also plan to regularly make masks for my hair using coconut oil and rosemary oil!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Affordable</li>
            <li> I bought this Rosemary oil to use as part of a mixture for bath salt soak. It is strong so a little goes a long way. great product. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other essential oils from Plant Therapy, and will be purchasing more in the future. Great price.</li>
            <li> I believe its diluted. Its not oily to the touch, doesn&#x27;t smell like rosemary oil (I use it regularly, so I know) and when added to water is dissolves, but doesn&#x27;t separate from water as oil always does.</li>
            <li> I love the Rosemary essential oil. It helps with respiratory problems. It mixes well with peppermint oil and lavender oil in a diffuser for sinus or respiratory problems.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is recommended for a lot of common ailments.  It is pure and undiluted.  The european stopper is frustrating for some, but because the oil is so concentrated, another type of dropper may give too much.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner. The smell is amazing, I use it on my face and neck and I love the tingle it gives my skin.​</li>
            <li> I am a beginner in using Essential oils and had heard Rosemary could help with hair growth. I had surgery a year and a half ago and one result was major hair loss, I have been adding this to my conditioner since purchasing and even friends and neighbors have asked what I have done for my hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair, and I have to say the scent was a little strong, but nice.</li>
            <li> I bought rosemary and lemon oils to blend for a clean house smell.  They&#x27;re perfect together.  It smells like you just washed the floor, when actually, you were playing words with friends.  I think it&#x27;s my new favorite combo.</li>
            <li> I use this old to burn in my MIL&#x27;s room, she has dementia. The reason I do this,  is because there is many studies that indicate that Rosemary helps restore memory. It helps with fatigue, and reduces sluggishness. I also use this to put on the ends of my hair. I used to bleach and dye my hair, since I have stopped and started using rosemary on the ends I find my hair is becoming healthier. I highly recommend this oil. Even if you don&#x27;t have dementia, you should burn this. Yes your room might smell like a thanksgiving turkey but who cares, its all worth it.</li>
            <li> The stuff is OK, smells great, works well in a diffuser.  But ... not as great as other brands we have bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. So far I have used it in homemade salve. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in other ways too.</li>
            <li> Was bitten by deer tick last summer and my system hasn&#x27;t been the same.  Plant therapy was recommended so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Have been using different essential oils and they seem to be working.  Not a miracle cure but do help in movements of joints and the tired feelings.</li>
            <li> Not only that this product is 100% pure essential oil. The price is reasonable and the bottle came 20% more free thats 36 ml.</li>
            <li> i love this rosemary oil. really smells great and it excellent to use in the oil on my massage clients.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. We bought another Rosemary oil and it smelled like Eucalyptus.  This stuff works fine.  I read that is suppose to be good for the brain.  Lord knows I need it.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of these oils. I&#x27;ve purchased several from Plant Therapy &amp; have always been satisfied. I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the most hideous Rosemary oil.  Buy this if you want to spend money on oil that does not smell like rosemary and then as it is on your skin it begins to smell almost like urine.  &amp;#62;NOT KIDDING&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT BUY THIS EVER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to experiment with essential oils and I love this Rosemary. It smells wonderful and I&#x27;m using it to make some bath oils, shower scrub and also  some body butter. A good value for a very nice  oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for years. I make perfume sprays with them, as well as oils for skin problems, massage for relaxation, bug-repellants, and healing salves. Also, infusions to help with mood, energy-levels and as a sleep aid. There are also cleaning uses, anti-mildew properties and anti-bacterial applications for surface areas and linens too. Rosemary is excellent for some of these uses. It is a good essential oil to have in general for circulation and memory. It has an herbal fragrance and is said to aid in memory problems. I inhale it deeply whenever I feel mentally sluggish. This was a new brand of essential oil for me. Usually I buy Star West, Nature&#x27;s Alchemy, Oshadi  and Now Foods brands. I went with this one because  it had a good price. So far, I am pleased with. Seems pure &amp; effective for me. I would def. buy it again. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This oil is the real deal!  I had eaten some bad homemade bread.  It smelled a little sour but tasted good but even before I was halfway done I knew I had made an error.  I was queasy already.  I quick added some rosemary which is antiseptic, antibacterial, anti fungal, anti eveything you can think of, to some water - just a drop to about 24 oz and instead of spending the day holding onto the toilet bowl (it was looking to be going that way) I felt almost immediate relief and I was totally fine at the end of about an hour and a half.  It really saved me from a very miserable day!  I&#x27;ve also used it in conjunction with peppermint (in some carrieer oil) to rub on my shoulder for joint pain and it cured that right up almost completely too as well as get rid of a mild headache I had  brewing at the same time.  I just started down the aromatherapy road recently and rosemary is an important one to have.  I&#x27;m glad I trusted this manufacturer.  FYI for those not familiar with aromatherapy take caution, as it cannot be used with people who are prone to seizures.  I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I received this product half full. Although the seal was not broken, it leaked somehow. It is authentic, but didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was half full.received it on time though.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering essential oils, but I could not be happier with the product.  I add this and a few others to Epsom salts to create an awesome bath salt.</li>
            <li> Bought this for homemade shampoo. Stimulates hair growth and improves scalp. Love the brand, its the only one I use now. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> We love Rosemary.  I like to mix this with Lemon EO for the daily shower spray I make.  It smells wonderful &amp; gives you a great pick me up in the morning.  This is a wonderful EO to have on hand.  It was one of my first &amp; favorites!! My husband loves it too!!</li>
            <li> Love this rosemary EO. IT helped my hair grow. Good seller. Will buy again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been buying all my essential oils from Plant Therapy as of late. I think they are the best (you may differ) and their price is quite fair since I like a large quantity. I cannot write a separate review on all those that I have bought so please know, if this review is here, I love this product.</li>
            <li> good oil, smells great</li>
            <li> Nice product, is as expected.</li>
            <li> Heard this was good for the hair. Added a smidge to shampoo and my hair was limp and greasy. For other purposes, like inhaling to give you a mental lift in the afternoon, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with the smell of rosemary.  I liven in New York City and this helps me deal with every day stress. It helps me sleep and get rid of headaches. It also makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and has many benefits. Very quick shipping as usual, always very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This, mixed with an equal portion of peppermint turned out a really nice smelling soap.  I&#x27;ve never purchased any other Rosemary oil, so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other, but it smells great to me!</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, other people I&#x27;ve made products for are and it does blend well with mint/peppermint. I use Rosemary mainly in my hair for its thickening properties as I have very thin, baby fine hair. I add it to commercial shampoo, and have made my own natural shampoo with it. I also massage some neat into my scalp 10-15 minutes before my morning shower, let it &amp;#34;do its thing&amp;#34;, and then wash my hair. The smell goes away, but I can tell it is helping give some life and body to my hair. I&#x27;ve also added it to some other oils and a carrier to treat cellulite. I&#x27;m told it can also help clear your sinuses, which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be testing out in a few months as it gets colder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy has quickly become my favorite essential oil company, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. The quality of oils you get for the price is amazing. They rival, and sometimes surpass, the multi-level marketing companies that claim to be the best on the market. Whenever I talk about the benefits of essential oils with people and how much they have helped my family, I always stress that PT is our go-to brand.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, thanks guys. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I find that Plant Therapy oils are great quality for the price paid. They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well. (I&#x27;ve never taken oils internally.)</li>
            <li> Thank you...perfect...exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Rosemary oil is a great scalp conditioner and stimulator.  It also works well for minor skin irritations.  The bottle has a dispenser top that makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil for the price. I use them to make aromatherapy blends the price is great on it as well! I will be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Great for reviving the scalp and stimulating hair growth.  I&#x27;ve been making DIY hair cocktails with ease using this oil.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product for what I use it for. Really goes a long way. But definitely purchase this again. Love it,</li>
            <li> This rosemary oil smells like rosemary, not eucalyptus like so many others. I use it in a diffuser, and it&#x27;s somehow both invigorating and relaxing. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fine, strong rosemary oil at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is part of a formula I created for insect repellant. I cannot speak to specifics of the product other than to say my concoction does repel insects. This product as with the other ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> Recieved product exactly as advertised.  I use essential oils in my homemade cleaning supplies, so it was nice to find a 30ml bottle at a good price.</li>
            <li> Very quality oil and great customer service and support by Plat Therapy. My rosemary oil was delivered with a loose cap and some of the oil leaked out; the company replaced it with a new bottle. I was very satisfied! I used to buy more expensive oils sold by a big MLM company until I discovered Plant Therapy and I could tell no difference between their oils and more expensive ones. I highly recommend this oil and this company.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on its stress relieving properties, and it really works.  You only need a few drops in your warm bath and it melts the days cares away. This product will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Shipped quick and is high quality.</li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t have a diffuser so I have been putting a few drops into a qt.size  pan and heating on the stove top then putting a towel over and inhaling, it&#x27;s great for stress and tention</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is everything I expected it to be.  I like how it doesn&#x27;t stay oily and absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> I like the sent of this oil, it&#x27;s definitely rosemary! It&#x27;s strong and stimulating smell. It&#x27;s perfect for my soaps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil with great success in treating minor burns, rashes and insect bites. It&#x27;s definitely full strength and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available. This did not come out smelling good or anything like what I&#x27;m used to. I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
            <li> I love this company. Order 2 different essential oils and love them. Fast shipping no problems just as advertised.  Great buy for price. For whatever your needs or desire of purchasing this product im sure you will be quite pleased.</li>
            <li> it was a gift they also loved it</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, it was actually what I was looking for</li>
            <li> We really like Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  You get a good value/amount of oil here.  And the quality seems right up there with the other major/pricier brands.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it brings a wonderful essence of Rosemary to life. I hope others have found this true also . Shipping &amp; packing was A+</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading it is good for healthy, thicker hair.  As I&#x27;m 50 and starting too loose some, got intrigued by it.&lt;br /&gt;cant say it did a big difference for my hair but I had some drops in my shampoo and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> The aroma is so much stronger than just freshly cut rosemary. Very stimulating and refreshing though it might be too much for some people. I put few drops of rosemary oil into my hair conditioner and about once a week I mix few drops with jojoba oil for deep hair conditioning mask. Satisfied with the product and the delivery</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and works great for all my needs. Anyone who wants to try Oils and hasn&#x27;t yet, should. Sooner the better</li>
            <li> I just started using this...so far so good!</li>
            <li> Love these essential oils.  I have lavender and rosemary and almond oil.  I make a blend of about 85% almond oil, 10% lavender and 5% rosemary and use it every day in the shower after exfoliating. My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Just started to use the product which felt good and useful.</li>
            <li> Love that I can get great EOs for reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Cannot drink it even when diluted according to the instructions I researched - rubbing on my hands and smelling it works better.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell to it and is exactly what I was expecting. I would but it again.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy essential oils.  I use five different ones and love them all.  I would recommend these to anyone wanting a quality long lasting essential oil!</li>
            <li> I use essential oils for cleaning, for clearning space of negative energy and bringing in positive energy, and for emotional uplifting.  Mixing Rosemary with Eucalyptus does all of these so well.  I purchase off of my oils through Amazon and get the Plant Therapy Essential Oils brand.  They are really good.</li>
            <li> The product is nice and strong-you only need few drops.I use it for my hair.Strong and fresh smell! Thank you for the prompt service.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and in good condition. I&#x27;m using it for my Mother who is in the beginning stages of dementia. I heard that breathing the scent of Rosemary oil can help. I&#x27;ll try anything. I have been putting some drops into a tea light and it does scent her room nicely. That is what I&#x27;m using it for and it is working great. Can&#x27;t beat this price. It is half of what they are charging at the stores around my area.</li>
            <li> nice oils I bought a bunch to make thieves</li>
            <li> Good product. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Rosemary. I  mix this in everything in my baths, with other oils. Shipping was fast, Thanks!</li>
