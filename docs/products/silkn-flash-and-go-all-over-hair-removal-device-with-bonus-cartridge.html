            <li>LOL)</li>
            <li>This works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M SO HAPPY</li>
            <li>For the thrifty of us :P</li>
            <li>For the thrifty of us :P</li>
            <li>I stopped using it on my legs a good 6 months in.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed and felt the price was immediately justified even if the thing didn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have good results with the device, it&#x27;s gotten rid of a lot of unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li>I waited two weeks and reused it on my face just for good measure but haven&#x27;t had any hair growth on my face at all.</li>
            <li>and so I should have been a good candidate to the product and it has not worked at all.</li>
            <li>I used it on my &amp;#34;dark hair and light skin parts&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t even work!!</li>
            <li>so I do know it&#x27;s working there, but I think I will have to invest another good year in this thing to see more results.  </li>
            <li>I get to do the treatments on my own schedule</li>
            <li>Product is very beautiful hair has disappeared completely advise you buy it</li>
            <li>I am very light skinned &amp; have darker hair</li>
            <li>Price was definitely better than the salon treatments.</li>
            <li>More about I will ask her to post soon</li>
            <li>than that, I am quite pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cheap $7 ones for green/blue laser lights are not the appropriate kind.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with more treatments, it will work even better, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that stage yet.</li>
            <li>That is probably a better solution.</li>
            <li>That is probably a better solution.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also been over a month since I&#x27;ve been able to shave my legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this thing.</li>
            <li>The more hair you have in an area, the more it will hurt, and the aloe vera will help with that.</li>
            <li>You might also want to invest in some sunscreen :)</li>

            <li>You might also want to invest in some sunscreen :)</li>
            <li>and she love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turned on and I put the device up to my face, making sure there was contact and waited for the device lights to flash.  </li>
            <li>I´m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I am confident that soon, I will not need to shave anymore.</li>
            <li>Just started Using this month , so far good!</li>
            <li>Here is my true honest review of this product...</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I like that I can use it in privacy and when I want.</li>
            <li>Everyone has different experiences, but the Flash N Go worked great for me, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being on the far end of their given spectrum of color, couple of uses showed a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li>The product seems ok, it is very easy to use, but it needs some time to know if it is really working.</li>
            <li>I have light skin, dark hair, and I’m a perfect candidate to laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>I was able to do about  3-4 treatments and then I became pregnant...</li>
            <li>plug is huge, so finding an adequate fitting plug can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Huge improvement if I have anything to say about</li>
            <li>flashing light telling me</li>
            <li>Now, my skin stays silky smooth for 3-4 days before I need to shave.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>I have seen significant hair removal on my arm pits.</li>
            <li>I tested the levels higher and higher to be sure it was safe, and it is.</li>
            <li>I am still using my first cartridge :)</li>
            <li>:) I used to shave every day as my hair grows fast.</li>
            <li>The product is extremely easy to use, does not hurt and really works!  </li>
            <li>I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges.</li>
            <li>Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lucky</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly, immediately watched the DVD and put the tool to work.  </li>
            <li>and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number.</li>
            <li>No pain at all even using the higher level of light.</li>
            <li>(Intense Pulsed Light)</li>
            <li>Received it today and did my first treatment today - full legs, bikini &amp; under arms.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>One of the things I liked was getting the extra cartridge</li>
            <li>And that is totally worth months of not having to tweeze or shave.</li>
            <li>After a clinic totally removed a patch of hair as a trial, I thought this might be a cheap alternative which may take more attempts.</li>
            <li>Also I can go a good 5 days without shaving my arm pits (and I used to shave every other day).  </li>
            <li>I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I am returning it right now.</li>
            <li>It now grows in pretty patchy but there are areas I no longer have hair growing.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got the bonus Cartridge because one cartridge is not enough for face, legs &amp; underarms.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written but the product worked</li>
            <li>If someone were willing to give me my $50 back, even with the one issue I have with the product, I would up it to 5 stars. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room.</li>
            <li>My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s removed most of my hair and what is left grows in softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I was going to try it on my face first, then tried it on my leg.</li>
            <li>am still using the device in hopes of bringing those percentages even higher.  </li>
            <li>I went back and watched the video 3 more times and each time without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first use, I set the tool to level one.  </li>
            <li>- i saw a difference and after the third i saw more of one..</li>
            <li>I have had professional laser hair removal and love this for the spot maintenance - it really does work very well.  </li>
            <li>I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll hang on to it for a long time :)</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll hang on to it for a long time :)</li>
            <li>I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s just too much work for me.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is way to get these results for a lower price.</li>

            <li>My hair grows really fast).</li>
            <li>Zapped the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Level one didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>If you have reasonable expectations, I&#x27;d recommend the Flash and Go.  </li>
            <li>I do use CFL lightbulbs and this might be the issue, but my whole apartment has that lighting.  </li>
            <li>for someone who has struggled with a lot of body hair my whole life - i&#x27;m almost in tears..</li>
            <li>I have light white skin and after 6 months using it the hair in my legs desappeared week by week.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase.</li>
            <li>The diode laser requires 10 or more treatments with dark skin.&lt;br /&gt;IPL</li>
            <li>I have used this now for 4 treatment cycles and ALL of the facial hair that I wanted removed has diminished, however, the thicker and more coarse hair is taking longer.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it, the only draw back is that you do have to have patience.</li>
            <li>I have not specifically noticed if the treated areas have thinner hair growth, so I will have to use it a few more times to really know if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone wanting permanent hair removal without paying high prices.</li>
            <li>I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, but not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li>, but not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li>I had to stop it and have it play normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just got this one big square bald spot on my right leg</li>
            <li>I had to go to my  new Laptop computer.  </li>
            <li>soon they were very professional.</li>
            <li>The first one covered all 3 treatments for my upper lip, under arms, bikini line, and calves.</li>
            <li>The next treatment I put it on a higher setting and decided to just do one leg</li>
            <li>I only did 3 treatments (basically one a month for 3 months) on a higher setting than 1.</li>
            <li>after my second treatment using a higher voltage or whatever</li>
            <li>After using this on my face, a large majority of the hairs are gone, and the ones that are there take 2-3 days to grow back.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and very occasionally a bit of redness, but no pain unless I go over the same area twice or the setting is high.</li>
            <li>Do not waste money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal that didn&#x27;t work and cost loads of money.</li>
            <li>And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services.</li>
            <li>I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments.</li>
            <li>However, I have also had professional treatments here</li>
            <li>I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should.</li>
            <li>But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and</li>

            <li>But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and</li>
            <li>The hair that is still left on that leg is much softer.</li>
            <li>I learned that you have to plug into a direct wall socket.  </li>
            <li>(so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my facial hair didn&#x27;t grow back.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and super dark thick hair - didn&#x27;t think it would work -</li>
            <li>tried a new head, and the same process.</li>
            <li>Test it out in a less sensitive area first.</li>
            <li>I got my bottle at Dollar General for like $1.50.</li>
            <li>I got my bottle at Dollar General for like $1.50.</li>
            <li>From the professional hair laser the hair came out the same day.</li>
            <li>I used one cartridge so far and just started on my second.</li>
            <li>Got thrown off a lot by the flip flops in the reviews, but finally caved in and bought one directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a present for my daughter, so far she have used it twice</li>
            <li>This apparently is a BluRay disk and some computers will not have a BluRay player.  </li>
            <li>No side effects for me so far and the hair on my legs is almost totally gone</li>
            <li>Generally it works but very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;After two month usage still cannot use that product alone, need to combine with other tools to have 100% effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color.</li>

            <li> plug is huge, so finding an adequate fitting plug can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Huge improvement if I have anything to say about</li>
            <li> flashing light telling me</li>
            <li> Now, my skin stays silky smooth for 3-4 days before I need to shave.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> I have seen significant hair removal on my arm pits.</li>
            <li> I tested the levels higher and higher to be sure it was safe, and it is.</li>
            <li> I am still using my first cartridge :)</li>
            <li> :) I used to shave every day as my hair grows fast.</li>
            <li> The product is extremely easy to use, does not hurt and really works!  </li>
            <li> I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges.</li>
            <li> Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lucky</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly, immediately watched the DVD and put the tool to work.  </li>
            <li> and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number.</li>
            <li> No pain at all even using the higher level of light.</li>
            <li> (Intense Pulsed Light)</li>
            <li> Received it today and did my first treatment today - full legs, bikini &amp; under arms.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> One of the things I liked was getting the extra cartridge</li>
            <li> And that is totally worth months of not having to tweeze or shave.</li>
            <li> After a clinic totally removed a patch of hair as a trial, I thought this might be a cheap alternative which may take more attempts.</li>
            <li> Also I can go a good 5 days without shaving my arm pits (and I used to shave every other day).  </li>
            <li> I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I am returning it right now.</li>
            <li> It now grows in pretty patchy but there are areas I no longer have hair growing.  </li>
            <li> Glad I got the bonus Cartridge because one cartridge is not enough for face, legs &amp; underarms.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written but the product worked</li>
            <li> If someone were willing to give me my $50 back, even with the one issue I have with the product, I would up it to 5 stars. &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room.</li>
            <li> My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s removed most of my hair and what is left grows in softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I was going to try it on my face first, then tried it on my leg.</li>
            <li> am still using the device in hopes of bringing those percentages even higher.  </li>
            <li> I went back and watched the video 3 more times and each time without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first use, I set the tool to level one.  </li>
            <li> - i saw a difference and after the third i saw more of one..</li>
            <li> I have had professional laser hair removal and love this for the spot maintenance - it really does work very well.  </li>
            <li> I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll hang on to it for a long time :)</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll hang on to it for a long time :)</li>
            <li> I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just too much work for me.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is way to get these results for a lower price.</li>

            <li> My hair grows really fast).</li>
            <li> Zapped the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Level one didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> If you have reasonable expectations, I&#x27;d recommend the Flash and Go.  </li>
            <li> I do use CFL lightbulbs and this might be the issue, but my whole apartment has that lighting.  </li>
            <li> for someone who has struggled with a lot of body hair my whole life - i&#x27;m almost in tears..</li>
            <li> I have light white skin and after 6 months using it the hair in my legs desappeared week by week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase.</li>
            <li> The diode laser requires 10 or more treatments with dark skin.&lt;br /&gt;IPL</li>
            <li> I have used this now for 4 treatment cycles and ALL of the facial hair that I wanted removed has diminished, however, the thicker and more coarse hair is taking longer.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it, the only draw back is that you do have to have patience.</li>
            <li> I have not specifically noticed if the treated areas have thinner hair growth, so I will have to use it a few more times to really know if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone wanting permanent hair removal without paying high prices.</li>
            <li> I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , but not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li> , but not least, I want to give a warning.</li>
            <li> I had to stop it and have it play normal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just got this one big square bald spot on my right leg</li>
            <li> I had to go to my  new Laptop computer.  </li>
            <li> soon they were very professional.</li>
            <li> The first one covered all 3 treatments for my upper lip, under arms, bikini line, and calves.</li>
            <li> The next treatment I put it on a higher setting and decided to just do one leg</li>
            <li> I only did 3 treatments (basically one a month for 3 months) on a higher setting than 1.</li>
            <li> after my second treatment using a higher voltage or whatever</li>
            <li> After using this on my face, a large majority of the hairs are gone, and the ones that are there take 2-3 days to grow back.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and very occasionally a bit of redness, but no pain unless I go over the same area twice or the setting is high.</li>
            <li> Do not waste money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal that didn&#x27;t work and cost loads of money.</li>
            <li> And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services.</li>
            <li> I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments.</li>
            <li> However, I have also had professional treatments here</li>
            <li> I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should.</li>
            <li> But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and</li>

            <li> The hair that is still left on that leg is much softer.</li>
            <li> I learned that you have to plug into a direct wall socket.  </li>
            <li> (so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my facial hair didn&#x27;t grow back.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and super dark thick hair - didn&#x27;t think it would work -</li>

            <li> Got thrown off a lot by the flip flops in the reviews, but finally caved in and bought one directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Generally it works but very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;After two month usage still cannot use that product alone, need to combine with other tools to have 100% effect.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Other than going outside in natural sunlight</li>
            <li> My only compliant is that since you have to shave first, it&#x27;s hard to know if you have already lasered that spot until it hurts.</li>
            <li> The only down side is just not realizing how fast you can go thru a cartridge, but even the ones that came in this combo pack have lasted a while so its not much to really complain about.</li>

            <li> This is an apartment and the lighting is limited.  </li>
            <li> found one in the kitchen, and it worked twice, then kept flashing yellow, meaning my skin was too dark.  </li>
            <li> The silkn flash n go costs less and actually works.</li>
            <li> The wavelength the Flash &amp; Go uses (475-1200nm) is similar to other Silk&#x27;N AND other IPL/HPL products that a study from Australia shows DO NEED safety glasses.</li>
            <li> It did burn the hairs but it really didn&#x27;t slow the hairs down.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of areas where there is not one single hair... not lighter hair, NO hair!</li>
            <li> and now I have very coarse hair and a $300 product and wasted time.</li>
            <li> I understand the underarms are much harder to tackle</li>
            <li> The different is noticeable if you use it ever few days apart from each other.</li>
            <li> I do use it every week instead of every other week as directed.</li>
            <li> My underarms now have small patches that have not grown back</li>
            <li> $120 is a small price to pay to save your eyesite later in life.</li>
            <li> but it could lead to skin discoloration due to the increase of hormones.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale and have coarse, black body hair.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to see a whole lot of results on the first go, and ramping something like this up to the max setting on the first go is a really stupid and dangerous idea.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously for six months and no result. The worse part is that I had to start shaving the area on my face because of it and now I have very coarse hair and a $300 product and wasted time. Very disappointing, I have had professional laser hair removal and no it is not the same at all. From the professional hair laser the hair came out the same day. Here, not one hair came out. Do not waste money.</li>
            <li> Here is my true honest review of this product... I have been faithfully using this product for over a year now.  I am very light skinned &amp; have darker hair so I&#x27;m the perfect candidate for this item.  My interest in it was specifically for my arm pits, bikini area &amp; legs.  I HAVE seen results, but it is ALOT of work!! If you are not willing to use it for a long period of time DO NOT waste your time.  I have seen significant hair removal on my arm pits. It now grows in pretty patchy but there are areas I no longer have hair growing.  Also I can go a good 5 days without shaving my arm pits (and I used to shave every other day).  Also razor bumps are GREATLY reduced.  I stopped using it on my legs a good 6 months in.  It&#x27;s just too much work for me.  After 6 months my leg hair definitely feels softer but still grows at regular rate &amp; only slightly reduced. Now my bikini area...This is where I was expecting to see results &amp; I feel is taking the longest amount of time.  Obviously the hair is denser &amp; thicker and that is why.  I didn&#x27;t notice ANY results until about 6 months in.  The area grows back VERY patchy &amp; I do have a few spots where hair no longer grows so I do know it&#x27;s working there, but I think I will have to invest another good year in this thing to see more results.  The product is expensive &amp; the refills are expensive but overall cheaper than lazer removal.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the /silk&#x27;n Flash and Go after paying enormous price for laser treatments at a salon. Price was definitely better than the salon treatments. It is easy to use and I like that I can use it in privacy and when I want. No appointments necessary. Glad I got the bonus Cartridge because one cartridge is not enough for face, legs &amp; underarms. Seems to be working as well as the salon treatments. Using on a schedule as directed and on the second cartridge, but not hair-free yet.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written but the product worked so well I had to post something. I saw definite results after only a month of use. I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal that didn&#x27;t work and cost loads of money. The silkn flash n go costs less and actually works. I do use it every week instead of every other week as directed. I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Received it today and did my first treatment today - full legs, bikini &amp; under arms. Took no time at all and now we wait for the results. I will update when I have some !</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s happy with this product....so I am happy also . More about I will ask her to post soon</li>
            <li> I have used this now for 4 treatment cycles and ALL of the facial hair that I wanted removed has diminished, however, the thicker and more coarse hair is taking longer. My underarms now have small patches that have not grown back and although I wish it were a faster process I can&#x27;t complain. I get to do the treatments on my own schedule, I don&#x27;t have to leave the house, and I can touch up as I please. I used one cartridge so far and just started on my second. The first one covered all 3 treatments for my upper lip, under arms, bikini line, and calves. I am pleased with it, the only draw back is that you do have to have patience.</li>
            <li> TYPES OF LASER EPILATORS:&lt;br /&gt;Nd:YAG laser: 1064 nm (Near-Infrared) made for treating darker skin,  FDA Approved For Medium-To-Dark Skin Tones  Expensive machine. Would need to go to a laser clinic.&lt;br /&gt;Diode Laser  such as Tria Home Laser  The diode laser requires 10 or more treatments with dark skin.&lt;br /&gt;IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) Laser such as  Silk&#x27;n Flash n Go -IPL is known as  ‘painless” laser hair removal.  It requires additional sessions on dark or black skin.  IPL laser is also used for Photo-facial treatments, to treat skin imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;Heat filament uses heat flash  such as  NoNo Pro-  burns hair follicle.  Not a laser.&lt;br /&gt;My personal choice is the IPL Laser.</li>
            <li> The product seems ok, it is very easy to use, but it needs some time to know if it is really working.</li>
            <li> didnt reduce hair at all and I used all the cartridges up</li>
            <li> Everyone has different experiences, but the Flash N Go worked great for me, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I am a little annoyed that I just bought it last month and it just dropped $50 in price, but what can ya do? If someone were willing to give me my $50 back, even with the one issue I have with the product, I would up it to 5 stars. &#x3D; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am quite pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to state that I did go ahead and purchase IPL approved safety glasses. The cheap $7 ones for green/blue laser lights are not the appropriate kind. I found a bunch of mixed information. But, here is the conclusion I came to. Silk&#x27;N states you don&#x27;t need safety glasses. However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room. That made me nervous. The wavelength the Flash &amp; Go uses (475-1200nm) is similar to other Silk&#x27;N AND other IPL/HPL products that a study from Australia shows DO NEED safety glasses. Here is the link to that study. [...]&lt;br /&gt;Glasses that are specifically approved for IPL use run around $70-$120. I found a pair on a well known auction site that starts with an \\&quot;E\\&quot; for around $30. I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase. However, do some research. $120 is a small price to pay to save your eyesite later in life. And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services. The ones I purchased were the Phillips LS-IPLB-206.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you point and shoot the thing. Not hard to do, with a little yoga-like flexibility. Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4. I have had it 1 month and done 2 treatments, 2 weeks apart, as is recommended in the instruction booklet. As time goes on, you do them less and less. I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges - I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail. I am 5&#x27;4\\&quot; and 140 lbs to give you an idea of surface area. I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg (so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge. I tried to guestimate and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number. I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges. But, who knows. Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my legs - it worked GREAT. No, that is an understatement. It worked AWESOME. I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments. I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far. I was impressed and felt the price was immediately justified even if the thing didn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my bikini/happy trail - It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments. Perhaps with more treatments, it will work even better, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that stage yet. There is a reduction in hair, and the hair still there is finer/thinner. That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; ) Keep in mind that I only use level 4 on this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my underarms - This is the area it works the least for me. It still works, but the results aren&#x27;t quite as dramatic. However, I have also had professional treatments here and they have worked even less. My armpit hair is apparently incredibly stubborn. In this region on my body, any improvements is a big deal to me. So, once again, I am happy. My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them. Up until now, the roots are so dark that even after shaving, there is still a residual shadow. I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face/chin - the hairs here are finer and lighter. However, they didn&#x27;t start that heavy or dark, so I am not sure how much better they can get. Once again, for the price, any improvement will make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, I want to give a warning. If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color. I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots. I tried to avoid the actual pen marks, but the IPL targets dark things, so it left a residual. I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t go away and I would be left with equally spaced marks up and down my legs FOREVER. I put on some vitamin E and it went away in a couple days. I saw a review where one girl used white eyeliner. That is probably a better solution. Anything other than pure white is a bad idea, though. Just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have now owned this for two years. I do still use it. HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should. I tend to let things go in the winter and use it in the summer to extend the periods in between shaves. It did not bring my leg hair to zero. But neither did the professional laser treatments I paid thousands for and the hair is GREATLY decreased. My follicles used to be so dark that I looked like I had hair even when I had just shaved. Now, even when the hair grows I can go weeks and weeks in between shaving. The hair is so light that even when it is long, you can hardly see it. I still stand by my endorsement. I really don&#x27;t think there is way to get these results for a lower price. Given the choice, I would buy it again.d make it look like I did actually shave them.

            <li> Used pro laser treatment before and had hair growth after a few months. Decided to buy silkn flash n go and it worked great!</li>
            <li> This works well for me. I have pretty sensitive skin and very occasionally a bit of redness, but no pain unless I go over the same area twice or the setting is high. I have quite pale skin and very dark hair. I use 5 on my legs, but can only go up to 3 on my underarms and bikini area. It&#x27;s removed most of my hair and what is left grows in softer and smoother. I&#x27;m quite happy with it. My only compliant is that since you have to shave first, it&#x27;s hard to know if you have already lasered that spot until it hurts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about a year ago... I am extremely pale and have coarse, black body hair. I did one treatment on a low setting all over. The next treatment I put it on a higher setting and decided to just do one leg so I could compare. I was able to do about  3-4 treatments and then I became pregnant... It won&#x27;t harm the baby but it could lead to skin discoloration due to the increase of hormones. Anyway, so I chose to stop. It&#x27;s been at least 10 months since my last treatment, (sorry for the TMI) and it&#x27;s also been over a month since I&#x27;ve been able to shave my legs. OMG. The difference in my legs is insane! I took a picture and attached it (told ya I haven&#x27;t shaved in forever LOL) I hope you can see it well and tell the difference... Anyways, the treated leg still has hair, but the its&#x27; significantly less from the other leg, keep in mind when looking at the picture I only did 3 treatments (basically one a month for 3 months) on a higher setting than 1. I have a lot of areas where there is not one single hair... not lighter hair, NO hair! The hair that is still left on that leg is much softer. Very impressed and happy with this product! I cannot wait to get back to using this again.</li>
            <li> Works well for me. Being on the far end of their given spectrum of color, couple of uses showed a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li> It did burn the hairs but it really didn&#x27;t slow the hairs down.It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at buying something like this for the longest time. Got thrown off a lot by the flip flops in the reviews, but finally caved in and bought one directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this thing. It&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted it took a couple of treatments to see anything happening (I use this thing twice a week. My hair grows really fast). I zapped lines down both my legs, a spot on my bikini area, and I have problems around my chin. Zapped the whole thing. Level one didn&#x27;t do much for me. Level two, I felt a little discomfort and smelled some burning hair. Then I ramped it up to three. Holy crap, if there is a lot of hair in the area does it burn. But after like the third time using it on the third setting, the hairs that I zapped have not shown head nor tail. It&#x27;s a big difference in my &#x27;test&#x27; areas than in the ones I haven&#x27;t treated. I&#x27;ve just got this one big square bald spot on my right leg and I feel no more discomfort when I zap the area. I just did my second treatment on the area in my bikini line (I slacked off a couple of weeks to see if it was actually doing anything), the hair that I zapped hadn&#x27;t come back in yet. My face has been a problem area for years. I&#x27;ve got tons of &#x27;whiskers&#x27; on my chin and jaw, and it was getting to the point where I was shaving my face everyday. After using this on my face, a large majority of the hairs are gone, and the ones that are there take 2-3 days to grow back. Huge improvement if I have anything to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to keep in mind if you&#x27;re planning on getting this, though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Go through the settings one at a time. Yes it takes longer, but you have less of a chance of hurting yourself if you do. i.e: Do not start level three on your face. Test it out in a less sensitive area first. I was going to try it on my face first, then tried it on my leg. It is SO uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You need Aloe Vera, or something that soothes burns. The more hair you have in an area, the more it will hurt, and the aloe vera will help with that. I got my bottle at Dollar General for like $1.50. You might also want to invest in some sunscreen :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Be patient. You&#x27;re not going to see a whole lot of results on the first go, and ramping something like this up to the max setting on the first go is a really stupid and dangerous idea. I&#x27;ve seen so many people in reviews saying they hate the product because it burned them. Well, if you would&#x27;ve followed the directions and warnings that wouldn&#x27;t have happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) They have a little payment thing on the Silkn site where you can pay like $100 upfront to get this shipped to you, and then pay on the rest of it every month until it&#x27;s completely yours. They also have tons of coupons to use on their site. For the thrifty of us :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all though, I like the Flash and Go, and I think I&#x27;ll hang on to it for a long time :)u have in an area, the more it will hurt, and the aloe vera will help with that.

            <li> I purchased the Flash and Go two years ago for less at Bed Bath and Beyond using their 20% off coupon.  One of the things I liked was getting the extra cartridge right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use on my face and underarms only.  I use an Emjoi for everything else.  I have good results with the device, it&#x27;s gotten rid of a lot of unwanted hair.  I&#x27;ve seen the best results on my face with a reduction of around 65% in hairloss.  I understand the underarms are much harder to tackle but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s managed to remove 45% of the unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the device in hopes of bringing those percentages even higher.  If you&#x27;re looking for 100% hair removal, this device is not for you.  If you have reasonable expectations, I&#x27;d recommend the Flash and Go.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> Product is very beautiful hair has disappeared completely advise you buy it Thank you&lt;br /&gt;silk&#x27;n flash&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li> The product is extremely easy to use, does not hurt and really works!  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting permanent hair removal without paying high prices.</li>
            <li> It was a present for my daughter, so far she have used it twice and she love it but it is too soon to tell the results, the customer service from this vendor was excellent and I will buy from them soon they were very professional.</li>
            <li> This did not work - Literally  NO Flash so No go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the DVD would not play in my desktop computer.  I had to go to my  new Laptop computer.  It found \\&quot;3D\\&quot; and started up in 3D.  I had to stop it and have it play normal.  This apparently is a BluRay disk and some computers will not have a BluRay player.  Lucky I did.  I have one for my TV but I didnt want it playing for everyone!!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching it twice, I went and shaved and then turned the device on and followed the instructions from the DVD.  I also had the booklet with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned on and I put the device up to my face, making sure there was contact and waited for the device lights to flash.  And I waited.  I tried another area, and repeated the process.  No lights flashed.  Nor did it tell me I was too dark.  I am VERY pale. Not been out in the sun in years.  So I tried it on my inner arm to see if it was my skin.  NO flashing lights telling me it was a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a new head, and the same process. NO flashing light telling me it was a go.  I went back and watched the video 3 more times and each time without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally determined that the product was defective.  WHAT a disappointment after spending all that money.  I cannot get a replacement since it came from Amazon and its nothing they did, so have to wait for them to receive the package then get my refund, then order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 6 - Received the replacement and again had issues.  I learned that you have to plug into a direct wall socket.  No extensions.  When I called the company they said \\&quot;of course\\&quot;.  Well its NOT stated as such in their video NOR their instruction booklet.  Have they ever seen the equipment for ladies in a bathroom?  Hairdryers, curlers, etc.  You need an extension plug!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plug is huge, so finding an adequate fitting plug can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found one in the kitchen, and it worked twice, then kept flashing yellow, meaning my skin was too dark.  I am white, VERY pale so my skin being dark just cannot be the issue.  I even tried on the inside of my under arm.  It kept flashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and they said that its the lighting.  You have shadows from lighting and it tricks the device into thinking its dark skin.  She suggested a room with different lighting.  She said \\&quot;less bright\\&quot; room.  This is an apartment and the lighting is limited.  I do use CFL lightbulbs and this might be the issue, but my whole apartment has that lighting.  Other than going outside in natural sunlight, whats the option?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it doesnt work in a completely dark room...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had packed the device away when I called and was not in the mood to pull it out and try it.  I will call them back on Monday when I try it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the combo package product but received the one without the extra cartridges.. it was so disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;the price difference is almost 75$. and I live in Iraq so it would be inconvenient to send the item back again.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly, immediately watched the DVD and put the tool to work.  After the first use, my facial hair didn&#x27;t grow back. I waited two weeks and reused it on my face just for good measure but haven&#x27;t had any hair growth on my face at all. I also used it on my underarms.  For the first use, I set the tool to level one.  After two weeks I used it again on level two. I&#x27;ve noticed the hair growth has slowed but will probably set the tool to level 3 for future treatments.  I have also had two treatments on the bikini line and hair growth is slowing.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Generally it works but very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;After two month usage still cannot use that product alone, need to combine with other tools to have 100% effect.&lt;br /&gt;So, product value is still not clear yet, still using wax for going out.</li>
            <li> this thing works - i couldn&#x27;t believe it. it takes a few treatments though - don&#x27;t get discourage. after my second treatment using a higher voltage or whatever - i saw a difference and after the third i saw more of one.. virtually no hair.. i&#x27;m amazed! I have light skin and super dark thick hair - didn&#x27;t think it would work - but it did - even on my bikini line.. thoroughly impressed! for someone who has struggled with a lot of body hair my whole life - i&#x27;m almost in tears..</li>
            <li> I used it on my &amp;#34;dark hair and light skin parts&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t even work!! DO NOT BUY, it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice, and have no idea if it is working or not.  I have not specifically noticed if the treated areas have thinner hair growth, so I will have to use it a few more times to really know if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Not worth the box it came in.</li>
            <li> I bought this Flash ans Go hair removal last February (6 months ago) and started using it in a weekly base. I tested the levels higher and higher to be sure it was safe, and it is. No pain at all even using the higher level of light. I have light white skin and after 6 months using it the hair in my legs desappeared week by week. Now I use it every 10-15 days to cover some hair spots. It worked for legs and under arms area. The bikini area didn´t work for me, at least for now. I´m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Just started Using this month , so far good!</li>
            <li> I have had professional laser hair removal and love this for the spot maintenance - it really does work very well.  Yes, it is slightly painful but only for a split second. And that is totally worth months of not having to tweeze or shave.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift. I have used this once a week since Christmas. I use it on my legs, arms and underarms. I am still using my first cartridge :) This works great. It took 6 weeks before my hair growth slowed down dramatically. No side effects for me so far and the hair on my legs is almost totally gone :) I used to shave every day as my hair grows fast. Now, my skin stays silky smooth for 3-4 days before I need to shave. I am confident that soon, I will not need to shave anymore. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to get started.  Never know if it is truly working.  How long is it before I should expect to see results?</li>
            <li> We used the silk&#x27;n the same day we received it. We use its every few days and can tell a difference. Neither one of us have to shave as often as we did before we got this. The different is noticeable if you use it ever few days apart from each other. I would recommend this to those I know. The only down side is just not realizing how fast you can go thru a cartridge, but even the ones that came in this combo pack have lasted a while so its not much to really complain about.</li>
            <li> Very good product wirks well</li>
            <li> This product has not worked and it has increased hair growth instead of removing it. My skin type it white and so I should have been a good candidate to the product and it has not worked at all.</li>
            <li> I am returning it right now. I have light skin, dark hair, and I’m a perfect candidate to laser hair removal. After a clinic totally removed a patch of hair as a trial, I thought this might be a cheap alternative which may take more attempts. After several uses nothing. Even on the highest setting there was no hair reduction.</li>
            <li> I NEEDED THIS PRODUCT AND IT&#x27;S LIKE A PICTURE WITH ALL THE ACCESSORIES. I&#x27;M SO HAPPY AND I RECOMENDED THIS PRODUCT</li>
