            <li>Love it.üòç</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BRUSH.</li>
            <li>my favorite brush&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the texture of it as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>Better than my Mac brush this size for a portion of the price</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It more than deserves it at this</li>
            <li>but im glad I ordered it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been reaching for my beauty blender which is pretty good.</li>
            <li>great to apply finishing matte powder over foundation, really soft bristles</li>
            <li>So far im happy</li>
            <li>So soft and dense, great foundation brush.</li>
            <li>It washes very easily (best to use some sort of scrubby item like those handheld brush scrubbers where you place some drops of cleaner on it, wet the brush and rub the brush against it to efficiently get the makeup out from the centre).</li>
            <li>but i really do and love it ,amazing for foundation application .</li>
            <li>It is a nice soft brush and nice quality.</li>
            <li>this brush is just as good as any high end brush.</li>
            <li>So soft and nice- my friend tried to take it from me!</li>
            <li>brush is super soft and is great for very quick coverage of liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super soft, and the price was great</li>
            <li>The best part is that the little hairs on the brush don&#x27;t get stuck to my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just a cheap foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I use this brush everyday and its works great for applying foundation!</li>
            <li>Now I am no professional makeup artist, but for an average woman who needs a great foundation brush- this is perfect!</li>
            <li>This is great brush, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>But this is a great brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>but it was a cheap brush</li>
            <li>Works really good , feels soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and good handle.  </li>
            <li>I really like !!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure using a brush to apply my liquid foundation would make much difference, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a brush!  </li>
            <li>Ugh I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li>this one I love more because it&#x27;s more substantial and has a bigger handle.</li>
            <li>Seems the only thing china is good at making is cheap china trash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So Soff and leaves your face looking super smooth</li>
            <li>My advice is to pay more for a blending brush that is real, not synthetic.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the smooth finish.</li>
            <li>You will love it just as much as i did.</li>
            <li>The shipping was much faster than expected, and the difference in applying makeup is incredible.  </li>
            <li>, i most likely wont buy anymore from here, and could have done a better job myself i feel.</li>
            <li>Super comparible to sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
            <li>You definitely get more than what you pay for!</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth your money.</li>
            <li>So worth to money.</li>
            <li>I freaking love this brush so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>The reviews are right on this one.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft and none have fallen out so far!</li>
            <li>Typically I use the standard makeup brushes for my liquid foundation, but a friend told me that this kind with the flatter top is really the bomb for smoother and more even coverage.</li>
            <li>My little sister ordered this on my account because she was looking for a better way to apply foundation, rather than use the sponge applicator that comes with many of the store-bought foundations she has.</li>
            <li>product came sooner than expected, really soft, smells chemically, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li>It feels very nice on the skin and lacks nothing compared to more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>Very high quality brush!</li>
            <li>but i did the same routine with a different makeup brush and my foundation came out flawless with no dry spots.</li>
            <li>My hand actually blends better than this brush.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>i have dropped my walmart brand brushes from a higher distance than that</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived!</li>
            <li>but i must say that when it came i instantly fell in love with it</li>
            <li>Will actually purchase more brushes.</li>
            <li>Good brush, I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li>what did I really expect right?</li>
            <li>I will recommend anyone to use a flat top brush for applying in foundation.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a Flat top brush</li>
            <li>I began my search and soon found this flat top Kabuki brush in a very decent price range.</li>
            <li>At first i wasnt sure if it was the brush or my face being too dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m practicing my makeup application for my big wedding and this is making things easy.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>its soft no fall out of hairs haven&#x27;t had it that long to really give my honest opinion on it.</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft and works really well.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast &amp; it feels so Soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>For such a low price, this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>But for $3, I can&#x27;t complain too much...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>It blends really well</li>
            <li>Gentle and pleasing on my skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast, the brush is really soft!</li>
            <li>Seriously don&#x27;t buy other 30-50$ makeup brushes when you can get one just as good for a steal!!</li>
            <li>It also buff in my powder foundation real well giving mr fuller coverage than any high end brush I&#x27;ve use.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, very soft yet firm bristles.  </li>
            <li>when using this brush to smooth the foundation in it ended up making my foundation dry and clumpy around my eyes and nose area.</li>
            <li>High quality surprisingly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely soft, and really really affordable.</li>
            <li>Liked them enough to buy extra for motor home and future.</li>
            <li>i will order a few more.</li>
            <li>Thank you Ailunce for providing such a high quality brush for a very affordable price!</li>
            <li>Not a good look, especially when you walk out the door and the natural light hits your face....Not cute.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and applies makeup evenly.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my go to foundation applicator besides the beauty blender;)</li>
            <li>She loves this brush and I&#x27;ve noticed her makeup gets applied more evenly and doesn&#x27;t look caked on as it has in the past.</li>
            <li>Although it did take long to get in the mail, but te wait was worth it.</li>
            <li>The shipping was a bit slow but the product is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Smelled a bit funny when it first came</li>
            <li>Soft and held together well, not stiff</li>
            <li>Brush is soft, doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>buy a few more in the near future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and so far has not given me any fall outs at all.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly very affordable and I will definitely be purchasing from here again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and blends well, and I never get streaks.</li>
            <li>Brush was so soft and provides even application.</li>
            <li>This one does come directly from China (not a brand name)</li>
            <li>The brush is soooo soft onmy skin.</li>
            <li>its so soft</li>
            <li>This brush actually surprised me.</li>
            <li>So far all the bristles are intact, so no shedding, and the bristles are still soft as ever.</li>
            <li>I was worried it wasn&#x27;t going to be soft</li>
            <li>, the only difference is that the sigma bristles are more firm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeously thick and soft and sooo smooth almost akin to the mac brush!</li>
            <li>I use much less foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t settle into my dry patches or fine lines at all!  </li>
            <li>Although a few bristles have fallen off, it was very worth the price.</li>
            <li>and i love how by putting a little fondation on the brush goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and bristles still fall out consistently; I bought a new brush already.</li>
            <li>I wash it and its back to new ...</li>
            <li>so i didnt loose much.</li>
            <li>I always apply primer before i apply foundation just because I dont like the thought of my bare face touchingg foundation and</li>
            <li>I recently paid $30 for a Bare Minerals one and</li>
            <li>soft but didnt work for my dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Very nice brush but doesn&#x27;t work well with liquid foundation :(</li>

            <li> shipping was faster than expected, great product, great quality.</li>
            <li> so glad I ordered 2 of them.</li>

            <li> Love it.üòç</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH.</li>
            <li> my favorite brush&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the texture of it as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> Better than my Mac brush this size for a portion of the price</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It more than deserves it at this</li>
            <li> but im glad I ordered it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been reaching for my beauty blender which is pretty good.</li>
            <li> great to apply finishing matte powder over foundation, really soft bristles</li>
            <li> So far im happy</li>
            <li> So soft and dense, great foundation brush.</li>
            <li> It washes very easily (best to use some sort of scrubby item like those handheld brush scrubbers where you place some drops of cleaner on it, wet the brush and rub the brush against it to efficiently get the makeup out from the centre).</li>
            <li> but i really do and love it ,amazing for foundation application .</li>
            <li> It is a nice soft brush and nice quality.</li>
            <li> this brush is just as good as any high end brush.</li>
            <li> So soft and nice- my friend tried to take it from me!</li>
            <li> brush is super soft and is great for very quick coverage of liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super soft, and the price was great</li>
            <li> The best part is that the little hairs on the brush don&#x27;t get stuck to my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a cheap foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday and its works great for applying foundation!</li>
            <li> Now I am no professional makeup artist, but for an average woman who needs a great foundation brush- this is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is great brush, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> But this is a great brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> but it was a cheap brush</li>
            <li> Works really good , feels soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and good handle.  </li>
            <li> I really like !!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure using a brush to apply my liquid foundation would make much difference, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a brush!  </li>
            <li> Ugh I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li> this one I love more because it&#x27;s more substantial and has a bigger handle.</li>
            <li> Seems the only thing china is good at making is cheap china trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So Soff and leaves your face looking super smooth</li>
            <li> My advice is to pay more for a blending brush that is real, not synthetic.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the smooth finish.</li>
            <li> You will love it just as much as i did.</li>
            <li> The shipping was much faster than expected, and the difference in applying makeup is incredible.  </li>
            <li> , i most likely wont buy anymore from here, and could have done a better job myself i feel.</li>
            <li> Super comparible to sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
            <li> You definitely get more than what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth your money.</li>
            <li> So worth to money.</li>
            <li> I freaking love this brush so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> The reviews are right on this one.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft and none have fallen out so far!</li>
            <li> Typically I use the standard makeup brushes for my liquid foundation, but a friend told me that this kind with the flatter top is really the bomb for smoother and more even coverage.</li>
            <li> My little sister ordered this on my account because she was looking for a better way to apply foundation, rather than use the sponge applicator that comes with many of the store-bought foundations she has.</li>
            <li> product came sooner than expected, really soft, smells chemically, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> It feels very nice on the skin and lacks nothing compared to more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Very high quality brush!</li>
            <li> but i did the same routine with a different makeup brush and my foundation came out flawless with no dry spots.</li>
            <li> My hand actually blends better than this brush.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> i have dropped my walmart brand brushes from a higher distance than that</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived!</li>
            <li> but i must say that when it came i instantly fell in love with it</li>
            <li> Will actually purchase more brushes.</li>
            <li> Good brush, I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> what did I really expect right?</li>
            <li> I will recommend anyone to use a flat top brush for applying in foundation.</li>

            <li> It also buff in my powder foundation real well giving mr fuller coverage than any high end brush I&#x27;ve use.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, very soft yet firm bristles.  </li>
            <li> when using this brush to smooth the foundation in it ended up making my foundation dry and clumpy around my eyes and nose area.</li>
            <li> High quality surprisingly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely soft, and really really affordable.</li>
            <li> Liked them enough to buy extra for motor home and future.</li>
            <li> i will order a few more.</li>
            <li> Thank you Ailunce for providing such a high quality brush for a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> Not a good look, especially when you walk out the door and the natural light hits your face....Not cute.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and applies makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my go to foundation applicator besides the beauty blender;)</li>
            <li> She loves this brush and I&#x27;ve noticed her makeup gets applied more evenly and doesn&#x27;t look caked on as it has in the past.</li>
            <li> Although it did take long to get in the mail, but te wait was worth it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was a bit slow but the product is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Smelled a bit funny when it first came</li>

            <li> The brush is soooo soft onmy skin.</li>
            <li> its so soft</li>
            <li> This brush actually surprised me.</li>
            <li> So far all the bristles are intact, so no shedding, and the bristles are still soft as ever.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wasn&#x27;t going to be soft</li>
            <li> , the only difference is that the sigma bristles are more firm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeously thick and soft and sooo smooth almost akin to the mac brush!</li>
            <li> I use much less foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t settle into my dry patches or fine lines at all!  </li>
            <li> Although a few bristles have fallen off, it was very worth the price.</li>
            <li> and i love how by putting a little fondation on the brush goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and bristles still fall out consistently; I bought a new brush already.</li>
            <li> I wash it and its back to new ...</li>
            <li> so i didnt loose much.</li>
            <li> I always apply primer before i apply foundation just because I dont like the thought of my bare face touchingg foundation and</li>
            <li> I recently paid $30 for a Bare Minerals one and</li>
            <li> soft but didnt work for my dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Very nice brush but doesn&#x27;t work well with liquid foundation :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a high end brush, for less.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Shany set and it had one of those flat brushes for foundation.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is don&#x27;t even bother trying to clean it because the little bristles WILL fall out.</li>
            <li> Im a little disappointed with all the great reviews</li>
            <li> Theres no seamless blending with this brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> a lil bit goes a long way,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not soft at all.</li>
            <li> Shipping didn&#x27;t take long at all</li>
            <li> Arrived in great time and for the price insanely a steal!</li>
            <li> The handle on mine is very loose and it will come undone sometimes as I&#x27;m using it to put on my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> Not cheap Chinese s</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it because it&#x27;s rough on my face</li>
            <li> It came in and sooner than what i had expected.</li>
            <li> There were a few long pieces on the brush</li>
            <li> This brush works like any other from Mac or Sephora  but doesn&#x27;t cost you 30 dollars&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was skeptical to get this brush at first due to its price</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> These worked well for me only complaint would be they shed a little.</li>
            <li> It took a month and a half to receive</li>
            <li> i received this item, i used it once, it rolled off the coffee table and dropped about 1 foot where it broke in half.</li>
            <li> but I can still smell it a little.</li>
            <li> The bristles do absorb some makeup so a little is wasted</li>
            <li> i am unhappy but am going to pinch the metal band back around the wooden handle and hope that it holds!!!</li>
            <li> I use It everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of goat hair.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> one complaint is that it smells a little odd.  </li>
            <li> Made my foundation looked dry and unappealing.</li>
            <li> It worked well for applying foundation and blending, but hairs were constantly falling out and making application difficult.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the weird smell..</li>
            <li> I would guess that at least 80% of the brushes on here are made there.  </li>
            <li> Since I had read a review in which someone complained about the shipping speed I was expecting it to take a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> It makes m face smell a little weird..</li>
            <li> It was broken when I got  it and came late.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m already obsessed!</li>
            <li> i had read all the bad comments</li>
            <li> otherwise i might not have been so unhappy about this situation!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works fairly well. My only complaint is don&#x27;t even bother trying to clean it because the little bristles WILL fall out. The handle on mine is very loose and it will come undone sometimes as I&#x27;m using it to put on my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;To me, this brush is shorter than the picture that they provide.&lt;br /&gt;The price is what sold me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a cheap foundation brush. Nothing to it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Great brush for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Best Kabuki brush I ever owned. Brush is soft, doesn&#x27;t fall out. Brushes foundation on smoothly, Very satisfied with this. I will def. buy a few more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I looove loove loved this! It&#x27;s gorgeously thick and soft and sooo smooth almost akin to the mac brush! Arrived in great time and for the price insanely a steal!</li>
            <li> This brush leaves your makeup flawless! It&#x27;s soft and so far has not given me any fall outs at all. It&#x27;s honestly great quality and a great prize too.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles . Bristles stay in tact.</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft and works really well. It&#x27;s clearly very affordable and I will definitely be purchasing from here again!</li>
            <li> My brush just came in and I love it it&#x27;s super soft, and the price was great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE&lt;br /&gt;GOOD BRUSH !</li>
            <li> I feel like it just keeps moving the makeup around my face. But for $3, I can&#x27;t complain too much...what did I really expect right? My advice is to pay more for a blending brush that is real, not synthetic. Stick to the name brands. Not cheap Chinese s***. Seems the only thing china is good at making is cheap china trash. Keep the trash in China. Go to Sephora and go buy one from there. There&#x27;s no such thing as saving money when it comes to quality. Quality is quality for a reason. My hand actually blends better than this brush. When I use it, it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a mask. Theres no seamless blending with this brush what so ever. It just looks like I stippled skin colored paint all over my face. Not a good look, especially when you walk out the door and the natural light hits your face....Not cute.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for the price! Fast shipping. Will be ordering another one for sure!</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my foundation and I love it! It&#x27;s very smooth. There were a few long pieces on the brush but I clipped them off and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding.</li>
            <li> This brush is so awesome i really recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush. It puts on the foundation perfectly. I love makeup and I love ho this brush doesn&#x27;t soak up Tue foundation</li>
            <li> Great value for the money..use it every morning! The bristles are nice and soft and none have fallen out so far!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t expect to recieve an amazing brush but i really do and love it ,amazing for foundation application .</li>
            <li> The shipping was a bit slow but the product is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Smelled a bit funny when it first came but after a wash it was a-okay!</li>
            <li> These worked well for me only complaint would be they shed a little. Liked them enough to buy extra for motor home and future. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> arrived on time. love this brush! the quality is great. i will order a few more.</li>
            <li> Handle loosens after a week.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BRUSH !</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure using a brush to apply my liquid foundation would make much difference, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a brush!  I found this one and decided to take a chance.  The shipping was much faster than expected, and the difference in applying makeup is incredible.  I use much less foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t settle into my dry patches or fine lines at all!  I&#x27;m sold on foundation brushes, and the fact that this one was so reasonably priced and good quality makes this purchase even better!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Amazing price.</li>
            <li> I loved it!!! i love the softness of it the feeling on my face was great and spreads the foundation very well.. definetly recommend to others. price, cant complain</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday and its works great for applying foundation!</li>
            <li> Great brush! I&#x27;ve had it for months and it doesn&#x27;t shed at all. It&#x27;s soft and blends well, and I never get streaks.</li>
            <li> Overall a great brush! Although when received it has many many fall outs but once they&#x27;re all gone it&#x27;s a great brush !</li>
            <li> I initially ordered this to use as a powder brush but instead I use it as a liquid foundation brush and its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;- Soft and held together well, not stiff&lt;br /&gt;- Looks exactly as pictured&lt;br /&gt;- High quality surprisingly!&lt;br /&gt;- Came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for a great price. It feels very nice on the skin and lacks nothing compared to more expensive brushes. Glad I bought it and would buy it again. ~//~ Excelente escova por um pre√ßo excelente. Deixa uma sensa√ß√£o muito agrad&amp;aacute;vel sobre a pele e n√£o falta nada em compara√ß√£o com escovas mais caras. Estou contente de t√™-la comprado e compraria novamente.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, professional product and feels good to the touch, flawless application for the price, so glad I didn&#x27;t  pay 25 for a Mac brush...</li>
            <li> Brush was so soft and provides even application. Love it! Downfall.... It took a month and a half to receive</li>
            <li> This brush is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for your make-up collection.  It allows your liquid make-up to leave a completely flawless face.</li>
            <li> I have never use a brush to apply on my foundation. Once I tried this brush, you can see the difference of the coverage. I will recommend anyone to use a flat top brush for applying in foundation.</li>
            <li> this is a great brush, nice coverage and you dont need to get a lot of product on the brush a lil bit goes a long way,</li>
            <li> just got this brush a week or two ago and i&#x27;m already obsessed! SO SOFT and great for applying liquid foundation and blending contour!</li>
            <li> Love it! Don&#x27;t hesitate to get It hahaha</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture. I would purchase this makeup brush again. Love it!</li>
            <li> The reviews are right on this one.  Do not hesitate to buy it. It is great brush, very soft but works amazingly well. I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is made in China but so is everything.  I would guess that at least 80% of the brushes on here are made there.  This one does come directly from China (not a brand name) so you do need to wait for it.  It took about 10 days to arrive.  Since I had read a review in which someone complained about the shipping speed I was expecting it to take a lot longer.  I was pleased with the shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that it smells a little odd.  I washed it and that seemed to help.</li>
            <li> product came sooner than expected, really soft, smells chemically, but it&#x27;s still a great product. Goes great with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Ugh I love this brush so much! It&#x27;s like a high end brush, for less. Worth every penny and so much more!!!</li>
            <li> It was broken when I got  it and came late.</li>
            <li> shipping was faster than expected, great product, great quality. i recommend this don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> Wonderful so glad I ordered 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush with a great price. The brush is very soft and applies makeup evenly. I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for the price you pay i had read all the bad comments but my brush didn&#x27;t do that at all I like to use my brush for my mousse fondation but it works good with liquid to and also I use it to go over my bronzer so I defenetly recommend</li>
            <li> A very soft brush that is perfect on your skin, and did arrive as promised.</li>
            <li> Works really good , feels soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I just started experimenting with makeup brushing, and love this brush.</li>
            <li> Typically I use the standard makeup brushes for my liquid foundation, but a friend told me that this kind with the flatter top is really the bomb for smoother and more even coverage. I began my search and soon found this flat top Kabuki brush in a very decent price range. I could tell by the picture that it appeared to be good quality but I had no idea how good until I received it! I have used it every day for one week and there has been zero shedding which is always a good indicator of a quality brush. Thank you Ailunce for providing such a high quality brush for a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> Works great! Blends my foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife and she LOVED it.  Would order again</li>
            <li> This brush is great, it does what it needs to do it evenly applies my foundation and when used in a stippling motion it creates a really flawless application. This is definitely my go to foundation applicator besides the beauty blender;)</li>
            <li> I saw these online for $12- $30 and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me. I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money so I decided to get this one. I am SO GLAD I did! It is a nice soft brush and nice quality. Now I am no professional makeup artist, but for an average woman who needs a great foundation brush- this is perfect!</li>
            <li> i received this item, i used it once, it rolled off the coffee table and dropped about 1 foot where it broke in half. i have dropped my walmart brand brushes from a higher distance than that and they have remained intact. when i looked in the handle of the brush the only thing holding it together was in inadequate amount of what looks like wood glue...i could have made this brush myself, i most likely wont buy anymore from here, and could have done a better job myself i feel. i am unhappy but am going to pinch the metal band back around the wooden handle and hope that it holds!!! i waited almost a month for delivery otherwise i might not have been so unhappy about this situation!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I use It everyday. Super comparible to sigma brushes. I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 4 months now and have cleaned it multiple times . No shedding and washes really nicely . Defiantly worth your money.</li>
            <li> this brush is just as good as any high end brush. good quality.</li>
            <li> I have tons of acne and this brush covered it amazingly and makes my skin look flawless and airbrushed!! Seriously don&#x27;t buy other 30-50$ makeup brushes when you can get one just as good for a steal!! So worth to money.</li>
            <li> soft blends make up in wonderfully and evenly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not soft at all. I don&#x27;t even use it because it&#x27;s rough on my face but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it to apply foundation. It blends really well and it&#x27;s super affordable. The best part is that the little hairs on the brush don&#x27;t get stuck to my face.</li>
            <li> My little sister ordered this on my account because she was looking for a better way to apply foundation, rather than use the sponge applicator that comes with many of the store-bought foundations she has. She loves this brush and I&#x27;ve noticed her makeup gets applied more evenly and doesn&#x27;t look caked on as it has in the past.</li>
            <li> soft but didnt work for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I ordered a Shany set and it had one of those flat brushes for foundation. Waste of goat hair. The bristles do absorb some makeup so a little is wasted but it&#x27;s worth the smooth finish. I washed it wish dishwashing liquid and it cleaned up well. I can&#x27;t do without it. I&#x27;m practicing my makeup application for my big wedding and this is making things easy. Love it, love it. love it. (wife)</li>
            <li> This brush blends my foundation flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Very high quality brush! Works well with liquid foundation and does not leave streaks. It also makes my foundation look very smooth and airbrushed. You definitely get more than what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Love it! Just got it today! Soft bristles and good handle.  It makes m face smell a little weird.. Might be my makeup though</li>
            <li> I love this brush will recommend</li>
            <li> Love it! It came in and sooner than what i had expected. Was worried to buy it but when i read the reviews, i had to try it. I smelled it and mine didnt hav a funky smell at all. The brush is soooo soft onmy skin. The hairs on my brush did not come off. I recommend anyone to buy this! You will love it just as much as i did. My friend noticed my face was flawless when i went to work and asked me what new makeup did i buy? Its that great!</li>
            <li> Nice quality, very soft yet firm bristles.  Densely packed.  Gentle and pleasing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great brush I use it everyday. I wash it and its back to new ... Great product .... This brush works like any other from Mac or Sephora  but doesn&#x27;t cost you 30 dollars&lt;br /&gt; I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very very good  I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So Soff and leaves your face looking super smooth</li>
            <li> I freaking love this brush so soft. Leave my liquid foundation with an airbrush finish. It also buff in my powder foundation real well giving mr fuller coverage than any high end brush I&#x27;ve use. Love it.üòç</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived! This is great brush, especially for the price! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> AWESOME BRUSH!!!&lt;br /&gt;works soooo good better than my $30 brushes..... looove it and its soooo cheap....best purchase</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast, the brush is really soft! I use it to set my under eye concealer with banana powder, but I&#x27;m gonna try to use it to apply my liquid foundation, hope it works as well as it does for setting my undereyes !</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ive tried! its so soft</li>
            <li> i like it..but the bristles on this brush sometimes fall off..other than that its a good brush for the price,</li>
            <li> Jjust what I need, very good brush and great price!!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical to get this brush at first due to its price but i must say that when it came i instantly fell in love with it</li>
            <li> This brush works wonders! I was surprised, because I didn&#x27;t think a brush that was $3 Wouk work this great! Although it did take long to get in the mail, but te wait was worth it.</li>
            <li> great to apply finishing matte powder over foundation, really soft bristles</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 out five its soft no fall out of hairs haven&#x27;t had it that long to really give my honest opinion on it. Shipping didn&#x27;t take long at all and you can&#x27;t beat the price. So far im happy</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH. I haven&#x27;t been reaching for my beauty blender which is pretty good. this blush blends well and it&#x27;s extremely soft, and really really affordable. I think I&#x27;m buying more of these brushes instead of a beauty blender which is expensive</li>
            <li> Great brush and cheap</li>
            <li> Amazing deal on a brush!  I recently paid $30 for a Bare Minerals one and this one I love more because it&#x27;s more substantial and has a bigger handle.</li>
            <li> my favorite brush&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This brush actually surprised me. I have the sigma brush and this is compared to that, the only difference is that the sigma bristles are more firm. But this is a great brush, especially for the price. Shipping was awesome as well. Will actually purchase more brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for daily use. The bristles are super soft and don&#x27;t shed at all. I&#x27;ve been using this brush for three weeks and have been deep cleaning it every week. So far all the bristles are intact, so no shedding, and the bristles are still soft as ever. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> This brush allows me to apply my foundation flawlessly. I am in love with the texture of it as well</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Flat top brush and I found this one. It arrived super fast &amp; it feels so Soft on your skin. I&#x27;m in love with it. I totally recommend it. It&#x27;s really worth it. P</li>
            <li> So soft and nice- my friend tried to take it from me! Although a few bristles have fallen off, it was very worth the price.</li>
            <li> Better than my Mac brush this size for a portion of the price</li>
            <li> This brush did not work for me... Didnt blend well at all. Made my foundation looked dry and unappealing. I always apply primer before i apply foundation just because I dont like the thought of my bare face touchingg foundation and when using this brush to smooth the foundation in it ended up making my foundation dry and clumpy around my eyes and nose area. At first i wasnt sure if it was the brush or my face being too dry but i did the same routine with a different makeup brush and my foundation came out flawless with no dry spots. Im a little disappointed with all the great reviews but it was a cheap brush so i didnt loose much. I bought 3 at the time and threw all 3 away.</li>
            <li> For such a low price, this brush is amazing. It&#x27;s so soft, blends my foundation flawlessly and leaves no brush marks. Do not hesitate to buy. I will order again!</li>
            <li> So soft and dense, great foundation brush. It blends out foundation very nicely and it gives an air brush finish!</li>
            <li> Good brush, I use it everyday now. It is so soft and is the perfect foundation brush!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t recived my brush yet, I&#x27;ve been waiting for a while now. can I get what I paid for ??</li>
            <li> If I could rate no stars I would my brush arrived in pieces don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush I love it.</li>
            <li> i love this brush it applies the foundation flawlessly and i love how by putting a little fondation on the brush goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Very nice brush but doesn&#x27;t work well with liquid foundation :( still on the search for a good one .</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my face!</li>
            <li> It worked well for applying foundation and blending, but hairs were constantly falling out and making application difficult. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and bristles still fall out consistently; I bought a new brush already.</li>
            <li> Love it! Does not shed at all! Blends beautifully!</li>
            <li> Update just under three years later (July 2017) -- I&#x27;m STILL using this for my liquid foundation! It&#x27;s lasted and hasn&#x27;t even shedded in any way. Bristles still as they were. And it&#x27;s my &#x27;dirtiest&#x27; brush, being used for foundation daily. It washes very easily (best to use some sort of scrubby item like those handheld brush scrubbers where you place some drops of cleaner on it, wet the brush and rub the brush against it to efficiently get the makeup out from the centre). Still a great product and I&#x27;m upping the star rating to five. It more than deserves it at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is super soft and is great for very quick coverage of liquid foundation. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for the price. My only complaint is the weird smell.. I cleaned it and it helped some but I can still smell it a little. Hopefully it will fade as I use it</li>
            <li> I was worried it wasn&#x27;t going to be soft but im glad I ordered it I really like !!!</li>
