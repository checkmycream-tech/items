            <li> Product seems like it s not original</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering this product with high hopes it wouldn&#x27;t leak all over during shipping....big mistake. Don&#x27;t order this unless you want a big mess.</li>
            <li> This is not USDA Organic. This is most likely not even organic. It has a very weak strength. Avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Nice, earthy clary sage!</li>
            <li> Excellent for premenstrual cramps</li>
            <li> No smell at all. I was very disappointed with this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. So this product came well packaged in bubble wrap so you don&#x27;t need to worry about it arriving broken. Also you could easily smell the flowery/ grassy smell of the sage even without diffusing it and just smelling it in the bottle. It came with a little dropper so you can easily measure out the correct amount of oil to diffuse. The Clary Sage itself smells great and has that flowery/ grassy smell. It really helps to calm you down and get rid of your stress. Also it will leave a nice smell in your house for hours after your done diffusing it which I really enjoyed. I wouldn&#x27;t say it has an overpowering smell and it actually is quite subtle, and has just enough kick to get the job done. Overall my family loved this oil and thought it smelt great and really helped to put you in a good mood. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you look up all the uses for Clary Sage oil, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s basically the jack-of-all trades essential oil. Looking up what it doesn&#x27;t do will probably take less time. Be that as it may, I went ahead and tried this for its most mundane use - dandruff. Supposedly, clary sage oil interacts with the scalp to reduce dandruff somehow. Magically. But not overnight, apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while my dandruff issues are still alive and well, keeping Head and Shoulders firmly in business, I&#x27;m still applying the oil. Why you ask? Because it feels darn nice AND the smell of it in the shower makes all of the stresses of the day just melt away. I shower at night (thanks, kids!) and it puts me to sleep. if you&#x27;re a night-shower-er like I am, try dropping a little of this in your shower before you turn on the hot water. You will be absolutely amazed at how relaxed and ready for bed you feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Tis oil is very nice and a great deal for the size. Thank you! I will be buying  more.</li>
            <li> Really like the product</li>
            <li> Very nice product! Great price!</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Smells like Clear Sage should and I am trying this brand for the first time hoping it will be satisfactory.  I will&lt;br /&gt;Do a follow - up to report later.  I have used Clary Sage for quit some time and know what to expect.  Delivery was quick and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;F/ U  July 2015 this oil is very weak strength or too diluted?  Does not provide benefits I was looking for.  Will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I just did not enjoy the scent</li>
            <li> I really like using this Clary Sage in my diffuser. It is a popular aphrodisiac and great for its antibacterial properties as well. I personally just enjoy the scent. Diffusing it leaves my house smelling fresh and I have received many compliments when I mix it with eucalyptus and a drop of lemongrass. It always puts me in a better mood and I plan to continue use often. I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this oil!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sun Organic purchase, though I have been buying organic essential oils for many years.

            <li> Smells ready medicinal. I&#x27;m not sure what clary sage is suppose to smell like but I have encountered a lot of fake essential oils on amazon and this one seems real but it is definitely diluted. The smell is not that strong and several of the other oils I have purchased from this brand were diluted.</li>
            <li> I like using this in a diffuser</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Great Price</li>
