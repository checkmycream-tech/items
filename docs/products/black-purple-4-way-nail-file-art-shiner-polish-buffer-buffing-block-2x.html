    <ol>
            <li>Just what I wanted...works great and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Nice sanding block!</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Sanding blocks work nicely and came as they said they would</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s a two-pack for when I finish using the 1st one.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I use them all the time after I cute my nails.</li>
            <li>They are all right ,but I&#x27;ve seen better</li>
            <li>but all in all, so far this is working nicely</li>
            <li>These are very abrasive ,cut the side e of my finger with it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read reviews before I purchased since a &amp;#34;4-way&amp;#34; shiner and buffer seemed pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>Gave as a stocking stuffer, wife has liked them in the past</li>
            <li>It feels like high grade sand paper, or grip tape from a skateboard.</li>
            <li>Not at all what is described, more like only one level of grit which should only be used for acrylic nails or another surface that requires sandpaper (not your natural nails!).</li>
            <li>I have since ordered another nail buffer from the same manufacturer of my old nail buffer.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good grade for sanding acrylics (just a little tough to get into the edges of the nail)</li>
            <li>This file is very rough, it takes several layers off of your nail making it very flimsy and breakable.</li>
            <li>Black sides are all same roughness (very), purple side is just foam material.</li>

            <li> All sides are ROUGH...</li>
            <li> Rough enough to get my nails prepped for painting, without hurting my cuticles (unless I scrub too hard to remove some remaining polish).</li>
            <li> This is not good for natural nails; it is made to take down the length of artificial nais; but I don&#x27;t think this is made clear in the description.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they made these out of</li>

            <li> A waste of money, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Poorly advertised.</li>
            <li> Horrible so rough</li>
            <li> Seriously just awful</li>
            <li> Tried one time and my nails were so scratched :-(  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> These are terrible!</li>
            <li> The product is horrible and I will throw them away!  </li>

            <li> I was hoping this would be similar to the Revlon buffer, with different degrees of abrasiveness on each side.  It is NOT. All sides are ROUGH...This is not good for natural nails; it is made to take down the length of artificial nais; but I don&#x27;t think this is made clear in the description.</li>
            <li> I expected these files to have a different texture on each side, but all three sides  were all course.</li>

            <li> Sanding blocks work nicely and came as they said they would</li>
            <li> These are very abrasive ,cut the side e of my finger with it! Same texture on all sides.</li>
            <li> Horrible so rough I almostade a hole in my nail. Does not buff natural nails leaves them dull and rough.</li>
            <li> These are terrible! It feels like they are going to sand off your nails. I&#x27;m not sure what they made these out of but it is not proper nail files. It feels like high grade sand paper, or grip tape from a skateboard. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> They are all right ,but I&#x27;ve seen better</li>
            <li> It does not deserve any stars!  The product is horrible and I will throw them away!  Tried one time and my nails were so scratched :-(  I have used several nail buffers over the years, but this product needs to be removed from Amazon.  I have since ordered another nail buffer from the same manufacturer of my old nail buffer.</li>
            <li> Very nice. A bit of every type of nail buffer you could ask for.</li>
            <li> Black sides are all same roughness (very), purple side is just foam material. Definitely not a 4-way file.</li>
