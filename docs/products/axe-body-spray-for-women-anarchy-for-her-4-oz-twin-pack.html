            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a spray perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like something I&#x27;ve never smelled before, strong but light!</li>
            <li>My new favorite body spray!!</li>

            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>I love this scent because it&#x27;s mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>My husband had been a huge AXE body spray fan for years.</li>

            <li>Smells great, I spray my workout clothes prior to working out, and after working out.</li>
            <li>Love it&#x27;s smell and is pretty strong during sweating.</li>
            <li>They shipped pretty quickly and they smell AMAZINGGG!</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a strong scent right as first, but it quickly goes to a soft/perfect scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Twist the top, spray, twist it back to close and throw it in the gym bag.</li>
            <li>First time I ever used an Axe product.</li>
            <li>However, I feel the bottle runs out very fast even though I&#x27;m not using that much.</li>
            <li>Not only do I have the ability to just throw it in a bag and not worry about it, but the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item to any lady.</li>
            <li>Originally got this as a free sample ... very hard to find.</li>
            <li>Its a whole new smell, completely different from anything else.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong but not overwhelming</li>
            <li>the only scent my 15 year old daughter wears.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i bought this as a body spray for the sandalwood fragrance. i found it smelled nothing like sandalwood and was an unpleasant and strong scent  i&#x27;m gonna give Eclectic Lady another try and chalk this up as a $9 dollar mistake. I can&#x27;t even think of anyone I&#x27;d give it away to, it&#x27;s so unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My new favorite body spray!! looooove it!</li>
            <li> My husband had been a huge AXE body spray fan for years. I loved the convenience of the product. Twist the top, spray, twist it back to close and throw it in the gym bag. But for me, I always had to take my pump body spray and hope it wouldn&#x27;t get crushed. Now AXE has body sprays for her? WaHoo! One less thing to worry about. Not only do I have the ability to just throw it in a bag and not worry about it, but the scent is fantastic. It has a bit of a strong scent right as first, but it quickly goes to a soft/perfect scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. Love this body spray.</li>
