            <li>This is the best, makes your hair thick and full, not greasy and smells great...</li>
            <li>This Flocker works great on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>NICK&#x27;S PRODUCTS ARE SO EASILY TO USE</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with no texture.</li>
            <li>works great on short hair</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job holding your hair without making your hair feel sticky or weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I love it for my fine blonde hair.use sparingly.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every cent</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and have never used a product that I&#x27;ve been happy with...until now.</li>
            <li>If u must try use VERY sparingly!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for fine, flat and possibly shorter hair than mine.</li>
            <li>I only use this for special occasions, and I really recommend it to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>you are using too much and not styling properly.&lt;br /&gt;Wet</li>
            <li>So much body.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I think you truly do have to experiment a few times to figure out how much to use for your own hair.</li>
            <li>Work great only takes a small amount</li>
            <li>It constantly adds volume at the top and it keeps a blow dry much longer.</li>
            <li>This works very well, but make sure that you start off with a small amount, maybe dime size.  </li>
            <li>Very soft silky feeling to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Worked</li>
            <li>Things can definitely get &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; if you use too much though!</li>
            <li>or dry hair (Dry, gives a more wild look, whereas applying to wet hair, when your hair dries it looks more natural wavy/volumized) only use about a thumbprint size.  </li>
            <li>My hair is short and fine; I use the Flocker as a finishing styling aid on dry hair.</li>
            <li>I hardly ever write reviews, but this one I just had to share :-)</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow - definition, major volume, shine, no frizz</li>
            <li>not only was it golden yellow in color instead of off white</li>
            <li>As I read in other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product, which helps as it is a bit pricey!</li>
            <li>Works very well, all you have to do is fluff hair to get style back.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for this product at all seems to weigh the hair down to much.</li>
            <li>I blow my  hair almost dry then use Soft a flicker by Nick Chavez then style with dryer.</li>
            <li>and I like to let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>A little too heavy and greasy for fine hair.  </li>

            <li> A little too heavy and greasy for fine hair.  Weighs it down.  If u must try use VERY sparingly!</li>
            <li> NICK&#x27;S PRODUCTS ARE SO EASILY TO USE BUT, THIS IS THE BEST YET, RUB IT ON YOUR HANDS AND JUST RUB IT INTO YOU HAIR AND YOU JUST ABOUT STYLE YOU HAIR WITH YOUR HANDS, NO ODOR, NOT STICKY, NOT GREASES OT MESSY.  PLEASE PURCHASE THIS PRODUCTS AND YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and I have tried every product and brand under the sun to give my hair volume.  Everything from Tresemme volumizing mousse, Redken volumizer gel, and Paul Mitchell shampoos and styling products.  NOTHING WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;My aunt introduced me to this product, because we have the same type of hair, and I have used this product for years!  If your hair looks dirty or it weighs your hair down you are using too much and not styling properly.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry hair (Dry, gives a more wild look, whereas applying to wet hair, when your hair dries it looks more natural wavy/volumized) only use about a thumbprint size.  This product works! The best hair product I have ever used and this is my 5th purchase of this product.  I hardly ever write reviews, but this one I just had to share :-)</li>
            <li> works great on short hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this because in the past I have purchased from Nick Chavez directly online so I thought this would be the same thing( since it is advertised as same) not only was it golden yellow in color instead of off white but it had been opened and someone had run their finger through it!!! By the time I realized this I had thrown away the packaging. Oh well lesson learned.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this. I blow my  hair almost dry then use Soft a flicker by Nick Chavez then style with dryer. So much body.&lt;br /&gt; I used my Daughters when she visited.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has more body. I&#x27;m 70. No matter my age I want my hair to look nice. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Work great only takes a small amount</li>
            <li> This does a good job piecing my hair.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I have to wash my hair the next day, but in the summer I do that anyway.</li>
            <li> I love his products.  This Flocker works great on my naturally curly hair.  I turn my head over apply a small amount between my hands &amp; apply to scalp.  My hair turns out really Full &amp; the curl is just great.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product on an infomercial and am glad that I purchased it. My hair is short and fine; I use the Flocker as a finishing styling aid on dry hair. It adds style and definition to my hair, but doesn&#x27;t take the place of the products I use to add volume and hold, such as mousse and hairspray. As I read in other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product, which helps as it is a bit pricey!</li>
            <li> This product did not work well on my hair.  It weighed my hair down and made my hair feel very dirty the next day.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> This is good to apply after you&#x27;ve styled you hair to piece it out...it&#x27;s perfect:)</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but this is the best it smells great, and leaves hair manageable while holding the style</li>
            <li> I made my hair dirty looking NOT shiny. Did NOT add volume.. It was a total waste of my money</li>
            <li> I love Nick Chavez hair products  They work! JS</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have thin fine hair and have never used a product that I&#x27;ve been happy with...until now.</li>
            <li> After all these years I still love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and I love it!!</li>
            <li> A little to HEAVY of a hair product for me. It was just OK. I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for fine, flat and possibly shorter hair than mine. It constantly adds volume at the top and it keeps a blow dry much longer. I only use this for special occasions, and I really recommend it to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product at all seems to weigh the hair down to much. It didn&#x27;t give any volume at all.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It gives my hair texture without making it look dirty or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product.  Put it on your fingertips and rub it around to heat it up then run it through the areas of your hair that need taming or that you want to \\&quot;shape\\&quot; or to stay in place.  It does a great job holding your hair without making your hair feel sticky or weighing it down.  Does not make your hair feel greasy either.  You do not need to use a lot of product at one time, so the jar actually lasts a long time.  Have seen this other places but it is cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had this about 2 weeks and have been using it daily and it&#x27;s just amazing for volume, oomph and controlling the frizzies. I have thick, naturally curly and colored hair and I like to let my hair dry naturally. But sometimes although the curl is defined after air drying, it&#x27;s a little flat, but notafter using a 1/4 size scoop of this! All I can say is wow - definition, major volume, shine, no frizz and it stays too. It maybe pricey but it&#x27;s worth every cent and it also smells divine.</li>
            <li> Works very well, all you have to do is fluff hair to get style back. Lasts for days.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as it did on the online models.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It&#x27;s like magic what it does for your hair.  Thank you , thank you!  Everyone should know about this.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dirty.  There are a couple of drug store brands that I like better, so returned the item.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked just like the video showed.  I like that it wasn&#x27;t heavy on the hair and styling was very easy.</li>
            <li> This works very well, but make sure that you start off with a small amount, maybe dime size.  It does have a tendency to make hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with no texture. After seeing what a wonderful job it did for the models on the shopping channel, I thought it would give my hair texture. It did not. It just made my hair look and feel dirty &amp; flat. Does not thicken at all.</li>
            <li> received my order did not open until today. The flocker had dried out a little, I have used b/4 so I know how it should feel, very disappointed  with this jar.</li>
            <li> This is the best, makes your hair thick and full, not greasy and smells great...you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> Was not worth buying.  It made my hair sticky and flat. No volume what so ever.  I will never buy or recommend this product to anyone.  Big disappointment. : (</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Really gives my hair a great lift.</li>
            <li> IF IT MAKES YOUR HAIR LOOK dirty,tfluff andstylehen you are not using it properly.Put it under the top layer of hair,then use fingers hair into place.I love it for my fine blonde hair.use sparingly. WATCH THE INFOMMERCIAL ON TVtolearn how to use.</li>
            <li> Very soft silky feeling to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Worked great on sculpting versatile looks</li>
            <li> This is a great texturizer for me, but I can see that it may not work for everyone. I think you truly do have to experiment a few times to figure out how much to use for your own hair. I like it bc it gives some texture / grit / hold to my roots. I wear my hair up in a claw, and it gives the claw something firmer to hold onto and the clip stays in place better. Things can definitely get &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; if you use too much though!</li>
            <li> My stylist turned me on to this product she had gotten on QVC and I fell in love with it. Body and hold for my short hair without being sticky or heavy. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
