            <li>.......&lt;br /&gt;Price is Good for the item</li>
            <li>All flavors, but spearmint is a really good one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much I loved the colgate wisp until I bought the scope minibrushes.</li>
            <li>Excellent way to freshen your mouth when you don&#x27;t have toothpaste, toothbrush, or water available.  </li>
            <li>Flavor is good.</li>
            <li>The perfect way to keep my teeth clean no matter where.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use a full brush set at work and this was a perfect compromise.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the delivery and quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a sink nearby!</li>
            <li>If your looking for a great strong flavor to knock garlic</li>
            <li>If you want to add your own toothpaste I guess it would work as a toothbrush also.</li>
            <li>The bristles hold up well to vigorous brushing and the lil&#x27; flavor pack that&#x27;s embedded within is effective, albeit foul tasting.</li>
            <li>Nice to buy in volume but</li>
            <li>handy while traveling.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping your teeth clean on the go.  </li>
            <li>For those that have plaque challenges and you need a quick solution in between brushing your teeth, this product works great.</li>
            <li>: Personally, I like Spearmint Wisps the best - but to be fair</li>
            <li>They happily and quickly refunded me.</li>
            <li>and I found it more cost effective to purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>These wisps are better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a container to put it in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend it :) :)</li>
            <li>I love to use the Wisp brushes.</li>
            <li>I keep them in my car, my desk and LOVE to use them on trips.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience and size, but is this a sustainable solution to consumption?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a job where I can brush my teeth at work, and these are the next best thing!</li>
            <li>The spearmint is my favorite flavor and the freshness lasts longer than a stick of gum.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>Spearmint taste OK.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I also love them when I am traveling to use on the airplane when it isn&#x27;t convenient to get to my carry-on bag.</li>
            <li>They are much better than chewing gum after a meal of anytime you want to refresh your mouth.</li>
            <li>And for the price, you couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>I love having one of these in my purse to freshen up after lunch and before meeting with clients.</li>
            <li>Love how these come in</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are ok.</li>
            <li>A tiny toothbrush with built-in toothpaste and no water needed -- what a great idea!</li>
            <li>Best of all, these are tiny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quite handy for a med student since I&#x27;m rarely home.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s a pick at the end of the mini-brush (how cool is that!).</li>
            <li>Easy to throw in purse or briefcase, and work well after meals and before meetings.  </li>
            <li>These are too easily damaged in my purse.</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant and they really get your teeth clean without needing water or paste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easily fits in your purse or backpack, lets you freshen up any time you need it.</li>
            <li>They were convenient and effective and I intend to keep some around all the time because you never know whey you might need to clean up your smile and freshen up your breath.</li>
            <li>and they work fine both ways.</li>
            <li>Love these mini-brushes, I keep them stashed everywhere in case I need a quick cleaning at work, in the car, or while I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>These little things are awesome.  </li>
            <li>I do like the pick on the end, which is the most useful element to these things.</li>
            <li>but ummm...if someone&#x27;s asking, I&#x27;m available.  </li>
            <li>Those things are fantastic.)</li>
            <li>You never know when you need to freshen your breath and don&#x27;t have access to a toothbrush, middle of the work day, impromptu date, happy hour after work, etc.</li>
            <li>The small size of the brush means it gets in all the nooks and crannies and fits perfectly on each tooth.</li>
            <li>Keep them in your desk at work, in your night table, purse and car, for really clean frshness on the go.  </li>
            <li>Soon found out that a regular toothbrush is much more effective for that.</li>
            <li>I feel like I just visited the dentist after I use them because my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I keep a couple in my flight kit more for freshening than for real brushing.</li>
            <li>I had been told they were cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Although the scope toothpaste on these really packs a refreshing *zing</li>
            <li>Works well for that quick brush...</li>
            <li>These are great for your purse, glove compartment in the car or even my grandson&#x27;s back pocket as he is really finicky about brushing his teeth after every meal.</li>
            <li>As someone who prefers to take small purses out to dinner yet often orders fish, these things are ideal for me.</li>
            <li>The bristles on each Wisp do a fantastic job of cleaning gunk off your teeth (definitely better than floss, which is what I usually carry in my purse), and the flavor bead freshens breath nicely without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a nice spearmint drop in the middle and you use it like a toothbrush or toothpick.  </li>
            <li>It has a minty bead of toothpaste type stuff in it that is sooo FRESH.  </li>
            <li>As far as cleaning goes, cut off the head of a toothbrush and you&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li>It is also handy for travel, just tossing it in your purse, brief case or stick in your glove compartment.</li>
            <li>teeth and breath feel fresh.</li>
            <li>These are nicely packed individual mini brushes that work well.</li>
            <li>Especially useful for travelers or those without access to traditional implements during the workday.</li>
            <li>A little larger with a more ergonomic handle and these would be really good travel brushes!</li>
            <li>I take these camping with me and they leave me with a very clean feeling/tasting mouth after use, no less so than legitimate brushing.</li>
            <li>Of course your tongue doesn&#x27;t quite feel the same as if you&#x27;d used an actual toothbrush and paste, but this is still a great clean for your teeth, and really freshens breath.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t very helpful cleaning your teeth either, as the cheap plastic bristles don&#x27;t seem to hold up well, or have much cleaning power.</li>
            <li>Great tool for getting hard to remove plaque off.</li>
            <li>G Basis Refreshing Facial Cleansing Cloths]]</li>
            <li>the 4-packs purchased individually travel much better.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer said it was a great weight loss help, as once your teeth are clean, you&#x27;re less likely to snack.</li>
            <li>I love that Wisps are designed with a curved flexible toothpick device on one end, because sometimes when you&#x27;re out in public and realize that you&#x27;ve got a very stubborn and visible bit of food stuck in your teeth,</li>
            <li>I used to buy these in the store and haven&#x27;t been able to find them for a long time.</li>
            <li>The plastic bristles seem a bit hard and abrasive on your teeth, but the freshening bead does seem to give your mouth a nice, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I enjoy these Wisps overall though.</li>
            <li>Wisping is calorie-free, makes your mouth clean and fresh, and tastes lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be careful.</li>
            <li>I actually feel like these cleaned my teeth better than my usual toothbrush and toothpaste although I am sure they don&#x27;t have any fluoride or anti-gingivitus additives.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, I felt like Wisps didn&#x27;t actually CLEAN my teeth enough, they just freshened my breath - but I&#x27;m over that now,</li>
            <li>, Bandaids (high heels can be a real b*tch, no?), chapstick, travel-size mascara, concealer, etc. - AND - let us not forget - a couple of Colgate</li>
            <li>I carried these everywhere, but I&#x27;m going back to the traditional travel toothbrush and toothpaste, even though those are bulkier, the results are significantly better.  </li>
            <li>Or if you don&#x27;t want the mess, gum works much better, with a swig of water.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I mean is more foam/toothpaste on your teeth and a more rough toothbrush to really dig into your teeth.</li>
            <li>But I admit I love these little brushes and try not to be without them.</li>
            <li>I love these little brushes.</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes, my teeth were clean and my breath was minty fresh.</li>
            <li>The amazon price is better than the sale price at regular stores, and it&#x27;s worth having a few in my gym bag or purse for freshening up when I can&#x27;t bring a toothbrush and toothpaste with me.</li>
            <li>, whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy this thing, believe me, I&#x27;m not a delicate person and my palate has tried all sorts of things</li>
            <li>Everyone left for prom with minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Firm bristles are not needed, nor are they even recommended by most dentists.</li>
            <li>You could eat a bug and not notice sometimes, if it&#x27;s mixed in just right with the party mix.</li>
            <li>The little toothpick on the opposite end of each brush is also a handy touch.</li>
            <li>I even keep a couple near the bed</li>
            <li>They burned my sensitive mouth, but I still give them 5 stars cause</li>
            <li>Just not for a sensitive mouth though.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d recommend at least trying a bag before you purchase more.</li>
            <li>I find these very convenient and especially like to have one in my purse at all times.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very involved with school and sports and uses these on a daily basis when she has no time to come home and brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>They take up next to no room in a purse or pocket, which makes them much more convenient than carrying floss or even a travel toothbrush and small toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Small size will fit anywhere, even in a pocket.</li>
            <li>It seemed weak and more on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;These tiny single-use toothbrushes are much more compact than the roughly equivalent alternative (a travel-size toothbrush, toothpaste &amp; floss), thus, they&#x27;re much easier to carry with me (especially when I&#x27;m using a small handbag).  </li>
            <li>, I have a favorable bias toward spearmint in general.</li>
            <li>I am a very socially active mid-twenties female living in Manhattan, so I spend most of my life out-and-about on a nonstop unpredictable whirlwind adventure - going out for food/drinks, friends&#x27; apartments, events, workout classes, dates, weekend trips out of the city, etc.</li>
            <li>After all, sometimes snacking is just mindlessly chewing on something, right?</li>
            <li>The Wisps are a little bit too small to work effectively, and even the package itself warns this is not to be used in lieu of regular toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li>If you get hooked, like I have, it can hurt your social life if it becomes as automatic as snacking.</li>
            <li>BUT the BIG THING for me is my mouth is very small, and with these, I can easily brush those teeth in the back without drooling, foaming, and otherwise looking rabid.</li>
            <li>opposite end is a sharp, textured, flexible pick that can scrape in between teeth and really get off any remaining gunk.</li>

            <li> The bristles on each Wisp do a fantastic job of cleaning gunk off your teeth (definitely better than floss, which is what I usually carry in my purse), and the flavor bead freshens breath nicely without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has a nice spearmint drop in the middle and you use it like a toothbrush or toothpick.  </li>
            <li> It has a minty bead of toothpaste type stuff in it that is sooo FRESH.  </li>
            <li> As far as cleaning goes, cut off the head of a toothbrush and you&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li> It is also handy for travel, just tossing it in your purse, brief case or stick in your glove compartment.</li>
            <li> teeth and breath feel fresh.</li>
            <li> These are nicely packed individual mini brushes that work well.</li>
            <li> Especially useful for travelers or those without access to traditional implements during the workday.</li>
            <li> A little larger with a more ergonomic handle and these would be really good travel brushes!</li>
            <li> I take these camping with me and they leave me with a very clean feeling/tasting mouth after use, no less so than legitimate brushing.</li>
            <li> Of course your tongue doesn&#x27;t quite feel the same as if you&#x27;d used an actual toothbrush and paste, but this is still a great clean for your teeth, and really freshens breath.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t very helpful cleaning your teeth either, as the cheap plastic bristles don&#x27;t seem to hold up well, or have much cleaning power.</li>
            <li> Great tool for getting hard to remove plaque off.</li>

            <li> the 4-packs purchased individually travel much better.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer said it was a great weight loss help, as once your teeth are clean, you&#x27;re less likely to snack.</li>
            <li> I love that Wisps are designed with a curved flexible toothpick device on one end, because sometimes when you&#x27;re out in public and realize that you&#x27;ve got a very stubborn and visible bit of food stuck in your teeth,</li>
            <li> I used to buy these in the store and haven&#x27;t been able to find them for a long time.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles seem a bit hard and abrasive on your teeth, but the freshening bead does seem to give your mouth a nice, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I enjoy these Wisps overall though.</li>
            <li> Wisping is calorie-free, makes your mouth clean and fresh, and tastes lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be careful.</li>
            <li> I actually feel like these cleaned my teeth better than my usual toothbrush and toothpaste although I am sure they don&#x27;t have any fluoride or anti-gingivitus additives.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, I felt like Wisps didn&#x27;t actually CLEAN my teeth enough, they just freshened my breath - but I&#x27;m over that now,</li>
            <li> , Bandaids (high heels can be a real b*tch, no?), chapstick, travel-size mascara, concealer, etc. - AND - let us not forget - a couple of Colgate</li>
            <li> I carried these everywhere, but I&#x27;m going back to the traditional travel toothbrush and toothpaste, even though those are bulkier, the results are significantly better.  </li>
            <li> Or if you don&#x27;t want the mess, gum works much better, with a swig of water.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I mean is more foam/toothpaste on your teeth and a more rough toothbrush to really dig into your teeth.</li>
            <li> But I admit I love these little brushes and try not to be without them.</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes, my teeth were clean and my breath was minty fresh.</li>
            <li> The amazon price is better than the sale price at regular stores, and it&#x27;s worth having a few in my gym bag or purse for freshening up when I can&#x27;t bring a toothbrush and toothpaste with me.</li>
            <li> , whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy this thing, believe me, I&#x27;m not a delicate person and my palate has tried all sorts of things</li>
            <li> Everyone left for prom with minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Firm bristles are not needed, nor are they even recommended by most dentists.</li>
            <li> You could eat a bug and not notice sometimes, if it&#x27;s mixed in just right with the party mix.</li>
            <li> The little toothpick on the opposite end of each brush is also a handy touch.</li>
            <li> I even keep a couple near the bed</li>
            <li> They burned my sensitive mouth, but I still give them 5 stars cause</li>
            <li> Just not for a sensitive mouth though.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d recommend at least trying a bag before you purchase more.</li>
            <li> I find these very convenient and especially like to have one in my purse at all times.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very involved with school and sports and uses these on a daily basis when she has no time to come home and brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> They take up next to no room in a purse or pocket, which makes them much more convenient than carrying floss or even a travel toothbrush and small toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Small size will fit anywhere, even in a pocket.</li>
            <li> It seemed weak and more on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;These tiny single-use toothbrushes are much more compact than the roughly equivalent alternative (a travel-size toothbrush, toothpaste &amp; floss), thus, they&#x27;re much easier to carry with me (especially when I&#x27;m using a small handbag).  </li>
            <li> , I have a favorable bias toward spearmint in general.</li>
            <li> I am a very socially active mid-twenties female living in Manhattan, so I spend most of my life out-and-about on a nonstop unpredictable whirlwind adventure - going out for food/drinks, friends&#x27; apartments, events, workout classes, dates, weekend trips out of the city, etc.</li>
            <li> After all, sometimes snacking is just mindlessly chewing on something, right?</li>
            <li> The Wisps are a little bit too small to work effectively, and even the package itself warns this is not to be used in lieu of regular toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li> If you get hooked, like I have, it can hurt your social life if it becomes as automatic as snacking.</li>
            <li> BUT the BIG THING for me is my mouth is very small, and with these, I can easily brush those teeth in the back without drooling, foaming, and otherwise looking rabid.</li>
            <li> opposite end is a sharp, textured, flexible pick that can scrape in between teeth and really get off any remaining gunk.</li>
            <li> I would say do away with the pointy handle end and make the handle flat.</li>
            <li> Yes I do have some guilt about the amount of unnecessary waste these create, so I try not to use them more than a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I do a 1-hour long cleaning at the periodontalist at $160 a pop that insurance does not cover, so this cost is very minor in my overall dental.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting a little bit more of a dramatic outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I frequently don&#x27;t know where the day (or night) is going to take me, I always keep a little cosmetic/toiletry pouch with me in my purse with a few key products: individually wrapped Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths ([[ASIN:B000NVU82</li>

            <li> I ignored their advice for a long time until I came across these.</li>
            <li> There really is no water required.</li>
            <li> The original concept was nice, it&#x27;s true that you don&#x27;t need water and that it serves almost as well as brushing your teeth the traditional way, however, the flavor is beyond nasty, the aftertaste it leaves in your mouth is just disgusting</li>
            <li> Too small and hard to really make a difference.</li>
            <li> but it is a little too small and stiff to do a real brush job; its is hard to get at the inside surfaces because the handle is too short.</li>
            <li> You can get food out of your teeth with one end, brush and polish with the other end.  </li>
            <li> They are compact and small enough for the small cross body bags all the girls carry.</li>
            <li> The little ball of minty goodness definitely helps freshen up breath, and the little pick also does its job.</li>
            <li> Too small for my hands and not enough brushing power.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price for the 16-pack is roughly the equivalent of what you&#x27;d pay for a tiny pack of 4 Wisps at the store (...at least in Manhattan).  </li>
            <li> I also hold down a full-time job.  </li>

            <li> I wish the bristles were a little stiffer.</li>
            <li> how well they&#x27;re cleaning my teeth, but at the very least it relieves you of some of the guilt if you&#x27;ve left home in a rush without brushing your teeth.</li>

            <li> I completely wasted my money on these.  </li>

            <li> A few of these take up no space at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I just take couple of these to classes everyday and use them when I need to.&lt;br</li>

            <li> A little too small and stiff.</li>

            <li> but I found I need at least a swig afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick to get in between my teeth.</li>

            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The other day I had a bad breath emergency at work, after lunch.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste inside the bristles is so hard, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get it to activate.</li>
            <li> The pick at the end is useless.</li>
            <li> my car console, my purse, my gym bag, my nightstand (when I am reading a book at night and end up too sleepy to get up to brush but then feel guilty about all the plaque on my teeth).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t confuse this with a regular toothbrush.  It has a nice spearmint drop in the middle and you use it like a toothbrush or toothpick.  If you want to add your own toothpaste I guess it would work as a toothbrush also.</li>
            <li> I am physically disabled and standing at the sink is not an option. In the past, I had to sit in my wheelchair with a glass of water and a pan to brunch my teeth. The Wisp brushes are a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li> I take these camping with me and they leave me with a very clean feeling/tasting mouth after use, no less so than legitimate brushing. The bristles hold up well to vigorous brushing and the lil&#x27; flavor pack that&#x27;s embedded within is effective, albeit foul tasting. The pick at the end is useless. It&#x27;s too thick to get in between my teeth. I enjoy these Wisps overall though.</li>
            <li> My son carries these with him so that when he has to take out his invisiline braces to eat he can go into restroom and brush afterwards and reinsert his braces. I would recommend these to anyone for their ease of use and carry.</li>
            <li> product is good,compact,durable,reasonably priced with fair shipping cost,fast service will order again. thank you</li>
            <li> I use these when I travel for work.  Easy to throw in purse or briefcase, and work well after meals and before meetings.  I&#x27;ve used with and without water and they work fine both ways.</li>
            <li> The original concept was nice, it&#x27;s true that you don&#x27;t need water and that it serves almost as well as brushing your teeth the traditional way, however, the flavor is beyond nasty, the aftertaste it leaves in your mouth is just disgusting, whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy this thing, believe me, I&#x27;m not a delicate person and my palate has tried all sorts of things but this is something you don&#x27;t want to put in your mouth, after only three uses I&#x27;m throwing this away because none of my friends want it.</li>
            <li> These wisps are better than nothing. I keep them in my desk and use before meetings/after lunch. Has saved me several times after eating pizza with garlic.</li>
            <li> I bout these to use at my son&#x27;s Pre prom party and they were a hit!  Everyone left for prom with minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li> These little things are awesome.  They are individually wrapped. You can get food out of your teeth with one end, brush and polish with the other end.  It has a minty bead of toothpaste type stuff in it that is sooo FRESH.  Keep them in your desk at work, in your night table, purse and car, for really clean frshness on the go.  Good for camping too, I would imagine.</li>
            <li> These are great to carry with me for the occasion that I can&#x27;t brush my teeth after eating or drinking. Not a replacement for brushing, obviously, but will work in a pinch. I can use one of these and put my Invisalign trays back in without feeling too gross.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the delivery and quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought these little toothbrushes after I got invisalign braces, to help with cleaning. Soon found out that a regular toothbrush is much more effective for that. These aren&#x27;t very helpful cleaning your teeth either, as the cheap plastic bristles don&#x27;t seem to hold up well, or have much cleaning power. I do like the pick on the end, which is the most useful element to these things. As far as cleaning goes, cut off the head of a toothbrush and you&#x27;ll be better off. Just make sure you have a container to put it in. Or if you don&#x27;t want the mess, gum works much better, with a swig of water.</li>
            <li> Great tool for getting hard to remove plaque off. you can reuse them too which is a bonus.  These are the same as they give out of airlines.</li>
            <li> There is no actual brush and there is not enough substance to even do anything.  I completely wasted my money on these.  They do not work as intended.</li>
            <li> For those that have plaque challenges and you need a quick solution in between brushing your teeth, this product works great. It is also handy for travel, just tossing it in your purse, brief case or stick in your glove compartment. Highly recommend. I used to buy these in the store and haven&#x27;t been able to find them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a very socially active mid-twenties female living in Manhattan, so I spend most of my life out-and-about on a nonstop unpredictable whirlwind adventure - going out for food/drinks, friends&#x27; apartments, events, workout classes, dates, weekend trips out of the city, etc. (Oh yeah - I also hold down a full-time job.  Forgot to mention that part.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I frequently don&#x27;t know where the day (or night) is going to take me, I always keep a little cosmetic/toiletry pouch with me in my purse with a few key products: individually wrapped Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths ([[ASIN:B000NVU82G Basis Refreshing Facial Cleansing Cloths]] no, I am not a paid spokesperson - but ummm...if someone&#x27;s asking, I&#x27;m available.  Those things are fantastic.), Bandaids (high heels can be a real b*tch, no?), chapstick, travel-size mascara, concealer, etc. - AND - let us not forget - a couple of Colgate Wisps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tiny single-use toothbrushes are much more compact than the roughly equivalent alternative (a travel-size toothbrush, toothpaste &amp; floss), thus, they&#x27;re much easier to carry with me (especially when I&#x27;m using a small handbag).  I love that Wisps are designed with a curved flexible toothpick device on one end, because sometimes when you&#x27;re out in public and realize that you&#x27;ve got a very stubborn and visible bit of food stuck in your teeth, a toothbrush alone just won&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I felt like Wisps didn&#x27;t actually CLEAN my teeth enough, they just freshened my breath - but I&#x27;m over that now, so either I lowered my standards or just got used to the fact that using a Wisp doesn&#x27;t feel the same as using a toothbrush (probably both).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I&#x27;m writing a review HERE is because you won&#x27;t find Colgate Wisps cheaper anywhere else!  Amazon&#x27;s price for the 16-pack is roughly the equivalent of what you&#x27;d pay for a tiny pack of 4 Wisps at the store (...at least in Manhattan).  I always stock up on Amazon and never buy them anywhere else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Personally, I like Spearmint Wisps the best - but to be fair, I have a favorable bias toward spearmint in general.</li>
            <li> Nice to buy in volume but the 4-packs purchased individually travel much better.  These are too easily damaged in my purse.</li>
            <li> good Quality .......&lt;br /&gt;Price is Good for the item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good To have small Tooth brush with you in your trip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it :) :)</li>
            <li> I love to use the Wisp brushes. I feel like I just visited the dentist after I use them because my teeth feel so clean. I keep them in my car, my desk and LOVE to use them on trips.</li>
            <li> I buy these regularly and keep them everywhere. The small size of the brush means it gets in all the nooks and crannies and fits perfectly on each tooth. When you&#x27;re done, you feel like you&#x27;re leaving the dentist. Of course your tongue doesn&#x27;t quite feel the same as if you&#x27;d used an actual toothbrush and paste, but this is still a great clean for your teeth, and really freshens breath. I even keep a couple near the bed so if I collapse at the end of a long day and realize I forgot to brush, I can use one.&lt;br /&gt;The opposite end is a sharp, textured, flexible pick that can scrape in between teeth and really get off any remaining gunk. Yes I do have some guilt about the amount of unnecessary waste these create, so I try not to use them more than a couple times a week. But I admit I love these little brushes and try not to be without them.</li>
            <li> There are pros and cons to these.  I love the convenience and size, but is this a sustainable solution to consumption?  The Wisps are a little bit too small to work effectively, and even the package itself warns this is not to be used in lieu of regular toothbrushing.  I carried these everywhere, but I&#x27;m going back to the traditional travel toothbrush and toothpaste, even though those are bulkier, the results are significantly better.  Although, I must say that the Wisp design is great - there&#x27;s a pick at the end of the mini-brush (how cool is that!).</li>
            <li> I use one of these after lunch every work day. My periodontalist told me to brush after lunch. I ignored their advice for a long time until I came across these. I didn&#x27;t want to use a full brush set at work and this was a perfect compromise. 4 times a year I do a 1-hour long cleaning at the periodontalist at $160 a pop that insurance does not cover, so this cost is very minor in my overall dental.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a job where I can brush my teeth at work, and these are the next best thing! The amazon price is better than the sale price at regular stores, and it&#x27;s worth having a few in my gym bag or purse for freshening up when I can&#x27;t bring a toothbrush and toothpaste with me. The spearmint is my favorite flavor and the freshness lasts longer than a stick of gum.</li>
            <li> Love these mini-brushes, I keep them stashed everywhere in case I need a quick cleaning at work, in the car, or while I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Pow!!! Spearmint knocks out anything you&#x27;ve eaten period!!!  Awesomely strong, like an Altoid, they unstick dinner from your teeth and polish those pearly whites!!!  Amazon&#x27;s price blew me away!!! I have to be honest, I had to return them! They burned my sensitive mouth, but I still give them 5 stars cause it&#x27;s me not the product that had a problem! They happily and quickly refunded me. If your looking for a great strong flavor to knock garlic breathe they are Perfect and I do recommend them. Just not for a sensitive mouth though.</li>
            <li> Very handy and does freshen your mouth and teeth.  It does work with no water as advertised but I found I need at least a swig afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love these.  I keep a couple in my car, a couple in my purse and a couple in my backpack.  I also buy these and send them to soldiers overseas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Wisps. All flavors, but spearmint is a really good one.&lt;br /&gt;I Wisp while watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;I Wisp while listening to ebooks.&lt;br /&gt;I Wisp to music on my ipod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually cut out some calories by Wisping in place of snacking! Seriously. After all, sometimes snacking is just mindlessly chewing on something, right? You could eat a bug and not notice sometimes, if it&#x27;s mixed in just right with the party mix. Wisping is calorie-free, makes your mouth clean and fresh, and tastes lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be careful. If you get hooked, like I have, it can hurt your social life if it becomes as automatic as snacking. My husband nudged me once in a movie theatre, and I realized I&#x27;d pulled out a little Wisp mini-brush during the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001TH8Y6A Colgate Wisp Spearmint, 16-Count (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Great size for  your purse, lunch box or pocket.  Works well for that quick brush...even while driving, not over-powering in taste.  Will keep on hand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure how well they&#x27;re cleaning my teeth, but at the very least it relieves you of some of the guilt if you&#x27;ve left home in a rush without brushing your teeth. The plastic bristles seem a bit hard and abrasive on your teeth, but the freshening bead does seem to give your mouth a nice, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have never given an awful review on any product, but these things are worthless! The brushes are all plastic, not your typical toothbrush bristle.The bristles are so firm they make my gums bleed. Firm bristles are not needed, nor are they even recommended by most dentists. The toothpaste inside the bristles is so hard, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get it to activate. I would Not recommend these.</li>
            <li> Great idea. A little too small and stiff. The handle end  can be used as a pik. Spearmint taste OK. Leaves the mouth refreshed but it is a little too small and stiff to do a real brush job; its is hard to get at the inside surfaces because the handle is too short. A little larger with a more ergonomic handle and these would be really good travel brushes! I would say do away with the pointy handle end and make the handle flat. I keep a couple in my flight kit more for freshening than for real brushing.</li>
            <li> There really is no water required. I have invisilign and wanted something fow on the go. this did the trick.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered these without ever having used them before.  I had been told they were cool and I had a trip coming up where I would need to impress a lot of people and not have access to any mouthwash, let alone my toothbrush.  I actually feel like these cleaned my teeth better than my usual toothbrush and toothpaste although I am sure they don&#x27;t have any fluoride or anti-gingivitus additives.  They were convenient and effective and I intend to keep some around all the time because you never know whey you might need to clean up your smile and freshen up your breath.</li>
            <li> They kinda do the job? But it&#x27;s really awkward. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m speaking from bias here as I&#x27;ve never used a product like this but I was expecting a little bit more of a dramatic outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I mean is more foam/toothpaste on your teeth and a more rough toothbrush to really dig into your teeth. It seemed weak and more on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if my opinion will reflect yours but I&#x27;d recommend at least trying a bag before you purchase more.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes. very effective. teeth and breath feel fresh. Can brush anywhere. No water needed.so small you can keep them anywhere.thanks.</li>
            <li> The perfect way to keep my teeth clean no matter where. I have these stashed in my work drawer, my car console, my purse, my gym bag, my nightstand (when I am reading a book at night and end up too sleepy to get up to brush but then feel guilty about all the plaque on my teeth). Another reviewer said it was a great weight loss help, as once your teeth are clean, you&#x27;re less likely to snack. It&#x27;s true. BUT the BIG THING for me is my mouth is very small, and with these, I can easily brush those teeth in the back without drooling, foaming, and otherwise looking rabid. I didn&#x27;t know how much I loved the colgate wisp until I bought the scope minibrushes. Although the scope toothpaste on these really packs a refreshing *zing*, the bristles were too stiff and the \\&quot;picks\\&quot; on the end of the scope weren&#x27;t as flexible as the picks on the wisps.</li>
            <li> I keep these in my car and my purse. You never know when you need to freshen your breath and don&#x27;t have access to a toothbrush, middle of the work day, impromptu date, happy hour after work, etc.</li>
            <li> I find these very convenient and especially like to have one in my purse at all times. I also love them when I am traveling to use on the airplane when it isn&#x27;t convenient to get to my carry-on bag.</li>
            <li> Excellent way to freshen your mouth when you don&#x27;t have toothpaste, toothbrush, or water available.  Small size will fit anywhere, even in a pocket.</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes. They&#x27;re convenient. The packaging is such that you can separate them individually. I&#x27;m a nurse and have a very small (pencil pouch sized) bag that I keep with me at work all night. A few of these take up no space at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away one star because they turn my tongue blue. Without the artificial coloring, they&#x27;d be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I keep these in my desk at work. I like that they&#x27;re individually wrapped so I can throw them in my bag or pocket. I hate dirty teeth and this takes care of it conveniently. Just make sure you have a sink nearby!</li>
            <li> For the price I find this to be a very good product. i like Scope&#x27;s Outlast better,but that product is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am currently in treatment with invisalign and I have to constantly have my teeth brushed so I just take couple of these to classes everyday and use them when I need to.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite handy for a med student since I&#x27;m rarely home.&lt;br /&gt;I say it is a bit pricey but it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very involved with school and sports and uses these on a daily basis when she has no time to come home and brush her teeth. They are compact and small enough for the small cross body bags all the girls carry. She even shares them with others in her class. The taste is pleasant and they really get your teeth clean without needing water or paste. We always have these on hand.</li>
            <li> These are great! They are much better than chewing gum after a meal of anytime you want to refresh your mouth. And for the price, you couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and found it very handy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I keep one in my purse just in case I need a toothbrush in a pinch.</li>
            <li> These are nicely packed individual mini brushes that work well. The little ball of minty goodness definitely helps freshen up breath, and the little pick also does its job. I love having one of these in my purse to freshen up after lunch and before meeting with clients.</li>
            <li> I keep some in my car. It&#x27;s easy to use. No water needed. I wish the bristles were a little stiffer.</li>
            <li> I usually carry these little wisps with me everywhere. The other day I had a bad breath emergency at work, after lunch. I got this out of my bag and scooted to the restroom. Within a few minutes, my teeth were clean and my breath was minty fresh. Love how these come in handy while traveling.</li>
            <li> Best item to carry with you at all times. This product can be used traveling and on-the-go. Larger quanities decrease cost and I found it more cost effective to purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great for our bachelorette party goodie bags!</li>
            <li> These are great for your purse, glove compartment in the car or even my grandson&#x27;s back pocket as he is really finicky about brushing his teeth after every meal.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your teeth clean on the go.  Especially useful for travelers or those without access to traditional implements during the workday.</li>
            <li> These are great for on the go or for that family member with braces.  Easily fits in your purse or backpack, lets you freshen up any time you need it.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are ok. Flavor is good. Too small for my hands and not enough brushing power. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> A tiny toothbrush with built-in toothpaste and no water needed -- what a great idea! As someone who prefers to take small purses out to dinner yet often orders fish, these things are ideal for me. The bristles on each Wisp do a fantastic job of cleaning gunk off your teeth (definitely better than floss, which is what I usually carry in my purse), and the flavor bead freshens breath nicely without being overpowering. The little toothpick on the opposite end of each brush is also a handy touch. Best of all, these are tiny! They take up next to no room in a purse or pocket, which makes them much more convenient than carrying floss or even a travel toothbrush and small toothpaste. Absolutely wonderful invention.</li>
            <li> Too small and hard to really make a difference. Bad idea.</li>
