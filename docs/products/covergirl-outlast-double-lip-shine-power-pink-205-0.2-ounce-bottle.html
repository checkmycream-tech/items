            <li>Just perfect.</li>
            <li>Absolutely GREAT!</li>
            <li>I had a very good experience with this stuff.</li>
            <li>When&lt;br /&gt;I received this color I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;having a great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips feel so plump and cute, and shiney, and whenever I wear it my boyfriend smiles at me more.</li>
            <li>I love it and it looks just like the pic</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more soon thank u again</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my&lt;br /&gt;skin tone and the price was terrific</li>
            <li>The shade looks good with my skin tone and u can even just use the clear stuff if you just want some shine on your lips.</li>
            <li>Love Covergirl Outlast Lip shine first of all.</li>
            <li>Ordered several colors at one time and I am pleased with all the different shades and the value was great</li>
            <li>and they came quick and fast thanks</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product because the color is so pretty, but it almost immediately started balling up on my lips, the formula does not wear well at all.</li>
            <li>Bright, true pink color -- not like baby pink or pastel pink, more like a pink rose-- with a shimmer that can make the color look paler than when blotted.</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>Looks very discolored  and old.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips dry fast, I have to constantly apply Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the pink, but I bought it for the clear because I couldn&#x27;t find just clear by itself.</li>

            <li> I love cover girl because it&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your lips.</li>
            <li> Typical long wear laquer feeling but it stays on through all non-oily food/drink/lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Came is a safety sealed container so no worries about any previous use...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only using the clear gloss now because the lipstick is so terrible.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed I thought it would keep my lips shinny longer than regular lip gloss.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, the lipstick does not even last over an hour and clumps off.</li>
            <li> This  product  came in the envelope  looking dirty  and sticky  </li>

            <li> This just came to my house and im in shock. Im not one to write reviews but this is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they  had a zero  stars.

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that when I looked in the mirror the morning after wearing this lip gloss, that it was still on. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love Covergirl Outlast Lip shine first of all. When&lt;br /&gt;I received this color I was thrilled! Perfect for my&lt;br /&gt;skin tone and the price was terrific - cannot find&lt;br /&gt;that price around here! Just ordered it the beginning&lt;br /&gt;of this week and I already received it! Thank you for&lt;br /&gt;having a great price and quick shipping.</li>
