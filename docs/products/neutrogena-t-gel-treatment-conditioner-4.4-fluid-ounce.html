            <li>I always used Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo and this conditioner in tandem to control my scalp psoriasis AND be able to comb through my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Helps get rid of most of the tarry smell from the T gel shampoo.</li>
            <li>not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Use it, love it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It has a interesting smell, but most hair treatments do.  </li>
            <li>Smells OK, but no help in detangling hair.  </li>
            <li>i love T-gel.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot</li>
            <li>I let it sit on my head for a minute or more.  </li>
            <li>Bot helped me with the scalp itchiness, it&#x27;s a strong conditioner, yett leaves my hair still shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair combs out easily (medium length), remains soft to the touch and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Along with t-gel shampoo this product is fantastic</li>
            <li>She was so happy I could find the conditioner for her as they stopped carrying it in different stores.</li>
            <li>Otherwise fantastic product for medicated shampoo/scalp needs.</li>
            <li>Hair was fly away and not soft and shiny like advertised.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was just as described.</li>
            <li>Compaired to many other conditioners for the same hair type, this product works remarkably well for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to leave my hair so smooth, shiny &amp; soft</li>
            <li>Within the first wash I noticed a drastic difference with the psoriasis on my ears (seborrheic dermatitis).</li>
            <li>The first time I used TGel</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different shampoos but Neutrogena works for me.</li>
            <li>I find mixing up different shampoos and conditioners leaves my hair natural, bouncy and sexy!</li>
            <li>I think the product speaks for itself, and I&#x27;ll go on to say that it works tremendously well for my hair (thick and wavy), has a pleasant smell and leaves my hair feeling soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I expect it will work very wall again.</li>
            <li>And i actually really like the smell too.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>

            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon, who is able to provide this product to me, and countless of other customers.    </li>
            <li>Glad I could find it here, at least.</li>
            <li>With the addition of the conditioner it is soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Kroger and other generic knock-offs, but nothing beats the Neutragena original.</li>
            <li>Only warning: do NOT let this get near their eyes.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, it strips all moisture from the hair itself so have a moisturizing conditioner or other hairdress ready.</li>

            <li> I live in a very dry climate and dry skin is a problem.  </li>
            <li> I have used T-Gel in the past and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair but an oily scalp, and this is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve found which doesn&#x27;t grease me up.</li>
            <li> My sister has been using T-Gel for a long time.</li>
            <li> made my hair feel kinda dry.</li>
            <li> When I use the corresponding shampoo my hair is very dry and straw like.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve dealt with a few itchy spots on my head for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> But I have medium curly hair past my shoulders and just using it on my entire scalp</li>
            <li> I just always had this little spot on my head where it was always dry.</li>
            <li> It can be harsh on your hair (leaving it really dry), so I always mix 1 part</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not experience any positive results.</li>
            <li> The bottle comes in an old, dirty and torn box with an blue ink stain on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Works great...a little smelly</li>
            <li> Got a little itchy scalp, saw it, grabbed it, used it.</li>
            <li> The whole thing looked like it was coming from somebody&#x27;s dirty closet.</li>
            <li> That can be difficult with a 2 year old but we had a system.</li>
            <li> It would be far too expensive.  </li>
            <li> The bottle seems to have been used - at least it is not full.</li>
            <li> It is especially disturbing for heath and beauty items, I am sure they have violated a number of regulations.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe that this was ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and allow the shampoo to stay on at least 5 minutes after each application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nostalgic.</li>
            <li> It has dandruff go all crazy</li>
            <li> Having had psoriasis for over 50 years, I&#x27;ve gone the route of all of the awful, smelly, treatments of the past.  </li>
            <li> Some of the dandruff products smell bad, but  Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel doesn&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> I have dry hair but an oily scalp, and this is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve found which doesn&#x27;t grease me up.</li>
            <li> I love it. Goog  item.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised and doesn&#x27;t smell the house up with a tar smell.  As adverstised and package so it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> This product s amazing. I just always had this little spot on my head where it was always dry. In one use it relieved my itch and dryness. Along with t-gel shampoo this product is fantastic</li>
            <li> I almost went into panic mode when the local stores discontinued carrying this product.  Thank goodness for Amazon, who is able to provide this product to me, and countless of other customers.    Having had psoriasis for over 50 years, I&#x27;ve gone the route of all of the awful, smelly, treatments of the past.  The Neutrogene T/Gel Therapeutic Conditioner is the best product for conditioning hair and a psoratic/dry scalp.  My hair combs out easily (medium length), remains soft to the touch and has a pleasant scent.  My husband, who does not have a scalp problem, likes it too!  I can&#x27;t speak highly enough for this product.</li>
            <li> I always used Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo and this conditioner in tandem to control my scalp psoriasis AND be able to comb through my curly hair.  Then I moved to another city where the drugstores don&#x27;t sell the conditioner at all.  Glad I could find it here, at least.</li>
            <li> This stuff was grreat.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to leave my hair so smooth, shiny &amp; soft but it did!  Wish it came in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Works great...a little smelly</li>
            <li> Works great with T-sal shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo, just as advertized for scalp problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I started with a bout of dandruff that caused me to use Neutrogena&#x27;s medicated shampoo.  I continued with the conditioner even after the dandruff left me because it worked so well.</li>
            <li> Within the first wash I noticed a drastic difference with the psoriasis on my ears (seborrheic dermatitis). My dermatologist recommended this product and I am so grateful!</li>
            <li> great product to use after the T-gel shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works well. Helps get rid of most of the tarry smell from the T gel shampoo.</li>
            <li> not my favorite. made my hair feel kinda dry. I like using the tsal shampoo just by itself</li>
            <li> Use it, love it. Used to use years ago and forgot about it. Complacent  I guess. Got a little itchy scalp, saw it, grabbed it, used it. Problem gone.</li>
            <li> I felt the effect from the second wash. It leaves on a discrete perfume. Love it!</li>
            <li> recommended by dermatologist</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine and went to Amazon to purchase it.  It arrived quickly and was just as described. I live in a very dry climate and dry skin is a problem.  The first time I used TGel my scalp stopped itching.  Hooray!  This has become one of my \\&quot;must have\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the price - it is much higher in retail stores in my area.</li>
            <li> My sister has been using T-Gel for a long time. She was so happy I could find the conditioner for her as they stopped carrying it in different stores.</li>
            <li> The conditioner seems to relieve my itching from sebhoreic (sp?) dermatitis.  Hopefully, it will provide relief with continued use!</li>
            <li> This stuff works although we eventually had to go Rx for child&#x27;s itchy scalp.  Only warning: do NOT let this get near their eyes. Whew! That can be difficult with a 2 year old but we had a system. Otherwise fantastic product for medicated shampoo/scalp needs. Like others have said, it strips all moisture from the hair itself so have a moisturizing conditioner or other hairdress ready.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. But it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> had the t-gel shampoo, just got the conditioner.  Bot helped me with the scalp itchiness, it&#x27;s a strong conditioner, yett leaves my hair still shiny.  Don&#x27;t know what will it do on my tinted hair...</li>
            <li> Product does just what it claims.  It has a interesting smell, but most hair treatments do.  I&#x27;m noticing I differnce in the amount of dandruff I have.  Good product for men &amp; women alike.</li>
            <li> The item was received a day earlier than expected which is always a nice surprise. The product itself does what it says it does. It actually soothes my scalp. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so I can&#x27;t provide a lengthy description but I already feel an improvement. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Smells OK, but no help in detangling hair.  I have to add my regular conditioner to the T-Gel Conditioner to get tangles loosened.</li>
            <li> The bottle comes in an old, dirty and torn box with an blue ink stain on the bottom. The bottle seems to have been used - at least it is not full. The whole thing looked like it was coming from somebody&#x27;s dirty closet. Never seen anything like that before. It is especially disturbing for heath and beauty items, I am sure they have violated a number of regulations. It is hard to believe that this was ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and gives your hair a great feeling. It has dandruff go all crazy,this conditioner gives it&#x27;s details and produce what is stated on the label</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I think the product speaks for itself, and I&#x27;ll go on to say that it works tremendously well for my hair (thick and wavy), has a pleasant smell and leaves my hair feeling soft and well conditioned.  Compaired to many other conditioners for the same hair type, this product works remarkably well for me.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase more!!</li>
            <li> I never had dandruff until recently. I have tried many different shampoos but Neutrogena works for me. Follow the directions and allow the shampoo to stay on at least 5 minutes after each application. Also, use a conditioner made for dandruff  problems. I used Neutrogena&#x27;s and it works and smells great. Some of the dandruff products smell bad, but  Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Made my head itch.  Hair was fly away and not soft and shiny like advertised.</li>
            <li> I have used T-Gel in the past and it works very well. I expect it will work very wall again.</li>
            <li> i love T-gel.  I used it as a kid and recently decided to buy it again.  Great stuff.  And i actually really like the smell too.  Maybe its bc I&#x27;m nostalgic.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot and you can feel it working. I use it with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I&#x27;ve dealt with a few itchy spots on my head for as long as I can remember.  It&#x27;s embarrassing to scratch my head.  When I did, there was skin cells under my nail.  When my head is feeling itchy, I apply this during my shower on the spots that I have the most trouble in.  Then I work it into a lather through the rest of my hair.  I let it sit on my head for a minute or more.  It does a great job!</li>
            <li> Great scalp treatment if you don&#x27;t want all weird chemicals in your hair. I use this 2x per week. I find mixing up different shampoos and conditioners leaves my hair natural, bouncy and sexy! Rrrrrrrrrrr.......</li>
            <li> I liked the tgel shampoo but i don&#x27;t shampoo too often becuase of my curly frizz prone hair- so i thought i&#x27;d try the conditioner. Unfortunately I did not experience any positive results. It did feel nice on my scalp but did not keep the psoriasis or dandruff at bay. I would choose the shampoo over this next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Kroger and other generic knock-offs, but nothing beats the Neutragena original. It really works. I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was a teen. It can be harsh on your hair (leaving it really dry), so I always mix 1 part TGel to 3 parts hair conditioner. It takes away the cleaning power but NOT the effectiveness of the tar.</li>
            <li> This item really helps.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair needs.  I just condition close to the scalp (as directed) and when I rinse it seems to condition all of my hair on the way out.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine using it like a regular conditioner and drenching my hair to the tips.  It would be far too expensive.  But I have medium curly hair past my shoulders and just using it on my entire scalp does the job.  I do still use the Perfect 10 leave-in conditioner after towel drying.</li>
            <li> Love this! This is the perfect addition to the shampoo. When I use the corresponding shampoo my hair is very dry and straw like. With the addition of the conditioner it is soft. Using the shampoo and conditioner my scalp no longer itches. If you use the shampoo you need to use this!</li>
