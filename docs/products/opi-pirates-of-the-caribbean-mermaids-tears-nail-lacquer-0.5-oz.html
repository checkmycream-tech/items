            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love this polish more than I can say.</li>
            <li>However, I love OPI and it isreally close in color to &amp;#34;thanks a windmillion&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>one of my favorite nail polishes, and i get a lot of compliments when i use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a muted color.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s an interesting color.  </li>
            <li>Love OPI&#x27;s polishes and this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>So cute that they do movie collections.</li>
            <li>This had quickly become one of my very favorite polishes.</li>
            <li>color is very unique.</li>
            <li>nail polish goes on strong and gives a nice full coverage</li>
            <li>Two coats is good, three is better and longer lasting.  :)</li>
            <li>I love the color but it looks nothing like the photo shown in the picture, but I still love it very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lovely almost tiffany blue kind of color</li>
            <li>Till one day i saw a great manicure from the website, it totally blew me away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect green because it pairs well with almost anything in terms of clothing</li>
            <li>It sorta reminds me of a genuine turquoise stone.  </li>
            <li>and I love it very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a gorgeous color.  </li>
            <li>Top it off with Seche Vite top coat and this polish with last!  </li>
            <li>Beautiful shade of green.  </li>
            <li>Mermaid tears is my new favorite color.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>OPI is worth the money, to my way of thinking.  </li>
            <li>I always get many compliments whenever I wear this color more than any of my other polishes.</li>
            <li>I did 3 average coats which yielded good coverage.</li>
            <li>Very spring and summer!</li>
            <li>It is just fit for my skin, neither too mature nor too naive, just good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It reminds me of Easter - very spring&lt;</li>
            <li>and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>ALSO, and this is important, OPI colors (especially the non frosted ones) truly do help to strengthen nails.  </li>
            <li>The color was a bit streaky in the customary 2 coats, however if you&#x27;ve got a steady hand, you could always do two thicker coats.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not a mint green or bright turquoise like it often appears on screen.  </li>
            <li>I bought this highly sought after OPI nailpolish with high hopes...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this color, but my bottle is a little more greyish green vs the vibrant color pictured.</li>
            <li>MERMAID&#x27;S TEARS may seem a bit wild, but actually, it is a very neutral color.  </li>
            <li>So, I have purchased several OPI colors and am having fun with them.  </li>
            <li>Finally, i saw this in amazon and selling at a reasonable prize.</li>
            <li>It is not exactly like the picture though, it is a little lighter and more pale than in the picture, but I still like it :)</li>

            <li> The photo had me thinking this color was a cross between a mint green and a teal, but its definitely darker than that.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how I received a color that looks blue....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s limited edition!!!</li>
            <li> so Ill just use it as a back up for that and try to repurchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> As this is a discontinued series, im having a hard time to find it again.</li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Im puzzled and disappointed</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Discontinued color :(&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s limited edition!!! A painter can never have enough colors!!!</li>
            <li> OPI is one of my top fav nail polish. I have to say that i wasn&#x27;t too impress about \\&quot;mermaid tears\\&quot; at 1st. Till one day i saw a great manicure from the website, it totally blew me away. As this is a discontinued series, im having a hard time to find it again. Finally, i saw this in amazon and selling at a reasonable prize. I got my item superb fast consider mailing to Singapore, polish was well-bubbled wrapped. Great seller, great item!</li>
            <li> I love this color, as do so many people that look at my nails!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my understanding that the color has been discontinued by OPI so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Great color and Great polish. Bought it for my daughter and she love it.  This color and brand is one of her favorites.</li>
            <li> The color is not the same as the one used in the salon, but I am going to take it with me on my next manicure to see what they think. I&#x27;m not giving it up just yet</li>
            <li> I love the color but it looks nothing like the photo shown in the picture, but I still love it very much.</li>
            <li> This is my fav color i just love it.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the color! She loves Pirates of The Caribbean and nail polish so this was a perfect gift!</li>
            <li> I love the color. It is not exactly like the picture though, it is a little lighter and more pale than in the picture, but I still like it :)</li>
            <li> I love this polish more than I can say. It&#x27;s the perfect green because it pairs well with almost anything in terms of clothing so I don&#x27;t need to worry that my outfit won&#x27;t match my nail polish. The formula is perfect. Two layers coats the nails perfectly and it isn&#x27;t a streaky formula.</li>
            <li> I always get many compliments whenever I wear this color more than any of my other polishes. It&#x27;s a very lovely almost tiffany blue kind of color and I absolutely adore it. Very spring and summer!</li>

            <li> Worth every penny. Perfect! Love mermaid tears!</li>
            <li> It last a long time, you must use two coats and it takes a while to dry but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I bought this highly sought after OPI nailpolish with high hopes... Everyone that is an OPI collector knows that this polish is a must have so I paid about $10 for it thinking it would be just amazing.  The color is pretty close in real life as it is in person, but the one I received has random grey streaks throughout the polish and doesnt quite match up.. so I was a little disappointed.  However, I love OPI and it isreally close in color to &amp;#34;thanks a windmillion&amp;#34; so Ill just use it as a back up for that and try to repurchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> My daughter has convinced me to jump into COLOR and the 21st Century! So, I have purchased several OPI colors and am having fun with them.  MERMAID&#x27;S TEARS may seem a bit wild, but actually, it is a very neutral color.  ALSO, and this is important, OPI colors (especially the non frosted ones) truly do help to strengthen nails.  Mine are growing out nicely with the non-frosted colors.  OPI is worth the money, to my way of thinking.  NO TEARS WITH MERMAID&#x27;S TEARS. I am using my husband&#x27;s computer tonight, so it lists this review as having come from him.  It comes from me.  He doesn&#x27;t use nail polish.  LOL.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for my red haired grand daughter with her fair skin. She loves it and it looks really great!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted me to buy her this color for Christmas and she loves the color.  Beautiful shade of green.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite nail polishes, and i get a lot of compliments when i use it. the color is just like the picture</li>
            <li> very beautiful color and I love it very much. It is just fit for my skin, neither too mature nor too naive, just good.</li>
            <li> The color was a bit streaky in the customary 2 coats, however if you&#x27;ve got a steady hand, you could always do two thicker coats. I did 3 average coats which yielded good coverage. I love this color, but my bottle is a little more greyish green vs the vibrant color pictured. I am an OPI fan, so it&#x27;s a lovely color to have!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color!  But it does not look like the swatches on Amazon.  Google it.  It can look very bright in a lot of the photos but it isn&#x27;t bright.  It&#x27;s more of a muted color.  But it is BEAUTIFUL nonetheless.  I think it&#x27;s an interesting color.  It&#x27;s definitely not a mint green or bright turquoise like it often appears on screen.  It sorta reminds me of a genuine turquoise stone.  The cream formula is definitely easy to work with and dries to a beautiful finish!  Top it off with Seche Vite top coat and this polish with last!  Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, great polish. Love OPI&#x27;s polishes and this did not disappoint. Mermaid tears is my new favorite color. So cute that they do movie collections.</li>
            <li> Thank you for adding to my nail polish addiction.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and durable</li>
