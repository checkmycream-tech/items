            <li>Tis product is easy to use!</li>
            <li>clear tray set stated \\&quot;deep\\&quot; compartments, but they are HUGE!!!!  </li>

            <li>Very cheap product.  </li>
            <li>The pack fits nicely on the counter and is an easy reminder.</li>
            <li>I love my new pill cases they fit perfectly in my pocketbook</li>
            <li>and the compartments are huge!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems there are many choices here on which one to get.</li>
            <li>I came across this one and am so glad I went with it.</li>
            <li>These things make it so much better then hauling all the bottles of amino acids around.</li>
            <li>One way that it has changed my life is in being able to prepare my pills just once a week.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product, and I even ordered one for my mother... who in turn bought one for her husband!</li>
            <li>34;AM/PM&amp;#34; on top has worn off.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for my daily needs and travels with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>I thought it would hold more than it did.  </li>
            <li>It holds more pills than you would think.</li>
            <li>They fit nicely in my purse.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will get better after I have used it more.</li>
            <li>I like the way you can take out one or more days for travel</li>
            <li>The more I&#x27;ve used them, the more they have losened up.</li>
            <li>(And stylish).</li>
            <li>Effective, Fit in my pocket.</li>
            <li>have many pills to take in the am and pm.</li>
            <li>Excellent way to keep my numerous meds organized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many pills spill in my purse.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>so I  able to load up for the month with two packs.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I could get twice as many in the AM section.  </li>
            <li>I am going to look for a more durable product, but maybe I just got a lemon.</li>
            <li>Love that it has AM and PM compartments.</li>
            <li>I love the portability and design.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind having 2 more</li>
            <li>That helps track when you need more prescription pills.  </li>
            <li>I have NO problems with fitting all my pills inside (which include a large-sized fish oil pill, large-sized calcium, large-sized vitamin, etc.)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Preferred the 4 compartment organizers which are better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I plan to but two more as gifts.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Cute, too.</li>
            <li>The top still stays on so</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s room for way more.</li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>On the bright side I haven&#x27;t forgotten a dose once since I keep this right on my counter</li>
            <li>what it was, but thanks to Amazon Owen got his Birthday wish!!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for carrying 10-15 pills (some of mine are large and the Fish Oil was over 1&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>perfect has changed my life so simple so easy</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel &amp; daily doses, easily fits into pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible it will seeing as it&#x27;s just plastic and all, but they&#x27;ve been fine and therefore I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>And yes - I was more excited to to receive this box :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m worried that the tops may snap off at some point, but they&#x27;ve held on great thus far.</li>
            <li>I think there is room for more pills so maybe 15 - 18 will fit in an AM or PM section at a time.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of these, and they are indeed very useful in transporting my vitamins and pills each day.</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill, store and each box</li>
            <li>It is so easy to just slip the box in your purse, pocket, lunch</li>
            <li>The separate day containers are great so there isn&#x27;t a huge week container that you have to manipulate and in my case the individual containers are better for dropping the contents into the feeding slot on the top of a huge fish tank.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pop a case in my purse if I know I&#x27;ll be out when it&#x27;s time to take my pills.</li>
            <li>The openings are easy to use and yet sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Has made organizing twice-daily meds really easy.  </li>
            <li>how easily I can keep it organized.</li>
            <li>Easy for traveling to.</li>
            <li>It is easy to grab the box for the day and put in my purse when I am on the go.  </li>
            <li>Easy to pop in his pocket when we anticipate being away all day.</li>
            <li>Easy to view contents.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and so versatile.</li>
            <li>It fits a ton of pills and my two fiber gummies easily.</li>
            <li>Junk break off to easily</li>
            <li>Unless you have very many extremely large pills, this size box will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very handy to be able to take an individual box to work if I happen to be taking breakfast at work, or have a dinner engagement.</li>
            <li>Works perfect for 7 days of meds for the average person.</li>
            <li>Even the one with the cracked lid has been fine.</li>
            <li>Lots of pills fit in it easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill and doesn&#x27;t fly open by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I often go away for a day or two at short notice and thought these would be great because I can just grab the days i need on my way out the door</li>
            <li>They are well made with smooth edges.</li>
            <li>This organizer is actually one of the smaller ones of its kind on the market, and fits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>I like being able to take out one day&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I can fit everything in one side of each day&#x27;s case.</li>
            <li>really like that each day is it&#x27;s own box.</li>
            <li>The plastic boxes themselves also look cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Great product; I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>I never have to move pills around to make them fit.</li>
            <li>Once I get them all filled for the week, I check my prescriptions and vitamins to see what I need to reorder.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product for the price</li>
            <li>This is SUCH a great buy.</li>
            <li>I can fit all of my pills per time of day in the slots and have room.  </li>
            <li>I can fit almost 6 multi vitamins in a slot.</li>
            <li>Love the size and having 7 days worth of vitamins</li>
            <li>Having these brightly colored boxes right in my kitchen is the friendly reminder I need in the morning, then I take that day&#x27;s box with me in my purse so in the afternoon/evening I&#x27;ll be ready to take my evening vitamins.  </li>
            <li>Nice large compartments and easy to remove a day&#x27;s worth if I need to be away from home.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, these organizers are very nicely made and the lids click shut and are very secure, so you shouldn&#x27;t have any surprise openings, especially if packed for a</li>
            <li>The boxes are nice and well made but all the lettering on was wiped away just by normal handling.</li>
            <li>not raving about it because it seems like this type of product should be straightforward.  </li>
            <li>Love this pill box, I can pull out the day I am on and throw it in my purse to take with me, it is very convenient!</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re in the middle of infertility treatment, it&#x27;s amazing how many pills you can end up taking.  </li>
            <li>This case is perfect for him and for any adult who may take 5-6 larger capsules twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Works better than others, although I wish the flip-lids would open more easily.</li>
            <li>Most helpful for me as I keep my stuff in a large basket and toss the sorter on top...uneven.  </li>
            <li>The doors on the boxes are remarkably sturdy and easy to open, but won&#x27;t accidentally open on their own.</li>
            <li>This pill organizer is good but not as deep</li>
            <li>It is true to color and size.</li>
            <li>I really like being able to grab one of the cells (?</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these boxes several months ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have medicine I need to take in the morning, but I like to take my vitamins on a full stomach at night.  </li>
            <li>Convenient size for several pills, nice to have AM PM separate compartments, easy to store in any place and to take just a couple of days doses if needed.</li>
            <li>And it is pretty easy to load the pills.</li>
            <li>I easily fit 5 pills into a side, including two very large capsules.  </li>
            <li>They are great for this since they have large AM/PM compartments on separate daily containers for twice a day feeding.</li>
            <li>I do use a medium size rubber band to secure the boxes in their tray Great for travel and everyday use.</li>
            <li>Super convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it comes time to refill it is quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have personally found the four compartment, inch deep pill box the best for my needs.</li>
            <li>Quick tip:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Large, a full week of AM and PM with room for all my pills!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice thing is if you&#x27;re going to be away from home for a few days, it&#x27;s very easy to just grab the days you need and</li>
            <li>My husband and I both take medication twice a day and the 7-day bill box organizer has really made it easy.</li>
            <li>By pressing gently below of the lip of the compartment the lid lifts easily.</li>
            <li>That makes it really easy and quick to figure out which day I&#x27;m on for the next day. :)</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this when it came in the mail because it looked like it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>, I am putting 16 vitamins, including 8 of which are large size ones, and can fit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pill boxes aren&#x27;t really something to rave about since they seem like they&#x27;d be easy to make, right?  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about this concept and for the first few weeks, it was great.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are labeled clearly and separate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not unhappy with these.  </li>
            <li>Of all the pill containers/management systems I have tried over the years and there have been quite a few, this is far and away the best I have come across.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the simple yet elegant comes through in their design.</li>
            <li>meaning that I can use the pill box for 2 weeks worth of pills since I don&#x27;t need the AM/PM separation.</li>
            <li>Handy way to keep up with daily meds without bulkiness!!</li>
            <li>We are extremely satisfied with this very affordable pill box organizer and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I searched and searched for the right pill box.</li>
            <li>The compartments are just the right size for what I need as they hold those horse-sized supplements like Calcium as well as my prescription medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love being able to sit down and fill the boxes once per week and not have to worry about it.  </li>
            <li>You have enough room to fit perhaps 5 large fish oil pills in each compartment, plus vitamins, and more.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this for storage of very large pills.</li>
            <li>The large, bold lettering showing the day of the week and the \\&quot;AM\\&quot; and \\&quot;PM\\&quot; on each compartment has not faded or flaked.</li>
            <li>This handy pill box holds all my daily pills, some of which are rather large.  </li>
            <li>It is a little large for me, but it is very handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise - easy to handle, clear to read.</li>
            <li>Much better than carrying an entire week&#x27;s worth of pills.</li>
            <li>Easy to open and adequate pill space.</li>
            <li>Very spacious, convenient and colorful..</li>
            <li>This works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>Also, I can quickly remember whether or not I&#x27;ve already taken pills at a particular time</li>
            <li>The lids could be sturdier but they have and will serve their purpose well and are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I think the size is perfect since they hold a lot, but small enough to take with me to work in a labcoat pocket or a bag.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought this that the size of the compartments would hold all the medicines I needed to put in them, but I put in 10 pills, all different sizes and shapes</li>
            <li>If you are purchasing them for someone who has reduced movement in their fingers, I&#x27;d recommend opening them and closing them and losening them up mulitple times when you first get them</li>
            <li>And it was a present for myself (love It).</li>
            <li>I take 10 or more pills per day at three different times of the day.  </li>
            <li>sure to get the Blue tray one.</li>
            <li>Item is EXACTLY as pictured.</li>
            <li>I really like this idea and like this item!</li>
            <li>Have had this a year and continues to work as well today as first day.</li>
            <li>the item is not useless.</li>
            <li>It sounds like they have a really good guarantee, so you could always try it and contact the company if you are having trouble with it.</li>
            <li>Nontheless I&#x27;m usually able to fit between 6-8 or 9 pills per each half of the boxes depending on size.</li>
            <li>The individual boxes are a nice size and fit  multiple large pills in them.</li>
            <li>The 1st time you need nails to open the compartments, but the good thing is they shut properly.</li>
            <li>Since my husband and I take several meds/vitamins daily, and some are rather large, I wanted to make sure I had an organizer that can easily hold all.  </li>
            <li>the small one is thinner and breaks more easily.</li>
            <li>she pretty much has it from there makes her life</li>
            <li>I particularly like that I can pop out a day or a weekend&#x27;s worth of pills and take them with me without having to cart the whole week&#x27;s supply around.</li>
            <li>I love these - they go right in my purse and always stay closed!</li>
            <li>but they fall out of the larger box easily.</li>
            <li>This organizer is sturdy and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>It easily fits all seven of my daily pills including two large supplements.  </li>
            <li>you have large pills get the 2 compartment.</li>
            <li>This product will hold large pills if you need to take them.  </li>
            <li>Large compartments for AM/PM pills and seperate container for each day.</li>
            <li>It has AM and PM compartments and holds any number of medications and large vitamins.  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy yet easy to open.</li>
            <li>This is so much more handy compared to the solid week pill organizers that are far less transportable.</li>
            <li>Handy little boxes.</li>
            <li>I love this item and am ordering a few more for family and back up for myself.</li>
            <li>and I could basically double that and still fit.</li>
            <li>Placing it in a shirt pocket should not be much of a problem and it won&#x27;t take up much room in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So now I dnt have to carry so much stuff around.</li>
            <li>I have about 6 or 7 supplements I take, and its very convenient to go through all those bottles just once and have the whole week laid out.</li>
            <li>The lids remain intact and the days printed on the side also remain legible.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>cheaply made &amp; some boxes do not lock properly so pills fall out.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and makes remembering your medications/</li>
            <li>I really like this set of pill boxes.</li>
            <li>This keeps him very organized.</li>
            <li>Very convenient for me.  </li>
            <li>I now have 4 of them and while filling all 28 days is time consuming, I am ready to go on a trip, visit family for a week or just put the day&#x27;s pills in my pocket at the drop of a hat.  </li>
            <li>If I were to throw a pack in my purse I would definitely use a rubber band or two to secure it.</li>
            <li>This one is much flatter yet holds 20 pills/supplements no problem.</li>
            <li>Very portable.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to take the whole pill box, but just the day you need it.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for my father-in-law.</li>
            <li>He has real memory problems.</li>
            <li>The lettering is staying on very well.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a real depth to the divided holders.</li>
            <li>The boxes for daily use stay secure in the tray.  </li>
            <li>So this has come in handy to not only keep track of my pills but for convenience of having to open just one &#x27;container&#x27; to get my meds.  </li>
            <li>You can easily pack 7+ pills in each compartment as long as you take the time to lay them in there neatly.</li>
            <li>There is room for probably 2 more small ones or maybe 1 more big one.</li>
            <li>These arthritic fingers originally fumbled and the joints rebelled when trying to just get a compartment open.</li>
            <li>Love this compared to the other options in pill boxes.</li>
            <li>Further, the lids are clear and you can easily see in to them.  </li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used the organizers that are all one piece, with some kind of flip up lid for each day.</li>
            <li>They can also stay fairly propped open, so every week I line them all up, open all the lids: they stay open, and fill up for the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also love the days of the week showing, I turn them upside down once they are done.</li>
            <li>These boxes have simplified my life and made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.</li>
            <li>Some of the pills need to be spaced out and/or taken at particular times.</li>
            <li>I was able to place it back in and have continued to use it anyway, but this is an indication that the lids are fragile.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these organizers...</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Each day has 2 compartments, so if you need to take your pills or vitamins more frequently than just twice a day, you may want to consider the other versions that have 3 or 4 slots.  </li>
            <li>So for almost all of my pills I can keep them in the cases, other more sensitive pills still need to be taken out from the bottle.</li>
            <li>These will accommodate large pills (e.g. fish oil) as well as stay closed when the compartment is packed full with pills pressing against the lid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for more than a few months and the doors to the compartments don&#x27;t feel any weaker.</li>
            <li>and there is room for a few more.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t keep them fresh outside of the bottles, not the cases fault.</li>
            <li>I can fit a large chewable calcium tablet, a couple of large pills and some small pills in each compartment.</li>
            <li>This easily holds larger multivitamin and five or so smaller (ibuprofen sized) pills.  </li>
            <li>It would be possible to fit a little more if necessary.  </li>
            <li>And have the other side free for medications...</li>
            <li>Finally, they snap closed pretty securely.  </li>
            <li>I live alone</li>
            <li>even though its brand new.</li>
            <li>go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had these for months now and they still look new.</li>
            <li>I really like the clear tops, and that they are clearly made in the USA</li>
            <li>finding I like the one I bought locally better - it isn&#x27;t any harder to open and seems sturdier.  </li>
            <li>Love this little box!  </li>
            <li>However, this is the 3rd pill case I&#x27;ve bought (first one disintegrated</li>
            <li>but I usually put the week into a quart zip lock or a snap lock container when I pack in my carry on just to be sure.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually review stuff, but these little pill organizers are a great thing to have.  </li>
            <li>When I first had the meds in the clear tray organizer set, there was enough room for 2-times</li>
            <li>However, I have not had them that long and a piece of the plastic that holds the top on broke off of the pink container and landed in my hand when I dumped my pills.</li>
            <li>They are easy to open (see below) but also stay securely closed</li>
            <li>I like the fact they&#x27;re square, so it&#x27;s easy to rotate them such that the day label isn&#x27;t visible when a day&#x27;s through (for those of us who don&#x27;t know what day of the week it is until the second or third cup of coffee).</li>
            <li>The compartments don&#x27;t have a big enough lip on the lids to make them as easy to open as some customers may need.</li>
            <li>Wish I could find one with 4 compartments but the slots are large enough for all of my pills</li>
            <li>The compartments are large enough to carry the largest capsules.</li>
            <li>This pill organizer is a good size however the compartments are very hard to open</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the issue is, clearly something in how they manufactured it because it has been this way since I got it.</li>
            <li>It seems really sturdy and I feel it will last me</li>
            <li>When I go out of town (which is frequent), I can just take the boxes for the days of the week I&#x27;ll be gone and leave the rest at home.</li>
            <li>This way you know when you have taken your pills completely for the day.</li>
            <li>So far the days of the week seem like they won&#x27;t erase or scratch off, so I&#x27;m glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for making life easier for a young woman.</li>
            <li>So is my 8 year old Grandson Owen.  </li>
            <li>These are very convenient boxes for managing meds and supplements, especially with its AM/PM divider.</li>
            <li>So far this size works well for me.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend after we took a trip and his old pill box spilled its contents in my purse.</li>
            <li>If you take more capsules (probiotics, fish oils, supplements) and approach 8+ twice a day, you should get the green tray which has bigger</li>
            <li>I wish this product was sturdy enough for everyday use, because I love everything else about it.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a good pill storage system, you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>It love this pill box I highly recommend it absolutely nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li>The size is great but they are a little hard to open for my old fingers.  </li>
            <li>Have the pill organizer in the larger size...1 inch high.  </li>
            <li>I will also say that the boxes could be a bit deeper as some larger pills make for a tight fit.</li>
            <li>lids stay closed and secure, but aren&#x27;t super hard to open, which I like.</li>
            <li>The lids snap tight and hold in place, but they are easy enough to open.</li>
            <li>I love these this silly little things enough to write a review on them! :)</li>
            <li>I take several meds daily to include the large fish oil, multivitamin, calcium, and several smaller-sized meds...</li>
            <li>I debated which of these pill organizers to get - the one with the blue tray (this one) or the one with the clear tray.</li>
            <li>I prefer the blue tray organizer as far as size.  </li>
            <li>take several vitamins and supplements both morning and night and so far these have held everything I needed.  </li>
            <li>The picture on this one&#x27;s packaging looks the most like what I bought locally (mine is green and purple, as shown on the packaging, but the actual product pictured is red and blue).</li>
            <li>The boxes are also a bit hard to open unless you are dextrous and have strong fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know not too big, not too small, definitely sturdy, easy to transport, etc.</li>
            <li>I bought this blue compartment tray set as well as the larger clear compartment tray organizer set.  </li>
            <li>Opening eight different pill bottles every morning and three different pill bottles every night was getting really old.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste precious time everyday trying to figure out what you need to</li>
            <li>the packaging was just fine, but the yellow box was cracked on one side (like the lid was forced on crooked and cracked it).  </li>
            <li>I mentioned the oddly shaped AM/PM compartments make loading them a pain, and they are too small for many supplements.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap plastic and second one was hard to remove individual days)</li>
            <li>So far this has been the only 7 day dispenser that is big enough for all my stuff.</li>
            <li>The compartment lids snap shut with enough force to not pop open on their own, but not so difficult it can&#x27;t be open one handed.</li>
            <li>They were also a bit stiff to open at first.  </li>
            <li>If you have to take quite a few large pills, however, you may want to consider another option (see image gallery).  </li>
            <li>but you can carefully pop the clear tops off, fill and then pop them back into place.</li>

            <li> Tis product is easy to use!</li>

            <li> Very cheap product.  </li>

            <li> I love my new pill cases they fit perfectly in my pocketbook</li>
            <li> and the compartments are huge!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems there are many choices here on which one to get.</li>
            <li> I came across this one and am so glad I went with it.</li>
            <li> These things make it so much better then hauling all the bottles of amino acids around.</li>
            <li> One way that it has changed my life is in being able to prepare my pills just once a week.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product, and I even ordered one for my mother... who in turn bought one for her husband!</li>
            <li> 34;AM/PM&amp;#34; on top has worn off.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for my daily needs and travels with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> I thought it would hold more than it did.  </li>
            <li> It holds more pills than you would think.</li>
            <li> They fit nicely in my purse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will get better after I have used it more.</li>
            <li> I like the way you can take out one or more days for travel</li>
            <li> The more I&#x27;ve used them, the more they have losened up.</li>
            <li> (And stylish).</li>
            <li> Effective, Fit in my pocket.</li>
            <li> have many pills to take in the am and pm.</li>
            <li> Excellent way to keep my numerous meds organized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many pills spill in my purse.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> so I  able to load up for the month with two packs.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I could get twice as many in the AM section.  </li>
            <li> I am going to look for a more durable product, but maybe I just got a lemon.</li>
            <li> Love that it has AM and PM compartments.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and design.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind having 2 more</li>
            <li> That helps track when you need more prescription pills.  </li>
            <li> I have NO problems with fitting all my pills inside (which include a large-sized fish oil pill, large-sized calcium, large-sized vitamin, etc.)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Preferred the 4 compartment organizers which are better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I plan to but two more as gifts.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> Cute, too.</li>
            <li> The top still stays on so</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s room for way more.</li>
            <li> Cheap!</li>
            <li> On the bright side I haven&#x27;t forgotten a dose once since I keep this right on my counter</li>
            <li> what it was, but thanks to Amazon Owen got his Birthday wish!!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for carrying 10-15 pills (some of mine are large and the Fish Oil was over 1&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> perfect has changed my life so simple so easy</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel &amp; daily doses, easily fits into pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible it will seeing as it&#x27;s just plastic and all, but they&#x27;ve been fine and therefore I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> And yes - I was more excited to to receive this box :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried that the tops may snap off at some point, but they&#x27;ve held on great thus far.</li>
            <li> I think there is room for more pills so maybe 15 - 18 will fit in an AM or PM section at a time.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of these, and they are indeed very useful in transporting my vitamins and pills each day.</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill, store and each box</li>
            <li> It is so easy to just slip the box in your purse, pocket, lunch</li>
            <li> The separate day containers are great so there isn&#x27;t a huge week container that you have to manipulate and in my case the individual containers are better for dropping the contents into the feeding slot on the top of a huge fish tank.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pop a case in my purse if I know I&#x27;ll be out when it&#x27;s time to take my pills.</li>
            <li> The openings are easy to use and yet sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Has made organizing twice-daily meds really easy.  </li>
            <li> how easily I can keep it organized.</li>
            <li> Easy for traveling to.</li>
            <li> It is easy to grab the box for the day and put in my purse when I am on the go.  </li>
            <li> Easy to pop in his pocket when we anticipate being away all day.</li>
            <li> Easy to view contents.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and so versatile.</li>
            <li> It fits a ton of pills and my two fiber gummies easily.</li>
            <li> Junk break off to easily</li>
            <li> Unless you have very many extremely large pills, this size box will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very handy to be able to take an individual box to work if I happen to be taking breakfast at work, or have a dinner engagement.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for 7 days of meds for the average person.</li>
            <li> Even the one with the cracked lid has been fine.</li>
            <li> Lots of pills fit in it easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill and doesn&#x27;t fly open by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I often go away for a day or two at short notice and thought these would be great because I can just grab the days i need on my way out the door</li>
            <li> They are well made with smooth edges.</li>
            <li> This organizer is actually one of the smaller ones of its kind on the market, and fits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like being able to take out one day&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I can fit everything in one side of each day&#x27;s case.</li>
            <li> really like that each day is it&#x27;s own box.</li>
            <li> The plastic boxes themselves also look cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Great product; I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I never have to move pills around to make them fit.</li>
            <li> Once I get them all filled for the week, I check my prescriptions and vitamins to see what I need to reorder.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product for the price</li>
            <li> This is SUCH a great buy.</li>
            <li> I can fit all of my pills per time of day in the slots and have room.  </li>
            <li> I can fit almost 6 multi vitamins in a slot.</li>
            <li> Love the size and having 7 days worth of vitamins</li>
            <li> Having these brightly colored boxes right in my kitchen is the friendly reminder I need in the morning, then I take that day&#x27;s box with me in my purse so in the afternoon/evening I&#x27;ll be ready to take my evening vitamins.  </li>
            <li> Nice large compartments and easy to remove a day&#x27;s worth if I need to be away from home.  </li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, these organizers are very nicely made and the lids click shut and are very secure, so you shouldn&#x27;t have any surprise openings, especially if packed for a</li>
            <li> The boxes are nice and well made but all the lettering on was wiped away just by normal handling.</li>
            <li> not raving about it because it seems like this type of product should be straightforward.  </li>
            <li> Love this pill box, I can pull out the day I am on and throw it in my purse to take with me, it is very convenient!</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re in the middle of infertility treatment, it&#x27;s amazing how many pills you can end up taking.  </li>
            <li> This case is perfect for him and for any adult who may take 5-6 larger capsules twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Works better than others, although I wish the flip-lids would open more easily.</li>
            <li> Most helpful for me as I keep my stuff in a large basket and toss the sorter on top...uneven.  </li>
            <li> The doors on the boxes are remarkably sturdy and easy to open, but won&#x27;t accidentally open on their own.</li>
            <li> This pill organizer is good but not as deep</li>
            <li> It is true to color and size.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to grab one of the cells (?</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these boxes several months ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have medicine I need to take in the morning, but I like to take my vitamins on a full stomach at night.  </li>
            <li> Convenient size for several pills, nice to have AM PM separate compartments, easy to store in any place and to take just a couple of days doses if needed.</li>
            <li> And it is pretty easy to load the pills.</li>
            <li> I easily fit 5 pills into a side, including two very large capsules.  </li>
            <li> They are great for this since they have large AM/PM compartments on separate daily containers for twice a day feeding.</li>
            <li> I do use a medium size rubber band to secure the boxes in their tray Great for travel and everyday use.</li>
            <li> Super convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it comes time to refill it is quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have personally found the four compartment, inch deep pill box the best for my needs.</li>
            <li> Quick tip:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Large, a full week of AM and PM with room for all my pills!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice thing is if you&#x27;re going to be away from home for a few days, it&#x27;s very easy to just grab the days you need and</li>
            <li> My husband and I both take medication twice a day and the 7-day bill box organizer has really made it easy.</li>
            <li> By pressing gently below of the lip of the compartment the lid lifts easily.</li>
            <li> That makes it really easy and quick to figure out which day I&#x27;m on for the next day. :)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this when it came in the mail because it looked like it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> , I am putting 16 vitamins, including 8 of which are large size ones, and can fit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pill boxes aren&#x27;t really something to rave about since they seem like they&#x27;d be easy to make, right?  </li>
            <li> I was really excited about this concept and for the first few weeks, it was great.  </li>
            <li> I love that they are labeled clearly and separate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not unhappy with these.  </li>
            <li> Of all the pill containers/management systems I have tried over the years and there have been quite a few, this is far and away the best I have come across.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the simple yet elegant comes through in their design.</li>
            <li> meaning that I can use the pill box for 2 weeks worth of pills since I don&#x27;t need the AM/PM separation.</li>
            <li> Handy way to keep up with daily meds without bulkiness!!</li>
            <li> We are extremely satisfied with this very affordable pill box organizer and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I searched and searched for the right pill box.</li>
            <li> The compartments are just the right size for what I need as they hold those horse-sized supplements like Calcium as well as my prescription medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love being able to sit down and fill the boxes once per week and not have to worry about it.  </li>
            <li> You have enough room to fit perhaps 5 large fish oil pills in each compartment, plus vitamins, and more.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this for storage of very large pills.</li>
            <li> The large, bold lettering showing the day of the week and the \\&quot;AM\\&quot; and \\&quot;PM\\&quot; on each compartment has not faded or flaked.</li>
            <li> This handy pill box holds all my daily pills, some of which are rather large.  </li>
            <li> It is a little large for me, but it is very handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise - easy to handle, clear to read.</li>
            <li> Much better than carrying an entire week&#x27;s worth of pills.</li>
            <li> Easy to open and adequate pill space.</li>
            <li> Very spacious, convenient and colorful..</li>
            <li> This works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, I can quickly remember whether or not I&#x27;ve already taken pills at a particular time</li>
            <li> The lids could be sturdier but they have and will serve their purpose well and are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I think the size is perfect since they hold a lot, but small enough to take with me to work in a labcoat pocket or a bag.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought this that the size of the compartments would hold all the medicines I needed to put in them, but I put in 10 pills, all different sizes and shapes</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing them for someone who has reduced movement in their fingers, I&#x27;d recommend opening them and closing them and losening them up mulitple times when you first get them</li>
            <li> And it was a present for myself (love It).</li>
            <li> I take 10 or more pills per day at three different times of the day.  </li>
            <li> sure to get the Blue tray one.</li>
            <li> Item is EXACTLY as pictured.</li>
            <li> I really like this idea and like this item!</li>
            <li> Have had this a year and continues to work as well today as first day.</li>
            <li> the item is not useless.</li>
            <li> It sounds like they have a really good guarantee, so you could always try it and contact the company if you are having trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Nontheless I&#x27;m usually able to fit between 6-8 or 9 pills per each half of the boxes depending on size.</li>
            <li> The individual boxes are a nice size and fit  multiple large pills in them.</li>
            <li> The 1st time you need nails to open the compartments, but the good thing is they shut properly.</li>
            <li> Since my husband and I take several meds/vitamins daily, and some are rather large, I wanted to make sure I had an organizer that can easily hold all.  </li>
            <li> the small one is thinner and breaks more easily.</li>
            <li> she pretty much has it from there makes her life</li>
            <li> I particularly like that I can pop out a day or a weekend&#x27;s worth of pills and take them with me without having to cart the whole week&#x27;s supply around.</li>
            <li> I love these - they go right in my purse and always stay closed!</li>
            <li> but they fall out of the larger box easily.</li>
            <li> This organizer is sturdy and easy to open.  </li>
            <li> It easily fits all seven of my daily pills including two large supplements.  </li>
            <li> you have large pills get the 2 compartment.</li>
            <li> This product will hold large pills if you need to take them.  </li>
            <li> Large compartments for AM/PM pills and seperate container for each day.</li>
            <li> It has AM and PM compartments and holds any number of medications and large vitamins.  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy yet easy to open.</li>
            <li> This is so much more handy compared to the solid week pill organizers that are far less transportable.</li>
            <li> Handy little boxes.</li>
            <li> I love this item and am ordering a few more for family and back up for myself.</li>
            <li> and I could basically double that and still fit.</li>
            <li> Placing it in a shirt pocket should not be much of a problem and it won&#x27;t take up much room in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So now I dnt have to carry so much stuff around.</li>
            <li> I have about 6 or 7 supplements I take, and its very convenient to go through all those bottles just once and have the whole week laid out.</li>
            <li> The lids remain intact and the days printed on the side also remain legible.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> cheaply made &amp; some boxes do not lock properly so pills fall out.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and makes remembering your medications/</li>
            <li> I really like this set of pill boxes.</li>
            <li> This keeps him very organized.</li>
            <li> Very convenient for me.  </li>
            <li> I now have 4 of them and while filling all 28 days is time consuming, I am ready to go on a trip, visit family for a week or just put the day&#x27;s pills in my pocket at the drop of a hat.  </li>
            <li> If I were to throw a pack in my purse I would definitely use a rubber band or two to secure it.</li>
            <li> This one is much flatter yet holds 20 pills/supplements no problem.</li>
            <li> Very portable.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to take the whole pill box, but just the day you need it.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for my father-in-law.</li>
            <li> He has real memory problems.</li>
            <li> The lettering is staying on very well.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a real depth to the divided holders.</li>
            <li> The boxes for daily use stay secure in the tray.  </li>
            <li> So this has come in handy to not only keep track of my pills but for convenience of having to open just one &#x27;container&#x27; to get my meds.  </li>
            <li> You can easily pack 7+ pills in each compartment as long as you take the time to lay them in there neatly.</li>
            <li> There is room for probably 2 more small ones or maybe 1 more big one.</li>
            <li> These arthritic fingers originally fumbled and the joints rebelled when trying to just get a compartment open.</li>
            <li> Love this compared to the other options in pill boxes.</li>
            <li> Further, the lids are clear and you can easily see in to them.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used the organizers that are all one piece, with some kind of flip up lid for each day.</li>
            <li> They can also stay fairly propped open, so every week I line them all up, open all the lids: they stay open, and fill up for the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also love the days of the week showing, I turn them upside down once they are done.</li>
            <li> These boxes have simplified my life and made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.</li>
            <li> Some of the pills need to be spaced out and/or taken at particular times.</li>
            <li> I was able to place it back in and have continued to use it anyway, but this is an indication that the lids are fragile.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these organizers...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Each day has 2 compartments, so if you need to take your pills or vitamins more frequently than just twice a day, you may want to consider the other versions that have 3 or 4 slots.  </li>
            <li> So for almost all of my pills I can keep them in the cases, other more sensitive pills still need to be taken out from the bottle.</li>
            <li> These will accommodate large pills (e.g. fish oil) as well as stay closed when the compartment is packed full with pills pressing against the lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for more than a few months and the doors to the compartments don&#x27;t feel any weaker.</li>
            <li> and there is room for a few more.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep them fresh outside of the bottles, not the cases fault.</li>
            <li> I can fit a large chewable calcium tablet, a couple of large pills and some small pills in each compartment.</li>
            <li> This easily holds larger multivitamin and five or so smaller (ibuprofen sized) pills.  </li>
            <li> It would be possible to fit a little more if necessary.  </li>
            <li> And have the other side free for medications...</li>
            <li> Finally, they snap closed pretty securely.  </li>
            <li> I live alone</li>
            <li> even though its brand new.</li>
            <li> go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had these for months now and they still look new.</li>
            <li> I really like the clear tops, and that they are clearly made in the USA</li>
            <li> finding I like the one I bought locally better - it isn&#x27;t any harder to open and seems sturdier.  </li>
            <li> Love this little box!  </li>
            <li> However, this is the 3rd pill case I&#x27;ve bought (first one disintegrated</li>
            <li> but I usually put the week into a quart zip lock or a snap lock container when I pack in my carry on just to be sure.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review stuff, but these little pill organizers are a great thing to have.  </li>
            <li> When I first had the meds in the clear tray organizer set, there was enough room for 2-times</li>
            <li> However, I have not had them that long and a piece of the plastic that holds the top on broke off of the pink container and landed in my hand when I dumped my pills.</li>
            <li> They are easy to open (see below) but also stay securely closed</li>
            <li> I like the fact they&#x27;re square, so it&#x27;s easy to rotate them such that the day label isn&#x27;t visible when a day&#x27;s through (for those of us who don&#x27;t know what day of the week it is until the second or third cup of coffee).</li>
            <li> The compartments don&#x27;t have a big enough lip on the lids to make them as easy to open as some customers may need.</li>
            <li> Wish I could find one with 4 compartments but the slots are large enough for all of my pills</li>
            <li> The compartments are large enough to carry the largest capsules.</li>
            <li> This pill organizer is a good size however the compartments are very hard to open</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the issue is, clearly something in how they manufactured it because it has been this way since I got it.</li>
            <li> It seems really sturdy and I feel it will last me</li>
            <li> When I go out of town (which is frequent), I can just take the boxes for the days of the week I&#x27;ll be gone and leave the rest at home.</li>
            <li> This way you know when you have taken your pills completely for the day.</li>
            <li> So far the days of the week seem like they won&#x27;t erase or scratch off, so I&#x27;m glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you for making life easier for a young woman.</li>
            <li> So is my 8 year old Grandson Owen.  </li>
            <li> These are very convenient boxes for managing meds and supplements, especially with its AM/PM divider.</li>
            <li> So far this size works well for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend after we took a trip and his old pill box spilled its contents in my purse.</li>
            <li> If you take more capsules (probiotics, fish oils, supplements) and approach 8+ twice a day, you should get the green tray which has bigger</li>
            <li> I wish this product was sturdy enough for everyday use, because I love everything else about it.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a good pill storage system, you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It love this pill box I highly recommend it absolutely nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> The size is great but they are a little hard to open for my old fingers.  </li>
            <li> Have the pill organizer in the larger size...1 inch high.  </li>
            <li> I will also say that the boxes could be a bit deeper as some larger pills make for a tight fit.</li>
            <li> lids stay closed and secure, but aren&#x27;t super hard to open, which I like.</li>
            <li> The lids snap tight and hold in place, but they are easy enough to open.</li>
            <li> I love these this silly little things enough to write a review on them! :)</li>
            <li> I take several meds daily to include the large fish oil, multivitamin, calcium, and several smaller-sized meds...</li>
            <li> I debated which of these pill organizers to get - the one with the blue tray (this one) or the one with the clear tray.</li>
            <li> I prefer the blue tray organizer as far as size.  </li>
            <li> take several vitamins and supplements both morning and night and so far these have held everything I needed.  </li>
            <li> The picture on this one&#x27;s packaging looks the most like what I bought locally (mine is green and purple, as shown on the packaging, but the actual product pictured is red and blue).</li>
            <li> The boxes are also a bit hard to open unless you are dextrous and have strong fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know not too big, not too small, definitely sturdy, easy to transport, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this blue compartment tray set as well as the larger clear compartment tray organizer set.  </li>
            <li> Opening eight different pill bottles every morning and three different pill bottles every night was getting really old.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste precious time everyday trying to figure out what you need to</li>
            <li> the packaging was just fine, but the yellow box was cracked on one side (like the lid was forced on crooked and cracked it).  </li>
            <li> I mentioned the oddly shaped AM/PM compartments make loading them a pain, and they are too small for many supplements.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap plastic and second one was hard to remove individual days)</li>
            <li> So far this has been the only 7 day dispenser that is big enough for all my stuff.</li>
            <li> The compartment lids snap shut with enough force to not pop open on their own, but not so difficult it can&#x27;t be open one handed.</li>
            <li> They were also a bit stiff to open at first.  </li>
            <li> If you have to take quite a few large pills, however, you may want to consider another option (see image gallery).  </li>
            <li> but you can carefully pop the clear tops off, fill and then pop them back into place.</li>
            <li> For some, it may be too large for travel, but due to the size is easier to grasp to open for those experiencing weakness in the hands due to arthritis or carpal tunnel.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact you can open them up all the way without the lid falling back down and then drop in the meds without having to constantly open the lid like some of my old ones.</li>
            <li> Despite daily use there is no apparent weakening at the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; points.</li>
            <li> The pill &amp;#34;windows&amp;#34; were slightly hard to open at first</li>
            <li> , however the tray is small enough that it wouldn&#x27;t take up much room in either your purse or travel bag.  </li>
            <li> First the negative, one of the 7 boxes had a cracked lid upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> That took up too much space in my small purse.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t stay open very well to facilitate filling</li>
            <li> And at night I have one prescription that I take a whole pill one night &amp; then a half pill the other night.  </li>
            <li> Only wish I had purchased this long ago!</li>
            <li> Also, several of my cases don&#x27;t stay closed - they pop open and refuse to latch - or refuse to stay latched shut.</li>
            <li> The doors on the cells don&#x27;t open wide; when you bend them back to break them in - they threaten to break off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been having to replace them often because my new dog really likes them for a chew toy!  </li>
            <li> but they have become easier to open without getting too loose.  </li>
            <li> At one time I thought they were a little hard to open unless you got your fingers just right.</li>
            <li> They are big enough to hold what we need for each day, but small enough we can slip an individual one in a purse or bag if we are out and about.</li>
            <li> know how long it will last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The covers are hard to open maybe because it is new.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m less likely to forget, or take a double dose.</li>
            <li> We both take a Multivitamin, Reflux and various other supplements every night.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and one is twice as big as the other.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the convenience of taking the individual compartments out but the plastic flip lids are a little difficult to open and filling them is not as streamlined as I expected since the lids are stiff and have to be pulled back each time.  </li>
            <li> Been using these boxes for over a year and am pleasantly surprised the only complaint I have is the &amp;#</li>
            <li> The one thing I would suggest - when I first bought them, the lid was pretty stiff and a little difficult to open.</li>
            <li> It fits in my medicine cabinet which is a corner cabinet with limited space.  </li>
            <li> So each days box has 2 compartments, which means for 1 single day</li>
            <li> Big enough but not easy to line up and fill.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s enough for a average person carrying medication and supplements.</li>
            <li> I can put 5 large fish oil pills and a few small vits in just one side of the pack.</li>
            <li> The downfall is that after only about a month of use, the AM half of my sunday lid no longer snaps shut.  </li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t currently have a PM pill regimen, they are actually a little bigger than I need them to be, but still small and convenient enough for travel.  </li>
            <li> I have one massive multivitamin and then a few larger sized pills, plus some little ones</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li> compartments don&#x27;t stay closed...</li>
            <li> The hinges don&#x27;t seem to always stay firmly closed, but I haven&#x27;t had any spills.</li>
            <li> So be careful when you fill it, the lid does not snap shut.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Not really a travel case</li>
            <li> If I go away for a few days I only have to take a few cases with me rather than multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> when the day&#x27;s empty, flip it over</li>
            <li> I can imagine them breaking from being forced open daily.  </li>
            <li> Now I only have to drag out the bottles once a week and fill the boxes, instead of everyday.</li>
            <li> These are great and just the size/style I needed but the lids sometimes have a hard time staying down which is annoying.  </li>
            <li> 2 of the 7 items don&#x27;t stay closed after first use, which makes them useless.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed, only issue is the lids are a little hard to open</li>
            <li> small enough to put in the lunch box</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviewers who said these do not stay shut.  </li>
            <li> My son is on the autism spectrum and so we have him on some vitamins and other supplements.  </li>
            <li> However, within a week of using it, I noticed that the boxes won&#x27;t stay closed!</li>
            <li> Tried to use them on a trip to hold vitamins but the tops on half of the boxes wouldn&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
            <li> Hard to open and fill.</li>
            <li> This company makes at least 2 different sizes.  </li>
            <li> once you have taken your pills for the day, rotate the pill container so the label with the day of the week is down.  </li>
            <li> About half of my closures will not stay shut.</li>
            <li> I lost one of the day containers from the previous set I had been using for years.</li>
            <li> Oddly shaped containers that are fiddly</li>
            <li> Not very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I added an black X with masking tape to the AM.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to open and don&#x27;t want to stay open.</li>
            <li> Check the item well to insure that there are no sharp or broken edges.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that the first one I ordered was poorly packaged and arrived chipped and broken.</li>
            <li> However the boxes are not secure in the tray, they won&#x27;t stay in the tray if you turn it upside down, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It snaps shut really tight, I have no worries when I throw a pack in my purse.</li>
            <li> and they still feel tight and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However for my purposes it still works once I&#x27;ve shoved it into my purse pocket and check that its tightly secured so that the lid is pressed close.</li>
            <li> My only complaint , if I had to find one, would be that the &amp;#34;lids&amp;#34; can be a *bit* difficult to snap open and snap closed.</li>
            <li> Despite months of use, there is little to no sign of wear and tear.</li>
            <li> A little trick I learned...</li>
            <li> , some don&#x27;t like to stay closed, some are hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have regarding this product is it&#x27;s a little difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> I use these everyday..</li>
            <li> I put all my vitamins and pills and just take one of the boxes with me to work everyday..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine for a few rounds already</li>
            <li> I take quite a few vitamins each day, from calcium to B12 to iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;At 1/2 inch deep, this pill box is fairly thin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them everyday for 7 months and have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I was getting so tired of having to open 4 or 5 bottles to get my pills out.  </li>
            <li> I take quite a few meds and supplements each morning</li>
            <li> I like that all the boxes fit well in the base</li>
            <li> This is not a huge deal for me -</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the size but the size was great, was very disappointed when I went to wash it before loading it up for the first time and found one of the pill boxes to be broken :(</li>
            <li> Time will tell if the stiff plastic joints hold up.  </li>
            <li> They still close very tightly and securly, but I don&#x27;t have trouble opening them any longer.</li>
            <li> The blue box lid has a jagged cut edge on the lid making it almost impossible to open.  </li>
            <li> Snaps tight - real tight.  </li>
            <li> The boxes are packed so tightly together that they are hard to pull out.</li>
            <li> If you have a bunch of small that you want separated get the 4.</li>
            <li> It was too small for our needs,therefore I returned the items.</li>
            <li> The pill holder was difficult to open as others have also stated.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly small so will travel well.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had no troubles with them popping open at the wrong time.</li>
            <li> Did notice that my fish oil and non-powder based pills getting squishy, so definitely not appropriate for all pills.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of vitamins and supplements, and it&#x27;s hard to cram them all in here.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time remembering</li>
            <li> This way I know that I have at least a week to get them in before I run out.  </li>
            <li> I use it a lot when I know I&#x27;ll be out late or staying at someone else&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> By compartment, I mean just an am or a pm.</li>
            <li> and you can just grab the one or ones you need and leave the rest behind.</li>
            <li> Still annoying, but overall it works.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with this by just using the PM half for Sunday, but it is still annoying and not a viable solution if you need both halves or want to use these for travel.  </li>
            <li> and these are useless unless someone is with me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the quality bad.  </li>
            <li> So, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> like that these remove from the base so you can take 2 or 3 cases if you are going away for the weekend.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The box didn&#x27;t come with a lid though like the one I had prevously</li>
            <li> Wish I could find one with 4 compartments but the slots are large enough for all of my pills and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday.. They are so convenient.. I put all my vitamins and pills and just take one of the boxes with me to work everyday.. Very spacious, convenient and colorful.. The days are on the boxes so it&#x27;s just so easy to grab the day and go!!</li>
            <li> So far this has been the only 7 day dispenser that is big enough for all my stuff. I can put 5 large fish oil pills and a few small vits in just one side of the pack. And have the other side free for medications... it works perfectly. I am so thrilled I took the chance and ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some people made comment about the lid and lock. I have had no problem at all with either. It seems really sturdy and I feel it will last me quit some time. It snaps shut really tight, I have no worries when I throw a pack in my purse. The lids are plastic yes but if you don&#x27;t abuse it there should be no problem. I&#x27;ve used mine for a few rounds already and they still feel tight and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems there are many choices here on which one to get. The tray comes in different colors and you can get either a 4 compartment pack or 2. I bought the 2 compartment pack with the blue tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have large pills get the 2 compartment. If you have a bunch of small that you want separated get the 4. That would be my recommendation. I love this item and am ordering a few more for family and back up for myself. I am too worried they will stop making them.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well for me.  I can fit a large chewable calcium tablet, a couple of large pills and some small pills in each compartment.</li>
            <li> I searched and searched for the right pill box. You know not too big, not too small, definitely sturdy, easy to transport, etc. All the things you want when searching for a pill box. I came across this one and am so glad I went with it. The doors on the boxes are remarkably sturdy and easy to open, but won&#x27;t accidentally open on their own. I love that they are labeled clearly and separate. When I go out of town (which is frequent), I can just take the boxes for the days of the week I&#x27;ll be gone and leave the rest at home. Super convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sizes of the sections are great. I have one massive multivitamin and then a few larger sized pills, plus some little ones and I could basically double that and still fit. The pack fits nicely on the counter and is an easy reminder. When it comes time to refill it is quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good pill storage system, you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I&#x27;ve had mine for more than a few months and the doors to the compartments don&#x27;t feel any weaker. Definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> I take quite a few vitamins each day, from calcium to B12 to iron.  Some of the pills need to be spaced out and/or taken at particular times. This pill organizer is good but not as deep as I require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 1/2 inch deep, this pill box is fairly thin.  Placing it in a shirt pocket should not be much of a problem and it won&#x27;t take up much room in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems with the lids breaking or had difficulty with shutting or opening them when needed.  I&#x27;ve also never had a lid open while in my purse.  Because I take a good number pills, it would be quite the annoyance to have to pick them up from my purse if the lids spontaneously opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy two of these, you can fill them and have 14 days of medication/vitamins at your fingertips.  Don&#x27;t waste precious time everyday trying to figure out what you need to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve probably seen several styles of this pill box. Some boxes are 1/2 inch deep, some are an inch deep, some have four compartments and others two compartments.  This product will hold large pills if you need to take them.  If you have to take quite a few large pills, however, you may want to consider another option (see image gallery).  I have personally found the four compartment, inch deep pill box the best for my needs. I have included some photos in the product gallery that may help you make your decision.  I used the largest vitamin that I take so you can, perhaps, formulate some idea what each type will hold.  The 1 inch, four compartment pill box has been wonderful for me.  It is the same style and material as the two compartment, 1/2 inch deep box.  These boxes have simplified my life and made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.</li>
            <li> These things make it so much better then hauling all the bottles of amino acids around. In each compartment you can hold 6fish pill sized pills. So that&#x27;s 12 per container. (for those who can&#x27;t count)&lt;br /&gt;I fill them up once a week. And every morning grab one and thrown it in my pocket. So now I dnt have to carry so much stuff around.</li>
            <li> Before buying this one, I researched about a dozen different models here on Amazon. I wanted something that had capacity for sevens days, chambers for both morning and evening, enough space for larger pills like fish oil or herbal remedies, and sturdy enough to last. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now, and I have found this the perfect box for all those reasons! It&#x27;s also very handy to be able to take an individual box to work if I happen to be taking breakfast at work, or have a dinner engagement. One way that it has changed my life is in being able to prepare my pills just once a week. I have about 6 or 7 supplements I take, and its very convenient to go through all those bottles just once and have the whole week laid out. Also, I can quickly remember whether or not I&#x27;ve already taken pills at a particular time so I&#x27;m less likely to forget, or take a double dose. Overall, a great product, and I even ordered one for my mother... who in turn bought one for her husband!</li>
            <li> Great idea--poor execution. I could barely open the pill boxes--and I don&#x27;t have any hand strength or arthritis issues!</li>
            <li> Handy and perfect for me and hubby!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both take medication twice a day and the 7-day bill box organizer has really made it easy. It is easy to fill, store and each box stays shut well and you can just grab the one or ones you need and leave the rest behind. It is so easy to just slip the box in your purse, pocket, lunch and it has done wonders with making taking our meds simple and convenient. I recommend this to anyone that is on daily medication.</li>
            <li> About half of my closures will not stay shut. I took a video but it&#x27;s not letting me post it here.</li>
            <li> It was too small for our needs,therefore I returned the items.</li>
            <li> So I bought 3 of these pill boxes to fill with a variety of fish food for feeding my fish. They are great for this since they have large AM/PM compartments on separate daily containers for twice a day feeding. The separate day containers are great so there isn&#x27;t a huge week container that you have to manipulate and in my case the individual containers are better for dropping the contents into the feeding slot on the top of a huge fish tank. The lids could be sturdier but they have and will serve their purpose well and are exactly what I needed. I can have 3 weeks of food laid out for myself or someone taking care of my tank if I&#x27;m gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this blue compartment tray set as well as the larger clear compartment tray organizer set.  Since my husband and I take several meds/vitamins daily, and some are rather large, I wanted to make sure I had an organizer that can easily hold all.  Much to my surprise, these organizers are very nicely made and the lids click shut and are very secure, so you shouldn&#x27;t have any surprise openings, especially if packed for a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear tray set stated \\&quot;deep\\&quot; compartments, but they are HUGE!!!!  You have enough room to fit perhaps 5 large fish oil pills in each compartment, plus vitamins, and more.  For some, it may be too large for travel, but due to the size is easier to grasp to open for those experiencing weakness in the hands due to arthritis or carpal tunnel.  I prefer the blue tray organizer as far as size.  I take several meds daily to include the large fish oil, multivitamin, calcium, and several smaller-sized meds...and they fit very nicely in the compartments with room to spare.  When I first had the meds in the clear tray organizer set, there was enough room for 2-times MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these organizers...quality is good and size is great.  I ordered through Amazon.com and turn-around time for delivery was just as promised...around 1 week.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the construction of the containers. The compartment lids snap shut with enough force to not pop open on their own, but not so difficult it can&#x27;t be open one handed. I like the fact they&#x27;re square, so it&#x27;s easy to rotate them such that the day label isn&#x27;t visible when a day&#x27;s through (for those of us who don&#x27;t know what day of the week it is until the second or third cup of coffee). All in all, of all the pill organizers I&#x27;ve ever handled, this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stay closed so what&#x27;s the point? Tried to use them on a trip to hold vitamins but the tops on half of the boxes wouldn&#x27;t stay closed. Returned as defective.</li>
            <li> These will accommodate large pills (e.g. fish oil) as well as stay closed when the compartment is packed full with pills pressing against the lid. You can easily pack 7+ pills in each compartment as long as you take the time to lay them in there neatly. I throw a box in my purse daily and I&#x27;ve never had the lid open and spill the contents. I bought one about a year ago and just bought a second one so I can organize my supplements two weeks out.</li>
            <li> First the negative, one of the 7 boxes had a cracked lid upon arrival.  This didn&#x27;t affect it&#x27;s functioning so I didn&#x27;t bother returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take several vitamins and supplements both morning and night and so far these have held everything I needed.  I think the size is perfect since they hold a lot, but small enough to take with me to work in a labcoat pocket or a bag.  Also having them seperate rather than an all week box is great for trips, since you can just grab the ones you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them everyday for 7 months and have no complaints.  Even the one with the cracked lid has been fine.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the convenience of taking the individual compartments out but the plastic flip lids are a little difficult to open and filling them is not as streamlined as I expected since the lids are stiff and have to be pulled back each time.  Time will tell if the stiff plastic joints hold up.  I can imagine them breaking from being forced open daily.  On the bright side I haven&#x27;t forgotten a dose once since I keep this right on my counter I can&#x27;t ignore the bright colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not unhappy with these.  The size is great but they are a little hard to open for my old fingers.  I&#x27;ve had to pry them open at times.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands.  I often go away for a day or two at short notice and thought these would be great because I can just grab the days i need on my way out the door BUT i cannot get them open by myself.  I live alone and these are useless unless someone is with me.</li>
            <li> Been using these boxes for over a year and am pleasantly surprised the only complaint I have is the &amp;#34;AM/PM&amp;#34; on top has worn off. The lids remain intact and the days printed on the side also remain legible. The size is perfect for my daily needs and travels with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> At one time I thought they were a little hard to open unless you got your fingers just right. Then one slipped out of my hand, hit the wall, and went flying across the floor without spilling the pills. Very satisfied. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very cheap product.  Some lids do not shut and stay open.</li>
            <li> The boxes are nice and well made but all the lettering on was wiped away just by normal handling. so now I have boxes and no days of the week.</li>
            <li> This takes care of my needs as a pillbox. It is true to color and size. It fits multiple big pills effortless. However the boxes are not secure in the tray, they won&#x27;t stay in the tray if you turn it upside down, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me. It has A.M. and P.M.</li>
            <li> Everything but my fish oil fits in these.  I did lose one fairly soon after buying, but am still really happy with the set.  It&#x27;s easy to pop a case in my purse if I know I&#x27;ll be out when it&#x27;s time to take my pills.</li>
            <li> compartments don&#x27;t stay closed...even though its brand new.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I bought this and it did not meet my expectations.  The pill holder was difficult to open as others have also stated.  I thought it would hold more than it did.  So, I was disappointed.  The delivery was on time, so no complaints from me on that.  I will say this if you need a pill holder for bigger pills or vitamins, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Perfect way to organize,store, and carry meds.  I like it so much, I just ordered a second one for vacations, and so that I&#x27;m always a week ahead. Unless you have very many extremely large pills, this size box will do the trick.  It holds more pills than you would think. Very happy with item. The only negative I have is that the first one I ordered was poorly packaged and arrived chipped and broken. Check the item well to insure that there are no sharp or broken edges.</li>
            <li> cheaply made &amp; some boxes do not lock properly so pills fall out.</li>
            <li> small enough to put in the lunch box</li>
            <li> perfect has changed my life so simple so easy have bought this for gifts for people</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t come open by accident. They fit nicely in my purse. I wish I had gotten the one with 3 compartments. but I will use these.</li>
            <li> Underwhelmed by this purchase. The pill containers are soso. Big enough but not easy to line up and fill. I used it for a couple of weeks, then tossed it out. Regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Best pill organizer I&#x27;ve had.  Large, a full week of AM and PM with room for all my pills!</li>
            <li> These are great pill boxes. I got 4 of them and can keep the month all organized, or just take one days box of pills with me if I need to. The lids have a nice snap to them. They are well made with smooth edges. With all the different sizes this company has something for everyone- even ones with alarm reminders!. I really like the clear tops, and that they are clearly made in the USA; it&#x27;s nice to know they are made somewhere that has enforced environmental standards.</li>
            <li> After travel, it seems like the plastic on the outside of the boxes cracked. If you are just leaving these on a counter they will work perfectly, however the boxes aren&#x27;t built to withstand being thrown in your purse repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Works well!  The pill &amp;#34;windows&amp;#34; were slightly hard to open at first but they have become easier to open without getting too loose.  Quick tip: once you have taken your pills for the day, rotate the pill container so the label with the day of the week is down.  This way you know when you have taken your pills completely for the day.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Functional.  Simple.  Plastic is durable (and made in USA so I&#x27;m not wondering what&#x27;s in the plastic).  Lots of pills fit in it easily.  So far the days of the week seem like they won&#x27;t erase or scratch off, so I&#x27;m glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not raving about it because it seems like this type of product should be straightforward.  Pill boxes aren&#x27;t really something to rave about since they seem like they&#x27;d be easy to make, right?  However, this is the 3rd pill case I&#x27;ve bought (first one disintegrated bc it&#x27;s cheap plastic and second one was hard to remove individual days) so this one beats them all hands done.  So I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So convenient  for my mom I just hand her the tray for the day and she pretty much has it from there makes her life a  lil. Easier</li>
            <li> I love the idea of these, and they are indeed very useful in transporting my vitamins and pills each day. However, I must admit their one fault. It seems that one or two of the lids just will not stay sealed shut, even when there are no pills in it. I don&#x27;t know what the issue is, clearly something in how they manufactured it because it has been this way since I got it. However for my purposes it still works once I&#x27;ve shoved it into my purse pocket and check that its tightly secured so that the lid is pressed close. Still annoying, but overall it works. I will also say that the boxes could be a bit deeper as some larger pills make for a tight fit. Nontheless I&#x27;m usually able to fit between 6-8 or 9 pills per each half of the boxes depending on size.</li>
            <li> These boxes work great, as there are a week of them and each box is divided into two sections, AM and PM. We have 4 sets of them, so that daily medicine can be prepared a month at a time. They are sturdy and stay snapped shut. I do use a medium size rubber band to secure the boxes in their tray Great for travel and everyday use.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviewers who said these do not stay shut.  Would be nice if they were made like a lock n lock.  The concept is perfect....now need to go back to the drawing board.  And maybe make them a bit larger.</li>
            <li> I was getting so tired of having to open 4 or 5 bottles to get my pills out.  And at night I have one prescription that I take a whole pill one night &amp; then a half pill the other night.  And I kept forgetting which pill I had to take at night.  So this has come in handy to not only keep track of my pills but for convenience of having to open just one &#x27;container&#x27; to get my meds.  The only complaint I have regarding this product is it&#x27;s a little difficult to open.  I don&#x27;t know if it will get better after I have used it more.</li>
            <li> Have used this for 4 months now. Convenient size for several pills, nice to have AM PM separate compartments, easy to store in any place and to take just a couple of days doses if needed. One of the lids broke just after two weeks of purchase. I was able to place it back in and have continued to use it anyway, but this is an indication that the lids are fragile.</li>
            <li> Purchased one set for mom&#x27;s medications and one set for myself for vitamins.  Very convenient and makes remembering your medications/vitamins simple.  Each day has 2 compartments, so if you need to take your pills or vitamins more frequently than just twice a day, you may want to consider the other versions that have 3 or 4 slots.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought this that the size of the compartments would hold all the medicines I needed to put in them, but I put in 10 pills, all different sizes and shapes and there is room for a few more.  The openings are easy to use and yet sturdy.  I like the way you can take out one or more days for travel, however the tray is small enough that it wouldn&#x27;t take up much room in either your purse or travel bag.  I was impressed with the fast shipping as well.  Would recommend this product</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re in the middle of infertility treatment, it&#x27;s amazing how many pills you can end up taking.  Opening eight different pill bottles every morning and three different pill bottles every night was getting really old.  This organizer is actually one of the smaller ones of its kind on the market, and fits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like this organizer because I can remove one day at a time and take just that day&#x27;s pills to work with me to take later. The two separate compartments for AM/PM are nice too. The hinges don&#x27;t seem to always stay firmly closed, but I haven&#x27;t had any spills.</li>
            <li> I really like this set of pill boxes. They are big enough to hold what we need for each day, but small enough we can slip an individual one in a purse or bag if we are out and about. The one thing I would suggest - when I first bought them, the lid was pretty stiff and a little difficult to open. The more I&#x27;ve used them, the more they have losened up. They still close very tightly and securly, but I don&#x27;t have trouble opening them any longer. If you are purchasing them for someone who has reduced movement in their fingers, I&#x27;d recommend opening them and closing them and losening them up mulitple times when you first get them so they are easier to open going forward.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for storage of very large pills. The pills fit perfect, and are easy to store and use. Thank you for making life easier for a young woman.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. My husband saw that I use mine every day and asked me to get him a set. This keeps him very organized.</li>
            <li> I like how you can take one out of the case, toss it on the counter to remind you to take the medication or whether you took it or not. Also love the days of the week showing, I turn them upside down once they are done.</li>
            <li> It is a little large for me, but it is very handy. I can see immediately if I have taken my pills. And it is pretty easy to load the pills.</li>
            <li> My son is on the autism spectrum and so we have him on some vitamins and other supplements.  This case is perfect for him and for any adult who may take 5-6 larger capsules twice a day.  If you take more capsules (probiotics, fish oils, supplements) and approach 8+ twice a day, you should get the green tray which has bigger compartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that these remove from the base so you can take 2 or 3 cases if you are going away for the weekend.  Further, the lids are clear and you can easily see in to them.  Finally, they snap closed pretty securely.  They will not accidentally pop open in your bag or if you drop onto the floor.  You have to use some pressure to pop them open.  Finally finally, I like that they sit upright and have a smaller footprint on the counter.</li>
            <li> I love these - they go right in my purse and always stay closed!</li>
            <li> Very convenient for me.  (And stylish). If you are going away for a couple of days just put those days in your purse and off you go.  I am so very satisfied with everything I&#x27;ve ordered through Amazon.  So is my 8 year old Grandson Owen.  He has gotten a lot of presents.  He just mentions the name like (INFINITY). I had no idea what it was, but thanks to Amazon Owen got his Birthday wish!!!!  Also this Pill Box Organizer was made in the USA.  And it was a present for myself (love It).</li>
            <li> No longer is it a chore to remember to take my vitamins.  Having these brightly colored boxes right in my kitchen is the friendly reminder I need in the morning, then I take that day&#x27;s box with me in my purse so in the afternoon/evening I&#x27;ll be ready to take my evening vitamins.  This is so much more handy compared to the solid week pill organizers that are far less transportable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review stuff, but these little pill organizers are a great thing to have.  I now have 4 of them and while filling all 28 days is time consuming, I am ready to go on a trip, visit family for a week or just put the day&#x27;s pills in my pocket at the drop of a hat.  Daily containers stay well in the holder for a week but I usually put the week into a quart zip lock or a snap lock container when I pack in my carry on just to be sure.  I recommend these to anyone.  I got my mom a set with four daily compartments and she uses them for travel too.</li>
            <li> I lost one of the day containers from the previous set I had been using for years. This replacement set was identical.</li>
            <li> This should help my husband since the smaller ones are to tiny for his hands!</li>
            <li> I like being able to take out one day&#x27;s worth. It fits in my medicine cabinet which is a corner cabinet with limited space.  However, the lids will not close on each compartment.  So be careful when you fill it, the lid does not snap shut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these and they work just great. Excellent way of organizing your pills and supplements. I love it! I&#x27;m worried that the tops may snap off at some point, but they&#x27;ve held on great thus far. It&#x27;s possible it will seeing as it&#x27;s just plastic and all, but they&#x27;ve been fine and therefore I&#x27;m happy! Recommended for anyone looking to organize their pills!</li>
            <li> These are very convenient boxes for managing meds and supplements, especially with its AM/PM divider.</li>
            <li> I have regular meds that I have to take in the morning and evening.  I need to kep track of these and keep them in a compact form for travel.  These cases and the tray they fit in are perfect for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Works better than others, although I wish the flip-lids would open more easily.</li>
            <li> I debated which of these pill organizers to get - the one with the blue tray (this one) or the one with the clear tray. I read the reviews over and over and finally decided to get this one. I take quite a few meds and supplements each morning and I like to make them up a week at a time. In the past I&#x27;ve used the organizers that are all one piece, with some kind of flip up lid for each day. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been having to replace them often because my new dog really likes them for a chew toy!  I never even knew there were organizers that either came apart or had separate cases for each day. So far this size works well for me. I can fit everything in one side of each day&#x27;s case. Yeah! I can now make up 14 days at a time. I really like being able to grab one of the cells (?is this what you call them?) and run off to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to let you know, I have not had any problems with the lids. I like the fact you can open them up all the way without the lid falling back down and then drop in the meds without having to constantly open the lid like some of my old ones.</li>
            <li> These are great and just the size/style I needed but the lids sometimes have a hard time staying down which is annoying.  If I were to throw a pack in my purse I would definitely use a rubber band or two to secure it.</li>
            <li> Simple.  Effective, Fit in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Love these! While you do stand the chance of losing one and messing up your weekly routine: it&#x27;s a great price, so I&#x27;d just re-order.&lt;br /&gt;I have many pills to take in the am and pm. Each box has a compartment for am and pm. Each compartment fits quite a bit. I hold 8 vitamins in one compartment: 4 of which are larger sized vitamins, 4 of which are smaller. There is room for probably 2 more small ones or maybe 1 more big one. By compartment, I mean just an am or a pm. So each days box has 2 compartments, which means for 1 single day, I am putting 16 vitamins, including 8 of which are large size ones, and can fit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lids stay closed and secure, but aren&#x27;t super hard to open, which I like. They can also stay fairly propped open, so every week I line them all up, open all the lids: they stay open, and fill up for the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that each day is it&#x27;s own box. This way if I go away for a weekend say, I can just take what I need and don&#x27;t need a giant pill case.</li>
            <li> Handy little boxes. but they fall out of the larger box easily.</li>
            <li> Hard to open and fill.</li>
            <li> Excellent way to keep my numerous meds organized. A friend recommended this and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought these planning on me and the husband using them for our nightly vitamins.  We both take a Multivitamin, Reflux and various other supplements every night.  This easily holds larger multivitamin and five or so smaller (ibuprofen sized) pills.  I took the AM side and he took the PM sides.  Works perfect for 7 days of meds for the average person.</li>
            <li> Oddly shaped containers that are fiddly, some don&#x27;t like to stay closed, some are hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned the oddly shaped AM/PM compartments make loading them a pain, and they are too small for many supplements.</li>
            <li> This is solidly constructed. The lids snap tight and hold in place, but they are easy enough to open.</li>
            <li> Gift from my wife.  Has made organizing twice-daily meds really easy.  Has separate sections for morning and evening doses.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Not very easy to use. The boxes are packed so tightly together that they are hard to pull out. The plastic boxes themselves also look cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this when it came in the mail because it looked like it was exactly what I needed. It&#x27;s big enough to hold all my pills and I like how easily I can keep it organized. However, within a week of using it, I noticed that the boxes won&#x27;t stay closed! I&#x27;ve had so many pills spill in my purse. I wish this product was sturdy enough for everyday use, because I love everything else about it.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these boxes several months ago and loved it.  I decided to buy another so I don&#x27;t have to do refills weekly.  I received it today- the packaging was just fine, but the yellow box was cracked on one side (like the lid was forced on crooked and cracked it).  The blue box lid has a jagged cut edge on the lid making it almost impossible to open.  It seems like these were manufactured defective and should have went to the dollar store rather than to be sold on amazon for $11 and change.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, only issue is the lids are a little hard to open but the compartments are big enough to hold a lot of pills. It is fairly small so will travel well.</li>
            <li> Of all the pill containers/management systems I have tried over the years and there have been quite a few, this is far and away the best I have come across. I love these this silly little things enough to write a review on them! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are of simple, sturdy design. Despite months of use, there is little to no sign of wear and tear. The large, bold lettering showing the day of the week and the \\&quot;AM\\&quot; and \\&quot;PM\\&quot; on each compartment has not faded or flaked. Despite daily use there is no apparent weakening at the \\&quot;flex\\&quot; points. They are easy to open (see below) but also stay securely closed so I&#x27;ve had no troubles with them popping open at the wrong time. The compartments are just the right size for what I need as they hold those horse-sized supplements like Calcium as well as my prescription medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening Compartments, there is a trick to it - These arthritic fingers originally fumbled and the joints rebelled when trying to just get a compartment open. Fortunately the simple yet elegant comes through in their design. By pressing gently below of the lip of the compartment the lid lifts easily.</li>
            <li> Have the pill organizer in the larger size...1 inch high.  That took up too much space in my small purse. This one is much flatter yet holds 20 pills/supplements no problem. Snaps shut so no worries about container accidentally opening.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Good product. You don&#x27;t have to walk around with a big 7 day pill box in your pocket. This allows you to put the pills for the day in your pocket so you can use them through your trip. The compartments are large enough to carry the largest capsules.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I only take pills once a day so I  able to load up for the month with two packs.  Easy for traveling to.</li>
            <li> Great product; I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad. It is very sturdy yet easy to open. The size of the compartment is great and holds all sizes of pills.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is going to hold up - the boxes do not have actual hinges, just thinner plastic that I think will wear out from opening and closing.  They don&#x27;t stay open unless you bend them *way* back, further stressing the plastic.  The boxes are also a bit hard to open unless you are dextrous and have strong fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding I like the one I bought locally better - it isn&#x27;t any harder to open and seems sturdier.  I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like the lock-together compartments, but they are growing on me.  [[ASIN:B008664TFM Detach N Go Am/pm Detachable Pill Box JUMBO]] The picture on this one&#x27;s packaging looks the most like what I bought locally (mine is green and purple, as shown on the packaging, but the actual product pictured is red and blue).</li>
            <li> This is a great pill organizer. I particularly like that I can pop out a day or a weekend&#x27;s worth of pills and take them with me without having to cart the whole week&#x27;s supply around.</li>
            <li> Great pill case. Very portable.</li>
            <li> This hAS BEEN SUCH A TIME SAVER</li>
            <li> This is the best pill organizer I have found. Not really a travel case but I take a lot of pills and this one has a lot of space for both morning and night.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 sets of these so I could get my pills set up awhile in advance. They&#x27;ll do the job with a couple caveats. Each day&#x27;s box is divided into 2 equal sides, &amp;#34;AM&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;PM.&amp;#34; If you have lots of pills in the morning or the evening (or any at lunchtime) this won&#x27;t be as convenient.  Also, several of my cases don&#x27;t stay closed - they pop open and refuse to latch - or refuse to stay latched shut.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the size but the size was great, was very disappointed when I went to wash it before loading it up for the first time and found one of the pill boxes to be broken :( Had to send back.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best pill boxes I&#x27;ve ever seen! Each day pack fits very easily in a pocket, a purse, whatever you need to carry it in for the day. I take approximately 6 pills a day and can easily fit those in one side of the pill box meaning that I can use the pill box for 2 weeks worth of pills since I don&#x27;t need the AM/PM separation. I never have to move pills around to make them fit. It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this compared to the other options in pill boxes. You don&#x27;t have to take the whole pill box, but just the day you need it. Excellent idea and product!</li>
            <li> These are an excellent way to organize pills.  If I go away for a few days I only have to take a few cases with me rather than multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> Perfect cases for most of my vitamins and supplements, couldn&#x27;t have bought a better organizer. Color coordinated and with days and even two containers in 1 for am and pm. Did notice that my fish oil and non-powder based pills getting squishy, so definitely not appropriate for all pills. Doesn&#x27;t keep them fresh outside of the bottles, not the cases fault. Just something I wasn&#x27;t expecting. So for almost all of my pills I can keep them in the cases, other more sensitive pills still need to be taken out from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this concept and for the first few weeks, it was great.  It easily fits all seven of my daily pills including two large supplements.  In fact, I could get twice as many in the AM section.  Because I don&#x27;t currently have a PM pill regimen, they are actually a little bigger than I need them to be, but still small and convenient enough for travel.  The downfall is that after only about a month of use, the AM half of my sunday lid no longer snaps shut.  I have dealt with this by just using the PM half for Sunday, but it is still annoying and not a viable solution if you need both halves or want to use these for travel.  I am going to look for a more durable product, but maybe I just got a lemon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take a lot of pills, I&#x27;d say I talk about 10-12 a day. This is the perfect size organizer for me. I think there is room for more pills so maybe 15 - 18 will fit in an AM or PM section at a time.</li>
            <li> Handy way to keep up with daily meds without bulkiness!!</li>
            <li> The covers are hard to open maybe because it is new.  However, two of the components will not snap close.</li>
            <li> I use this for the vitamins and supplements I take daily. Now I only have to drag out the bottles once a week and fill the boxes, instead of everyday. Love that it has AM and PM compartments. Only wish I had purchased this long ago!</li>
            <li> I take 10 or more pills per day at three different times of the day.  I absolutely love being able to sit down and fill the boxes once per week and not have to worry about it.  Once I get them all filled for the week, I check my prescriptions and vitamins to see what I need to reorder. This way I know that I have at least a week to get them in before I run out.  It is easy to grab the box for the day and put in my purse when I am on the go.  I also like the visual at the end of the week in case I have missed taking any medications.  I can see what I missed and when so that I can be aware about any symptoms I may have experienced.  This is a fabulous product for the price and if I ever happen to lose one of the 7 boxes, I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The doors on the cells don&#x27;t open wide; when you bend them back to break them in - they threaten to break off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise - easy to handle, clear to read.</li>
            <li> I ordered this organizer along with a bunch of supplements from Amazon. And yes - I was more excited to to receive this box :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for carrying 10-15 pills (some of mine are large and the Fish Oil was over 1&amp;#34;) and there&#x27;s still space remaining. The 1st time you need nails to open the compartments, but the good thing is they shut properly. So, no chances of pills falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to get the Blue tray one. That&#x27;s enough for a average person carrying medication and supplements.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and design. However, I should have gone with the deeper model. I take a lot of vitamins and supplements, and it&#x27;s hard to cram them all in here.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for my father-in-law. He has real memory problems. This way I can take it to him daily.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for my husband. Now I can sort out this meds for two weeks at a time. Otherwise he forgets and sometimes takes the a.m. ones in the evening and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fairly sturdy and the a.m./p.m. sections are a must. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t stay open very well to facilitate filling but you can carefully pop the clear tops off, fill and then pop them back into place. I wouldn&#x27;t mind having 2 more so I could do a month at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing is if you&#x27;re going to be away from home for a few days, it&#x27;s very easy to just grab the days you need and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had these for months now and they still look new. The lettering is staying on very well. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  Holds lots.  After about a year, the AM/PM wore off.  I added an black X with masking tape to the AM.  They were also a bit stiff to open at first.  You can remove one day from the holder and the rest stay put.  Most helpful for me as I keep my stuff in a large basket and toss the sorter on top...uneven.  A little trick I learned...when the day&#x27;s empty, flip it over so it&#x27;s blank.  That helps track when you need more prescription pills.  I&#x27;m ordering another one to keep on hand in case the hinges wear out.</li>
            <li> I have medicine I need to take in the morning, but I like to take my vitamins on a full stomach at night.  This is perfect.  I easily fit 5 pills into a side, including two very large capsules.  It would be possible to fit a little more if necessary.  I fill it a week at a time, and it helps me remember if I have taken it or not.</li>
            <li> Large compartments for AM/PM pills and seperate container for each day. Nice construction on cases and seems quite sturdy. I&#x27;m very pleased with this organizer.</li>
            <li> This handy pill box holds all my daily pills, some of which are rather large.  It&#x27;s easy to fill and doesn&#x27;t fly open by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick. Very happy with the whole transaction.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY 5TH MEDICATION ORGANIZER &amp; it seems like the best one by far.  Very Happy with this choice.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a real depth to the divided holders.</li>
            <li> This organizer is sturdy and easy to open.  It has AM and PM compartments and holds any number of medications and large vitamins.  The boxes for daily use stay secure in the tray.  We are extremely satisfied with this very affordable pill box organizer and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> it works great. I ordered two of these and one is twice as big as the other. The one that doesn&#x27;t match the description is too big and bulky</li>
            <li> Does not take up a lot of room on the counter.  Snaps tight - real tight.  Made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Item is EXACTLY as pictured. I really like this idea and like this item! I have NO problems with fitting all my pills inside (which include a large-sized fish oil pill, large-sized calcium, large-sized vitamin, etc.) My only complaint , if I had to find one, would be that the &amp;#34;lids&amp;#34; can be a *bit* difficult to snap open and snap closed. This is not a huge deal for me - - But I wanted to mention it in this review in case you are a person who might have a problem with that. It sounds like they have a really good guarantee, so you could always try it and contact the company if you are having trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend after we took a trip and his old pill box spilled its contents in my purse. He has diabetes and this size works beautifully - and has room for more meds if needed. Doors stay snapped shut, no spillage. Easy to pop in his pocket when we anticipate being away all day. Easy to view contents. Have had this a year and continues to work as well today as first day.</li>
            <li> This is SUCH a great buy. I will go in a buy one of my dad and mom- I had a hard time remembering if I took my med in the morning- this stopped the all the questions. Now I know if I took them and keep on track each day! Love it</li>
            <li> Love that this is made in the USA! Easy to use and so versatile. When we go out or on vacation I drop the boxes I need into my purse or suitcase.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daily vitamins. It separates my morning and afternoon vitamins  and the compartments are huge! Great investment</li>
            <li> The compartments don&#x27;t have a big enough lip on the lids to make them as easy to open as some customers may need.</li>
            <li> I love my new pill cases they fit perfectly in my pocketbook</li>
            <li> After using the pills at night, I turn the container over so the day isn&#x27;t showing.  That makes it really easy and quick to figure out which day I&#x27;m on for the next day. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there is PLENTY of room for my pills, both in the AM and PM sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great pill organizer!</li>
            <li> Another product that is what it says that it is.  I can fit all of my pills per time of day in the slots and have room.  I can fit almost 6 multi vitamins in a slot.</li>
            <li> Difficult to open and don&#x27;t want to stay open. Preferred the 4 compartment organizers which are better.</li>
            <li> Nice size. This company makes at least 2 different sizes.  I would have liked the dimensions to be listed in the product description.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best medi pack I have ever owned. I love it. I plan to but two more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have had these for some time now and I love them.  Nice large compartments and easy to remove a day&#x27;s worth if I need to be away from home.  I bought two and only have to fill my pills every two weeks.  Helps me remember to take my vitamins and medications.</li>
            <li> An excellent idea! When we go out of town, I can just grab the boxes for the days we&#x27;ll be gone. Much better than carrying an entire week&#x27;s worth of pills. Cute, too. My wife is jealous.</li>
            <li> Great for organization and not having lots of vitamin bottles out. I actually take my vitamins now!</li>
            <li> I believe these are USA made. That put them in the plus column for me. However, I have not had them that long and a piece of the plastic that holds the top on broke off of the pink container and landed in my hand when I dumped my pills. The top still stays on so the item is not useless.</li>
            <li> Great way to carry around a day or two&#x27;s worth of pills. I use it a lot when I know I&#x27;ll be out late or staying at someone else&#x27;s house. It fits a ton of pills and my two fiber gummies easily. I take about 8 pills of various size in the morning and 5 at night and there&#x27;s room for way more.</li>
            <li> Love this pill box, I can pull out the day I am on and throw it in my purse to take with me, it is very convenient!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel &amp; daily doses, easily fits into pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> Love this little box!  I have to take boo ku of meds so this hold them in the am and pm sections</li>
            <li> Cheap! Save your pennies.</li>
            <li> Junk break off to easily</li>
            <li> I like that all the boxes fit well in the base so when you pick the set up it doesn&#x27;t just all fall apart. The individual boxes are a nice size and fit  multiple large pills in them.</li>
            <li> This pill organizer is a good size however the compartments are very hard to open I would not recommend this product for anyone without fingenails I have to use a butter knife</li>
            <li> Tis product is easy to use! Easy to open and adequate pill space. A great product for seniors with difficulties.</li>
            <li> It love this pill box I highly recommend it absolutely nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> Love the size and having 7 days worth of vitamins handy.  Unfortunately the quality bad.  2 of the 7 items don&#x27;t stay closed after first use, which makes them useless.  I would not recommend buying.</li>
            <li> One of the compartments broke the 1st time I used it.  I also have the larger size of this product and have used it for several weeks without issues...the small one is thinner and breaks more easily.</li>
