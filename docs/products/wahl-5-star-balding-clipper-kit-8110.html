    <ol>
            <li>The clippers are awesome.</li>
            <li>great buzzer.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>However, this will be a lot quicker and much more comfortable on your head.  </li>
            <li>They cut smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>these up, the money quickly breaks even quick.</li>
            <li>If you want a quick close shave, this will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Simply put one of the best and only balding clippers out.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>good price cutters and sharp.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have used a trimmer that shaves CLOSER; IT&#x27;S EASY TO HANDLE AND USE FROM FRONT TO BACK.</li>
            <li>but that was a real pain</li>
            <li>Very well built.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so sharp that it cut my head since the blade is so fine.</li>
            <li>It leaves looking like you have a light shadow of hair, similar to a day&#x27;s growth from a wet shave.  </li>
            <li>Almost forgot, I had my old set for about 6 years</li>
            <li>I tried adjusting it several times as I saw many other reveiws with the same issues.</li>
            <li>It may not sound like much, but the balding clipper gives you a much cleaner and polished look.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is sharp and precise but as long as you&#x27;re being careful you should not have no problems with your newly shaved head.</li>
            <li>Way too heavy but certainly cuts close!</li>

            <li> Way too heavy but certainly cuts close!</li>
            <li> I did purchase a mirror, as an earlier review suggested, so that I was careful not to guess and dig into the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I gave my old Wahl clippers to my son, he would use them and not clean them</li>
            <li> I have used several clippers to shave the dome, and if you want a close shave, this will almost get you as close as a wet razor.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is that its heavy, but I&#x27;m guessing its the motor inside.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten a closer shave on my head with any other buzzer.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for clippers with a slight adjustment option stay away from these</li>
            <li> I like the bald look, but don&#x27;t like to shave my head everyday.  </li>
            <li> They are so noisy you can&#x27;t believe and people were afraid to have it put near their heads.</li>
            <li> just small kine!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and the way the blade is shaped is not ideal for getting a zero cut.</li>
            <li> The handling was a disappointment</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> We are disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have used a trimmer that shaves CLOSER; IT&#x27;S EASY TO HANDLE AND USE FROM FRONT TO BACK. I did purchase a mirror, as an earlier review suggested, so that I was careful not to guess and dig into the back of my head. The trimmer is sharp and precise but as long as you&#x27;re being careful you should not have no problems with your newly shaved head.</li>
            <li> Terrible. They are so noisy you can&#x27;t believe and people were afraid to have it put near their heads. I tried adjusting it several times as I saw many other reveiws with the same issues. It could not be adjusted to a point where it reduced the noise and still functioned. I was really disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. I tried shaving my head for a while but that was a real pain These clippers provide an almost shaved feel and look. If that&#x27;s what you are looking for these clippers are for you. I gave my old Wahl clippers to my son, he would use them and not clean them so now I have mine and he has his. If you are looking for clippers with a slight adjustment option stay away from these but if want a quality close cut clipper I would recommend them. Almost forgot, I had my old set for about 6 years so Wahl makes a quality product.</li>
            <li> These clippers are SSSSSICKKK!!!!!! If you need a baldy, then these are it. The shave is so close. Only downside is that its heavy, but I&#x27;m guessing its the motor inside. No rrrreal complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snap these up, the money quickly breaks even quick.</li>
            <li> Way too heavy but certainly cuts close!</li>
            <li> The handling was a disappointment</li>
            <li> good price cutters and sharp.</li>
            <li> Finally found a clipper that&#x27;s cuts close. Use this every week. Could not be happier. Very well built.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten a closer shave on my head with any other buzzer. This thing rocks. Definitely worth it. Used it on my face as a beard trimmer and it grabbed some of the skin on my neck. Oh well, didn&#x27;t buy it for that. It does come with 2 attachments for thicker hair , 2 cleaning combs, 1 regular comb and some cleaning oil.</li>
            <li> Piece of Junk. It will land you in the emergency room within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a HEAD SLASHER, SKIN RIPPER, MURDEROUS CLIPPER.&lt;br /&gt;The engineers who designed it should be fired immediately.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. great buzzer. so sharp that it cut my head since the blade is so fine. wasn&#x27;t too bad. just small kine!!</li>
            <li> The clippers are awesome. They cut smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> The closest you will get with an electric clipper.  I like the bald look, but don&#x27;t like to shave my head everyday.  I use this every 3 days and it does the trick.  I have used several clippers to shave the dome, and if you want a close shave, this will almost get you as close as a wet razor.  However, this will be a lot quicker and much more comfortable on your head.  If you want a quick close shave, this will do the trick.  It leaves looking like you have a light shadow of hair, similar to a day&#x27;s growth from a wet shave.  If you use a regular clipper without any attachments, you look like you have 3 days growth.  It may not sound like much, but the balding clipper gives you a much cleaner and polished look.</li>
            <li> Simply put one of the best and only balding clippers out. Been using these for over 15 yrs and never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!  Will purchase again if necessary.</li>
            <li> We are disappointed with this product. I bought it for my husband and the way the blade is shaped is not ideal for getting a zero cut.</li>
