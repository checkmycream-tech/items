            <li> but if you do be very careful they will cut the skin.</li>

            <li> These blades give me a nice sharp line, when I do my edge ups. I&#x27;ll be shopping back very soon. If there is a better blade, please let me know!</li>
            <li> The deep tooth guide comb allows for blade alignment just under the guide comb end for a smooth almost razor like line, very clean. The original guide comb has such shallow teeth that alignment to get clean lines is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> Blade came before expected date just had to zero gap it i own 2 sets if the blades.......works the neckline great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber ... been cutting over 20 years ... this blade is the best I&#x27;ve used so far ... make sure to adjust it according to how sharp you prefer your blades</li>

            <li> I love it I need to order some more blades like this thank you</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Pulls skin and cut my clients. I tried to aligned the blade in so many ways and still pulled my clients skin. Stick to the original blade. Don&#x27;t waste your 20 dollars on this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I thought it would. I&#x27;m sticking withmyregular T outliner blade that was original with my clippers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for balding out. I have mines set damn near at zero. You don&#x27;t have to zero gap these blades but if you do be very careful they will cut the skin. Overall all a good product.</li>
            <li> I broke my other blade when I dropped my clippers. This blade does the job and keeps my edge ups looking nice and crisp. I use it to shave on occasion and it keeps the my face nice and clean between razor shaves.</li>
            <li> Length of teeth, and the way I like  mine adjusted. They work great.</li>
