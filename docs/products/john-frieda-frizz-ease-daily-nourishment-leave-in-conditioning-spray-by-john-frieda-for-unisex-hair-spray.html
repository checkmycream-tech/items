            <li>The fact that it smells great is just a bonus!!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with the results both</li>
            <li>My favorite, best smelling leave in conditioner spray.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say how good it is on heat protection.</li>
            <li>Smells good and does not take a lot to work.</li>
            <li>Frizz ease makes good products you can count on.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li>This product almost reduce 50-70% of the frizz of my hair, the best thing is that is very practical to use.</li>
            <li>This product is very light, smells wonderful, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This is a super product for beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>If you blow-dry or use hot irons on your hair it is the best thing you can find and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and smells nice.</li>
            <li>and I just fell in love after the very first use !!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Best way I can describe it is it smells like a hair salon, or rather like hair and soap mixed together.</li>
            <li>:)      </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>I like this spray much better than the stuff I have tried that you put on your hands and apply yourself</li>
            <li>This stuff not only de-tangles excellently</li>
            <li>I love changing my hair color</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I do not color or heat style my hair, thus my hair tends to be relatively healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more watery than I would expect in a leave-in conditioning spray.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER used a product on my hair this long, but because this one is so awesome,  I have no reason to stop!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find curly hair products suitable for very fine, curly hair, but this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>Good size bottle and you don&#x27;t need much for each use.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Style Straighten &amp; Smooth Creme 5.1 oz (145 g)]</li>
            <li>The product is so light ..</li>
            <li>love the smell and u see results right after application(</li>
            <li>It works real good for dry frizzy hair, it really helped me so I could get another perm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very watery as I said before, which makes me spray more... when I apply it on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, kind of oily hair, and this stuff is light weight, and keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, smells great, and left my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used the spray I can notice the difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, very fine hair, that easily gets oily if I use too much product.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to use the leave in conditioner since I find a lot of times leave ins</li>
            <li>It would be better if they formulated this product without parabens, especially.</li>
            <li>, the difference in my hair after just a week of using it was pretty defined.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m still on the quest for something that can actually make a difference.</li>
            <li>I use it after washing my hair and add a little more after using texturizing products to smooth my hair out.</li>
            <li>This is great for reducing the frizz that can occur after applying salt/surf sprays; Frizz-Ease won&#x27;t negate the effects of the other products but will smooth out hair ends and add a little shine all over.</li>
            <li>But it definitely works with frizz, and leaves my hair shiny, smooth, and lightweight</li>
            <li>matter how much conditioner I used in the shower, I would still shed tears trying to brush my hair.</li>
            <li>, I always seem to put to much and my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li>I was really expecting something that&#x27;s thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really kept my hair frizz up</li>
            <li>like I could probably shock myself that it rubs on my clothing so much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to people of all hair types.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and it is so much stronger since I have been using it.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair is dried, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I have anything in it.</li>
            <li>If you wash your hair everyday, you probably would be okay.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Pantene Pro-V Detangling Light Conditioning Spray, and my hair was already so heavy after using it that I couldn&#x27;t really use mousse or styling products without making my hair feel clumpy and oily when I styled it.     </li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my hair soft and tangle free but does not keep frizz down.</li>
            <li>My only problem would be I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>have noticed that I need to reapply the spray a couple of times during the day (or evening) especially when it is very humid.</li>
            <li>I put it in wet hair out of the shower and it makes it so easy to brush and to dry sleeker and straighter.</li>
            <li>I seriously cannot express how much I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for at least the last three years, once or more daily.  </li>
            <li>After reading several other reviews, I realized that this product may not be ideal for all hair types, but for those who, like me, have thick, semi-straight hair that tends to be dry and who like to rock a messy style without massive frizz, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light enough that I can use other products without weighing down my hair with extra goop.</li>
            <li>n weak , which caused me to start using the heat protection sprays I got for free with my straightener, but boy it screwed my hair up .</li>

            <li> My hair gets dry enough normally, and this long, cold, hatful winter on top of the perm is not helping at all.  </li>
            <li> I will say that I have pretty thick n straight hair but after subjecting it to the torture of blow drying and straining my hair did start getting limp</li>
            <li> Its very lightweight going on hardly feels like you have anything in your hair.</li>
            <li> at least until I use up the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I used to have issues with dry hair and split ends, but I never have a problem now.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows in thicker, it is stronger and resistant to breakage, and because I use it all the time, coloring my hair doesn&#x27;t even dry it out.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this from the drug store because my hair was dry and tangled</li>
            <li> If my hair starts to look &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; or overly dry</li>
            <li> I also use this on my hair when it is dry if it looks to dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my hair feeling kinda dry and for some reason.</li>
            <li> then it weights down your hair the 2nd day.  </li>
            <li> If someone had only slightly wavy hair they probably wouldn&#x27;t even need to straighten it after using this.</li>
            <li> no frizzing what so ever ).. and stays long enuf !!!</li>
            <li> leaves unclean feeling in hair even when using minimal amount.</li>
            <li> I use shampoo and conditioner and once I get out of the shower, I spray this on my damp hair and use a wide tooth comb to comb it through.  </li>
            <li> However, I live in a ridiculously humid climate and I needed to find a product that would help me to tame the inevitable frizz that tortures my beach waves from April through October.</li>
            <li> I used this product a several times, just a few pumps on the ends, and use a round brush to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> But if you are like me that washes my hair probably every other day...</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a house that has hard water.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to put anything in it to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at Walgreens after experiencing some serious frizz issues that I thought a daily conditioner might fix.</li>
            <li> The product I receive was not genuine.  </li>
            <li> (usually Wal-Mart, but</li>

            <li> I have shampooed at least 15 times and twice washed my hair with vinegar to try to get it out</li>
            <li> ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that does concern me is that it contains &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34;, or silicone ingredients, which a lot of hair experts say are bad for your hair over the long term.</li>
            <li> I have never had worse hair days.     </li>
            <li> just had my hair permed, and I couldn&#x27;t pick a worse time to do....</li>
            <li> Because this product is inexpensive, I don&#x27;t feel guilty about using it as needed to touch up my style.</li>
            <li> I was tired of my Sedu Heat Protection Kit !!    </li>
            <li> I hate this product.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this for at least the last three years, once or more daily.

I highly recommend this to people of all hair types.  The fact that it smells great is just a bonus!!</li>
            <li> My favorite, best smelling leave in conditioner spray. I love it. Nothing else to say. I put it in wet hair out of the shower and it makes it so easy to brush and to dry sleeker and straighter. Plus, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from the drug store because my hair was dry and tangled and I didn&#x27;t want to put anything in it to weigh it down. Well this product was the answer to my delimma. it&#x27;s light, smells great, and left my hair really soft and manageable. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at Walgreens after experiencing some serious frizz issues that I thought a daily conditioner might fix. It works well enough to replace the [[ASIN:B003F6VJWY Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Style Heat Protection and Shine Spray, 8.5-Ounce (Pack of 3)]] and [[ASIN:B003G3738A Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Style Straighten &amp; Smooth Creme 5.1 oz (145 g)]] I had been using. I was hesitant at first to use the leave in conditioner since I find a lot of times leave ins make my hair frizzy and hard to straighten but this one actually straightens it out a bit. If someone had only slightly wavy hair they probably wouldn&#x27;t even need to straighten it after using this. Its very lightweight going on hardly feels like you have anything in your hair. My only problem would be I don&#x27;t really like the smell. Best way I can describe it is it smells like a hair salon, or rather like hair and soap mixed together. Definitely not the Pantene smell Im&#x27; used to. Can&#x27;t say how good it is on heat protection. I&#x27;ve yet to see any singed pieces in my hair, but my hair still sheds a bit when I flatiron it. But it definitely works with frizz, and leaves my hair shiny, smooth, and lightweight when I flatiron it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well</li>
            <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner. Easy to use and smells nice. It&#x27;s hard to find curly hair products suitable for very fine, curly hair, but this one is perfect. I have used it after using a rinse-out conditioner and also used it after shampooing and using no regular conditioner. I&#x27;ve been happy with the results both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that does concern me is that it contains &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34;, or silicone ingredients, which a lot of hair experts say are bad for your hair over the long term. Another thing is that some of the ingredients are parabens. It would be better if they formulated this product without parabens, especially.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair soft and tangle free but does not keep frizz down. Smells good and does not take a lot to work.</li>
            <li> leaves unclean feeling in hair even when using minimal amount.</li>
            <li> Well it is for my son and he seems to be using it without question&lt;br /&gt;Well it is for my son and he seems to be using it without question</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a house that has hard water. I tried a filter, but my hair still turns into a rat&#x27;s nest in an instant. Seeing as I rent, and can&#x27;t alter the water here, I chose to use a detangler/leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how much conditioner I used in the shower, I would still shed tears trying to brush my hair. I used this (without using a conditioner in the shower) and am so happy I did! Brushing is a breeze again. I have very straight, kind of oily hair, and this stuff is light weight, and keeps my hair soft. Once my hair is dried, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I have anything in it. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this from Pathmark coz I was tired of my Sedu Heat Protection Kit !!    I will say that I have pretty thick n straight hair but after subjecting it to the torture of blow drying and straining my hair did start getting limp n weak , which caused me to start using the heat protection sprays I got for free with my straightener, but boy it screwed my hair up . I have never had worse hair days.     After reading reviews online I went in for this product and I just fell in love after the very first use !! The product is so light ..love the smell and u see results right after application( no frizzing what so ever ).. and stays long enuf !!! and doesn&#x27;t cost a mint :)      Love John Frieda !!!</li>
            <li> Good size bottle and you don&#x27;t need much for each use. Frizz ease makes good products you can count on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this frizz ease conditioning spray.  I use it every time I wash my hair.  I use shampoo and conditioner and once I get out of the shower, I spray this on my damp hair and use a wide tooth comb to comb it through.  I spray it especially on my ends and underneath my hair.  If my hair starts to look &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; or overly dry I will spray it on again and brush or comb through.  I also use this on my hair when it is dry if it looks to dry on the ends.  I like this spray much better than the stuff I have tried that you put on your hands and apply yourself, I always seem to put to much and my hair looks greasy. I love this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have long, very fine hair, that easily gets oily if I use too much product. This stuff not only de-tangles excellently, the difference in my hair after just a week of using it was pretty defined. It&#x27;s also light enough that I can use other products without weighing down my hair with extra goop. I used to use Pantene Pro-V Detangling Light Conditioning Spray, and my hair was already so heavy after using it that I couldn&#x27;t really use mousse or styling products without making my hair feel clumpy and oily when I styled it.     This product is very light, smells wonderful, and very reasonably priced. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I used this product a several times, just a few pumps on the ends, and use a round brush to dry my hair.  The brush transferred this product to all my hair and now my hair constantly looks and feels greasy.  I have shampooed at least 15 times and twice washed my hair with vinegar to try to get it out and it&#x27;s still there.  When I touch it, it leaves a sticky greasy feel on my fingers.  I am going to have to go to the salon to try to get it out.  I hate this product.  Die, John Frieda!</li>
            <li> Great for my hair !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my bathroom. A truly must-have for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Love! Works well, no build up.</li>
            <li> This is a super product for beautiful hair. If you blow-dry or use hot irons on your hair it is the best thing you can find and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love changing my hair color and I had started picking up with leave in awhile back at the drug store, but they no longer carry it there thus i buy here on amazon now. It&#x27;s just amazing i dont wash my hair without it anymore.</li>
            <li> Yeah....it&#x27;s okay. it leaves my hair feeling kinda dry and for some reason.</li>
            <li> I do not color or heat style my hair, thus my hair tends to be relatively healthy. However, I live in a ridiculously humid climate and I needed to find a product that would help me to tame the inevitable frizz that tortures my beach waves from April through October. John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz-Ease Daily Nourishment Leave-In Conditioning Spray does the trick. After reading several other reviews, I realized that this product may not be ideal for all hair types, but for those who, like me, have thick, semi-straight hair that tends to be dry and who like to rock a messy style without massive frizz, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that I need to reapply the spray a couple of times during the day (or evening) especially when it is very humid. I use it after washing my hair and add a little more after using texturizing products to smooth my hair out. This is great for reducing the frizz that can occur after applying salt/surf sprays; Frizz-Ease won&#x27;t negate the effects of the other products but will smooth out hair ends and add a little shine all over. Because this product is inexpensive, I don&#x27;t feel guilty about using it as needed to touch up my style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more watery than I would expect in a leave-in conditioning spray.  I was really expecting something that&#x27;s thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had my hair permed, and I couldn&#x27;t pick a worse time to do.... in the middle of the winter.  My hair gets dry enough normally, and this long, cold, hatful winter on top of the perm is not helping at all.  After seeking several different leave-in conditioning, I came across on this John Frieda.  I read several review on Amazon and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works! It really kept my hair frizz up like I could probably shock myself that it rubs on my clothing so much.  The very first time I used the spray I can notice the difference in my hair.  It&#x27;s softer and I didn&#x27;t feel like I might electrocute myself.  However, I do not like how it feels on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very watery as I said before, which makes me spray more... when I apply it on my hair.  It also leaves this almost sticky but not so sticky feeling on my hand afterwards.  If you wash your hair everyday, you probably would be okay.  But if you are like me that washes my hair probably every other day... then it weights down your hair the 2nd day.  And it&#x27;s almost greasy looking after the 2nd day too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would probably use it for emergency frizz ease... at least until I use up the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> This product almost reduce 50-70% of the frizz of my hair, the best thing is that is very practical to use.</li>
            <li> The product I receive was not genuine.  My wife said it was like putting sugar water in her hair.  She has purchased this item locally for years so she knows what it is supposed to feel like.  It made her hair so sticky she couldn&#x27;t even run her fingers through her hair without them getting stuck.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works real good for dry frizzy hair, it really helped me so I could get another perm. I need to get some more !!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my curly frizzy hair. It&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m still on the quest for something that can actually make a difference.</li>
