            <li>I feel it gives me more control over applying my make</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this brush for anyone looking for flawless application on a budget.</li>
            <li>Love the cheat sheet showing me what I can use each brush for.</li>
            <li>I have better control with shorter shadow bristles.</li>
            <li>You cannot find better quality or value for the price.</li>
            <li>The seller has also been emailing to check up and make sure I am satisfied.  </li>

            <li>Keep it natural and happy .</li>
            <li>They really feel good on my skin.</li>
            <li>These are the best value hands down.  </li>
            <li>The quality and softness of the bristles are superior, the thick handles are comfortable and just the right length, and the case is perfect.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft for synthetic brushes the handles are sturdy and the sizes are great for a face set.</li>
            <li>Allows makeup to be applied smoothly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone they are worth well more than I paid for them.</li>
            <li>Make up goes on smooth and</li>
            <li>The brushes are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes, they are fantastic and sooo worth the price.</li>
            <li>Lovely set of brushes, pick up the right amount of blush/foundation/shadow for my face</li>
            <li>think these are high quality brushes that do an amazing job over what I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li>Each brush has a nice heft to it and are obviously of high quality.</li>
            <li>Amazing soft bristles smooth finish</li>
            <li>Purchased these brushes a couple weeks ago, and Im loving them so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m, ahem, of a certain age and often that means my highlighter sits on top of my skin and highlights my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>This is such a good buy.</li>
            <li>I love my Malika Jafrin Professional Brush kit!!!</li>
            <li>So impressed how quick it is and how little foundation u need!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love new brushes</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more brushes by Malik&#x27;s Jafrin!</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and clean easily.</li>
            <li>They are very dense and soft, but most importantly blends make up like a piece of art on your face.</li>
            <li>Love the brush its so soft to the face</li>
            <li>Worth the money x</li>
            <li>They are so soft well made love the case they come in.</li>
            <li>So far I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>Super soft and full!</li>
            <li>I am telling you right now</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed by how soft these brushes are and love the fact that it came with details about what each brush is used for.</li>
            <li>Really soft and easy to use, but it leaves some streaks that you could see up close.</li>
            <li>And the first time I washed it, some thisles were coming off, and some are sticking out already.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes just ordered a second set!</li>
            <li>The foundation brush  smaller than most, but I like that.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never had makeup go on so clearly and smoothly onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a perfect set for traveling as it&#x27;s not too big or too small.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes and the little guideline on which brush to use for what is super helpful!</li>
            <li>These brushes apply the makeup to the face fantastically and the brushes are very soft, and full size.</li>
            <li>I love the flat foundation brush</li>
            <li>I have used the flat top kabuki brush for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>The larger brushes are fab for foundations, powders and the smaller sizes are good for concealing and contouring.</li>
            <li>the quality is as good if not better then</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>Nice kit but too soft for me, and eye shadow bristles too long for me.  </li>
            <li>The Contouring brush was a little thicker then what I would have liked</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thank you do very much!!&lt;br /&gt;Also...</li>
            <li>The price is where the real awesomeness is at.</li>
            <li>I am amazed by the quality of the brushes, and I love the wide range of shapes that came in the set.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.  </li>
            <li>Honestly expected cheap brushes but this was far from cheap.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also using and really like</li>
            <li>Dries very well.</li>
            <li>Very convenient travel case.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect such a quality product at this low price.  </li>
            <li>I am not replacing my original set but buying a 2nd set to leave at work.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel of these brushes--not only the size and weight in my hand, but also the lush and soft feel on my face.</li>
            <li>So I am new to using brushes so intensely in my makeup routine.  </li>
            <li>i support small businessess and this is such an amazing find!</li>
            <li>Better than more expensive brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>but the brush makes you look like you used high end stuff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>case is a leather-like material of high quality with a sturdy zipper.</li>
            <li>They are soft &amp; gentle on the skin, comes with a protective case to keep them from damage and the precision of these brushes are on point.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said, i&#x27;m new to the kabuki brush world.  </li>
            <li>Very professional packaging and quality brushes.</li>
            <li>Usually I can see the make up sitting on top of my skin, but this time, the make up was buffed INTO my skin.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is they have a chemical smell to them at first which needs to be aired out</li>
            <li>Extremely soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels really soft when applying it to my face</li>
            <li>The brush feels soft and luxurious on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was expecting a get-what-you-pay-for quality and I am continually floored every time I use one of the brushes (and I use at least three of them daily).</li>
            <li>So what I did was dot my foundation around my face and then buffed (quick round motions)</li>
            <li>Really good quality for less the money comparing with expensive brushes that do exactly the same work.</li>
            <li>It was only a minor thing, though, and it did come off with some gentle pulling.</li>
            <li>These synthetic bristles will last a long time and are very durable.</li>
            <li>This is my third order of these set since I do makeup on a professional level.  </li>
            <li>This morning, I did things a bit differently and WOW.  </li>
            <li>The Professional Kabuki Makeup Brush Set By Artist Malika Jafrin arrived in a standard, medium box from Amazon.</li>
            <li>No loose hairs falling out and ruining your makeup application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use all of the brushes on a daily basis, but I do generally reach for Malika Jafrin brushes for my eyeshadow, under eye concealer, highlight, and powder.</li>

            <li> Keep it natural and happy .</li>
            <li> They really feel good on my skin.</li>
            <li> These are the best value hands down.  </li>
            <li> The quality and softness of the bristles are superior, the thick handles are comfortable and just the right length, and the case is perfect.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft for synthetic brushes the handles are sturdy and the sizes are great for a face set.</li>
            <li> Allows makeup to be applied smoothly.</li>

            <li> think these are high quality brushes that do an amazing job over what I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> Each brush has a nice heft to it and are obviously of high quality.</li>
            <li> Amazing soft bristles smooth finish</li>
            <li> Purchased these brushes a couple weeks ago, and Im loving them so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m, ahem, of a certain age and often that means my highlighter sits on top of my skin and highlights my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> This is such a good buy.</li>
            <li> I love my Malika Jafrin Professional Brush kit!!!</li>
            <li> So impressed how quick it is and how little foundation u need!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love new brushes</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more brushes by Malik&#x27;s Jafrin!</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and clean easily.</li>
            <li> They are very dense and soft, but most importantly blends make up like a piece of art on your face.</li>
            <li> Love the brush its so soft to the face</li>
            <li> Worth the money x</li>
            <li> They are so soft well made love the case they come in.</li>
            <li> So far I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> Super soft and full!</li>
            <li> I am telling you right now</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by how soft these brushes are and love the fact that it came with details about what each brush is used for.</li>
            <li> Really soft and easy to use, but it leaves some streaks that you could see up close.</li>
            <li> And the first time I washed it, some thisles were coming off, and some are sticking out already.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes just ordered a second set!</li>
            <li> The foundation brush  smaller than most, but I like that.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never had makeup go on so clearly and smoothly onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a perfect set for traveling as it&#x27;s not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and the little guideline on which brush to use for what is super helpful!</li>
            <li> These brushes apply the makeup to the face fantastically and the brushes are very soft, and full size.</li>
            <li> I love the flat foundation brush</li>
            <li> I have used the flat top kabuki brush for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes are fab for foundations, powders and the smaller sizes are good for concealing and contouring.</li>
            <li> the quality is as good if not better then</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li> Nice kit but too soft for me, and eye shadow bristles too long for me.  </li>
            <li> The Contouring brush was a little thicker then what I would have liked</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thank you do very much!!&lt;br /&gt;Also...</li>
            <li> The price is where the real awesomeness is at.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by the quality of the brushes, and I love the wide range of shapes that came in the set.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.  </li>
            <li> Honestly expected cheap brushes but this was far from cheap.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also using and really like</li>
            <li> Dries very well.</li>
            <li> Very convenient travel case.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect such a quality product at this low price.  </li>
            <li> I am not replacing my original set but buying a 2nd set to leave at work.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel of these brushes--not only the size and weight in my hand, but also the lush and soft feel on my face.</li>
            <li> So I am new to using brushes so intensely in my makeup routine.  </li>
            <li> i support small businessess and this is such an amazing find!</li>
            <li> Better than more expensive brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> but the brush makes you look like you used high end stuff.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> case is a leather-like material of high quality with a sturdy zipper.</li>
            <li> They are soft &amp; gentle on the skin, comes with a protective case to keep them from damage and the precision of these brushes are on point.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said, i&#x27;m new to the kabuki brush world.  </li>
            <li> Very professional packaging and quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Usually I can see the make up sitting on top of my skin, but this time, the make up was buffed INTO my skin.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is they have a chemical smell to them at first which needs to be aired out</li>
            <li> Extremely soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels really soft when applying it to my face</li>
            <li> The brush feels soft and luxurious on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was expecting a get-what-you-pay-for quality and I am continually floored every time I use one of the brushes (and I use at least three of them daily).</li>
            <li> So what I did was dot my foundation around my face and then buffed (quick round motions)</li>
            <li> Really good quality for less the money comparing with expensive brushes that do exactly the same work.</li>
            <li> It was only a minor thing, though, and it did come off with some gentle pulling.</li>
            <li> These synthetic bristles will last a long time and are very durable.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of these set since I do makeup on a professional level.  </li>
            <li> This morning, I did things a bit differently and WOW.  </li>
            <li> The Professional Kabuki Makeup Brush Set By Artist Malika Jafrin arrived in a standard, medium box from Amazon.</li>
            <li> No loose hairs falling out and ruining your makeup application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all of the brushes on a daily basis, but I do generally reach for Malika Jafrin brushes for my eyeshadow, under eye concealer, highlight, and powder.</li>
            <li> not super high  end stuff</li>
            <li> finally figured out that the flat brush, KF02 is for BUFFING in liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li> I bought the set of brushes after searching on Amazon for a less expensive brush set, and I have been thrilled with this set.</li>
            <li> Ate first I was extremely skeptical but because of the decent price and review I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> Honestly I was shocked that they were so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The brushes are thick, high quality, picks up product well.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews</li>
            <li> The only issue that I encountered when receiving the brushes was a little bit of excess glue that was stuck to one of the brush&#x27;s bristles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on MAC, Sigma and Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I want to start this review by saying that I was not sent these brushes, as I have seen some other people say they were.</li>
            <li> There was some odor when I received the package, but I was prepared for that because of other reviews and an email that was sent to me after I made my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have given them as gifts to other makeup artist</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still figuring out the other brushes.  </li>
            <li> foreign smell, I did not  feel.</li>
            <li> After struggling for a few days, I finally got onto YouTube and saw a few folks using these brushes.  </li>
            <li> It was a gamble to go with less expensive brushes on the internet, but it really paid off.</li>
            <li> They suck all my product up and end up leaving my face very dry!!!</li>
            <li> The brush is not picking up the make up product, I have trouble using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble blending and these blend like a dream.  </li>
            <li> made no cheap materials.</li>
            <li> Its been a few weeks and there has been no shedding!</li>
            <li> I mean</li>
            <li> They are also very stiff and tug at my skin... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really hate seeing animals hurt in the process of some cosmetics :c &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> (I did have a foundation brush that I now realize is awful).  </li>

They are soft &amp; gentle on the skin, comes with a protective case to keep them from damage and the precision of these brushes are on point. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more items from your company. Thank you!</li>

The bristle are solid! This is my third order of these set since I do makeup on a professional level.  I have given them as gifts to other makeup artist</li>
            <li> They suck all my product up and end up leaving my face very dry!!! They are also very stiff and tug at my skin... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase (purchased one set over a year ago).  I am not replacing my original set but buying a 2nd set to leave at work.  Love these brushes, they are fantastic and sooo worth the price.</li>
            <li> Malika:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love the brushes. The quality and softness of the bristles are superior, the thick handles are comfortable and just the right length, and the case is perfect. So happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be well,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martha</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I was in need of a foundation brush but didn&#x27;t want to spend $$$$$ on just one. I saw these and figured why not and I&#x27;m glad I did! They are awesome brushes. The foundation brush  smaller than most, but I like that. I feel it gives me more control over applying my make up.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush for anyone looking for flawless application on a budget.</li>
            <li> Purchased these brushes a couple weeks ago, and Im loving them so far! Very soft, perfect for blending.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great value set. They&#x27;re super soft for synthetic brushes the handles are sturdy and the sizes are great for a face set. The larger brushes are fab for foundations, powders and the smaller sizes are good for concealing and contouring. Packaging is cute too! I&#x27;d recommend them. Worth the money x</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent price! Love the cheat sheet showing me what I can use each brush for. Love the feel of these brushes--not only the size and weight in my hand, but also the lush and soft feel on my face. Even the case is nice -- it has a fold over so the brushes don&#x27;t fall out or touch anything else in my bag.  I honestly didn&#x27;t expect such a quality product at this low price.  Extremely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Lovely set of brushes, pick up the right amount of blush/foundation/shadow for my face</li>
            <li> Nice kit but too soft for me, and eye shadow bristles too long for me.  I have better control with shorter shadow bristles.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good brushes. Smaller than i pictured, but i dont mind that. Picks up makeup well.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a good price!&lt;br /&gt;I had these brushes for awhile and now I decided to do a review on them.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are great quality and the assortment is great. They are very dense and soft, but most importantly blends make up like a piece of art on your face. I recommend these brush kit for beginners. The seller was so nice to send info on how to use/clean the brushes. Overall, great customer service along with amazing brushes!</li>
            <li> Im beyond happy with these brushes they have changed my makeup skills. They are so soft well made love the case they come in. I would recommend these to anyone they are worth well more than I paid for them.</li>
            <li> The Contouring brush was a little thicker then what I would have liked but the set it awesome!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and the little guideline on which brush to use for what is super helpful! Definitely recommending them!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful brushes and comes in a nice pouch. Its been a few weeks and there has been no shedding! Best of all, they&#x27;re very soft and feel great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes. Super soft. I highly recommend them. They do a great job of blending. You cannot find better quality or value for the price.</li>
            <li> So far I love these brushes.  Make up goes on smooth and no hairs fall out. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet but my fingers are crossed.  The seller has also been emailing to check up and make sure I am satisfied.  I am very impressed all around</li>
            <li> So I am new to using brushes so intensely in my makeup routine.  After struggling for a few days, I finally got onto YouTube and saw a few folks using these brushes.  This morning, I did things a bit differently and WOW.  I mean WOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally figured out that the flat brush, KF02 is for BUFFING in liquid makeup.  So what I did was dot my foundation around my face and then buffed (quick round motions) the dots into my skin.  I am telling you right now, I&#x27;ve never had makeup go on so clearly and smoothly onto my skin.  Usually I can see the make up sitting on top of my skin, but this time, the make up was buffed INTO my skin.  Beautiful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using and really like&lt;br /&gt;*KFA03 for contouring under my cheekbones and jaw.  I like the precision I get from using that brush.&lt;br /&gt;*KT04 for blending in my highlighter and my eyes and over my brows.  I&#x27;m, ahem, of a certain age and often that means my highlighter sits on top of my skin and highlights my wrinkles.  This brush, again, gets it into the skin without rubbing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still figuring out the other brushes.  As I&#x27;ve said, i&#x27;m new to the kabuki brush world.  I use the eye shadow brushes in decreasing order of size on the colors and regions of my eyes.  I can explain that more if someone would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to know how to use the KL6.  I don&#x27;t get how to use that brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are high quality brushes that do an amazing job over what I&#x27;ve had before (I did have a foundation brush that I now realize is awful).  I plan on editing this review as I learn more about the brushes!  Also happy to start a conversation on how you use these brushes, too!</li>
            <li> Make up brush set is amazing. I use neotrogena foundation  not super high  end stuff but the brush makes you look like you used high end stuff. The brushes are super soft. The case that the brushes come in is so convenient for travel and cleaniliness. The brushes  come with these Nice plastic holders to maintain the brush shape. I experienced no shedding when i washed them. Also they maintain their shape perfectly. I have used the flat top kabuki brush for liquid foundation. So impressed how quick it is and how little foundation u need!! The brushes are easy to clean. Just soap and water. Dries very well. I haven&#x27;t  used the eyeshadOw brushes but i am sure they will be just  as amazing bc the quality is as good if not better then the sigma brushes. I highly recommend these. Wonderful gift and use for your makeup collection. Malika has thought of everything.  I normally do not write reviews but bc i support small businessess and this is such an amazing find!</li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:7a08af5e92042873c4df9aa0f14ca10b]] The Professional Kabuki Makeup Brush Set By Artist Malika Jafrin arrived in a standard, medium box from Amazon. The product was cushioned with air pillows and also wrapped in plastic to protect the case from any scratches during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is a leather-like material of high quality with a sturdy zipper. It has a pouch for each brush and flip tabs to protect the brush heads. Each brush is wrapped in two pieces of plastic. One to protect the handle and another, thicker sleeve, to protect the bristles. Each brush has a nice heft to it and are obviously of high quality. The handles all have the Malika Jafrin signature name printed on them. The brush feels soft and luxurious on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge bonus: these brushes are vegan! These synthetic bristles will last a long time and are very durable. No loose hairs falling out and ruining your makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with a tri-fold, glossy pamphlet that details the best use for each brush. It also lists washing directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect set for traveling as it&#x27;s not too big or too small. The stylish wallet style case makes it a breeze to take along anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount in exchange for providing this honest review.</li>
            <li> These work great and are a good price for the set. The case is an added bonus. I would definitely recommend these brushes for both liquid and powder foundations, blushes and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Great brush set.. So worth the money. No shedding&lt;br /&gt;After washing, and while using them. Love how it picks up the product and applies it evenly on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Well made no cheap materials. I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance . Can&#x27;t wait till they have more brushes , bc I will be running to buy them.</li>
