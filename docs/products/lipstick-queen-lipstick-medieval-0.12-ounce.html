            <li>This is a beautiful &amp;#34;my lips</li>
            <li>The best thing I have had in a hybrid kind of way.</li>
            <li>Great for a cocktail party or with jeans, a versatile lip color.</li>

            <li>Great texture.  </li>

            <li>I recommend this as a nice gift.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t help loving the color and the ease of use.</li>
            <li>, you gotta treat yourself to something nice once in awhile.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on your lips.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with brown hair and blue eyes and this is the perfect MLBB color.</li>
            <li>I like the sheerness of the color because you can put on a couple more layers to make it more pronounced, or just wear one layer to look kind of flushed, but still yourself.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the item.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I always make sure to buy more before it runs out.</li>
            <li>favorite color .  </li>
            <li>The color is great and builds well if you want to darken it up, also layers nicely with other liners, glosses, and lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery...great color!</li>
            <li>It is light and smooth, not sticky or patchy at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great basic lipstick.</li>
            <li>Lipstick is light in color and does not stay on.....</li>
            <li>great sheer color...</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic and I can see how it would literally work on anyone.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I saw this lipstick in a magazine review of &#x27;great red lipsticks&#x27;</li>
            <li>A great universal red that looks good on everybody.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for the perfect lipstick since I was old enough to wear makeup</li>
            <li>I love looking like I have a natural, healthy color on my lips and for all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s buildable which is nice but very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sheer and it is better worn alone rather than on top of a primer or chapstick.</li>
            <li>Very sheer, more color, and stays on better than gloss, because it&#x27;s a lipstick.</li>
            <li>Your lips only better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so confident in the color and sheerness that I frequently reapply without even looking in a mirror.</li>
            <li>The color provides a natural red color to lips that looks great.</li>
            <li>I ordered this as an impulse along with Jean Queen which I had heard good things about and is a pretty pink color.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful rosy red color that goes on sheer and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It is creamy, pretty.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and it adds just enough color.  </li>
            <li>It looks like you just ate some red berries, I love the look and keep this in my purse with me all the time.  </li>
            <li>It actually feels more like a lip balm to me.</li>
            <li>I love that the tubes are all different colors</li>
            <li>so I know exactly which one to grab in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I love the sheer color.oo</li>
            <li>Have tried a lot of high end lipsticks and this one is right up there in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not highly pigmented, it&#x27;s more like a balm but in a lipstick manor.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The formula, as other have mentioned, feels light and more like a lip balm than anything else, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips at all.</li>
            <li>I rarely buy lipstick this expensive, but Lipstick Queen makes great layering shades, and I have three so far.</li>
            <li>High price or not</li>
            <li>Just recently received my new favorite red lipstick.</li>
            <li>but better&amp;#34; shade since the color of your lips can show through a little, making it adaptable to many skin</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the price for how often I wear it.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous sheer red gloss.  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite brands based on this lipstick alone, as I have yet to try other shades.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;medieval&amp;#34; color is much more pink than I expected.  </li>
            <li>This is the red for anyone who wants to and doesn&#x27;t think that they can pull it off.</li>
            <li>It is really soft and  moisturizing to lips.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>The price may seem a little high for US customers, but this is partly because Lipstick Queen is an Australian company, and prices are pretty high there.</li>
            <li>Building the full color takes a few passes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rosy blue-red, which works well for me since I have cool-toned skin, but I&#x27;d hazard to say that it&#x27;s a pretty universal shade, since it&#x27;s sheer enough to let the natural color of your lips show through.</li>
            <li>Such a buttery, clear red lipstick....and not sticky........</li>
            <li>looks from the pictures like it should be a solid red, but it goes on quite sheer so as to achieve a reddened, but still natural look.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I wish it lasted longer, but other than that, love it.</li>
            <li>It lightly colors your lips a rosy hue, (think tinted lip balm, not a heavy , thick lip stain), enhancing your natural lip color, subtle but very natural looking.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out.  </li>
            <li> I had been trying to track down this lipstick ever since reading a review of it in Nylon magazine several years ago.</li>
            <li> The shade is mean to mimic the color of medieval ladies&#x27; lips when they applied lemon juice to irritate them into a soft reddish pink color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> There is no better sheer lipstick out there.</li>
            <li> they have other colors and then try to tell me you don&#x27;t loves it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as dark as other lipsticks - I have to put on a couple coats to ensure that the color is noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Glides on easily.not as  dark as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I like it for days when I need a little color to my lips but not full on lipstick or gloss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked, it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Seriously when I think I have lost it</li>
            <li> and I found I didn&#x27;t need it unless I am looking for a dramatic night look.</li>
            <li> The price is expensive but it lasts for about a month</li>
            <li> I wear it a lot for both dressy and casual occasions because the color and sheerness are so versatile.</li>

            <li> Great texture.  The &amp;#34;medieval&amp;#34; color is much more pink than I expected.  It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; shade, and it&#x27;s not red either.  It goes on sheer.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick. Very sheer, more color, and stays on better than gloss, because it&#x27;s a lipstick.</li>
            <li> Never tried this brand before. So happy with this lipstick! Have tried a lot of high end lipsticks and this one is right up there in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the color and has great moisture!</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended Lipstick Queen. Can&#x27;t help loving the color and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery...great color!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but for this lipstick I needed to make an exception.  I have been searching for the perfect lipstick since I was old enough to wear makeup and I&#x27;ve finally found it.  I ordered this as an impulse along with Jean Queen which I had heard good things about and is a pretty pink color.  But Medieval is where it&#x27;s at.  Beautiful rosy red color that goes on sheer and moisturizing.  It&#x27;s buildable which is nice but very natural looking.  I have fair skin with brown hair and blue eyes and this is the perfect MLBB color.</li>
            <li> There is no better sheer lipstick out there. The color is great and builds well if you want to darken it up, also layers nicely with other liners, glosses, and lipsticks. Very moisturizing. I&#x27;m so confident in the color and sheerness that I frequently reapply without even looking in a mirror.</li>
            <li> Sheer but noticable, works with any skin tone.  Great lipstick.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out.  It&#x27;s a great basic lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful &amp;#34;my lips but better&amp;#34; lip tint that can be built up to create a darker color if preferred. The formula, as other have mentioned, feels light and more like a lip balm than anything else, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips at all. It&#x27;s a rosy blue-red, which works well for me since I have cool-toned skin, but I&#x27;d hazard to say that it&#x27;s a pretty universal shade, since it&#x27;s sheer enough to let the natural color of your lips show through. I rarely buy lipstick this expensive, but Lipstick Queen makes great layering shades, and I have three so far. I love that the tubes are all different colors so I know exactly which one to grab in my makeup bag. The only downside is that since it&#x27;s so sheer, I have to re-apply once or twice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is light in color and does not stay on.....seller was great</li>
            <li> This is the red for anyone who wants to and doesn&#x27;t think that they can pull it off. Building the full color takes a few passes and I found I didn&#x27;t need it unless I am looking for a dramatic night look. It&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;d buy a case if I ever heard it was being discontinued.</li>
            <li> Such a buttery, clear red lipstick....and not sticky........so glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> It is a great color and goes on smoothly. I would give it five stars if it lasted longer on the lips.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazingballs! It is really soft and  moisturizing to lips. The color provides a natural red color to lips that looks great. I have been wearing lipstick since the 7th grade and this is the best stuff I have ever found. It is timeless and will never go out of style. I love looking like I have a natural, healthy color on my lips and for all anybody know I am not wearing anything. The price is expensive but it lasts for about a month and I use it constantly during the day or when I am out at night (I AM A LIPSTICK ADDICT). I always make sure to buy more before it runs out. High price or not, you gotta treat yourself to something nice once in awhile. Go to ULTA, try it....they have other colors and then try to tell me you don&#x27;t loves it. Seriously when I think I have lost it I go BSC.</li>
            <li> favorite color .  wish it stayed on longer.  otherwise, perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the sheer color.oo</li>
            <li> PERFECT lipstick....great sheer color...not overdone and repeat buyer!!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it. Feels nice on your lips. A great universal red that looks good on everybody.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this purchase, but I couldn&#x27;t resist since I am always looking for a lipstick that has just the right color to make it look like you have naturally cherry lips. I&#x27;m shocked, it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  The color is fantastic and I can see how it would literally work on anyone.  Also, you can add extra layers to make the color deeper and it&#x27;s extremely smooth and silky.  I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I saw this lipstick in a magazine review of &#x27;great red lipsticks&#x27; so I was intrigued and gave it a try. It lightly colors your lips a rosy hue, (think tinted lip balm, not a heavy , thick lip stain), enhancing your natural lip color, subtle but very natural looking. It glides on smoothly and feels wonderful on. I like it for days when I need a little color to my lips but not full on lipstick or gloss. If you are looking for a a touch of color, this is it. My only complaint is I wish it lasted longer, but other than that, love it.</li>
            <li> It is not a stain and on me is a brownish rust color and does not stay on at all.  I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a $22 tinted lip gloss. &#x27;Nuff said...</li>
            <li> Great color and feels really nice on the lips.  Totally recommend.</li>
