            <li>and I have found the BEST one out there!!</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS THE BEST!</li>
            <li>Our pediatrician indicated this would be perfect for baby acne and to use it when changing her diaper.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deliveries from amazon is excellent by the way.</li>
            <li>but it works great!</li>
            <li>Baby Aquaphor is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very good and soothing cream.  </li>
            <li>Is a very good cream for babys with skin problems.</li>
            <li>The oil industry is happy to make some cash from the byproducts.     </li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>It feels great</li>
            <li>IT IS GOOD</li>
            <li>I have always taken good care of my skin and used creams and ointments when needed.</li>
            <li>good stuff</li>
            <li>Good delivered, good price.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep them (and yourself) happy.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT AND HELPED MY SONS ECZEMA BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE</li>
            <li>Then, when he started getting more diaper rashes, we started using this instead of Desitin, and it worked wonders!</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t stress how good this stuff is, and we&#x27;ll be using it even more when our son is born in July.</li>
            <li>These are two very important considerations for those of us with sensitive/irritated skin,of course.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry skin, it is great for irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>but so much more greasy .</li>
            <li>Aquaphor has so many uses and not just for my baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>There are many alternatives to cosmetics containing those harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad we followed her advice.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff... works for EVERYTHING&gt;..</li>
            <li>This is the best thing you can get for diaper rash, not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t have any smell and doesn&#x27;t leave \\&quot;white stuff\\&quot; everywhere.</li>
            <li>it is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this ointment.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this one for sure</li>
            <li>.. worth the price!!</li>
            <li>This product is the best for dry skin and it has no perfumes.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best for dry skin.</li>
            <li>They not only look good they feel good.</li>
            <li>We tried other products but this one is the best there is.</li>
            <li>If you have a child with Eczema or any other rash or even diaper rash this is GREAT to have!!</li>
            <li>worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>whole family loves this stuff, and that is amazing because none of us are \\&quot;lotion people\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The manufacturer states that it is free of fragrance and preservatives, and is therefore hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic.  </li>
            <li>After ONE night of using this stuff, my face has significantly changed.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for healing dry skin and diaper rash.</li>
            <li>My sister used it when she was on acutane, it worked great on her over dry skin and lips.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re ok with that because this product really works.     </li>
            <li>Once it is absorbed through the skin it interferes with absorption of important vitamins (A,D,E,K) and minerals.     </li>
            <li>Aquaphor might be even more reasonably priced considering its ingredients.</li>
            <li>I bought a whole jar of Aquafor and my back has been happy ever since.</li>
            <li>I had chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer, and it was at this time I experienced my first bouts of dry irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant with our 2nd child, and we will surely use Aquaphor for this baby as well!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be too thick at first, but it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>After using this and with continuous use, his skin is silky, soft and most of all...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also, of course, a useful product for baby/toddler care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though very pricey, this product is worth every cent!</li>
            <li>but this is so much better than lotion, and so much better than petroleum Jelly because it has a less greasy feel when on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve another problem with this product: it is reasonably inexpensively priced, but is, in fact, largely petrolatum and mineral oil, and they are two of the cheapest substances available.  </li>
            <li>As soon as our baby gets the first signs of diaper rash, we use this and it clears right up.  </li>
            <li>(the two most common places that we change diapers), and we keep a tube of it in the bathroom for our own skin irritations.</li>
            <li>important reason I need a rich ointment for my skin is that I find myself, pretty much on a daily basis, using disinfectant sheets on my cats&#x27; litter box; the sheets help keep the litter box bearable.  </li>
            <li>We first got introduced to this product when our first child was born premature</li>
            <li>First of all, it contains petrolatum, also known as petroleum jelly, is a byproduct of petroleum production.</li>
            <li>and we are still scraping the bottom of the first tub.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer further states that the ointment is able to absorb three times its weight in water, and is recommended by pediatricians and dermatologists.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin acaphor healing ointment 14 oz (395g) works better tan Vaseline in keeping dry skin moist for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended it to me because he has been using Accutane, which pretty much tears up your whole face and his doctor made him use this.</li>
            <li>Eucerin Aquaphor Healing Ointment comes in a fairly large, reasonably priced tub.  </li>
            <li>and this is the very stuff they use in the NICU because a premie&#x27;s skin is so fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cosmetic industry continue to use petroleum based ingredients because they are very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO PUT ON CUTS, CHAPPED LIPS, ETC.</li>
            <li>and it worked too but not as fast.  </li>
            <li>I really dreaded the outcome and what type of scaring I would have.  </li>
            <li>We tried this using a plain white cream but didn&#x27;t see great results.</li>
            <li>The only con with this product is that it is pricey, but it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>and I tryed so many other creams out there</li>
            <li>As long as we use this product every day, my daughter&#x27;s skin stays smooth.     </li>
            <li>We tried just about every lotion out there and the most any of them could claim was that they made her skin slightly less irritated.     </li>
            <li>My pediatrician gave me a free sample of this for the dry, peeling skin on my newborn&#x27;s feet and hands.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying a small tube first to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d even wake up in the middle of the night just to use my favorite shower brush as a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>As we grow older, our skin tends to become drier.</li>
            <li>Clears most minor to moderately severe rashes including diaper rashes on any infant that I have cared for.  </li>
            <li>She is a cancer survivor and had radiation done mostly on her face which left her face extremely dry.</li>
            <li>My dry and cracked heels are now soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>It softens cuticles, heels, chapped lips, even when you have that super dry patches on your face.  </li>
            <li>Then we switched to Aquaphor as our ointment and my daughters skin cleared up completely in TWO DAYS!     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his daily lotion for his whole body, and a protective barrier for his diapers!</li>
            <li>He never had a rash that bothered him again as at the first sign you put a tiny bit on the rash</li>
            <li>I recomend trying this before any other cream or ointment my wife and I tried many, most of which made his condition worse</li>
            <li>, I got online to see if there was anything else we could do to help clear up her skin.</li>
            <li>My son has a hereditary skin condition (Keratin Pilaris) on his cheeks, he&#x27;s had it since birth and is almost 3 years old now.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter has eczema, and our pediatrician recommended Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>I used Aquaphor on the bottom of my feet, slathered it on at night, and then I put on old socks to keep the Aquaphor on my feet.</li>
            <li>I have to say, when I was 28 yrs old</li>
            <li>is not quite as soft as Vaseline, which tends to get all over.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my 14 month old daughter and i have struggled since 2 months old with her excema.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a more involved procedure than simply slathering on some lotion a few times a day.</li>
            <li>: it is 41% petrolatum (popularly known as Vaseline), and is awfully thick, greasy and sticky for use in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li>I had it above my upper lip, right below my lower lip, under my eyebrows, and on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I went to the dermatologist multiple times and the moisturizers and prescription ointments made it appear moist, but once it was washed off it went right back to how it had been.</li>
            <li>IT IS LESS MESSY THAN OTHER DIAPER CREAMS, AND HAS NO ODOR (great for those with allergies or sensitivity to scents).</li>
            <li>I recommend use of this product for eczema and diaper rashes and really any type dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The biggest jar costs a little bit, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I now use Aquaphor on my feet and legs, particularly during the winter, when my skin tends to become dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>If she gets even the slightest hint of redness, we put a little on and it knocks it right out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much large corporations control what&#x27;s being used in consumer products and how limited power the FDA has in the US.</li>
            <li>Her dry, cracking skin was perfectly smooth after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my new baby&#x27;s face when he scratches himself with little nails and the red marks heal much faster.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old daughter has moderate eczema and we&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to help heal it.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a more involved procedure than simply slathering on some lotion a few times a day.</li>
            <li> : it is 41% petrolatum (popularly known as Vaseline), and is awfully thick, greasy and sticky for use in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> I had it above my upper lip, right below my lower lip, under my eyebrows, and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist multiple times and the moisturizers and prescription ointments made it appear moist, but once it was washed off it went right back to how it had been.</li>
            <li> IT IS LESS MESSY THAN OTHER DIAPER CREAMS, AND HAS NO ODOR (great for those with allergies or sensitivity to scents).</li>
            <li> I recommend use of this product for eczema and diaper rashes and really any type dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The biggest jar costs a little bit, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I now use Aquaphor on my feet and legs, particularly during the winter, when my skin tends to become dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> If she gets even the slightest hint of redness, we put a little on and it knocks it right out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much large corporations control what&#x27;s being used in consumer products and how limited power the FDA has in the US.</li>
            <li> Her dry, cracking skin was perfectly smooth after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my new baby&#x27;s face when he scratches himself with little nails and the red marks heal much faster.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter has moderate eczema and we&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to help heal it.  </li>
            <li> I large portion of tissue has to be taken which left me with a small hole in my face.</li>
            <li> It caused his cheeks to become red, dry, bumpy and cracked, this product is the only thing that has worked, and the results were almost instant.  </li>
            <li> When they become dry, red, and cracked I put aquaphor on my hands at night to relieve itching and take way the dryness.  </li>
            <li> I use the regular aquaphor for myself and it even helped with my stretchmarks and my dry skin on my tummy after my csection...</li>
            <li> I immediately washed it with water which was hard because this ointment really sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li> Her doctor and my aunt (also a doctor),told her to dab it around the dry areas of her face.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin</li>
            <li> I tend to get dry spots on my face from time to time</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s moist and no longer dry, flaky and even cracking sometimes.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me for my constantly dry, cracking hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it is still widely used in the US, petrolatum has been banned in the EU because of its carcinogenicity, and Environment Canada Domestic Substance List deemed it to be \\&quot;expected to be harmful and toxic.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> By the next day, the rash had diminished by half, and the day after that, it was gone, with only a slight bit of redness left, which disappeared by the end of that day.</li>
            <li> Our doctor had us on a limited bath/frequent lotion regiment, but her skin just wasn&#x27;t clearing up.  </li>
            <li> tried lubriderm as dr. suggested, tried aveeno, and several others with no success.  </li>
            <li> I learned that there are two schools of thought when it comes to eczema treatment: Dry Treatment and Wet Treatment.</li>
            <li> I now notice that it is less fragile.</li>
            <li> Like my husband, my son has VERY DRY skin...</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;wet treatment\\&quot; plan calls for frequent baths followed immediately by the application of a very heavy cream or ointment.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this product on other dry, irritated skin areas.  </li>
            <li> It will temporarily protect minor cuts, scrapes and burns, and chapped or cracked skin; and is useful in protecting skin from the drying effects of windy or cold weather.  </li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Apply only in small amounts.</li>
            <li> As in other reviews, I use it for all skin problems.  </li>
            <li> It works... as long as your partner doesn&#x27;t get tired of spreading it on your back before bed each night.</li>
            <li> My son was so uncomfortable and this really helped him.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we had a much happier baby after that.</li>
            <li> Keep the big tub on the changing table and the small tubes in your diaper bag!</li>
            <li> My son used to get terrible diaper rashes and our doctor told us to use this mixed with an equal part of liquid ant-acid, generic ant-acid with real Aquaphor</li>
            <li> as noted above, I had a serious skin issue while receiving chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> We got rid of his rashes this way in less than two days.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is now 2 and a half</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be used on animal bites, serious burns, or deep puncture wounds.  </li>
            <li> Much less messy than diaper cream for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just use a little of this product to treat it.  </li>
            <li> We got it out and dabbed a little on her poor red bottom.</li>
            <li> Gone in less than 24 hours!  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but like a previous reviewer stated, a little goes a long way, so it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I have had dry, broken skin on my face for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced dry skin throughout my life.</li>
            <li> Well the only cases we had were when they were sick, but we have never had diaper rash outside of an illness...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product amazed me.</li>
            <li> No more itching</li>
            <li> My wife had a small tube of Aquafor ointment which had been recommended to her by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> BUT IT JUST TAKES A SMALL AMOUNT EACH TIME, SO</li>
            <li> Instead of the usual triple antibiotic ointment, the doctor recommended Aquaphor to reduce the chance of a scar while protecting and promoting healing.  </li>
            <li> I am a senior and my skin, especially on my arms, is very thin and tears easiy.  </li>
            <li> We have been using this since my daughter was 5 weeks old and got a terrible, and I mean red, bumpy and raw case of diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Even though the doctor told me my son&#x27;s \\&quot;skin condition\\&quot; would pass I had a hard time believing them.</li>
            <li> I use this under my son&#x27;s nose when he has a cold and runny nose so that part doesn&#x27;t get red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> In fact the skin in the bottom of my feet peeled off secondary to chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> i got a tube of aquaphor and it is really thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Our son (now 2) had a bad case of cradle cap and baby acne when he was a newborn, so initially, that&#x27;s why his doctor recommended it to us.</li>
            <li> Another key ingredient, mineral oil, is produced as a byproduct of distillation of gasoline from crude oil.</li>
            <li> I wear powdered latex gloves and immediately wash my hands probably some 50-60 times in a normal shift, and with the Ohio winters that leads to a brutal assault on my hands.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and goes on almost like vaseline.</li>
            <li> Small bumps that itched like crazy in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to absorb and clogs pores.</li>
            <li> IT MAY SEEM EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no chemist, it might be difficult to combine those two substances, the word \\&quot;emulsion\\&quot; rings in my head.  </li>
            <li> She was itchy and miserable and I was starting to get frustrated.  </li>
            <li> Desperate</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This ointment contains everything that is bad for your skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> its like glue. its just like pat Tolima jelly  but so much more greasy . I was told dr oz. recommended this stuff. I cant under stand why.</li>
            <li> We first got introduced to this product when our first child was born premature and this is the very stuff they use in the NICU because a premie&#x27;s skin is so fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used it ever since.  It is great for dry skin, it is great for irritated skin.  I use this under my son&#x27;s nose when he has a cold and runny nose so that part doesn&#x27;t get red and irritated.  I use it on my new baby&#x27;s face when he scratches himself with little nails and the red marks heal much faster.  I also use it on baby&#x27;s diaper area BEFORE he gets a diaper rash to prevent it.  Much less messy than diaper cream for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole family loves this stuff, and that is amazing because none of us are \\&quot;lotion people\\&quot; but this is so much better than lotion, and so much better than petroleum Jelly because it has a less greasy feel when on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter has moderate eczema and we&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to help heal it.  Our doctor had us on a limited bath/frequent lotion regiment, but her skin just wasn&#x27;t clearing up.  She was itchy and miserable and I was starting to get frustrated.  We tried just about every lotion out there and the most any of them could claim was that they made her skin slightly less irritated.     Desperate, I got online to see if there was anything else we could do to help clear up her skin. I learned that there are two schools of thought when it comes to eczema treatment: Dry Treatment and Wet Treatment. The \\&quot;wet treatment\\&quot; plan calls for frequent baths followed immediately by the application of a very heavy cream or ointment. We tried this using a plain white cream but didn&#x27;t see great results. Then we switched to Aquaphor as our ointment and my daughters skin cleared up completely in TWO DAYS!     As long as we use this product every day, my daughter&#x27;s skin stays smooth.     The product is a bit greasy, and to lock in the water from the bath you have to put a lot on. It&#x27;s definitely a more involved procedure than simply slathering on some lotion a few times a day. It is very thick and goes on almost like vaseline. We&#x27;re ok with that because this product really works.     Just a note: this product does contain lanolin which can cause flair ups for some people. I would recommend buying a small tube first to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor has so many uses and not just for my baby&#x27;s butt. My mom recommended it to me. She is a cancer survivor and had radiation done mostly on her face which left her face extremely dry. Her doctor and my aunt (also a doctor),told her to dab it around the dry areas of her face. It has worked wonders. I also use it for my lips when they are feeling chapped especially  during winter. I also use it to soften my cuticles, and you can use it soften the heels of your feet and your elbows.My daughter has never had a diaper rash since she was born bec. of aquaphor.The biggest jar costs a little bit, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> My son has a hereditary skin condition (Keratin Pilaris) on his cheeks, he&#x27;s had it since birth and is almost 3 years old now.  It caused his cheeks to become red, dry, bumpy and cracked, this product is the only thing that has worked, and the results were almost instant.  I recomend trying this before any other cream or ointment my wife and I tried many, most of which made his condition worse, I can&#x27;t say how thankful we are for this product.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin and I&#x27;m allergic to scented products. This product is the best for dry skin and it has no perfumes. Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has eczema, and our pediatrician recommended Aquaphor.  Her dry, cracking skin was perfectly smooth after a few uses.  I wouldn&#x27;t go without it in the house anymore!</li>
            <li> Eucerin acaphor healing ointment 14 oz (395g) works better tan Vaseline in keeping dry skin moist for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> If I could give it a zero star I would. This ointment contains everything that is bad for your skin. First of all, it contains petrolatum, also known as petroleum jelly, is a byproduct of petroleum production. Although it is still widely used in the US, petrolatum has been banned in the EU because of its carcinogenicity, and Environment Canada Domestic Substance List deemed it to be \\&quot;expected to be harmful and toxic.\\&quot; Another key ingredient, mineral oil, is produced as a byproduct of distillation of gasoline from crude oil. It is difficult to absorb and clogs pores. Once it is absorbed through the skin it interferes with absorption of important vitamins (A,D,E,K) and minerals.     If they are harmful, why are they still being used and why doesn&#x27;t the FDA ban them? I can&#x27;t say enough about how much large corporations control what&#x27;s being used in consumer products and how limited power the FDA has in the US. The cosmetic industry continue to use petroleum based ingredients because they are very inexpensive. The oil industry is happy to make some cash from the byproducts.     There are many alternatives to cosmetics containing those harmful chemicals. Don&#x27;t use them on yourself, definitely not on your babies!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product amazed me. My friend recommended it to me because he has been using Accutane, which pretty much tears up your whole face and his doctor made him use this. I have had dry, broken skin on my face for over a year now. I had it above my upper lip, right below my lower lip, under my eyebrows, and on my forehead. I went to the dermatologist multiple times and the moisturizers and prescription ointments made it appear moist, but once it was washed off it went right back to how it had been. After ONE night of using this stuff, my face has significantly changed. No more itching and it HEALED my face. I can not recommend this product enough. Get it! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amaxon.com for my newborn son. It&#x27;s great for healing dry skin and diaper rash. We tried other products but this one is the best there is.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is the best! Our son (now 2) had a bad case of cradle cap and baby acne when he was a newborn, so initially, that&#x27;s why his doctor recommended it to us. Then, when he started getting more diaper rashes, we started using this instead of Desitin, and it worked wonders! Now, we use this for everything! It&#x27;s his daily lotion for his whole body, and a protective barrier for his diapers! (We keep 2 separate jars at the changing table) The only con with this product is that it is pricey, but it is definitely worth it! I&#x27;m pregnant with our 2nd child, and we will surely use Aquaphor for this baby as well!</li>
            <li> Every winter my back starts itching and I start behaving like some bear looking for the nearest tree to scratch against. I&#x27;d even wake up in the middle of the night just to use my favorite shower brush as a back scratcher. My wife had a small tube of Aquafor ointment which had been recommended to her by her dermatologist. I had her rub some on my back before I went to bed... what a relief! I bought a whole jar of Aquafor and my back has been happy ever since. It works... as long as your partner doesn&#x27;t get tired of spreading it on your back before bed each night. Be sure to keep them (and yourself) happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream!!! My sons Pediatrican told us he has Eczema ( A skin rash condition) and I tryed so many other creams out there and I have found the BEST one out there!! My son was so uncomfortable and this really helped him. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!! If you have a child with Eczema or any other rash or even diaper rash this is GREAT to have!!</li>
            <li> Our doctor recommended this and I&#x27;m glad we followed her advice.  As soon as our baby gets the first signs of diaper rash, we use this and it clears right up.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Clears most minor to moderately severe rashes including diaper rashes on any infant that I have cared for.  I have been in childcare for 7 years.  I recommend use of this product for eczema and diaper rashes and really any type dry skin.  Being in daycare I wear powdered latex gloves and immediately wash my hands probably some 50-60 times in a normal shift, and with the Ohio winters that leads to a brutal assault on my hands.  When they become dry, red, and cracked I put aquaphor on my hands at night to relieve itching and take way the dryness.  Bottom line it works!  However use caution when using this product on babies with yeast infections.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS RECOMMENDED BY  MY PEDIATRICIAN... I have used it on both of my boys with no diaper rash. Well the only cases we had were when they were sick, but we have never had diaper rash outside of an illness...THIS STUFF IS THE BEST! IT IS LESS MESSY THAN OTHER DIAPER CREAMS, AND HAS NO ODOR (great for those with allergies or sensitivity to scents). IT MAY SEEM EXPENSIVE BUT IT JUST TAKES A SMALL AMOUNT EACH TIME, SO IT  LASTS FOREVER. It is the consistency of petrolium jelly. PLUS IT IS GOOD FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO PUT ON CUTS, CHAPPED LIPS, ETC. IT IS ALL I USE AND WILL USE!</li>
            <li> As we grow older, our skin tends to become drier. I have not experienced dry skin throughout my life. I have always taken good care of my skin and used creams and ointments when needed. I had chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer, and it was at this time I experienced my first bouts of dry irritated skin. In fact the skin in the bottom of my feet peeled off secondary to chemotherapy. My inco,I gust had not seen this before, but he recommended Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor has no scent or preservatives which is a very big plus. as noted above, I had a serious skin issue while receiving chemotherapy. I used Aquaphor on the bottom of my feet, slathered it on at night, and then I put on old socks to keep the Aquaphor on my feet. Within a week of using the Aquaphor, the skin on my feet had started to feel softer and the irritated, irregular surfaces either sloughed off or softened.  I now use Aquaphor on my feet and legs, particularly during the winter, when my skin tends to become dry and irritated. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 07-16-15</li>
            <li> This healing ointment is the &amp;#34;Miracle Cure&amp;#34; for me.  My dry and cracked heels are now soft and smooth.  They not only look good they feel good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff... works for EVERYTHING&gt;.. I use the regular aquaphor for myself and it even helped with my stretchmarks and my dry skin on my tummy after my csection... it helps with cuts and scrapes too... good stuff.. worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Even though the doctor told me my son&#x27;s \\&quot;skin condition\\&quot; would pass I had a hard time believing them. Once I got my hands on the Aquaphor I noticed a huge difference. I would coat Samuel up after his oatmeal bath each night. Now that his skin is all cleared up I still use the ointment every night in his diaper area. It helps keep the moisture off his skin during the longer period.</li>
            <li> My son used to get terrible diaper rashes and our doctor told us to use this mixed with an equal part of liquid ant-acid, generic ant-acid with real Aquaphor worked just fine.  We got rid of his rashes this way in less than two days.  I did try to use just Aquaphor and it worked too but not as fast.  The Mylanta must do something, maybe cut the acid in the poo?</li>
            <li> We have been using this since my daughter was 5 weeks old and got a terrible, and I mean red, bumpy and raw case of diaper rash. None of the \\&quot;white\\&quot; creams did anything to help it. I called my sister-in-law, who is a perinatal nurse as well as a mom of 3, and she recommended this to me. I happened to have some in my cupboard that a doctor had recommended to me for a skin irritation, but had never thought to use it for diaper rash. We got it out and dabbed a little on her poor red bottom. By the next day, the rash had diminished by half, and the day after that, it was gone, with only a slight bit of redness left, which disappeared by the end of that day. Needless to say, we had a much happier baby after that. We haven&#x27;t used anything else since. It is expensive, but like a previous reviewer stated, a little goes a long way, so it lasts forever. My daughter is now 2 and a half and we are still scraping the bottom of the first tub. If she gets even the slightest hint of redness, we put a little on and it knocks it right out. DD loves it too and knows it helps. It seems like she has instant relief as soon as we put any on her. We keep one tub in the living room and one tub in her bedroom (the two most common places that we change diapers), and we keep a tube of it in the bathroom for our own skin irritations. This is the best thing you can get for diaper rash, not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t have any smell and doesn&#x27;t leave \\&quot;white stuff\\&quot; everywhere. I just can&#x27;t stress how good this stuff is, and we&#x27;ll be using it even more when our son is born in July.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on poison ivy (after usin another cream to get rid of the poison), burns , and scrapes.  It works.</li>
            <li> I have to say, when I was 28 yrs old I had eczema.  Small bumps that itched like crazy in cold weather.  My dermatologist recommended aquaphor.  5 years later i have tubes of aquaphor everywhere...in my purse, on my desk at work, by the kitchen sink, and a tub of it in the bathroom.  It softens cuticles, heels, chapped lips, even when you have that super dry patches on your face.  Its a miricle worker.  Please dont get it and think its vaseline.  Its not...it is so much better.  It works on any skin irritations such as sunburns, wind chapped skin, callused skin, etc.  You cant go wrong.  Once you use it, you&#x27;ll use it for life!</li>
            <li> Very good and soothing cream.  Would buy it again.  I would recommend it and did so to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgiann</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for dry skin. I like the texture: is not quite as soft as Vaseline, which tends to get all over.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my hands and/or feet and wear gloves and/or socks to bed.</li>
            <li> Our pediatrician indicated this would be perfect for baby acne and to use it when changing her diaper.  I use it for every changing and she has yet to get a diaper rash.  Must have!</li>
            <li> I was recently introduced to this product via my dermatologist following surgery on the left side of my face for a possible skin cancer.  I large portion of tissue has to be taken which left me with a small hole in my face. I really dreaded the outcome and what type of scaring I would have.  Instead of the usual triple antibiotic ointment, the doctor recommended Aquaphor to reduce the chance of a scar while protecting and promoting healing.  I love this stuff.  I tend to get dry spots on my face from time to time and I just use a little of this product to treat it.  My surgical wound is almost resolved and I can tell that I won&#x27;t have a scar after healing.    I have just started to use this product on other dry, irritated skin areas.  It feels great but a little goes a long way.  Apply only in small amounts.</li>
            <li> I am suffering from facial eczema and decided to put this on. About an hour after application, my wife started telling me that my face has gone red and I have flares all over the face. I immediately washed it with water which was hard because this ointment really sticks to your skin. So again I had to put steroid based ointment to reduce the flares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the third day I decided to try aquaphor again just giving it a second chance. But the same thing happened, flares and redness all over my face. Just didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deliveries from amazon is excellent by the way. Received it earlier than what they promised.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT AND HELPED MY SONS ECZEMA BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE I TRIED! BUT ITS WAY CHEAPER AT WALMART!!!!</li>
            <li> Though very pricey, this product is worth every cent! My daughters stubborn diaper rash started clearing up within what seemed like hours. I just wish i would of known about this sooner! Overlook the price, you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My pediatrician gave me a free sample of this for the dry, peeling skin on my newborn&#x27;s feet and hands.  It&#x27;s greasy so I apply it before bedtime but it works great!</li>
            <li> my 14 month old daughter and i have struggled since 2 months old with her excema.  tried lubriderm as dr. suggested, tried aveeno, and several others with no success.  one dr. prescribed steroid ointment and elidel, and being concerned with the age suggestions from the manufacturer and that it seemed to burn when i applied it to my childs face, i had to find something else.  i got a tube of aquaphor and it is really thick and moisturizing. although i still have to use a tiny amount of elidel when it flares up.</li>
            <li> As in other reviews, I use it for all skin problems.  I smear it generously on my arms and legs after shower and it appears that my skin is tighter.  I am a senior and my skin, especially on my arms, is very thin and tears easiy.  I now notice that it is less fragile.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone, with our with out babies.  My sister used it when she was on acutane, it worked great on her over dry skin and lips.  Then my son had a diaper rash that just would NOT go away.  He had it for a week and I kept putting diaper rash cream on it.  Then I tried Aquaphor.  Gone in less than 24 hours!  He never had a rash that bothered him again as at the first sign you put a tiny bit on the rash and it&#x27;s gone.  Keep the big tub on the changing table and the small tubes in your diaper bag!</li>
            <li> I love this ointment.  Like my husband, my son has VERY DRY skin...Baby Aquaphor is perfect.  I thought it would be too thick at first, but it&#x27;s perfect.  After using this and with continuous use, his skin is silky, soft and most of all...it&#x27;s moist and no longer dry, flaky and even cracking sometimes.  A definite keeper for the entire family.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Aquaphor Healing Ointment comes in a fairly large, reasonably priced tub.  The manufacturer states that it is free of fragrance and preservatives, and is therefore hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic.  These are two very important considerations for those of us with sensitive/irritated skin,of course. The manufacturer further states that the ointment is able to absorb three times its weight in water, and is recommended by pediatricians and dermatologists.  My dermatologist recommended it to me for my constantly dry, cracking hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is, of course, for external use only, and should be kept away from the eyes.  It shouldn&#x27;t be used on animal bites, serious burns, or deep puncture wounds.  It will temporarily protect minor cuts, scrapes and burns, and chapped or cracked skin; and is useful in protecting skin from the drying effects of windy or cold weather.  It&#x27;s also, of course, a useful product for baby/toddler care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important reason I need a rich ointment for my skin is that I find myself, pretty much on a daily basis, using disinfectant sheets on my cats&#x27; litter box; the sheets help keep the litter box bearable.  But they are murder on the skin, and I&#x27;ve been instructed by my dermatologist to wash hands immediately after using a sheet and apply ointment.  I did, however, have a problem with this ointment: it is 41% petrolatum (popularly known as Vaseline), and is awfully thick, greasy and sticky for use in the middle of the day.  My dermatologist did, in fact, agree with me that this ointment is too sticky for use during a working day.  I&#x27;ve another problem with this product: it is reasonably inexpensively priced, but is, in fact, largely petrolatum and mineral oil, and they are two of the cheapest substances available.  I&#x27;m no chemist, it might be difficult to combine those two substances, the word \\&quot;emulsion\\&quot; rings in my head.  But it seems to me Aquaphor might be even more reasonably priced considering its ingredients.</li>
            <li> Is a very good cream for babys with skin problems. Good delivered, good price. I recommend this one for sure</li>
