            <li>We had to fix it ourselves, and honestly I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;ll bust again.</li>
            <li>The metal and gaps on the rose</li>
            <li>It was packaged nicely to prevent damage during shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own this</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>and it was nice but broke min.</li>
            <li>Good quality, now I wish I had purchased more for Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product but the headband broke as soon as I tried it on.  </li>
            <li>Before I bought this, I looked at the reviews and saw that many people said it was good quality.</li>
            <li>maybe if I would have got it I would have liked it</li>
            <li>Looks really nice in hair and holds well.  </li>
            <li>I liked this.  </li>

            <li>Will make a nice stocking stuffer for any age.</li>
            <li>It has all of these hooks between each rose that gets caught in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I gues they are out of them and are now offering this kind.</li>
            <li>this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I ordered the rose headband and they sent me the leaf one.</li>
            <li>Nice, lightweight head band.  </li>
            <li>This is what I purchased what I received was nothin like it I received a metal rose on a hair tye</li>
            <li>For $1.42 I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to be honest.  </li>
            <li>Its really nice, but I&#x27;d prefer to have it as a headband.</li>
            <li>This is a very dainty pretty head band I purchased two one for me and one for my daughter we love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute, very elegant, the colors &amp; flowers are nice</li>

            <li>not bad quality, size is great</li>
            <li>It is very cute and looks lovely in my hair.</li>
            <li>The fact that this item was so cheap yet works and looks like it costs more makes it a great value.</li>
            <li>I loved the gold, flower design and how strong the band was</li>
            <li>The headband looks really cute,the quality is not the best but for the price is okay.</li>
            <li>the flowers get tangled in my hair very easily just by trying to take it off.</li>

            <li>great headband takes along time for them to come in but is well worth</li>
            <li>I was worried it might break before I bought it since it was cheap, but its actually really good quality.</li>
            <li>It was nice for the price, for the 3 or 4 times I was able to wear it before it broke.</li>
            <li>Headband is beautiful but broke first time it was tried on a 13 yr olds head.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be made well, looks gorgeous, and feels comfortable on.  </li>

            <li>this is beautiful and would be really pretty in your hair</li>
            <li>On the bright note, it&#x27;s cheap, so I could use it as a hair tie.  </li>

            <li>cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;the roses are very cute but the elastic is where it broke at</li>

            <li>what a great price!&lt;br /&gt;It is very dainty and looks great with casual or dressy outfits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Amazon shoppers: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love the color.</li>
            <li>I wear it across my forehead like a hippie head band :)</li>
            <li>So Make sure when you put it on pull on the elastics.  </li>
            <li>Not so cute when just holding it but put with a hair style its cute.</li>
            <li>I love this hair band .</li>
            <li>I love wearing it.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s made more for a child.</li>
            <li>and I do love the look of it.</li>
            <li>Def beats the $5+ it costs at F21. :)</li>
            <li>But I realized the band is CHEAP!</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>i love this headband.</li>
            <li>and I love the shiny, gold roses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to replace the band with bobby pins and pin into place.</li>
            <li>It does fit my toddler, though!</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is OK...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking so many pictures</li>
            <li>I bought this, and wasn&#x27;t really pleased with it</li>
            <li>Its so cute.</li>
            <li>Its really cute.</li>
            <li>For the couple bucks I paid for this, it&#x27;s really cute.</li>

            <li>I love the roses ordering some for my daughters</li>
            <li>i love how it looks</li>
            <li>I love how this headband looks, but the roses can get caught in your hair, and is a pain to take out because then your hair gets messed up...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay more than a $1 for this item.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is one of my favorite headbands since I bought it.</li>
            <li>Hold my hair back perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love it even more because it does not hurt my head like others and it is</li>
            <li>I guess for the price is ok</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t come gold, it came orange-ish gold-ish but still cute.</li>
            <li>I look forward to wearing it often to dress up my appearance on many occasions.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to take it off the band and glue it to a plastic headband with teeth to make sure it stays in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks adorable in my hair tho.</li>
            <li>It was cute, though.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s really cute.</li>
            <li>I was able to repair it.</li>
            <li>It  is more of a decorative headband.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s top be elected almost.</li>
            <li>I love this headband.</li>
            <li>, the metal is so cheap it broke before I even got it on my head!  </li>
            <li>it may work better.</li>
            <li>I love this accessory.</li>

            <li>At the price it is, I knew it would either be cheap and fall apart, or it might actually be nice.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>It looks cute though</li>
            <li>I would suggest having more of a stretch at the bottom so that it&#x27;d be easier to get through the head and be able to fix.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it once</li>
            <li>Much better quality than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Like i said i love this hairband..</li>
            <li>I was able to use it by taking the elastic off and using a ribbon instead.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>

            <li>On top of that there is no tracking the package available for this -____-</li>
            <li>it was cute verry cheap though</li>
            <li>It looks really pretty, very elegant.  </li>

            <li>When i did try to put it on, the elastic being too sturdy did&#x27;not stretch at all and broke right off the rose chain.</li>
            <li>It broke 1 time but was super easy to fix and never broke again!</li>
            <li>I just love being unique</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I ended up ordering two more after receiving my original order.</li>
            <li>The clasp that hook the flowers together come of easily and one went flying when I tried it on.  </li>
            <li>It also gets tangled in your hair really easily.  </li>
            <li>it changed color, and break easily.</li>
            <li>But it gets caught in my hair so easily and taking it out is a pain.</li>
            <li>but it can be fix easily just add a clip on it.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>One of the metal connecters broke and the rubber part doesn&#x27;t stretch easily.</li>
            <li>It came off my head really easily, and pulls out a lot of hair with it.</li>
            <li>It also gets tangled in hair really easily.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s super cute and great for those days to push your hair back, like at the beach.</li>
            <li>but it fit just fine</li>
            <li>It looked very cute on my older childs head.</li>
            <li>The headband was really pretty, but it slides off very easily.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments from the first day I wore it!</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li>It looks great with my blonde hair and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.</li>
            <li>it had been available in silver too</li>
            <li>The hair band wouldn&#x27;t fit and broke while I was trying to put it on.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and fit well.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t fit any grown-up&#x27;s head that I know of.</li>
            <li>Its free shipping</li>
            <li>Cheap piece.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get it to fit on my head.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>It is the same quality that you would get anywhere and a great value.</li>
            <li>There is no way I could fit this around my head maybe as a bracelet...</li>
            <li>Exactly fantastic,  </li>
            <li>I took this out of the envelope to see how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>I will never buy something so cheap on here again though.</li>
            <li>Its so cheap that i wont bother returning it.</li>
            <li>It is simple but a great accessory when you don&#x27;t feel getting dolled up.</li>
            <li>, It didn&#x27;t fit my head by any means.</li>
            <li>That being said, this does not even almost fit my head</li>
            <li>Product is made with elastic band making the fit comfortable for just about anybody.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>so it is not the comfortable fit</li>
            <li>But then again, for something this cheap</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing it away because it just didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>It doesnt feel cheap</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t fit my head too well</li>
            <li>Yet, keep in mind, shipping is free.</li>
            <li>LOL I for one have a bigger one than the person who may have made these.</li>
            <li>even cheap they look cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap</li>
            <li>But this headband will fit any head shape</li>
            <li>[It literally smells like cheap</li>
            <li>I decided to take a chance on it and buy it; it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s wicked cheap, but still.</li>
            <li>I really would like to meet the genius who decided to put metal closures between each rose at the front of the headband.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap for a reason, ladies.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this hair band.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look cheap either</li>
            <li>when I opened my envelope the flowers looked scratchy on the edges and cheap.</li>
            <li>She is generally very picky, and she liked it.</li>
            <li>I can fit a youth size four wheeler helmet</li>
            <li>Cheap metal, crappy quality.</li>
            <li>Great low price.</li>
            <li>and maybe it will fit one of them,</li>
            <li>Looks just as cheap as you&#x27;d expect but couldn&#x27;t even fit it over my head.</li>
            <li>they were cheaply made.</li>
            <li>this would fit.</li>
            <li>cheap and broke, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It took forever to come &amp; when I opened it, I thought it looked cheap.</li>
            <li>cheap and okay.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much and didn&#x27;t get to even wear out one time.</li>
            <li>Really cheap as well</li>
            <li>and I cannot comprehend how this would fit anybody.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a cheap thrill.</li>
            <li>I would suggest once you get it where you want it, try to secure it somehow</li>
            <li>My daughters and I enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li>Its worth the work for how cute it is.</li>
            <li>And it is comfortable, i can&#x27;t feel it poking or anything.</li>
            <li>The lady has worn it several times now and is quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I repackaged this and gave it to my 6yo niece for Christmas, and it fit her like a gem.  </li>
            <li>I realized it could look cheap</li>
            <li>but it is fabulous</li>
            <li>I love this headband far by one of the cutest I&#x27;ve bought and such a great price!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, metal finish, nice color, fits with all clothes and hair, can wear it with casual or elegant outfits.</li>
            <li>it is supposed to fit.</li>
            <li>Way too cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Affordable and comfortable elastic hairband.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap metal.  </li>
            <li>and it sits lightly on the head so it doesn&#x27;t dig in.</li>
            <li>but i think its meant for kids because it didnt fit me</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t stretch it to get over your head without snapping the cheap metal roses.</li>
            <li>And for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I love this, but because it is golden in color I fear it will turn.  </li>
            <li>This product is cheap and it looks cheap.</li>
            <li>and it looks perfect with sock buns/ messy buns.</li>
            <li>it came with a great price for what i have and it looks like it isnt breaking any time soon, i would totally do buy this again as a gift</li>
            <li>This was pretty, and a good price, but the first time I put it on it broke.</li>
            <li>for $1 something i thought it would not be good, but i was surprised.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it as much as I do, but it is a stunning piece :)</li>
            <li>Also, though it&#x27;s pretty, the flowers are very fine and my hair got tangled in them every time I tried to wear it.</li>
            <li>but so far, the product appears to be very sturdy, beautiful, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>i bought this for my preteen nieces, the fit was right and it was really cute until it started to tarnish</li>
            <li>I like it because it fits good but not tight and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>this headband is very cute and fashionable.i live the floral design and  </li>
            <li>it is cute, but it broke right when i put it on my head.</li>
            <li>I truly love it and everyone comments on it positively!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, good quality and I like that it lays flat on my head and doesn&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li>this is very nice actually bettter</li>
            <li>Turns out the headband looks very cheap, it hurts my hair when I put it on and it smells pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s beautiful and very sturdy for the very low price I paid:))</li>
            <li>Certainly not a quality gift, but good for the price!</li>
            <li>This is a cute headband, its pretty comfortable</li>
            <li>in all I am pretty satisfied for this product as it is super cute, shipped out super fast, is pretty good quality and was under $1 when I bought it.</li>
            <li>The flower part on it is metal and very sturdy, although the links that hold the flowers together brake off very easily.</li>
            <li>very  pretty easy to use</li>
            <li>Very pretty good quality n not tight!</li>
            <li>First off, this headband is so cute and can go with anything.</li>

            <li>She loves it worth the money!</li>
            <li>The elastic is perfect size for your head and does not give a headache like many more expensive headbands.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the price!</li>
            <li>IT IS ALSO GREAT FOR ALL HAIR LENGTHS,  IF YOU HAVE LONG HAIR</li>
            <li>The headband itself is awfully cute, and for the price, it is pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It took awhile to ship but was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>When I first saw the headband, I feel in love with it.</li>
            <li>I use this as a head band and also around one of my hats and it makes the hat unique.</li>
            <li>Its fancy and fun for a night out with friends!</li>
            <li>The hair band is so unique</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get it and broke while trying to put it on.</li>
            <li>This headband is lovely; however, it broke the first time I tried it on.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this would be a cute headband for me.</li>
            <li>I wear it quite often and the rubber band is still in great conditions and hasn&#x27;t stretched all out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and pretty</li>
            <li>It was totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this in my mail.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This just don&#x27;t worth your time nor your money!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>Worth the wait!</li>
            <li>However, it looks so cute that I&#x27;m willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get here because it ships from China, but for the price it&#x27;s definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li>i was excited to get this product</li>
            <li>it was pretty matched my dress I had on its cute .</li>
            <li>My granddaughter and her friends love it and looks so pretty on them.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this headband, which I still think is pretty.</li>
            <li>Rose detail was ok, but only tried twice and the band broke.</li>
            <li>although this didn&#x27;t work out for me as a headband, I&#x27;m sure that I can use the metal rose chain for something, so it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
            <li>The seller was quick with their shipment and it arrived securely.</li>
            <li>It was a great price and so far it has not broken.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap price this headband was good quality.  </li>
            <li>And super cheap.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the design is beautiful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is a Diva (in the most positive and complimentary form of the word!), who always dresses very well, so this was a lovely addition to her wardrobe.</li>
            <li>this was cute, well made, great price, but its so tight!</li>
            <li>It is defiantly a cute headband although I do not have that large of a head</li>
            <li>I got this yesterday, and it broke almost right away!</li>

            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve worn it so many times and it has held through very well.</li>
            <li>This is a really cool hair band.</li>
            <li>She thinks it is very sturdy and cute.</li>
            <li>It is really cute, but it gets stuck in my hair and really hurts to get it out.  </li>

            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Cute very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Overall good purchase.</li>
            <li>it looks good but the clips that connect each flower is an open hook which catches your hair and it hurts.</li>
            <li>Love this, it looks very delacate, but is stronger than it looks..</li>
            <li>nice and lovely hair band, my kids and i love it, the only things is the flower joint with the elastic not too good it came out after a few time wearing it</li>
            <li>It is very very well made with strong clasps between the flowers</li>
            <li>This head band was cute, but it was made to fit the head of a new born.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair accessory made of heavy metal and strong elasticity.  </li>
            <li>The headband is very pretty, and I was super excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty headband, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it, it stays on my head, and the gold tone flowers are made strong, so I</li>
            <li>It was pretty, but got tangled in hair easily.</li>
            <li>Great price free shipping not tooo tight on my head.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>it- looks good as a flat necklace as well</li>
            <li>It really is beautiful, it&#x27;s just so tight that it slid backwards and fell off when i put it on.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to buy a seemingly beautiful headband at such a low price.</li>
            <li>Love this, it&#x27;s classic and timeless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an extremely cheap investment for such a nice accessory.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is in general pretty good quality</li>
            <li>Never had hairbrand of mine break so quickly.</li>
            <li>I got lucky and didn&#x27;t injure my eyes.</li>
            <li>but I wished it would&#x27;ve changed colors so quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily I could fix it..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more stylish than a regular head band.</li>
            <li>This arrived fairly quickly - from China.  </li>
            <li>Once the seller learned about my problem they quickly refunded my money.</li>
            <li>When the package came at first I was unsure if the headband would even be in one piece(because of packaging)-  lucky for everyone it was!</li>
            <li>came faster than expected and nice for the price, wish there were more designs to choose from for this price range.</li>
            <li>Fits my head perfect and it&#x27;s beautiful...can wear it with a pretty evening gown or even with a lazy day outfit.</li>
            <li>but the metal became discolored Quickly</li>
            <li>The gold flowers are super cute and it fits nice and snug on my head without slipping off.</li>
            <li>very different headband,I&#x27;m always looking for unique head acceries, I have two daughters with long hair.was very happy to find some</li>

            <li>This is very pretty.</li>
            <li>When I got this product, it looked just like the picture which I am very pleased because sometimes sellers will send something similar to the picture.</li>
            <li>It broke the very first time I put it on.</li>

            <li>Combined Hot Lovely Metallic Sweet Lady Hollow Rose Flower Elastic Hair Band Headband - Gold (New)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super cute and not heavy at all!</li>
            <li>and also I tried it on &amp; it looks so cute and new</li>
            <li>Its cute and of good quality, but it was just too small.</li>
            <li>Definitely will purchase more!</li>
            <li>well it hasnt broke as many reviewers have mentioned, maybe they stretched out the whole thing but its nice.</li>
            <li>gives you a pretty look!</li>
            <li>The rubber band that the flowers are attached too doesnt really stretch and wouldnt be able to fit a normal persons head.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>broke on the first day!</li>
            <li>I CAN&#x60;T EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LIKE THIS HAIR BAND !!...</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;ll be able to fix it with a new stretch cord, but then, I don&#x27;t know if it will be worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I tried to be super careful not to break the chain, so it took me a good 10 mins to put it on.</li>
            <li>So I should have known better, but this was so cute, and I thought maybe since it was half elastic that it maybe just maybe would fit...</li>
            <li>Fortunately I did not spend much on it, but that is probably why it broke.  </li>
            <li>i will go over it with some clear top coat to seal the color and not get that greenish color thru&#x27; time.</li>
            <li>I wish the shipping was faster but for this price I think its worth it.</li>
            <li>So worth what you&#x27;ve paid for.</li>
            <li>It broke between a link on my 1st attempt to put it on...not even worth a dollar and had to wait over a month for it to arrive.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for  my daughter and I was surprised how much she liked it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did was because it was on a couponing site and people said they were nice.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I would say this is more for a child than an adult.</li>
            <li>I rarely see people with them</li>
            <li>It is so adorable and classy</li>
            <li>It took about 2-3 weeks to send but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>but I think this was worth buying.</li>
            <li>The headband looked really nice, and I wore it several times.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>When I wear it i get many compliments and people are surprised when I tell them I got it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>Actually looks nice and fits my head well.</li>
            <li>I already threw it away as it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li>just talked myself from reducing the rating to 1 star instead of 2, but it&#x27;s still only 1.5 honest rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s worth a 5, but not quite.  </li>
            <li>Roses are quite golden but not gaudy.</li>
            <li>in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It gets stuck in my hair all of the time though, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more for a pre-teen head than an adult&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love this band for both young and old.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not fragile or flimsy like I kind of imagined.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more the size for a young child and not an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good for young and old alike</li>
            <li>but It looks exactly like the picture it would be a great necklace too if you decided to let your hair down.</li>
            <li>broke right after I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li>This broke right away bc</li>
            <li>but I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It got 3 stars for them doing the right thing with the refund&lt;</li>
            <li>Right when I get it I try to use it</li>
            <li>it broke right away</li>
            <li>it broke right away just as i was trying it</li>
            <li>This has no elasticity and broke right away.</li>
            <li>That wasnt right</li>
            <li>This is a cute design however it was kind of small and fell apart after one use.</li>
            <li>The metallic sweet lady hollow rose flower elastic hair band was not up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really really nice to pull my hair back because its so so hot</li>
            <li>Other than that this headband is super cute!</li>
            <li>super cute if you have a tiny head and don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>Which I believe to be true as when she&#x27;s taken it off, much of her hair is STILL ATTACHED to it.</li>
            <li>This pulls your hair a bit, and it&#x27;s kind of cheesy, but from a distance it looks good and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It came right before the exact shipping date</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>Definitely well worth the $1.08 + free shipping!</li>
            <li>I was able to get a few and give as gifts, they also enjoyed.</li>
            <li>I think I only paid like $1 for this, and it&#x27;s so more than worth that.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, product is amazing, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>meant for a smaller head, I ended up attaching another elastic (about 4&amp;#34;) in order to get it to fit around my head comfortably.</li>
            <li>As much as this is a pretty headband, it doesn&#x27;t even fit, and I&#x27;m a very petite woman.  </li>
            <li>Very Pretty And Modern.</li>
            <li>Just as described at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>After correcting the size issue I like it very much.</li>
            <li>very nice only i have a big head</li>
            <li>Worth the price for certain.  </li>
            <li>however, the color when you get sweating goes off a little but still good to wear</li>
            <li>My little sister loved it.</li>
            <li>My little sister loved it</li>
            <li>anyways i totally recommend getting this its so beautiful and stays on just fine cause usually when i wear headband bands they slip off in like 5 minutes</li>
            <li>It would look good with your hair up or down!</li>
            <li>It was kind of tight on my head at first, but it quickly adjusted.</li>
            <li>Soooo pretty in my hair.</li>
            <li>its an ok hair product every time i put it on my hair it seems to go back after a while.</li>
            <li>The bank broke the first time I put it in my hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly like it said in the ad.</li>
            <li>so I was able to just clamp it back together .</li>
            <li>i think it is pretty</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li>this iten is exactly what i wanted but it took over a month to recieve it but</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I tried to place on head.</li>
            <li>i like it and it fit as expected really recomend it to people who are looking for something cute to wear</li>
            <li>This product broke on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Glad I only paid a dollar.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried to wear this, it broke.</li>
            <li>The headband is exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li>I bought this and got some compliments the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried to put it on, it broke.</li>
            <li>It would probably fit a 7  year old but that is it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very flexible and well adjust to your head if you want to wear it hippie style to!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>Thank you and hope you&#x27;ll make a lot of pretty things like this.</li>
            <li>Really pretty.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, but not durable at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks pretty cute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I tried to put it on.</li>
            <li>Just like the first one, it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so just be aware of this.</li>
            <li>The pictures shoes exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this item thinking it&#x27;d be cute and simple.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be fixed because it is sooooo cheap.</li>
            <li>This broke when I first tried to put on, I repaired it</li>
            <li>they broke first try&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li>The only problem being that it&#x27;s more of a copper color than the gold it says it is.</li>
            <li>However, the size is more geared for a childs&#x27; head, and the hooks between each of the flowers don&#x27;t close all the way, leaving them open to snag hair.</li>
            <li>it was pretty to look at</li>
            <li>This hair band fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This hair band is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It got stuck in my hair and the first day I tried to use it, it broke.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty for a kids head.</li>
            <li>Initially when I tried to put this on it broke, but I was able to fix it.  </li>
            <li>i wish i got it because it looks pretty in the picture.</li>
            <li>Pretty gold color just like in the pic.</li>
            <li>However, when you first get it, take a pair of needle nose pliers, and tighten the links between the roses.</li>
            <li>Its so pretty on, I&#x27;m getting extras for all the girly girls I know.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to only stretch out the elastic part whilst putting it on your head.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly how it looks like in the picture.</li>
            <li>looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>its just really pretty</li>
            <li>It fell apart in my hands as I was putting it on for the first time.</li>
            <li>exactly what i orderedwill order more in the future and recommend to my friends</li>
            <li>it broke when trying to put it on for the first time</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty piece.</li>
            <li>but the flowers are really pretty.</li>
            <li>s break first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not buy this unless you are willing for it to break before you even put it on your head.</li>
            <li>This headband Broke when I put it on the first time.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>but it is still pretty</li>
            <li>Glad to have found this piece for only a dollar on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Should make it stronger for big heads &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>So while I was able to momentarily stretch it onto my head, it felt like a vise and then instantly it slid</li>
            <li>Cute head band, but won&#x27;t work for big headed people like myself.</li>
            <li>I ended up breaking and injuring myself the first time putting it on.</li>
            <li>This headband is so pretty in person.  </li>
            <li>Fell apart the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>Also be careful because your hair can get caught on the rose pedals if your hair is frizzy.</li>
            <li>SO when i put it on for the first time it broke.</li>
            <li>broke the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li>It broke the first day I got it.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t the exact one I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>The flowers are almost exactly the size of a dime.</li>
            <li>I am going to try and put more metal links on it to make it larger and to fix it.</li>
            <li>Trying it on for the first time, it broke.</li>
            <li>also it broke within the first two to three days and</li>
            <li>On the plus side it is pretty.</li>
            <li>Broke on the first use.</li>
            <li>Pretty dissapointing.</li>
            <li>and this is the first headband ive ever had that doesn&#x27;t slip off my head.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>quality.the gold color its nice but does not really stretch.broke apart</li>
            <li>first time I put it on</li>
            <li>The headband is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Buyer be aware before purchasing.</li>
            <li>It comes exactly as pictured and made well.</li>
            <li>The elastic band broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>but i was able to get it back together</li>
            <li>highly reccomend!!</li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughter and the first time she put it on it broke within the hour.</li>
            <li>really is pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty although not too stretchy.</li>
            <li>The headband broke the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li>All that, plus it is pretty too.  </li>
            <li>A really pretty headband</li>
            <li>and it really dresses your hair up!</li>
            <li>This broke the first time I attempted to put it on my head.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this on, it broke.</li>
            <li>Definitely touches up any every day look :)  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but looks like it will break after the first use.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>It works with any pretty dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really cute and sturdy enough.</li>
            <li>Fits tight so it doesn&#x27;t slide out of my head, and the golden color of the (very cute) flower design, really pops out over my brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Made it a little lose but much more comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>But, what I like most is that it is very comfortable, small, and STAYS PUT!</li>
            <li>and i have a normal sized head!!</li>
            <li>Love this product so so much and would definitely purchase over and over again!!!!</li>
            <li>It stretches very well and makes a simple ponytail look cute.</li>
            <li>I bought this for one of my young adult daughter, it looks cute on her.</li>
            <li>Its cheap , cute looking but not comfortable at all .</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s very cute it broke with in the first few seconds of putting it on.</li>
            <li>This headband is very nice and looks beautiful when worn so it can be worn for everyday work, casual &amp; dress.</li>
            <li>I love it and hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I know this item was very inexpensive, but it broke on the first day.  </li>
            <li>very cute and not cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I can wear it with pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised its true to picture.</li>
            <li>lucky I fixed it</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it gets caught in your hair easily</li>
            <li>The only issue is that taking it out isn&#x27;t easy because my hair gets wrapped around the flowers.</li>
            <li>it is such an easy way to add elegance to your look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually when I buy headbands with the elastic band, it will stretch out and grow too large for my head.</li>
            <li>Guess I didn&#x27;t pull it on in a certain way.</li>
            <li>Never been told I have large head.</li>
            <li>IT IS CERTAINLY AN EYE CATCHER IN A CROWD.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to fix it, but the quality certainly isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have a large head.</li>
            <li>The head band is very cute and not too tight!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, but just doesn&#x27;t work as a headband if you are an adult.</li>
            <li>Looks &amp; fits great.&lt;br /&gt;Actually bought a few more as gifts !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty and makes any crazy hair fair look better.</li>
            <li>Attractive flowers with black elastic at back of neck.  </li>
            <li>i think it looks nice but is too tight it hurts</li>
            <li>Kind of tight around the head.</li>
            <li>The material is very cheap and the hooks that keeps the metal pieces together are very loose.</li>
            <li>This headpiece is nice in colour and shape, although it&#x27;s a bit small (don&#x27;t buy it if you have a very large head).</li>
            <li>This, as with many other people, broke when my wife first put it on.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S GREAT, fits a lil tight on my teen</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be nice to dress it up a little bit.</li>
            <li>Is not made large enough to fit over my 8 yr olds head.</li>
            <li>, I love it, very delicate and elegant.</li>
            <li>I actually didnt expect much because it was so cheap, but i was surprised at the quality and how pretty it was!</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I really like the headband</li>
            <li>This is very beautiful,but that is metal，When</li>
            <li>and it really stands out.  </li>
            <li>I love how this hair band stays in place all day without slipping out.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thank You for this high quality product!</li>
            <li>doesnt even fit its too big!!!</li>
            <li>It is a lot better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, arrived before estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>very cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it smells like a whole bunch of coins or something.</li>
            <li>Also hair get caught a bit, but if you have straight hair (like I do)</li>
            <li>I dont use it very often.</li>
            <li>Not put together very well, probably cheep materials.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to wear this hair band.</li>
            <li>MUch As Before</li>
            <li>It fits very well.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this headband so much.</li>
            <li>I really do suggest this.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really stretch</li>
            <li>I put a piece of fabric behind it and now it works great.</li>
            <li>but it did manage to fit around my big head</li>
            <li>I realize the item was very inexpensive, I guess you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really upsetting.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t losing much money to try</li>
            <li>while pulling it you have to be gentle.</li>
            <li>I made sure when I wear it that I carefully put it over my head and wore a style that the flowers won&#x27;t get caught in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind too much since I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it</li>
            <li>It really did meet my expectations</li>
            <li>It was very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Worn it a couple of times and has not broken..</li>
            <li>but I really like it for decoration</li>
            <li>I am a very petite woman, 5&#x27;2 and 105 pounds</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the elastic was the only thing that broke.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have to agree with her, its really adorable.&lt;br /&gt;plus</li>
            <li>the quality of the metal is very inferior.</li>
            <li>Much nicer in person.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think the size would matter much.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really stretch at all.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it would break unless someone was really trying to.</li>
            <li>yes, it arrived fast, yes</li>
            <li>And the metallic flowers looked very high-end.</li>
            <li>it is very beautiful，but</li>
            <li>u can almost wear it with anything..fits very well..</li>
            <li>The metal can tend to pull your hair so just be gentle when you take it off</li>
            <li>I didnt pay much and</li>
            <li>Stays in place really well.</li>
            <li>My big problem is the smell of metal from the roses, almost like a cheap metal smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about the hair band is really sucky</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>and this is very complimenting with my hair color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping came fast I guess, didn&#x27;t forget it about it during the time</li>
            <li>It looks like the metal would really snag your hair.</li>
            <li>You really get a quality product for a cheep price.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt feel very durable</li>
            <li>but this one doesn&#x27;t require me to place multiple bobbie pins around it to secure it.</li>
            <li>I like this so much.</li>
            <li>Cant really say anything about the quality of the headband because mine was never derived.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t ruin the whole hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair band</li>
            <li>it felt like it was gonna break any minute , but it feels very sturdy</li>
            <li>Really...  </li>
            <li>This is so well made and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The hair band was better than expected, after I bought it</li>
            <li>IF you expected better quality, it&#x27;s your fault.</li>
            <li>it will not stay on my head very well</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Quality item, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves this product, I get compliments on it all the time, everyone wants one.</li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>Much nicer made.</li>
            <li>Shipping isn&#x27;t fast, but it also was not unreasonable.</li>
            <li>It goes very well in her darker brown hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really affordable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than I expected to get.</li>
            <li>This is really cheap looking metalic hair band and slip all the time.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s wasting money totally.</li>
            <li>It fits very well</li>
            <li>I got this for a friend of mine as a really late birthday gift &amp; she loved it.</li>
            <li>and I can not imagine it fitting on even a smaller headed adult.</li>
            <li>So far it has not changed colors and looks cute with a bun or just simply alone.</li>
            <li>It looks really nice with a messy bun or updo.</li>
            <li>It was a pretty easy fix as I just had to rehook everything and clamp the ring closed again, so</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s plastic, it actually looks very nice and not cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>this headband is very strong but not too tight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, however, I think it would work better on a child, its way too small for me to use.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly the way the picture looks, it adds a different look to any hair style, its very pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, a bit tight like most hair bands.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made (which that is what you get for cheap products sometimes) and very tight on the head.</li>
            <li>i love this and wish that there were other designs or colors.</li>
            <li>other than that, love it.</li>
            <li>Wore this the other day to give my ponytail an interesting twist.</li>
            <li>I wore this the other day and got sooo many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I have a normal sized head!</li>
            <li>Only positive was I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>It however is the size to fit a small child, and will not even fit around my head.</li>
            <li>I would suggest for older users that will not handle it too much.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t fit any normal human beings head.</li>
            <li>Too small to fit an adults head and too flimsy to fit a childs head.</li>
            <li>does many e seem like it would break if stretched too far.</li>
            <li>I have long, dark, curly hair and though it looks amazing it hurts coming out!</li>
            <li>but hey, it was cute for a few wears and cheap enough for me not to complain much</li>
            <li>And considering it shipped from outside the country(Hong Kong), shipping was super fast - 5 days if I&#x27;m not mistaken.</li>
            <li>It felt secure even after I wore it all day long.</li>
            <li>Nice stocking stuffer or small gift.</li>
            <li>surprised how pretty it looks in person.</li>
            <li>But not worth more than a $1</li>
            <li>Cute, but not worth buying.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time my 15 year old put it on.</li>
            <li>, I was surprised that for the price of it, it didn&#x27;t break the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Not a good buy, though the quality of the metallic roses is good.</li>
            <li>, it broke the first time I put it in my hair, in addition, it got completely tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li>Gave me a whole new look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the color was slightly off from what I was expecting, instead of a gold color, it was more of a burnt bronze color?</li>
            <li>Too Two More Black Chongos .</li>
            <li>It can easily get stuck in your hair though, so be careful when putting it in and out of your hair.</li>
            <li>Not saying it would break easily, but you really never know.</li>
            <li>But that wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me as it still looks super</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price</li>
            <li>A classic look that anyone can wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delicate looking but well made, light weight, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is very pretty, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I gave this beautiful headband to Mom, as she was eyeballing my new headband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be too much hassle trying to return it, so I guess I&#x27;m just going to have to order again and hope they actually send me the right thing this time.</li>
            <li>This head band is quite beautiful, I was worried it would be a little tight after going through the reviews</li>
            <li>, looks good though, will have to get a long black band</li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s not so tight and it feels comfortable!</li>
            <li>I love it and its not so tight that is squeezes your head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my mistake, I should have considered the design more in that I am basically trying to put a tight necklace on my head.</li>
            <li>so I get many compliments BUT its awfly tight</li>
            <li>My headband didn&#x27;t break putting it on, unlike most reviewers, but after wearing it for a minute I thought my head was going to explode from it being too tight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend getting this hair band.</li>
            <li>It would be a good idea to have a second person near buy to help straighten the individual flower pieces which tend to turn various directions.</li>
            <li>Love this little elastic hair band.  </li>
            <li>A little more slack or another row of flowers would make this headband a winner.</li>
            <li>This hair band is exactly as pictured and will fit and stay in place on the average size head (though probably not a small child).</li>
            <li>Little gold flowers gives you a feminine touch without going over the top.</li>
            <li>it is a gorgeous piece tough.</li>
            <li>I will order more to have in stock to give with other gifts like for Xmas or Bdays!!</li>
            <li>However the metal is a bit soft, so be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>but, so far it really hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but it is made for very petite people and not full-sized adult women from any non-Asian country.</li>
            <li>I thought if wasn&#x27;t great at least I wouldn&#x27;t have spent too much on it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be cute to wear to dress up a messy bun for school, but it gets all stuck in your hair and pulls your hair</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll buy a few more anyways.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I&#x27;ll never use this again, but it was too cheap to waste time returning.</li>
            <li>Its good quiality but only if you have a small head.</li>
            <li>Maybe a few more times will loosen it up a bit.</li>
            <li>I know it is only a dollar but not even worth the time.</li>
            <li>my hair is silky and my head is oval shape, unlike the round shape of most headbands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable though and despite the fact that it&#x27;s too small, it seems like it&#x27;s very durable</li>
            <li>no complaint there.</li>
            <li>The band is quite small; however the linked roses really helps with the fitting.</li>
            <li>But it was apparently made with people with Elf sized heads because upon putting it on the first time it snapped and broke without any force.</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t wear head bands because of how they look.</li>
            <li>I normally run into issues with headbands staying in place</li>
            <li>Overall, its beautiful if you have a small enough head.  </li>
            <li>my head is of normal size by the way when i wore it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and delicate looking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so simple, and fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>even worth shipping it back and all that jazz ....</li>
            <li>Love it I always want to throw my hair in a ponytail or messy bun in the summer</li>
            <li>Great for casual wear and dressing up.</li>
            <li>really good for undos, because the tangling will be a mess with your hair loose.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit small for me, but it is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The one I gave my daughter broke before getting it over her head and the other one is still fine.  </li>
            <li>A little tight for my head but will make a great girt.</li>
            <li>Overall, the design is pretty and if you can get it in the right spot it doesn&#x27;t move very much, but I do not highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have very fine (and I mean VERY) hair.</li>
            <li>Of course, I tried to put it on right when I got it, and the elastic part in the back broke.</li>
            <li>and I hope it does not because its my only headband right now.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it on, it slide right off the back of my head.</li>
            <li>it fit a lil to tight and it don&#x27;t stretch much</li>
            <li>It was very cheap, but I thought, &amp;#34;hey, lets give it a try!&amp;#34; It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>you could use it for your head if your smart and stretched it out first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, well-made, &amp; the circumference is large enough that I don&#x27;t get a headache wearing it.</li>
            <li>(I live in the USA)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT plastic and looks like something I&#x27;d buy from a store where I live.</li>

            <li>Love it, but is very tight con head.stretched in time</li>
            <li>A little bit too tight but with use it will fit better.</li>
            <li>I bought this to wear with a messy bun- kind of a romantic hairstyle.</li>
            <li>Elastic band does not stretch very far at all.</li>
            <li>very early~</li>
            <li>is too tight to wear and broke easily.</li>
            <li>It barely fits around my whole head.</li>
            <li>The quality is typical of any low-end costume jewelry, but I think it will hold up just fine.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a small head I guess??</li>
            <li>looks so pretty on my head and a definite fashion band for your forehead</li>
            <li>I think I have a pretty averaged sized head, so it couldnt be because my head was too big.</li>
            <li>I tried to wear it but first of all it pulls the hair and second of all it broke at the connection.</li>
            <li>It was cute but it was really small.</li>
            <li>most people say I have a small head.</li>
            <li>Pretty headband especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, and it didn&#x27;t take too long to be shipped here.</li>
            <li>The first time it was tried on, one of the tiny clips bent and it fell apart.</li>
            <li>it looks pretty but not flexible enough, hurt hair and also too tight.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This was too small for my head and might be better for a child?</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to stretch it out and put it in back of the head first then</li>
            <li>Ok it is SMALL.</li>
            <li>have a small head, as been told be many people.</li>
            <li>Cheap material and just not worth it.</li>
            <li>I feel like these would be better suited for a small child.</li>
            <li>It was pretty but broke the same day i got it!</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t have fit someone with even an average sized head.  </li>
            <li>This was a pretty hair band, but  I only got to wear it once because it broke as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted something to hold my hair back yet still look fashionable.</li>
            <li>but although I love the style of the headband, I&#x27;m not sure what size head</li>
            <li>will definitely be purchasing again from Fashionwu very soon!</li>
            <li>It is so cute, but it&#x27;s so small.  </li>
            <li>Its really pretty though, even if it snaps you can totally fix.</li>
            <li>The design is pretty , but whenever I tried to take it off it would get tangled with my hair, it was such a hassle.</li>
            <li>I actually gave this item 3 stars just because it is pretty, but.....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that can be avoided and it&#x27;s not bad if you are careful about removing it from your head.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This headband is too small for an adult, and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the flimsy side and could break easily.</li>
            <li>What had happened is that the elastic band on the back that stretches and holds it in place on your head needs to be slightly stretched while you are sliding the thing on....but just the smallest stretching effort was enough to put too much strain on the incredibly cheap metal looking flower design (which is actually a very soft and low grade plastic that has been painted a metalic gold to look like metal) and the thing snapped right between two of the decorative flowers.</li>
            <li>I have been thinking about just sewing the flowers on to a new headband, but the metal is literally so soft that would probably break too.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to an adult, maybe a child because it is cute but small.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t broken, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair like another that I&#x27;ve bought, and looks adorable!</li>
            <li>It has tight fit as a headband.</li>
            <li>too tight didn&#x27;t go over my head to fit</li>
            <li>Other reviews told me that Rose Flower Elastic Hair Band would be a tight fit for an average head.  </li>
            <li>It might be good for a little girl however it is too tight for an adult.</li>
            <li>Because it was so tight I began to develop a headache and was only able to wear the headband for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I just have to make sure that my hair is pulled back tightly before I put the band on and then take my hair out once the band is in place.</li>
            <li>it did not even fit my little sisters hair</li>
            <li>so it would be very difficult to remove because my hair was all tied up but other than that its good and cute.</li>
            <li>but when I put this headband on it was really tight, It looks adorable but maybe for a 10 year old or something I thnik the sizing from where it was inported is a lot different from the US.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute, a little hard to wear, I don&#x27;t expect it to last to many</li>
            <li>I would be careful with it because it is a little fragile, but still, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how fast this shipped out to me from HK as it arrived about 2 weeks earlier than the estimated delivery date window.</li>
            <li>To prevent that I would suggest coating in clear finger nail polish.</li>
            <li>I was surprised the roses were kinda metal</li>
            <li>and so far the band has retained</li>
            <li>I was presently surprised with the quality of this headband.</li>
            <li>Waiting to see young niece and give it to her.  </li>
            <li>but so far ive worn it for 3 hours</li>
            <li>This headband is designed for a child, not an adult.</li>
            <li>It is delicate and lovely with the cut out roses.</li>
            <li>too cheap to even waste a dollar or your time on it.</li>
            <li>Light weight and fits firmly on my head...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;0&amp;#34; and very petite</li>
            <li>I gave it to my eight year old cousin</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 9 yr old daughter.  </li>
            <li>AT 64 HAIR JEWELRY BRINGS OUT THE 20 YR OLD</li>
            <li>My 7 year old wore it</li>
            <li>completely stuck to my hair</li>
            <li>this is not made for an adult head.</li>
            <li>Picture should be for a kid not an adult</li>
            <li>I completely forgot i had ordered it.</li>
            <li>I did not bother returning it since it would be a waste of time and money for something so cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall, very well made headband.</li>
            <li>This product surprised me.</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive, so i knew it would be low quality.</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t be surprised for the price.</li>
            <li>Had to give it to my 2 year old niece and it barley fits her.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fall off and it stays in place, and I received it a week early.</li>
            <li>it was for an adult.</li>
            <li>My daughter received this for her 14th birthday from her 8 year old brother.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I wear a size L adult helmet.  </li>
            <li>do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>and I just tied a knot and fixed it.</li>
            <li>Just enough decoration not too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it twice so far</li>
            <li>So far I like.</li>
            <li>So professional.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $2 I spent on it.  </li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s alright and only worth a dollar but still a piece of cheap metal and</li>
            <li>Sad, glad they did the right thing by refunding me.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>Maybe I have a a bigger head than most, but this head band is so tight!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is worth the price of the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable but it&#x27;s VERY small.</li>
            <li>and it is very cute just way too small for the average sized head.</li>
            <li>but my only problem with it is that you have to put it on using a particular side so it doesnt pull your hair because of the way the metal meets (or doesnt meet) in this case.</li>
            <li>I like it, the roses were just big enough without being obnoxious and it stayed in place pretty well.</li>
            <li>Probably I will give it to my 5.5 year old, maybe it will fit her small head.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this in the mail, but found that it was very small</li>
            <li>and I hurt a little bit when u wear it, but not bad.</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended especially for the matter of the price and the quality.</li>
            <li>It also came in a cute little bag that I use to keep loose change in.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I spent less than $2 on it.  </li>
            <li>breaks easily, also takes out hair when putting it on,  a waste of money, and also takes longer to do my hair than with a regular headband</li>
            <li>It is not as long as the picture makes it seem, but reasonable price</li>
            <li>Item is too small for adults and teens - may fit a baby.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too small for my head to be comfortable or to stay on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very expensive looking and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li>Its too small to fit around an adults head.</li>
            <li>This is too small that cant even fit a baby head .</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s too small to go on my head comfortably.</li>
            <li>I have a small head and it still barely fit.</li>
            <li>first use as its attachments are very loose.</li>
            <li>but apparently she must have a very small head because it&#x27;s more for kids.  </li>
            <li>It looks pretty but the metal clasps aren&#x27;t closed and smoothed all of the way, so it pulls on your hair a ton and is tricky to get into place.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really tight, &amp; i have a pretty normal sized head?</li>
            <li>Its very comfortable and tiny and delicate.</li>
            <li>im not mad or anything, i payed less that $2</li>
            <li>There were so many mixed reviews that it was hard to decided</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY THE NEW IMPROVED ONES.</li>
            <li>I bought this headband a few months ago, thinking it would be something cheap I&#x27;d wear occasionally.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s mixed with pretty long hair &amp; said it was just the thing she needed.</li>
            <li>I cannot wear this because it simply does not fit comfortably around my head.</li>
            <li>It is pretty but metal(the roses) is sharp and get stuck in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>But you hair gets stuck between the roses and tugs if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
            <li>This looked pretty when arrived, but just like the other reviews it broke after 1st use</li>
            <li>It is beautiful, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again simply because it can take me a few tries to get it on my head right, and my hair is thin enough as it</li>
            <li>only problem is that the links catch in my hair so i have to get it right the first time i put it in, which rlly isnt that hard</li>
            <li>It just snapped right in half.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty to look at...runs small for an adult.  </li>
            <li>and I have had to re attach a few times but other than that it is currently my favorite hair accessory.</li>
            <li>super cheap and not worth the few cents spent on it.</li>
            <li>Fun little headband.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t worn it at all because of how hard it is to style it so it looks good :/</li>
            <li>Later, i tried it on that was hard to use, my hair got caught in it multiple times and even ripped a couple strands of my hairs, as cute as the headband is its a pain to get it on.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t adjust it or anything, at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because it looks delicate, but  it holds my medium course curly hair really well.</li>
            <li>This thing broke 2 days later, the elastic stretched out to much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not very flexable, and honestly the clasps holding the flowers together are just not good...</li>
            <li>I am an adult female.</li>
            <li>One of the links hooking the roses together popped open, I fixed it, but another one immediately broke.  </li>
            <li>The metal doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can barely feel it there.</li>
            <li>I tried to put it on, barely stretching it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful, your hair can get stuck in the roses and get pulled.</li>
            <li>but they should make these for head sizes bigger than a 7 year old.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair too much if I take it out carefully.</li>
            <li>I bought this headband not really expecting too much out of it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cost much, so I&#x27;m not really worried about it.</li>
            <li>Overall, pleasantly surprised and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I barely wore it today.</li>
            <li>it comes 2 weeks after the delivery estimate, and on top of the extended wait i get it broken its a piece of trash</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really, really sad, because I liked the look of these on the page.</li>
            <li>I love the headband, but the elastic band has broken already and my hair tends to get stuck in the floral metal pieces.</li>
            <li>The reviews about it being small are unfortunately true.</li>
            <li>I was able to wear it for about 4 hours before I had to take if off because it was irritating me.</li>
            <li>It would nicely dress up someone&#x27;s attire without being flashy.</li>
            <li>It is well made and it looks so pretty with an up-do or with your hair down.</li>
            <li>This headband is very pretty &amp; doesn&#x27;t get caught in your hair, but the elastic is very tight on my scalp.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Takes a simple hairdo like a ponytail or just letting your hair down into a whole new level without any effort.</li>
            <li>The super long shipping time just makes it not worth it at all.</li>
            <li>I chose this head piece because I wanted something a little more than just a band but with little bling.</li>
            <li>This one is super small.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my hair is stick straight and baby fine, so it doesn&#x27;t stay in unless I curl or braid my hair.</li>
            <li>Very small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty but it is waaaayyyyy too small.</li>
            <li>I was even extra careful with the second one because the first one broke</li>
            <li>at first i thought it was going to break because it was really tight</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit too tight on my head, but it&#x27;s so sturdy and pretty</li>
            <li>and it is pretty tight.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty tight on my head.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I tried to wear it, because it was way too tight.</li>
            <li>but if you want them for a special occasion allow at least a month or 2 processing and shipping time.</li>
            <li>only that it was super small like for a toddler</li>
            <li>It is clearly a child sized headband, it&#x27;s pretty cute but does me no good seeing as it won&#x27;t fit. :(</li>
            <li>It was cheaply made and not good quality.</li>
            <li>It broke not long after that.</li>
            <li>Uhhhh Its So Tiny Barely Fits My Head .</li>
            <li>It takes a LONG time to arrive (nearly 2 months)</li>
            <li>It was literally only in my hands intact for maybe a grand total of 30 seconds before it was broken and sliding out of my daughter head to the floor.</li>
            <li>It also changed colors in the first few days.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a smaller head, this headband is pretty tight.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think my head is really big, but when I first got this headband it was really tight on my head and the chain broke.</li>
            <li>I may just have a big head , it was pretty tight .</li>
            <li>It could be dressed up or down, which is very convenient</li>
            <li>It had flowers down the whole band, and broke as soon as I used it.</li>
            <li>It was so small that it would not have fit my 12 year old sister&#x27;s head, much less mine.</li>
            <li>one of those things that arrives in a strange little package from China (which I find exciting).</li>
            <li>I did try it on, its a little tight but it fits my head fine.</li>
            <li>I took it out of the bag it came in, put it on my teeny 5 year old daughter (as it is SO small, it could only fit a petite child), and the thing snapped in half...</li>
            <li>It changes color and it keeps on popping, but I wont say its a total waste of money because for the first fewdays I had it on</li>
            <li>The hair band is so pretty, I am surprised when I received cause of its delicate.</li>
            <li>The only down side is it&#x27;s very snug on my head.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed I was very happy with its appearance</li>
            <li>It is just heavy enough to feel secure without weighing down my head.</li>
            <li>The elastic part was not long enough or stretchy enough.</li>
            <li>That said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this hair band for people with fine and/or thin hair.</li>
            <li>It did not fit my head, I don&#x27;t have an exceptionally large head</li>
            <li>Would not fit a large head and band is not too stretchy</li>
            <li>It is really cute, but it gets tangled in your hair and a little hard to put on.</li>
            <li>Very affordable gift for a little one in my life.  </li>
            <li>It does get a little caught in your hair at times but it really didnt pull my hair or break my hair.</li>
            <li>I think for how little  I spent, it&#x27;s totally worth my money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very pretty piece, but it gets stuck in my hair easily and hurts like crazy to get out!</li>

            <li> Just amazing.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the materials weren&#x27;t cheap feeling.</li>

            <li> Lays nicely</li>

            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> we really liked it.</li>
            <li> It looked nice, but it broke after one wear.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will set nicely on their head as it looks in this picture.</li>
            <li> We had to fix it ourselves, and honestly I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;ll bust again.</li>
            <li> The metal and gaps on the rose</li>
            <li> It was packaged nicely to prevent damage during shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own this</li>

            <li> and it was nice but broke min.</li>
            <li> Good quality, now I wish I had purchased more for Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product but the headband broke as soon as I tried it on.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I looked at the reviews and saw that many people said it was good quality.</li>
            <li> maybe if I would have got it I would have liked it</li>
            <li> Looks really nice in hair and holds well.  </li>
            <li> I liked this.  </li>
            <li> Nice headband but slides off and needs to be longer.</li>
            <li> Nice though</li>
            <li> Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Looks nice when I put on with one of my collared shirts.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I bought the product thinking it would be good quality and cute</li>
            <li> Will make a nice stocking stuffer for any age.</li>
            <li> It has all of these hooks between each rose that gets caught in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I gues they are out of them and are now offering this kind.</li>
            <li> this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the rose headband and they sent me the leaf one.</li>
            <li> Nice, lightweight head band.  </li>
            <li> This is what I purchased what I received was nothin like it I received a metal rose on a hair tye</li>
            <li> For $1.42 I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to be honest.  </li>
            <li> Its really nice, but I&#x27;d prefer to have it as a headband.</li>
            <li> This is a very dainty pretty head band I purchased two one for me and one for my daughter we love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute, very elegant, the colors &amp; flowers are nice</li>
            <li> But I am very satisfied with the headband:)</li>
            <li> tje flowers are pretty and dainty.</li>
            <li> It is a very cute head band :)</li>
            <li> not bad quality, size is great</li>
            <li> It is very cute and looks lovely in my hair.</li>
            <li> The fact that this item was so cheap yet works and looks like it costs more makes it a great value.</li>
            <li> I loved the gold, flower design and how strong the band was</li>
            <li> The headband looks really cute,the quality is not the best but for the price is okay.</li>
            <li> the flowers get tangled in my hair very easily just by trying to take it off.</li>
            <li> It breaks very easily</li>
            <li> I love this so cute!</li>
            <li> really cute though! :)</li>
            <li> :) I really love it!</li>
            <li> good if you want something cheap and dont care about</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> great product - fun and works well with everything - do recommend it................</li>
            <li> great headband takes along time for them to come in but is well worth</li>
            <li> I was worried it might break before I bought it since it was cheap, but its actually really good quality.</li>
            <li> It was nice for the price, for the 3 or 4 times I was able to wear it before it broke.</li>
            <li> Headband is beautiful but broke first time it was tried on a 13 yr olds head.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be made well, looks gorgeous, and feels comfortable on.  </li>
            <li> cute flowers and looks amazing in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is beautiful and would be really pretty in your hair</li>
            <li> On the bright note, it&#x27;s cheap, so I could use it as a hair tie.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this metallic gold rose flower hair band, it&#x27;s FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Good quality, comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love this band, I catch myself wearing it all the time because it&#x27;s so nice looking.</li>
            <li> Sometimes i even wear it as a necklace, it is so pretty...and the delivery was very quick!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I love love love this !</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and fit my large head perfectly.</li>

            <li> and I love, love the rose lace flowers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and kind of figured it would be junk, but to my pleasant surprise, I really like it!  </li>
            <li> The hair band is great, I really like it!</li>
            <li> cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;the roses are very cute but the elastic is where it broke at</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and great bargain.</li>
            <li> what a great price!&lt;br /&gt;It is very dainty and looks great with casual or dressy outfits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you love rose designs, you&#x27;ll certainly love this in your collection. :-)</li>
            <li> Amazon shoppers: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but very cheap and gets stuck in my hair lol</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made</li>

            <li> It is very comfortable and stylish.</li>
            <li> The headband is cute looking, but very cheaply made.</li>

            <li> and i  just feel so cute wearing it</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li> Cute, inexpensive hair band for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fashionable and the gold doesn&#x27;t look cheap, and it doesn&#x27;t slip from your head!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I also love the color.</li>
            <li> I wear it across my forehead like a hippie head band :)</li>
            <li> So Make sure when you put it on pull on the elastics.  </li>
            <li> Not so cute when just holding it but put with a hair style its cute.</li>
            <li> I love this hair band .</li>
            <li> I love wearing it.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s made more for a child.</li>
            <li> and I do love the look of it.</li>
            <li> Def beats the $5+ it costs at F21. :)</li>
            <li> But I realized the band is CHEAP!</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> i love this headband.</li>
            <li> and I love the shiny, gold roses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to replace the band with bobby pins and pin into place.</li>
            <li> It does fit my toddler, though!</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is OK...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking so many pictures</li>
            <li> I bought this, and wasn&#x27;t really pleased with it</li>
            <li> Its so cute.</li>
            <li> Its really cute.</li>

            <li> i love how it looks</li>
            <li> I love how this headband looks, but the roses can get caught in your hair, and is a pain to take out because then your hair gets messed up...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay more than a $1 for this item.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite headbands since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Hold my hair back perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love it even more because it does not hurt my head like others and it is</li>
            <li> I guess for the price is ok</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t come gold, it came orange-ish gold-ish but still cute.</li>
            <li> I look forward to wearing it often to dress up my appearance on many occasions.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to take it off the band and glue it to a plastic headband with teeth to make sure it stays in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks adorable in my hair tho.</li>
            <li> It was cute, though.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really cute.</li>
            <li> I was able to repair it.</li>
            <li> It  is more of a decorative headband.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s top be elected almost.</li>
            <li> I love this headband.</li>
            <li> , the metal is so cheap it broke before I even got it on my head!  </li>
            <li> it may work better.</li>
            <li> I love this accessory.</li>

            <li> I will order more.</li>
            <li> At the price it is, I knew it would either be cheap and fall apart, or it might actually be nice.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> It looks cute though</li>
            <li> I would suggest having more of a stretch at the bottom so that it&#x27;d be easier to get through the head and be able to fix.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it once</li>
            <li> Much better quality than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Like i said i love this hairband..</li>

            <li> The design is adorable and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> Not even sure it will fit her.  </li>

            <li> I just love being unique</li>

            <li> it changed color, and break easily.</li>
            <li> But it gets caught in my hair so easily and taking it out is a pain.</li>

            <li> It came off my head really easily, and pulls out a lot of hair with it.</li>
            <li> It also gets tangled in hair really easily.</li>

            <li> I enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li> It looks great with my blonde hair and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.</li>
            <li> it had been available in silver too</li>
            <li> The hair band wouldn&#x27;t fit and broke while I was trying to put it on.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and fit well.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t fit any grown-up&#x27;s head that I know of.</li>
            <li> Its free shipping</li>
            <li> Cheap piece.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get it to fit on my head.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> It is the same quality that you would get anywhere and a great value.</li>
            <li> There is no way I could fit this around my head maybe as a bracelet...</li>
            <li> Exactly fantastic,  </li>
            <li> I took this out of the envelope to see how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> I will never buy something so cheap on here again though.</li>
            <li> Its so cheap that i wont bother returning it.</li>
            <li> It is simple but a great accessory when you don&#x27;t feel getting dolled up.</li>
            <li> , It didn&#x27;t fit my head by any means.</li>
            <li> That being said, this does not even almost fit my head</li>
            <li> Product is made with elastic band making the fit comfortable for just about anybody.</li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> so it is not the comfortable fit</li>
            <li> But then again, for something this cheap</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it away because it just didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> It doesnt feel cheap</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t fit my head too well</li>
            <li> Yet, keep in mind, shipping is free.</li>
            <li> LOL I for one have a bigger one than the person who may have made these.</li>
            <li> even cheap they look cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap</li>
            <li> But this headband will fit any head shape</li>
            <li> [It literally smells like cheap</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance on it and buy it; it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s wicked cheap, but still.</li>
            <li> I really would like to meet the genius who decided to put metal closures between each rose at the front of the headband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap for a reason, ladies.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this hair band.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look cheap either</li>
            <li> when I opened my envelope the flowers looked scratchy on the edges and cheap.</li>
            <li> She is generally very picky, and she liked it.</li>
            <li> I can fit a youth size four wheeler helmet</li>
            <li> Cheap metal, crappy quality.</li>
            <li> Great low price.</li>
            <li> and maybe it will fit one of them,</li>
            <li> Looks just as cheap as you&#x27;d expect but couldn&#x27;t even fit it over my head.</li>
            <li> they were cheaply made.</li>
            <li> this would fit.</li>
            <li> cheap and broke, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It took forever to come &amp; when I opened it, I thought it looked cheap.</li>
            <li> cheap and okay.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Cheap product.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much and didn&#x27;t get to even wear out one time.</li>
            <li> Really cheap as well</li>
            <li> and I cannot comprehend how this would fit anybody.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a cheap thrill.</li>
            <li> I would suggest once you get it where you want it, try to secure it somehow</li>
            <li> My daughters and I enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li> Its worth the work for how cute it is.</li>
            <li> And it is comfortable, i can&#x27;t feel it poking or anything.</li>
            <li> The lady has worn it several times now and is quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I repackaged this and gave it to my 6yo niece for Christmas, and it fit her like a gem.  </li>
            <li> I realized it could look cheap</li>
            <li> but it is fabulous</li>
            <li> I love this headband far by one of the cutest I&#x27;ve bought and such a great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, metal finish, nice color, fits with all clothes and hair, can wear it with casual or elegant outfits.</li>
            <li> it is supposed to fit.</li>
            <li> Way too cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Affordable and comfortable elastic hairband.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap metal.  </li>
            <li> and it sits lightly on the head so it doesn&#x27;t dig in.</li>
            <li> but i think its meant for kids because it didnt fit me</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t stretch it to get over your head without snapping the cheap metal roses.</li>
            <li> And for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this, but because it is golden in color I fear it will turn.  </li>
            <li> This product is cheap and it looks cheap.</li>
            <li> and it looks perfect with sock buns/ messy buns.</li>
            <li> it came with a great price for what i have and it looks like it isnt breaking any time soon, i would totally do buy this again as a gift</li>
            <li> This was pretty, and a good price, but the first time I put it on it broke.</li>
            <li> for $1 something i thought it would not be good, but i was surprised.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it as much as I do, but it is a stunning piece :)</li>
            <li> Also, though it&#x27;s pretty, the flowers are very fine and my hair got tangled in them every time I tried to wear it.</li>
            <li> but so far, the product appears to be very sturdy, beautiful, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> i bought this for my preteen nieces, the fit was right and it was really cute until it started to tarnish</li>
            <li> I like it because it fits good but not tight and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s cute, good quality and I like that it lays flat on my head and doesn&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li> this is very nice actually bettter</li>
            <li> Turns out the headband looks very cheap, it hurts my hair when I put it on and it smells pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s beautiful and very sturdy for the very low price I paid:))</li>
            <li> Certainly not a quality gift, but good for the price!</li>

            <li> in all I am pretty satisfied for this product as it is super cute, shipped out super fast, is pretty good quality and was under $1 when I bought it.</li>
            <li> The flower part on it is metal and very sturdy, although the links that hold the flowers together brake off very easily.</li>
            <li> very  pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> Very pretty good quality n not tight!</li>
            <li> First off, this headband is so cute and can go with anything.</li>

            <li> Very much worth the price!</li>
            <li> IT IS ALSO GREAT FOR ALL HAIR LENGTHS,  IF YOU HAVE LONG HAIR</li>
            <li> The headband itself is awfully cute, and for the price, it is pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It took awhile to ship but was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> When I first saw the headband, I feel in love with it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a head band and also around one of my hats and it makes the hat unique.</li>
            <li> Its fancy and fun for a night out with friends!</li>
            <li> The hair band is so unique</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get it and broke while trying to put it on.</li>
            <li> This headband is lovely; however, it broke the first time I tried it on.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this would be a cute headband for me.</li>
            <li> I wear it quite often and the rubber band is still in great conditions and hasn&#x27;t stretched all out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and pretty</li>
            <li> It was totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this in my mail.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This just don&#x27;t worth your time nor your money!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> Worth the wait!</li>
            <li> However, it looks so cute that I&#x27;m willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get here because it ships from China, but for the price it&#x27;s definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li> i was excited to get this product</li>
            <li> it was pretty matched my dress I had on its cute .</li>

            <li> I was very excited to receive this headband, which I still think is pretty.</li>
            <li> Rose detail was ok, but only tried twice and the band broke.</li>
            <li> although this didn&#x27;t work out for me as a headband, I&#x27;m sure that I can use the metal rose chain for something, so it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
            <li> The seller was quick with their shipment and it arrived securely.</li>
            <li> It was a great price and so far it has not broken.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price this headband was good quality.  </li>

            <li> this was cute, well made, great price, but its so tight!</li>
            <li> It is defiantly a cute headband although I do not have that large of a head</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday, and it broke almost right away!</li>
            <li> It looked like I spent alot of money on it, which is great...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and pretty much came on time just as described.  </li>
            <li> so it was expected lol.</li>

            <li> Cute very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Overall good purchase.</li>
            <li> it looks good but the clips that connect each flower is an open hook which catches your hair and it hurts.</li>
            <li> Love this, it looks very delacate, but is stronger than it looks..</li>
            <li> nice and lovely hair band, my kids and i love it, the only things is the flower joint with the elastic not too good it came out after a few time wearing it</li>
            <li> It is very very well made with strong clasps between the flowers</li>
            <li> This head band was cute, but it was made to fit the head of a new born.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair accessory made of heavy metal and strong elasticity.  </li>
            <li> The headband is very pretty, and I was super excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty headband, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it, it stays on my head, and the gold tone flowers are made strong, so I</li>
            <li> It was pretty, but got tangled in hair easily.</li>
            <li> Great price free shipping not tooo tight on my head.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> it- looks good as a flat necklace as well</li>
            <li> It really is beautiful, it&#x27;s just so tight that it slid backwards and fell off when i put it on.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to buy a seemingly beautiful headband at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s classic and timeless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an extremely cheap investment for such a nice accessory.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is in general pretty good quality</li>
            <li> Never had hairbrand of mine break so quickly.</li>
            <li> I got lucky and didn&#x27;t injure my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I wished it would&#x27;ve changed colors so quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily I could fix it..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more stylish than a regular head band.</li>
            <li> This arrived fairly quickly - from China.  </li>
            <li> Once the seller learned about my problem they quickly refunded my money.</li>
            <li> When the package came at first I was unsure if the headband would even be in one piece(because of packaging)-  lucky for everyone it was!</li>
            <li> came faster than expected and nice for the price, wish there were more designs to choose from for this price range.</li>
            <li> Fits my head perfect and it&#x27;s beautiful...can wear it with a pretty evening gown or even with a lazy day outfit.</li>
            <li> but the metal became discolored Quickly</li>
            <li> The gold flowers are super cute and it fits nice and snug on my head without slipping off.</li>
            <li> very different headband,I&#x27;m always looking for unique head acceries, I have two daughters with long hair.was very happy to find some</li>

            <li> very pretty but cheaply made, i bought two and both snapped as I was putting them on for the first time.</li>
            <li> Its simple but very cute</li>
            <li> This is very pretty.</li>
            <li> When I got this product, it looked just like the picture which I am very pleased because sometimes sellers will send something similar to the picture.</li>
            <li> It broke the very first time I put it on.</li>

            <li> lovely, I really like it, thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> Combined Hot Lovely Metallic Sweet Lady Hollow Rose Flower Elastic Hair Band Headband - Gold (New)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super cute and not heavy at all!</li>
            <li> and also I tried it on &amp; it looks so cute and new</li>
            <li> Its cute and of good quality, but it was just too small.</li>
            <li> Definitely will purchase more!</li>
            <li> well it hasnt broke as many reviewers have mentioned, maybe they stretched out the whole thing but its nice.</li>
            <li> gives you a pretty look!</li>
            <li> The rubber band that the flowers are attached too doesnt really stretch and wouldnt be able to fit a normal persons head.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> broke on the first day!</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x60;T EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LIKE THIS HAIR BAND !!...</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;ll be able to fix it with a new stretch cord, but then, I don&#x27;t know if it will be worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I tried to be super careful not to break the chain, so it took me a good 10 mins to put it on.</li>
            <li> So I should have known better, but this was so cute, and I thought maybe since it was half elastic that it maybe just maybe would fit...</li>
            <li> Fortunately I did not spend much on it, but that is probably why it broke.  </li>
            <li> i will go over it with some clear top coat to seal the color and not get that greenish color thru&#x27; time.</li>
            <li> I wish the shipping was faster but for this price I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> So worth what you&#x27;ve paid for.</li>
            <li> It broke between a link on my 1st attempt to put it on...not even worth a dollar and had to wait over a month for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for  my daughter and I was surprised how much she liked it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did was because it was on a couponing site and people said they were nice.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I would say this is more for a child than an adult.</li>
            <li> I rarely see people with them</li>
            <li> It is so adorable and classy</li>
            <li> It took about 2-3 weeks to send but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> but I think this was worth buying.</li>
            <li> The headband looked really nice, and I wore it several times.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> When I wear it i get many compliments and people are surprised when I tell them I got it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Actually looks nice and fits my head well.</li>
            <li> I already threw it away as it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> just talked myself from reducing the rating to 1 star instead of 2, but it&#x27;s still only 1.5 honest rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s worth a 5, but not quite.  </li>
            <li> Roses are quite golden but not gaudy.</li>
            <li> in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It gets stuck in my hair all of the time though, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more for a pre-teen head than an adult&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this band for both young and old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not fragile or flimsy like I kind of imagined.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more the size for a young child and not an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good for young and old alike</li>
            <li> but It looks exactly like the picture it would be a great necklace too if you decided to let your hair down.</li>
            <li> broke right after I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> This broke right away bc</li>
            <li> but I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got 3 stars for them doing the right thing with the refund&lt;</li>
            <li> Right when I get it I try to use it</li>
            <li> it broke right away</li>
            <li> it broke right away just as i was trying it</li>
            <li> This has no elasticity and broke right away.</li>
            <li> That wasnt right</li>
            <li> This is a cute design however it was kind of small and fell apart after one use.</li>
            <li> The metallic sweet lady hollow rose flower elastic hair band was not up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really really nice to pull my hair back because its so so hot</li>
            <li> Other than that this headband is super cute!</li>
            <li> super cute if you have a tiny head and don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> Which I believe to be true as when she&#x27;s taken it off, much of her hair is STILL ATTACHED to it.</li>
            <li> This pulls your hair a bit, and it&#x27;s kind of cheesy, but from a distance it looks good and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It came right before the exact shipping date</li>
            <li> It shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> Definitely well worth the $1.08 + free shipping!</li>
            <li> I was able to get a few and give as gifts, they also enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I think I only paid like $1 for this, and it&#x27;s so more than worth that.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, product is amazing, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> meant for a smaller head, I ended up attaching another elastic (about 4&amp;#34;) in order to get it to fit around my head comfortably.</li>
            <li> As much as this is a pretty headband, it doesn&#x27;t even fit, and I&#x27;m a very petite woman.  </li>
            <li> Very Pretty And Modern.</li>
            <li> Just as described at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> After correcting the size issue I like it very much.</li>
            <li> very nice only i have a big head</li>
            <li> Worth the price for certain.  </li>
            <li> however, the color when you get sweating goes off a little but still good to wear</li>
            <li> My little sister loved it.</li>
            <li> My little sister loved it</li>
            <li> anyways i totally recommend getting this its so beautiful and stays on just fine cause usually when i wear headband bands they slip off in like 5 minutes</li>
            <li> It would look good with your hair up or down!</li>
            <li> It was kind of tight on my head at first, but it quickly adjusted.</li>
            <li> Soooo pretty in my hair.</li>
            <li> its an ok hair product every time i put it on my hair it seems to go back after a while.</li>
            <li> The bank broke the first time I put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly like it said in the ad.</li>
            <li> so I was able to just clamp it back together .</li>
            <li> i think it is pretty</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li> this iten is exactly what i wanted but it took over a month to recieve it but</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I tried to place on head.</li>
            <li> i like it and it fit as expected really recomend it to people who are looking for something cute to wear</li>
            <li> This product broke on the first use.  </li>
            <li> Glad I only paid a dollar.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to wear this, it broke.</li>
            <li> The headband is exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li> I bought this and got some compliments the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to put it on, it broke.</li>
            <li> It would probably fit a 7  year old but that is it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very flexible and well adjust to your head if you want to wear it hippie style to!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> Thank you and hope you&#x27;ll make a lot of pretty things like this.</li>
            <li> Really pretty.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, but not durable at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks pretty cute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I tried to put it on.</li>
            <li> Just like the first one, it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so just be aware of this.</li>
            <li> The pictures shoes exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this item thinking it&#x27;d be cute and simple.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be fixed because it is sooooo cheap.</li>
            <li> This broke when I first tried to put on, I repaired it</li>
            <li> they broke first try&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li> The only problem being that it&#x27;s more of a copper color than the gold it says it is.</li>
            <li> However, the size is more geared for a childs&#x27; head, and the hooks between each of the flowers don&#x27;t close all the way, leaving them open to snag hair.</li>
            <li> it was pretty to look at</li>
            <li> This hair band fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This hair band is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It got stuck in my hair and the first day I tried to use it, it broke.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty for a kids head.</li>
            <li> Initially when I tried to put this on it broke, but I was able to fix it.  </li>
            <li> i wish i got it because it looks pretty in the picture.</li>
            <li> Pretty gold color just like in the pic.</li>
            <li> However, when you first get it, take a pair of needle nose pliers, and tighten the links between the roses.</li>
            <li> Its so pretty on, I&#x27;m getting extras for all the girly girls I know.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to only stretch out the elastic part whilst putting it on your head.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly how it looks like in the picture.</li>
            <li> looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> its just really pretty</li>
            <li> It fell apart in my hands as I was putting it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> exactly what i orderedwill order more in the future and recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> it broke when trying to put it on for the first time</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty piece.</li>
            <li> but the flowers are really pretty.</li>
            <li> s break first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not buy this unless you are willing for it to break before you even put it on your head.</li>
            <li> This headband Broke when I put it on the first time.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> but it is still pretty</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this piece for only a dollar on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Should make it stronger for big heads &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> So while I was able to momentarily stretch it onto my head, it felt like a vise and then instantly it slid</li>
            <li> Cute head band, but won&#x27;t work for big headed people like myself.</li>
            <li> I ended up breaking and injuring myself the first time putting it on.</li>
            <li> This headband is so pretty in person.  </li>
            <li> Fell apart the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Also be careful because your hair can get caught on the rose pedals if your hair is frizzy.</li>
            <li> SO when i put it on for the first time it broke.</li>
            <li> broke the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> It broke the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t the exact one I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> The flowers are almost exactly the size of a dime.</li>
            <li> I am going to try and put more metal links on it to make it larger and to fix it.</li>
            <li> Trying it on for the first time, it broke.</li>
            <li> also it broke within the first two to three days and</li>
            <li> On the plus side it is pretty.</li>
            <li> Broke on the first use.</li>
            <li> Pretty dissapointing.</li>
            <li> and this is the first headband ive ever had that doesn&#x27;t slip off my head.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> quality.the gold color its nice but does not really stretch.broke apart</li>
            <li> first time I put it on</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but looks like it will break after the first use.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> It works with any pretty dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really cute and sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> Fits tight so it doesn&#x27;t slide out of my head, and the golden color of the (very cute) flower design, really pops out over my brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Made it a little lose but much more comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> But, what I like most is that it is very comfortable, small, and STAYS PUT!</li>
            <li> and i have a normal sized head!!</li>
            <li> Love this product so so much and would definitely purchase over and over again!!!!</li>
            <li> It stretches very well and makes a simple ponytail look cute.</li>
            <li> I bought this for one of my young adult daughter, it looks cute on her.</li>
            <li> Its cheap , cute looking but not comfortable at all .</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s very cute it broke with in the first few seconds of putting it on.</li>
            <li> This headband is very nice and looks beautiful when worn so it can be worn for everyday work, casual &amp; dress.</li>
            <li> I love it and hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I know this item was very inexpensive, but it broke on the first day.  </li>
            <li> very cute and not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I can wear it with pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised its true to picture.</li>
            <li> lucky I fixed it</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it gets caught in your hair easily</li>
            <li> The only issue is that taking it out isn&#x27;t easy because my hair gets wrapped around the flowers.</li>
            <li> it is such an easy way to add elegance to your look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually when I buy headbands with the elastic band, it will stretch out and grow too large for my head.</li>
            <li> Guess I didn&#x27;t pull it on in a certain way.</li>
            <li> Never been told I have large head.</li>
            <li> IT IS CERTAINLY AN EYE CATCHER IN A CROWD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to fix it, but the quality certainly isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have a large head.</li>
            <li> The head band is very cute and not too tight!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, but just doesn&#x27;t work as a headband if you are an adult.</li>
            <li> Looks &amp; fits great.&lt;br /&gt;Actually bought a few more as gifts !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and makes any crazy hair fair look better.</li>
            <li> Attractive flowers with black elastic at back of neck.  </li>
            <li> i think it looks nice but is too tight it hurts</li>
            <li> Kind of tight around the head.</li>
            <li> The material is very cheap and the hooks that keeps the metal pieces together are very loose.</li>
            <li> This headpiece is nice in colour and shape, although it&#x27;s a bit small (don&#x27;t buy it if you have a very large head).</li>
            <li> This, as with many other people, broke when my wife first put it on.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT, fits a lil tight on my teen</li>
            <li> so I thought this would be nice to dress it up a little bit.</li>
            <li> Is not made large enough to fit over my 8 yr olds head.</li>
            <li> , I love it, very delicate and elegant.</li>
            <li> I actually didnt expect much because it was so cheap, but i was surprised at the quality and how pretty it was!</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I really like the headband</li>
            <li> This is very beautiful,but that is metal，When</li>
            <li> and it really stands out.  </li>
            <li> I love how this hair band stays in place all day without slipping out.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thank You for this high quality product!</li>
            <li> doesnt even fit its too big!!!</li>
            <li> It is a lot better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, arrived before estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> very cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it smells like a whole bunch of coins or something.</li>
            <li> Also hair get caught a bit, but if you have straight hair (like I do)</li>
            <li> I dont use it very often.</li>
            <li> Not put together very well, probably cheep materials.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to wear this hair band.</li>
            <li> MUch As Before</li>
            <li> It fits very well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this headband so much.</li>
            <li> I really do suggest this.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really stretch</li>
            <li> I put a piece of fabric behind it and now it works great.</li>
            <li> but it did manage to fit around my big head</li>
            <li> I realize the item was very inexpensive, I guess you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> It came fast.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really upsetting.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t losing much money to try</li>
            <li> while pulling it you have to be gentle.</li>
            <li> I made sure when I wear it that I carefully put it over my head and wore a style that the flowers won&#x27;t get caught in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind too much since I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it</li>
            <li> It really did meet my expectations</li>
            <li> It was very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Worn it a couple of times and has not broken..</li>
            <li> but I really like it for decoration</li>
            <li> I am a very petite woman, 5&#x27;2 and 105 pounds</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the elastic was the only thing that broke.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have to agree with her, its really adorable.&lt;br /&gt;plus</li>
            <li> the quality of the metal is very inferior.</li>
            <li> Much nicer in person.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think the size would matter much.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really stretch at all.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it would break unless someone was really trying to.</li>
            <li> yes, it arrived fast, yes</li>
            <li> And the metallic flowers looked very high-end.</li>
            <li> it is very beautiful，but</li>
            <li> u can almost wear it with anything..fits very well..</li>
            <li> The metal can tend to pull your hair so just be gentle when you take it off</li>
            <li> I didnt pay much and</li>
            <li> Stays in place really well.</li>
            <li> My big problem is the smell of metal from the roses, almost like a cheap metal smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about the hair band is really sucky</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> and this is very complimenting with my hair color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping came fast I guess, didn&#x27;t forget it about it during the time</li>
            <li> It looks like the metal would really snag your hair.</li>
            <li> You really get a quality product for a cheep price.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt feel very durable</li>
            <li> but this one doesn&#x27;t require me to place multiple bobbie pins around it to secure it.</li>
            <li> I like this so much.</li>
            <li> Cant really say anything about the quality of the headband because mine was never derived.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t ruin the whole hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair band</li>
            <li> it felt like it was gonna break any minute , but it feels very sturdy</li>
            <li> Really...  </li>
            <li> This is so well made and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The hair band was better than expected, after I bought it</li>
            <li> IF you expected better quality, it&#x27;s your fault.</li>
            <li> it will not stay on my head very well</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Quality item, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this product, I get compliments on it all the time, everyone wants one.</li>
            <li> i really like it</li>
            <li> Much nicer made.</li>
            <li> Shipping isn&#x27;t fast, but it also was not unreasonable.</li>
            <li> It goes very well in her darker brown hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really affordable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than I expected to get.</li>
            <li> This is really cheap looking metalic hair band and slip all the time.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s wasting money totally.</li>
            <li> It fits very well</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend of mine as a really late birthday gift &amp; she loved it.</li>
            <li> and I can not imagine it fitting on even a smaller headed adult.</li>
            <li> So far it has not changed colors and looks cute with a bun or just simply alone.</li>
            <li> It looks really nice with a messy bun or updo.</li>
            <li> It was a pretty easy fix as I just had to rehook everything and clamp the ring closed again, so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s plastic, it actually looks very nice and not cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> this headband is very strong but not too tight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, however, I think it would work better on a child, its way too small for me to use.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly the way the picture looks, it adds a different look to any hair style, its very pretty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, a bit tight like most hair bands.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made (which that is what you get for cheap products sometimes) and very tight on the head.</li>
            <li> i love this and wish that there were other designs or colors.</li>
            <li> other than that, love it.</li>
            <li> Wore this the other day to give my ponytail an interesting twist.</li>
            <li> I wore this the other day and got sooo many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I have a normal sized head!</li>
            <li> Only positive was I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> It however is the size to fit a small child, and will not even fit around my head.</li>
            <li> I would suggest for older users that will not handle it too much.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t fit any normal human beings head.</li>
            <li> Too small to fit an adults head and too flimsy to fit a childs head.</li>
            <li> does many e seem like it would break if stretched too far.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark, curly hair and though it looks amazing it hurts coming out!</li>
            <li> but hey, it was cute for a few wears and cheap enough for me not to complain much</li>
            <li> And considering it shipped from outside the country(Hong Kong), shipping was super fast - 5 days if I&#x27;m not mistaken.</li>
            <li> It felt secure even after I wore it all day long.</li>
            <li> Nice stocking stuffer or small gift.</li>
            <li> surprised how pretty it looks in person.</li>
            <li> But not worth more than a $1</li>
            <li> Cute, but not worth buying.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time my 15 year old put it on.</li>
            <li> , I was surprised that for the price of it, it didn&#x27;t break the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy, though the quality of the metallic roses is good.</li>
            <li> , it broke the first time I put it in my hair, in addition, it got completely tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li> Gave me a whole new look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the color was slightly off from what I was expecting, instead of a gold color, it was more of a burnt bronze color?</li>
            <li> Too Two More Black Chongos .</li>
            <li> It can easily get stuck in your hair though, so be careful when putting it in and out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Not saying it would break easily, but you really never know.</li>
            <li> But that wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me as it still looks super</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price</li>
            <li> A classic look that anyone can wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicate looking but well made, light weight, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I gave this beautiful headband to Mom, as she was eyeballing my new headband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be too much hassle trying to return it, so I guess I&#x27;m just going to have to order again and hope they actually send me the right thing this time.</li>
            <li> This head band is quite beautiful, I was worried it would be a little tight after going through the reviews</li>
            <li> , looks good though, will have to get a long black band</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s not so tight and it feels comfortable!</li>
            <li> I love it and its not so tight that is squeezes your head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my mistake, I should have considered the design more in that I am basically trying to put a tight necklace on my head.</li>
            <li> so I get many compliments BUT its awfly tight</li>
            <li> My headband didn&#x27;t break putting it on, unlike most reviewers, but after wearing it for a minute I thought my head was going to explode from it being too tight.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend getting this hair band.</li>
            <li> It would be a good idea to have a second person near buy to help straighten the individual flower pieces which tend to turn various directions.</li>
            <li> Love this little elastic hair band.  </li>
            <li> A little more slack or another row of flowers would make this headband a winner.</li>
            <li> This hair band is exactly as pictured and will fit and stay in place on the average size head (though probably not a small child).</li>
            <li> Little gold flowers gives you a feminine touch without going over the top.</li>
            <li> it is a gorgeous piece tough.</li>
            <li> I will order more to have in stock to give with other gifts like for Xmas or Bdays!!</li>
            <li> However the metal is a bit soft, so be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> but, so far it really hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but it is made for very petite people and not full-sized adult women from any non-Asian country.</li>
            <li> I thought if wasn&#x27;t great at least I wouldn&#x27;t have spent too much on it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be cute to wear to dress up a messy bun for school, but it gets all stuck in your hair and pulls your hair</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll buy a few more anyways.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ll never use this again, but it was too cheap to waste time returning.</li>
            <li> Its good quiality but only if you have a small head.</li>
            <li> Maybe a few more times will loosen it up a bit.</li>
            <li> I know it is only a dollar but not even worth the time.</li>
            <li> my hair is silky and my head is oval shape, unlike the round shape of most headbands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable though and despite the fact that it&#x27;s too small, it seems like it&#x27;s very durable</li>
            <li> no complaint there.</li>
            <li> The band is quite small; however the linked roses really helps with the fitting.</li>
            <li> But it was apparently made with people with Elf sized heads because upon putting it on the first time it snapped and broke without any force.</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t wear head bands because of how they look.</li>
            <li> I normally run into issues with headbands staying in place</li>
            <li> Overall, its beautiful if you have a small enough head.  </li>
            <li> my head is of normal size by the way when i wore it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice and delicate looking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so simple, and fresh looking.  </li>
            <li> even worth shipping it back and all that jazz ....</li>
            <li> Love it I always want to throw my hair in a ponytail or messy bun in the summer</li>
            <li> Great for casual wear and dressing up.</li>
            <li> really good for undos, because the tangling will be a mess with your hair loose.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit small for me, but it is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The one I gave my daughter broke before getting it over her head and the other one is still fine.  </li>
            <li> A little tight for my head but will make a great girt.</li>
            <li> Overall, the design is pretty and if you can get it in the right spot it doesn&#x27;t move very much, but I do not highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine (and I mean VERY) hair.</li>
            <li> Of course, I tried to put it on right when I got it, and the elastic part in the back broke.</li>
            <li> and I hope it does not because its my only headband right now.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on, it slide right off the back of my head.</li>
            <li> it fit a lil to tight and it don&#x27;t stretch much</li>
            <li> It was very cheap, but I thought, &amp;#34;hey, lets give it a try!&amp;#34; It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> you could use it for your head if your smart and stretched it out first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight, well-made, &amp; the circumference is large enough that I don&#x27;t get a headache wearing it.</li>
            <li> (I live in the USA)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT plastic and looks like something I&#x27;d buy from a store where I live.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product Image  New Fashion Gold Leaf Festival</li>
            <li> Love it, but is very tight con head.stretched in time</li>
            <li> A little bit too tight but with use it will fit better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear with a messy bun- kind of a romantic hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Elastic band does not stretch very far at all.</li>
            <li> very early~</li>
            <li> is too tight to wear and broke easily.</li>
            <li> It barely fits around my whole head.</li>
            <li> The quality is typical of any low-end costume jewelry, but I think it will hold up just fine.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a small head I guess??</li>
            <li> looks so pretty on my head and a definite fashion band for your forehead</li>
            <li> I think I have a pretty averaged sized head, so it couldnt be because my head was too big.</li>
            <li> I tried to wear it but first of all it pulls the hair and second of all it broke at the connection.</li>
            <li> It was cute but it was really small.</li>
            <li> most people say I have a small head.</li>
            <li> Pretty headband especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price, and it didn&#x27;t take too long to be shipped here.</li>
            <li> The first time it was tried on, one of the tiny clips bent and it fell apart.</li>
            <li> it looks pretty but not flexible enough, hurt hair and also too tight.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This was too small for my head and might be better for a child?</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to stretch it out and put it in back of the head first then</li>
            <li> Ok it is SMALL.</li>
            <li> have a small head, as been told be many people.</li>
            <li> Cheap material and just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I feel like these would be better suited for a small child.</li>
            <li> It was pretty but broke the same day i got it!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t have fit someone with even an average sized head.  </li>
            <li> This was a pretty hair band, but  I only got to wear it once because it broke as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted something to hold my hair back yet still look fashionable.</li>
            <li> but although I love the style of the headband, I&#x27;m not sure what size head</li>
            <li> will definitely be purchasing again from Fashionwu very soon!</li>
            <li> It is so cute, but it&#x27;s so small.  </li>
            <li> Its really pretty though, even if it snaps you can totally fix.</li>
            <li> The design is pretty , but whenever I tried to take it off it would get tangled with my hair, it was such a hassle.</li>
            <li> I actually gave this item 3 stars just because it is pretty, but.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that can be avoided and it&#x27;s not bad if you are careful about removing it from your head.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This headband is too small for an adult, and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the flimsy side and could break easily.</li>
            <li> What had happened is that the elastic band on the back that stretches and holds it in place on your head needs to be slightly stretched while you are sliding the thing on....but just the smallest stretching effort was enough to put too much strain on the incredibly cheap metal looking flower design (which is actually a very soft and low grade plastic that has been painted a metalic gold to look like metal) and the thing snapped right between two of the decorative flowers.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about just sewing the flowers on to a new headband, but the metal is literally so soft that would probably break too.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to an adult, maybe a child because it is cute but small.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair like another that I&#x27;ve bought, and looks adorable!</li>
            <li> It has tight fit as a headband.</li>
            <li> too tight didn&#x27;t go over my head to fit</li>
            <li> Other reviews told me that Rose Flower Elastic Hair Band would be a tight fit for an average head.  </li>
            <li> It might be good for a little girl however it is too tight for an adult.</li>
            <li> Because it was so tight I began to develop a headache and was only able to wear the headband for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I just have to make sure that my hair is pulled back tightly before I put the band on and then take my hair out once the band is in place.</li>
            <li> it did not even fit my little sisters hair</li>
            <li> so it would be very difficult to remove because my hair was all tied up but other than that its good and cute.</li>
            <li> but when I put this headband on it was really tight, It looks adorable but maybe for a 10 year old or something I thnik the sizing from where it was inported is a lot different from the US.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute, a little hard to wear, I don&#x27;t expect it to last to many</li>
            <li> I would be careful with it because it is a little fragile, but still, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how fast this shipped out to me from HK as it arrived about 2 weeks earlier than the estimated delivery date window.</li>
            <li> To prevent that I would suggest coating in clear finger nail polish.</li>
            <li> I was surprised the roses were kinda metal</li>
            <li> and so far the band has retained</li>
            <li> I was presently surprised with the quality of this headband.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see young niece and give it to her.  </li>
            <li> but so far ive worn it for 3 hours</li>
            <li> This headband is designed for a child, not an adult.</li>
            <li> It is delicate and lovely with the cut out roses.</li>
            <li> too cheap to even waste a dollar or your time on it.</li>
            <li> Light weight and fits firmly on my head...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;0&amp;#34; and very petite</li>
            <li> I gave it to my eight year old cousin</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 yr old daughter.  </li>
            <li> AT 64 HAIR JEWELRY BRINGS OUT THE 20 YR OLD</li>
            <li> My 7 year old wore it</li>
            <li> completely stuck to my hair</li>
            <li> this is not made for an adult head.</li>
            <li> Picture should be for a kid not an adult</li>
            <li> I completely forgot i had ordered it.</li>
            <li> I did not bother returning it since it would be a waste of time and money for something so cheap.</li>
            <li> Overall, very well made headband.</li>
            <li> This product surprised me.</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive, so i knew it would be low quality.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t be surprised for the price.</li>
            <li> Had to give it to my 2 year old niece and it barley fits her.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fall off and it stays in place, and I received it a week early.</li>
            <li> it was for an adult.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this for her 14th birthday from her 8 year old brother.</li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I wear a size L adult helmet.  </li>
            <li> do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> and I just tied a knot and fixed it.</li>
            <li> Just enough decoration not too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it twice so far</li>
            <li> So far I like.</li>
            <li> So professional.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $2 I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s alright and only worth a dollar but still a piece of cheap metal and</li>
            <li> Sad, glad they did the right thing by refunding me.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a a bigger head than most, but this head band is so tight!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is worth the price of the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable but it&#x27;s VERY small.</li>
            <li> and it is very cute just way too small for the average sized head.</li>
            <li> but my only problem with it is that you have to put it on using a particular side so it doesnt pull your hair because of the way the metal meets (or doesnt meet) in this case.</li>
            <li> I like it, the roses were just big enough without being obnoxious and it stayed in place pretty well.</li>
            <li> Probably I will give it to my 5.5 year old, maybe it will fit her small head.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this in the mail, but found that it was very small</li>
            <li> and I hurt a little bit when u wear it, but not bad.</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended especially for the matter of the price and the quality.</li>
            <li> It also came in a cute little bag that I use to keep loose change in.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I spent less than $2 on it.  </li>
            <li> breaks easily, also takes out hair when putting it on,  a waste of money, and also takes longer to do my hair than with a regular headband</li>
            <li> It is not as long as the picture makes it seem, but reasonable price</li>
            <li> Item is too small for adults and teens - may fit a baby.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too small for my head to be comfortable or to stay on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive looking and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> Its too small to fit around an adults head.</li>
            <li> This is too small that cant even fit a baby head .</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s too small to go on my head comfortably.</li>
            <li> I have a small head and it still barely fit.</li>
            <li> first use as its attachments are very loose.</li>
            <li> but apparently she must have a very small head because it&#x27;s more for kids.  </li>
            <li> It looks pretty but the metal clasps aren&#x27;t closed and smoothed all of the way, so it pulls on your hair a ton and is tricky to get into place.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really tight, &amp; i have a pretty normal sized head?</li>
            <li> Its very comfortable and tiny and delicate.</li>
            <li> im not mad or anything, i payed less that $2</li>
            <li> There were so many mixed reviews that it was hard to decided</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY THE NEW IMPROVED ONES.</li>
            <li> I bought this headband a few months ago, thinking it would be something cheap I&#x27;d wear occasionally.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s mixed with pretty long hair &amp; said it was just the thing she needed.</li>
            <li> I cannot wear this because it simply does not fit comfortably around my head.</li>
            <li> It is pretty but metal(the roses) is sharp and get stuck in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But you hair gets stuck between the roses and tugs if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
            <li> This looked pretty when arrived, but just like the other reviews it broke after 1st use</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again simply because it can take me a few tries to get it on my head right, and my hair is thin enough as it</li>
            <li> only problem is that the links catch in my hair so i have to get it right the first time i put it in, which rlly isnt that hard</li>
            <li> It just snapped right in half.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty to look at...runs small for an adult.  </li>
            <li> and I have had to re attach a few times but other than that it is currently my favorite hair accessory.</li>
            <li> super cheap and not worth the few cents spent on it.</li>
            <li> Fun little headband.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t worn it at all because of how hard it is to style it so it looks good :/</li>
            <li> Later, i tried it on that was hard to use, my hair got caught in it multiple times and even ripped a couple strands of my hairs, as cute as the headband is its a pain to get it on.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t adjust it or anything, at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because it looks delicate, but  it holds my medium course curly hair really well.</li>
            <li> This thing broke 2 days later, the elastic stretched out to much</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very flexable, and honestly the clasps holding the flowers together are just not good...</li>
            <li> I am an adult female.</li>
            <li> One of the links hooking the roses together popped open, I fixed it, but another one immediately broke.  </li>
            <li> The metal doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can barely feel it there.</li>
            <li> I tried to put it on, barely stretching it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful, your hair can get stuck in the roses and get pulled.</li>
            <li> but they should make these for head sizes bigger than a 7 year old.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair too much if I take it out carefully.</li>
            <li> I bought this headband not really expecting too much out of it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cost much, so I&#x27;m not really worried about it.</li>
            <li> Overall, pleasantly surprised and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so I barely wore it today.</li>
            <li> it comes 2 weeks after the delivery estimate, and on top of the extended wait i get it broken its a piece of trash</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really, really sad, because I liked the look of these on the page.</li>
            <li> I love the headband, but the elastic band has broken already and my hair tends to get stuck in the floral metal pieces.</li>
            <li> The reviews about it being small are unfortunately true.</li>
            <li> I was able to wear it for about 4 hours before I had to take if off because it was irritating me.</li>
            <li> It would nicely dress up someone&#x27;s attire without being flashy.</li>
            <li> It is well made and it looks so pretty with an up-do or with your hair down.</li>
            <li> This headband is very pretty &amp; doesn&#x27;t get caught in your hair, but the elastic is very tight on my scalp.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Takes a simple hairdo like a ponytail or just letting your hair down into a whole new level without any effort.</li>
            <li> The super long shipping time just makes it not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I chose this head piece because I wanted something a little more than just a band but with little bling.</li>
            <li> This one is super small.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair is stick straight and baby fine, so it doesn&#x27;t stay in unless I curl or braid my hair.</li>
            <li> Very small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty but it is waaaayyyyy too small.</li>
            <li> I was even extra careful with the second one because the first one broke</li>
            <li> at first i thought it was going to break because it was really tight</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit too tight on my head, but it&#x27;s so sturdy and pretty</li>
            <li> and it is pretty tight.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty tight on my head.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I tried to wear it, because it was way too tight.</li>
            <li> but if you want them for a special occasion allow at least a month or 2 processing and shipping time.</li>
            <li> only that it was super small like for a toddler</li>
            <li> It is clearly a child sized headband, it&#x27;s pretty cute but does me no good seeing as it won&#x27;t fit. :(</li>
            <li> It was cheaply made and not good quality.</li>
            <li> It broke not long after that.</li>
            <li> Uhhhh Its So Tiny Barely Fits My Head .</li>
            <li> It takes a LONG time to arrive (nearly 2 months)</li>
            <li> It was literally only in my hands intact for maybe a grand total of 30 seconds before it was broken and sliding out of my daughter head to the floor.</li>
            <li> It also changed colors in the first few days.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a smaller head, this headband is pretty tight.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think my head is really big, but when I first got this headband it was really tight on my head and the chain broke.</li>
            <li> I may just have a big head , it was pretty tight .</li>
            <li> It could be dressed up or down, which is very convenient</li>
            <li> It had flowers down the whole band, and broke as soon as I used it.</li>
            <li> It was so small that it would not have fit my 12 year old sister&#x27;s head, much less mine.</li>
            <li> one of those things that arrives in a strange little package from China (which I find exciting).</li>
            <li> I did try it on, its a little tight but it fits my head fine.</li>
            <li> I took it out of the bag it came in, put it on my teeny 5 year old daughter (as it is SO small, it could only fit a petite child), and the thing snapped in half...</li>
            <li> It changes color and it keeps on popping, but I wont say its a total waste of money because for the first fewdays I had it on</li>
            <li> The hair band is so pretty, I am surprised when I received cause of its delicate.</li>
            <li> The only down side is it&#x27;s very snug on my head.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I was very happy with its appearance</li>
            <li> It is just heavy enough to feel secure without weighing down my head.</li>
            <li> The elastic part was not long enough or stretchy enough.</li>
            <li> That said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this hair band for people with fine and/or thin hair.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my head, I don&#x27;t have an exceptionally large head</li>
            <li> Would not fit a large head and band is not too stretchy</li>
            <li> It is really cute, but it gets tangled in your hair and a little hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Very affordable gift for a little one in my life.  </li>
            <li> It does get a little caught in your hair at times but it really didnt pull my hair or break my hair.</li>
            <li> I think for how little  I spent, it&#x27;s totally worth my money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very pretty piece, but it gets stuck in my hair easily and hurts like crazy to get out!</li>
            <li> I like it very much not sure how long it will last since it seems a little un-sturdy...but has not broken</li>
            <li> It is cheap but too tight for me ,may be my head too big, so I cant use that no more.</li>
            <li> The band was small and tight enough to fit an infants head.</li>
            <li> My head is considered small, but the band was still a tight fit.  </li>
            <li> It barely fits my 9 year old daughter, and it definitely does not fit me.  </li>
            <li> have your hair be as flat as possible</li>
            <li> The metal was so thick and the headland was so small it wouldn&#x27;t even fit my 3 year old sister.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered it for Halloween, but the shipping process took way to long, so I had to buy a different one.</li>
            <li> So this really assists in those with shorter hair to add just a little bit of bling to their style!</li>
            <li> but it was pretty tight and after about an hour I had to take it off due to a headache.  </li>
            <li> Fits well, not too small not too large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually concerned with headbands being too large for my head</li>
            <li> It would be really cute but the elastic portion is so tight that the weak links between the metal part just bend and fall apart.</li>
            <li> The cons are that once its on it stays on when you remove it be vary careful because it will pull your hair not too much that it will hurt only it will mess up your hair design and have to start all over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little fragile so be careful stretching it too much</li>
            <li> Just a fun little hair accessory for a few different days but</li>
            <li> The very first time I went to wear it for school, it completely snapped and now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> its to small, it doesn&#x27;t really stretch.</li>
            <li> cheap and flimsy,too small for my head and usually things are too big for my head!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear headbands so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too</li>
            <li> Well I think I&#x27;ll save it for my daughter until she is 2 years old since it is not worth my time to return it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last since some buyers have claimed that this isn&#x27;t so durable</li>
            <li> I stretched it to put it on, and it instantly snapped!</li>
            <li> however, I dont know how long will it last.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it lasting long..</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAD SHORT HAIR OR LONG HAIR,</li>
            <li> I was being very careful in trying the headband out because I didn&#x27;t want it to break if I stretched it over my head too far.</li>
            <li> far as I am concerned, this was a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Total, complete junk and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend for someone with a smaller head (like a child) or not as much hair (I have thick hair).</li>
            <li> very pretty, but a little small on my head...</li>
            <li> This item is pretty, but it is sized very small.</li>
            <li> Pretty but runs very small</li>
            <li> Headband was very small, and broke upon first use.</li>
            <li> I hope it last for a while and doesn&#x27;t loose</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter gave up on it because it was too tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem is, the black elastic part of it is not nearly long enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tight, the clasps that holds the band to the roses have broken twice already but it was easy to reattach and the joints between the roses pull the hair a bit, but if you flip it around to the smoother side, hen the pulling isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> it looked cheap and when I put it  on it felt uncomfortable on my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty but no good as soon as you strech it to go over your head</li>
            <li> It snapped the second time I tried wearing it, so basically I only got to wear it once for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, but not worth it even so.</li>
            <li> it is smaller than expected and shown in the pictures...</li>
            <li> but I knocked off 1 star because it took so long.</li>
            <li> a long time to arrive&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> It would not fit my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive.  </li>
            <li> It barely stretched over my head and dug into my scalp.</li>
            <li> I waited so long for it</li>
            <li> i had a headache after wearing it too long.</li>
            <li> Also, the amount of time for delivery is so long, I had forgotten all about ordering it.</li>
            <li> The minute i stretched it to put it around my head</li>
            <li> I think that it got stretched over time and the color started to fade into this copper color.</li>
            <li> its been so long and still nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for a kid definitely not an adult sync</li>
            <li> I was looking for one like this for too long</li>
            <li> It is a bit to snug and I can&#x27;t wear for that long.</li>
            <li> (the pulling of the band being stretched).</li>
            <li> The only reason i ordered this is because i had only a few bucks left on my account and needed to spend it.</li>
            <li> I wore it for not that long</li>
            <li> Not by a long shot.  </li>
            <li> but this one can be in place all day long.</li>
            <li> The flowers are smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It was not clear what size it was.  </li>
            <li> It is a really pretty headbands but when I first got it it smells and felt very weird</li>
            <li> When purchasing this headband please take into consideration that the stretched out size of the band is smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> It was so inexpensive it was worth buying and taking the risk of it being broken.  </li>
            <li> only down side is that it hurts my head and gives me massive headaches when i wear it</li>
            <li> Very cheap tight to wear as a headband so uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a slight bit too big, but i just tied an extra knot onto it</li>
            <li> For the price I expected far less.</li>
            <li> This headband is super pretty wasn&#x27;t Disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> A little tight and the links between flowers are too tight or something, because it&#x27;s stiff and doesn&#x27;t move easily, and the elastic part was put on twisted (an easy fix by opening the fastening ring).</li>
            <li> The elastic part is too tight and what is holding the metal to the elastic is just a tiny ring that swings open when there is pressure</li>
            <li> it looks almost same like the picture but too tight for head and it broke in 2nd use.</li>
            <li> Metal is very sharp and coarse, also very thin and will break easily.</li>
            <li> With all headbands like this, just don&#x27;t leave them on for a long time!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure ill get a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even worn it due to the fact that it weighs like 2 lbs and looks completely different then</li>
            <li> It also arrived earlier than expected, not even after the estimated delivery date!</li>
            <li> You can layer the headband with other accessories actually.  </li>
            <li> THE BAND DID NOT HOLD FOR VERY LONG WHEN I OUT</li>
            <li> So I bought this a very long time ago that I had forgotten that I had bought it</li>
            <li> Only thing is it can get caught in ur hair a little:/ but not too bad:)</li>
            <li> Band too small for Adult Head.  </li>
            <li> I am a regular 19year old college student and Iam a size small in clothes and my head is average size</li>
            <li> I have an average Asian head</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable but adorable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> It still looks nice in copper, I&#x27;m just disappointed that it&#x27;s not the color that&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.  </li>
            <li> When I had first got it, one of the flowers petals was broken, and that was a downfall.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time finding headbands that don&#x27;t slide off my head after an hour or wear but this is the first one to stay in place!</li>
            <li> Goes well with hair up in a bun or loose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is too small or what, but the elastic doesn&#x27;t allow for much stretch, so a lot of stress is put on the little metal pieces and the links that hold the pieces together.  </li>
            <li> only sometimes your hair might get alittle tangled with the headband which can be annoying, but other than that, its really nice.</li>
            <li> it is very cute but very tight and almost impossible to get around my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing an updo where the front part of my hair is covered with some curls to hide the black band in the front and the back of my hair displays the flower pattern of the headband.  </li>
            <li> Only stretch the black elastic part, do not even touch the gold when you&#x27;re placing over your head.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The black elestic broke after the 3rd time i was wearing it.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this less than one star, considering I ordered back in November, but there it is.</li>
            <li> only negative I could say is the points on the roses do occasionally get caught in my hair, but I would think it would be the same with any other decorative headband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is cute, but it&#x27;s very delicate, and it gets caught in your hair, making it pretty painful to wear.</li>
            <li> Also, the tiny clips that connect the flowers catch on the hair, so they mess up hair while putting it on, and then pull hair while trying to take it off.</li>
            <li> The band was so tight, it felt like an instant headache.  </li>
            <li> I guess I have a big head or something because it felt really tight on my head.</li>
            <li> but this product is actually way too tight.</li>
            <li> but if it was a little bit bigger i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It does snag and tangle a little, so you have to be comitted before you put it on - especially if you don&#x27;t want to snag your up-do!</li>
            <li> Just enough to look a little done-up.</li>
            <li> Its starting to fade a little bit</li>
            <li> I had to physically fix every little clamp in it with some pliers.</li>
            <li> The headband looked a little different in person</li>
            <li> The moment I put it on, it just disintegrated and left little gold hooks all in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was a little too big for my head...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would like it if maybe it could come a little bigger</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to get a headband to stay in my hair properly without slipping off my head especially when bending &amp; working which is the reason I need a headband.  </li>
            <li> I would consider my head to be about average, or slightly larger than average, size.</li>
            <li> So far this sucks</li>
            <li> But be careful in which the way you grab it.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful with it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit tighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> I made adjustments to just be careful</li>
            <li> I could give this a minus star I would, JUNK</li>
            <li> wearable,, just be careful</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I suppose that was to be expected considering the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as securely closed as thy should be, which can lead to some annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be prepared to rip some of your hair out.</li>
            <li> went to put it on and the elastic band pulled out of the metal center clip, now its held together with a knot.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful to not tangle it in your hair</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not stay in place on my head so if you have straight, thin hair it probably wont stay.</li>
            <li> My sister broke it in a week, but I guess that is to be expected since she breaks stuff in weeks.</li>
            <li> I have to move it back a few times in the day.</li>
            <li> The item arrived as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> I did so carefully.</li>
            <li> It also tends to snag in hair, so you have to be really careful.  </li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive, but it is still irritating to not even get it.</li>
            <li> I ordered just be careful putting it on and taking it off</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so tight, it pushes the hair flat on your head.  </li>
            <li> But by the third wear, it broke in half!</li>
            <li> This headband is super thin and looks cheap :(</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or the ridiculously long wait!</li>
            <li> and no, my head is not large.</li>
            <li> it is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> It would probably fit a small child but may still be uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Tiny, cheap breakable rings attach each &amp;#34;flower&amp;#34; which all spread apart and broke when placed on the head. :(</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it took to long to get here.</li>
            <li> It was obviously made for someone with a smaller head than me, or at least less hair.</li>
            <li> It IS a little tight, I think I would recommend the seller include an extra gold ring to adjust the size if need be.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the other reviews/reviewers.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this for a small child..</li>
            <li> oh we&#x27;ll other</li>
            <li> I took the advice of the other reviewer.  </li>
            <li> so its only for people with small heads.</li>
            <li> This is sharp and your hair gets tangled up in it and you will lose hair when you take the headband off.</li>
            <li> Shipped sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive, and it&#x27;s a bit small, but I consider myself to have a big head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else has the same problem, or if it is just me.</li>
            <li> , yes would recommend to some friends with small heads, younger ages.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll reuse the roses to make some other type of jewelry.</li>
            <li> i just don&#x27;t have earings to match it with but other than that</li>
            <li> Have to look on line to see if there are other products from this line.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can give this to a friend or save it in case my other one breaks or something</li>
            <li> Other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Could not wear the headband, due to the cheapness it was made from.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear this for very long before it starts to hurt a little from being so snug.</li>
            <li> so I replaced those, but in between the flowers are pieces that hold the flowers together, and they cling to my hair, and I literally have to yank it out very carefully.</li>
            <li> very careful and check all part before trying it on.</li>
            <li> Was kinda hard to put on since the flowers are all chained together, like they turn one way while the other flower is going the opposite as you&#x27;re trying to put it on.</li>
            <li> this did not appear as shown in the picture the picture is of a flower made with material but the one that arrived was made with pure with metal so the picture is wrong</li>
            <li> I have a small head, and this headband was actually too tight for me; maybe it&#x27;s sized for a child?  </li>
            <li> It feels a little stronger then I expected.  </li>
            <li> The lacing was a little lighter than i expected but it is holding up.  </li>
            <li> it is just a little to small for my big head</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and hoped for something a little better.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would caution about it is that its a little small.</li>
            <li> It was a bit tight and I simply stretched it out a little before wearing since i get headaches from too tight of headbands.</li>
            <li> I thought because of its cheap price that the quality would be just as bad.</li>
            <li> really bad cheap material, as though it wasnt even meant to be worn.</li>
            <li> not worth returning for price.</li>
            <li> it is not worth it at all</li>
            <li> So not worth it.</li>
            <li> It was definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> Sucks to have a bigger head!</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> , i would expect it to at least last a couple of months</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable either.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s delicate, yet bold - but not too flashy.</li>
            <li> dress up or dress down.</li>
            <li> Can be dressed up or down.</li>
            <li> a little sharp don&#x27;t ripe hair when putting it on.</li>
            <li> , the only con is it is a little small, hopefully it will stretch a little after some wear.</li>
            <li> When i got it i was excited, but nervous upon reading the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> It broke really fast too which i was a little sad about, but hey you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> I wear it a few times a week and other people always compliment me on it.</li>
            <li> The elastic is not very strong.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical at first because people complain that it was too small.</li>
            <li> It took about a month and a half for the product to arrive.</li>
            <li> I wait almost a month for this product, and it breaks in half when I wear it.</li>
            <li> (Well, the elastic is still black.)  </li>
            <li> Not impressed, it was really small and broke first wear.</li>
            <li> It took over a month and  half to arrive to my door, and they fell apart before even wearing once.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind because I paid less than $2 for it</li>
            <li> But hey, what did you expect for less than a dollar?</li>
            <li> I want something with less fuss and pain.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to put it on it snapped in half.</li>
            <li> but it was the one with gold metal roses and a black elastic in the back).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It turned black ..</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different head bands lately</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have an odd shaped head, or what.  </li>
            <li> it is definitely way toooooo small, I have a small head ad it bearly fitted.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit :(</li>
            <li> when putting it on so it doesn&#x27;t snag and mess everything up.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit too tight</li>
            <li> Bought for myself but had to give to a child because it was so tight.</li>
            <li> I can get it on but it feels tight.</li>
            <li> Not too tight, so</li>
            <li> I did not find the headband to tear my hair and it is not too tight.</li>
            <li> The band is so tight that it keeps sliding off my head.</li>
            <li> like I wanted to cause it fits to tight.</li>
            <li> It was WAY too tight.</li>
            <li> But Kinda Tight.</li>
            <li> it was too tight on the head and it broke after wearing it for a day.</li>
            <li> its extremely tight.</li>
            <li> A lot of times headbands are tight on me</li>
            <li> A bit tight on my head</li>
            <li> It is waaaay too tight to get around your head.</li>
            <li> But when my wife wore it she said it was too tight ( she is not pumpkin headed )</li>
            <li> but it is so tight it will break and is unfixable or will give you headache.</li>
            <li> So tight.  </li>
            <li> but it was to tight around my head</li>
            <li> I put it on and immediately had to take it off because it was way too tight.</li>
            <li> it is really tight</li>
            <li> then my head starts hurting... from how tight it is.</li>
            <li> and EXTREMELY tight on your head.</li>
            <li> Its also too tight.</li>
            <li> it was so tight</li>
            <li> It is tight and does not move once in place.</li>
            <li> It is way too tight to wear.</li>
            <li> Well , it was sorta tight on my head.</li>
            <li> I know the hairband should be tight so that it can hold the hair.  </li>
            <li> However, this one is waaay tooo tight.  </li>
            <li> It looks like the picture and it fits tightly around your head.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mean to rate of course since I have nothing to review after I waited sooo long</li>
            <li> Its a little tight on my head</li>
            <li> However, it is a little tight and the metallic roses pull on the hair when the headband is being taken off.</li>
            <li> It is really tight and I am hoping it will loosen up a little</li>
            <li> The band is a little to tight for the head and it snapped as I was putting it on.</li>
            <li> ( i have to say it is a little tight</li>
            <li> The headband is a little tight, but it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless your head is the size of a Barbie doll, don&#x27;t waste your money, because it won&#x27;t fit. :-(</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t anticipate the fact that my hair would get caught in the little grooves by the metal roses.  </li>
            <li> The little clasps holding each gold piece together just broke.</li>
            <li> Neither me nor my little sister could get it over our heads.</li>
            <li> This is meant for little girls I think.  </li>
            <li> The little flower shapes came off.</li>
            <li> Maybe meant for a little girl?</li>
            <li> the little flowers bend and get stuck because they are metal like</li>
            <li> All those little links snag your hair both putting it on, and taking it off.</li>
            <li> Little did I know that the chains that connected the flowers got stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of giving this to my little cousin because I&#x27;m never wearing this again.</li>
            <li> So they sent me the uglier headband, instead of the one with little flowers all connected.</li>
            <li> A little advice for you</li>
            <li> Got one for all the little girls in my family.</li>
            <li> The metal links catch in my hair a little, but that is the nature of metal hair accessories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned it will slide out of our hair.</li>
            <li> All the little flowers can get tangled in your hair when you are trying to take it out.</li>
            <li> This item is well past due and did not arrive.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this item, but disappointed</li>
            <li> took a little while to get it, but it did come from out of the U.S.  </li>
            <li> it was short like for children and wouldve been rediculously tight if it hadnt broken.</li>
            <li> Totally waste of money, however little amount.  </li>
            <li> I waited for over a month to get it, and paid very little but definitely not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I have fixed it at least 6 times now and it has broken every time.</li>
            <li> I have gotten quite a few compliments on it already.</li>
            <li> I got quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> but i like the design, can not wear it as it does not fit my head</li>
            <li> so she kept asking everyday when the mail came if they were here.</li>
            <li> It was packaged neatly and I got it a few days before the deadline.</li>
            <li> I probably wear this headband everyday of the summer.</li>
            <li> Totally a waste of money, won&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product did not fit my head.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A FEW TIMES.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I have really short thin hair</li>
            <li> However, if you are in a rush, this is not the hair band for you as it does take a few weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like it will fall apart after a few times of using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money on this like I did.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it..</li>
            <li> DONT EVEN WASTE .99 cents.  </li>
            <li> It was made with flimsy material and it was a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> could dress up a messy hair style.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few head bands online and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> Product came via postal service ~ when I open it, it is already broken ( the chain )</li>
            <li> Too small for my average size head.</li>
            <li> I got it in yesterday but the thing that sucks is that you have to be really careful in how you put it on</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t waste a penny on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought a few months ago but it changed colors.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on money on this.</li>
            <li> I saw this after a few months.</li>
            <li> It goes with everything I wear and the product is not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> it was way too tight and hurt to wear for longer than 20 minutes or so, and when i tried stretching it to put it on it ripped and snapped in my face, not cool :/</li>
            <li> complete waste of money, its for very small head and very delicate.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to put it on my head the black band broke!</li>
            <li> Elastic is very thin and doesn&#x27;t stretch far.</li>
            <li> the metal is a stiff and gets caught in your hair, plus it smells like bronze.</li>
            <li> For sprucing up a plain bun or ponytail, this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quite tight (and I have a small head)&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was so small and tight for my head.</li>
            <li> it was way to small and tight, and it gets stuck to your hair since it has metal pieces.</li>
            <li> This headband is so small for anyone&#x27;s head and way to tight.</li>
            <li> The size is a bit small and it fits tight around my head.</li>
            <li> Also it is a bit small and is a tight squeeze.</li>
            <li> It would be 4 stars except for the fact that it is a bit small, so you have to be careful not to break it, it is delicate.</li>
            <li> but it is a little small for my head,</li>
            <li> It does run just a little small.  </li>
            <li> It looked a little small</li>
            <li> I guess it was a little too small</li>
            <li> It was a little small for my head though.</li>
            <li> Just a little small for my head</li>
            <li> Both snapped in half the first time I tried to use them :(</li>
            <li> It was so tight when I extended it on to my head!</li>
            <li> It was still too tight!</li>
            <li> The headband fell apart as soon as I got it and way too tight for head!</li>
            <li> Gluing it together proved pointless because when it dried</li>
            <li> I usually have trouble getting hair accessories to stay in my head</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, but it was pretty.</li>
            <li> These little flowers are made of metal and they get stuck in your hair the second you try and put it on, they get all twisted up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very tight.</li>
            <li> and it is very tight on my head...</li>
            <li> The elastic is very tight and does not stretch well.  </li>
            <li> but this head band was very tight.</li>
            <li> and then right as i was about to place it in my hair it broke :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as it is cute.</li>
            <li> I rated 4 star because it is a little bit hard to wear on head.  </li>
            <li> However, the elastic part is quite small and it is very tight on my head.  </li>
            <li> It did arrive a little late</li>
            <li> Avoid it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Price seem to be very little.</li>
            <li> and then the other side broke when i was just holding it!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small for head.</li>
            <li> Bear in mind, though, that it is quite small.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> but it was small and the flowers get caught in your hair.</li>
            <li> so if i were you i would put that it is small.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> it was to small for my head.</li>
            <li> It was too small.</li>
            <li> and it literally was so small</li>
            <li> It must be for a child, it&#x27;s too small.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if to recommed this.</li>
            <li> This headband is way too small.</li>
            <li> but its way too small..</li>
            <li> When I received it the headband was really small.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it was also sort of small on my head..</li>
            <li> this was not safe  metal to wear</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> It was so small that I couldn&#x27;t even get it around my head.</li>
            <li> it was so small ...</li>
            <li> Then a different area broke and I was unable to repair it.</li>
            <li> It is heavy though, and you may want to take it off slowly if you want to prevent pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> Its for small heads .</li>
            <li> I hope this helps, if anyone is not sure it will work.</li>
            <li> and I have small head.</li>
            <li> It was also to small.</li>
            <li> but it is still small.  </li>
            <li> The product is really small, i think this was meant for a child or someone with a really small head</li>
            <li> I was not pleased at all in the headband</li>
            <li> I think it was made in china where humans are small though</li>
            <li> All elastic headbands usually are..</li>
            <li> Way too small.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t even expand it past my eyes before it snapped.</li>
            <li> The headband is just way too small.</li>
            <li> It is not more than it purports to be.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it was quite small, so I knew it would give me a headache.</li>
            <li> However it is too small to go around my head.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t suggest it to anyone, its a waste of a dollar!</li>
            <li> but it was too small for my head.</li>
            <li> but it broke the first time she used it :(</li>
            <li> Or it is too small?</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Not sure if buying from again</li>
            <li> I usually get an opportunity to contact the seller, but that didn&#x27;t come up this time, so I can&#x27;t say if there would be redress.</li>
            <li> I hhave a small head.</li>
            <li> The clasps that join each little flower are open clasps that catch your hair and make it a very difficult mess to get off.</li>
            <li> after a long wait period for shipping i was disappointed by the smaller size of the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First it is small and hard to put on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very bad quality and it got broken second time I was trying to wear it...very high price for a disposable item!</li>
            <li> It was just so awful because it broke easily.</li>
            <li> I pulled on it too hard and the chain had become lose and fell apart in one spot.</li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s defense I pulled on it a bit hard and the chain didn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> With my fine,thin hair it&#x27;s hard to find a hair accessory that doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put on as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get it to stretch around my head and will leave flower imprints on my skin if it&#x27;s sitting on skin.</li>
            <li> it is hard material</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put on and that&#x27;s probably why it broke.  </li>
            <li> I found it was hard to put on</li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that the flowers are hard metal and hurts to put on the head, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> so hard to even rate</li>
            <li> Buy two and put two together if you are hard up for buying this.</li>
            <li> Hard to get over your head just to get it on as a headband.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE THIN AND FLIMSY</li>
            <li> it sucks</li>
            <li> Disappointing that I could only wear it once</li>
            <li> This really sucks because I orderd this around september 9....</li>
            <li> I filed a complaint about a week after I was supposed to get it.</li>
            <li> I think that if you bought this in a box store, you would pay at least triple</li>
            <li> read the negative reviews before you buy.</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile my hair tangles in it and that sucks.</li>
            <li> pping sucks thats all I can say for now.</li>
            <li> But honestly, I never would have put this in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Its not cheap thin metal.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine how this would work with thick, or curly hair.</li>
            <li> the metals thick and well made.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MY MONEY!!</li>
            <li> If you have a small head then it may work for you!</li>
            <li> It arrived in a very small package from china.</li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable to wear and it broke the second time I tried to use it</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> It runs very small with not a lot of give.</li>
            <li> It was for a very small head.</li>
            <li> This head piece was very small and the gold roses dig into your scalp.</li>
            <li> It was very very small aswell</li>
            <li> but it was just made very small</li>
            <li> I was only try to wearing and was impossible never again</li>
            <li> The product is pretty much useless now... disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit tight and uncomfortable on my head and pulls my hair</li>
            <li> , it wraps really tight around your head which makes it uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I can get it on, but I take it off within minutes because it gives me such a bad headache.  </li>
            <li> It kept sliding backwards which does me not good.  </li>
            <li> the quality is not really good.</li>
            <li> Also the band is twisted, but its not a huge problem because no one will see it anyways.</li>
            <li> It was not very stretchy and was very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I would give it negative stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I want my money back</li>
            <li> This thing was so small and so tight that it was painful.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s elastic and try very hard not to pull on the metal.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be giving it to my 5 year old niece rather than keeping it even though I wanted to wear it so badly!</li>
            <li> ~ so disappointing .&lt;br /&gt;Also too tight.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!  </li>
            <li> It was way too small!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m unhappy and a little pissed.</li>
            <li> Plus the metal is poor quality</li>
            <li> how disappointing and a waste of money....</li>
            <li> poorly made.</li>
            <li> When I received this item is was broken.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It lost 2 stars for it being broken.</li>
            <li> but hate how it tangles in my hair and very fragile and it gives me that worry &amp;#34;hope</li>
            <li> the headband came broken.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was not happy with mine at all.</li>
            <li> In addition to that, it was broken with pieces of it hanging off.</li>
            <li> , worse comes to worse</li>
            <li> I was expecting the metal to be thin</li>
            <li> This hair band is poorly crafted.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> AND it was broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this transaction</li>
            <li> Either the shipping will take forever, or it will be poorly made, etc.</li>
            <li> The headband itself was really hard to put on and was tight on my head :(</li>
            <li> the flowers have little medal prongs that get stuck and tangled in your hair and it hurts really  bad .lol</li>
            <li> Even on small heads, does not fit well, hair gets caught in the flowers on the band frequently, very painful.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received the headband and attempted to wear it, it snapped in half.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I recommend buying from a different seller.</li>
            <li> uses, and it&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Cause your wrong.</li>
            <li> It is what it is, nothing too complicated here.  </li>
            <li> ITS LOOKS EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> but mine unfortunately broke when putting it on</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad, but for the price what can I expect,</li>
            <li> but when I slid it on I was unable to adjust because of the bars that hold the flowers together.</li>
            <li> Since I have shorter hair, adding style to my hair can well, be difficult.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all!!!!</li>
            <li> They put the WRONG pic up</li>
            <li> Looks expensive but isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is very poorly made don&#x27;t order this</li>
            <li> When I got it, I seen that it was very thin, I put it on my head and it snapped.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> the band at the base of this is very, very stiff and the jump rings catch the hair.</li>
            <li> so it was so tight that is was very painful and couldn&#x27;t wear.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid of putting it on and breaking it</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about purchasing this product because I was afraid that the flowers would get caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> If not, im afraid the metal part will snap from the pressure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly afraid to put this on...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t pull at the hair like I was afraid it might</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be mad, it was crazy inexpensive.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so mad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry to have to report this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically impossible to wear.</li>
            <li> I, honestly, expected it to be terrible quality, but it is not(:&lt;br /&gt;you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I though some users just had bad luck.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> It makes any outfit of bad hair day look like a purposeful hairstyle.</li>
            <li> but this was painful to put on.</li>
            <li> The quality of this accessory shocked me.</li>
            <li> when I got it, it totally shocked me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I opened the package and pulled out the headband, I was shocked at the quality.</li>
            <li> This is extremely disappointing!</li>
            <li> Not too sturdy and a bit disappointed with the quality</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know what to do with it now :(</li>
            <li> And for the price you&#x27;d be crazy not to buy it!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> sadly disappointed that this piece never came, it might eventually.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to put it around my head, it snapped and broke :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy!  </li>
            <li> But I hate when it gets tangled in my hair or when I go to take it off my hair gets pulled out :(</li>
            <li> very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Took forever to come in the mail and when it did it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> i hate it.</li>
            <li> This head band is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>

            <li> Ordered this and got a completely different product!</li>
            <li> This is actually made of metal, which I had read the description well enough but I adore it all the more. Its very comfortable and tiny and delicate. Very femine I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a all fabric headband.. I was surprised the roses were kinda metal... looks like its gonna  be durable. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it... I love it</li>
            <li> I love it,my mom loves it, everyone that sees me wears it loves it! Its sturdy and doesnt slip off your head and i  just feel so cute wearing it</li>
            <li> I actually didnt expect much because it was so cheap, but i was surprised at the quality and how pretty it was! its just like the pictures</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s classic and timeless. I have gotten quite a few compliments on it already. Lays nicely and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have a small head, and this headband was actually too tight for me; maybe it&#x27;s sized for a child?  Also, though it&#x27;s pretty, the flowers are very fine and my hair got tangled in them every time I tried to wear it.</li>
            <li> Was a really great buy for this price, I may have even bought it for more money! No reason to doubt this product! With all headbands like this, just don&#x27;t leave them on for a long time! Good, good buy!</li>
            <li> I am INLOVE with it! It is so cute, and looks IDENTICAL to the picture! It would look good with your hair up or down! Such a nice fashion accessory for your hair!!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I received this headband just 2 weeks after I ordered it. First off, this headband is so cute and can go with anything. The quality is amazing for its&#x27; price and it is extremely comfortable. It could be dressed up or down, which is very convenient and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it. I highly recommend this product to anyone!! :)</li>
            <li> Exactly like the item described, great for the price!! I will be throwing this in my hair soon! And it came way before it said it would arrive!</li>
            <li> Cute, inexpensive hair band for the price. Nice stocking stuffer or small gift. Certainly not a quality gift, but good for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a very dainty pretty head band I purchased two one for me and one for my daughter we love it.</li>
            <li> It took about two weeks for the order to arrive.. But I am very satisfied with the headband:) it&#x27;s beautiful and very sturdy for the very low price I paid:)) I love it! It&#x27;s fashionable and the gold doesn&#x27;t look cheap, and it doesn&#x27;t slip from your head! Haven&#x27;t worn it out in public yet but I&#x27;m sure ill get a lot of compliments! Definitely will purchase more!</li>
            <li> the product broke at the moment of use unacceptable I was only try to wearing and was impossible never again</li>
            <li> I thought it might stick to my hair but it doesn&#x27;t at all.  It&#x27;s super cute, light weight and easy to put in and take off.</li>
            <li> I bought this headband a few months ago, thinking it would be something cheap I&#x27;d wear occasionally. Since I&#x27;ve received it, I&#x27;ve been wearing it multiple times a week! I love it. The design is adorable and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap. Almost every time I wear it I&#x27;ll get a compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I buy headbands with the elastic band, it will stretch out and grow too large for my head. I&#x27;ve had it for months and so far the band has retained it&#x27;s shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I could say is the points on the roses do occasionally get caught in my hair, but I would think it would be the same with any other decorative headband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an extremely cheap investment for such a nice accessory.</li>
            <li> well it hasnt broke as many reviewers have mentioned, maybe they stretched out the whole thing but its nice. i will go over it with some clear top coat to seal the color and not get that greenish color thru&#x27; time. it is not  that goldish color you would get like from goldish jewelry you would buy at  charlotte russe but its still nice</li>
            <li> I was presently surprised with the quality of this headband. It&#x27;s super cute and great for those days to push your hair back, like at the beach.</li>
            <li> It looks so nice and fancy! I love it. Great for casual wear and dressing up. Wish they had more!</li>
            <li> Soooo pretty in my hair. So dainty and sweet looking. Goes well with hair up in a bun or loose. I would recommend this item, love it!</li>
            <li> It came right before the exact shipping date (: and also I tried it on &amp; it looks so cute and new but when I try to put it on it gets caught on my hair and that&#x27;s a bother.</li>
            <li> its an ok hair product every time i put it on my hair it seems to go back after a while.</li>
            <li> The hair band looks like in the picture. It barely fits around my whole head. I use it as a hair tie instead or around a bun. Looks a bit fragile. It is not as long as the picture makes it seem, but reasonable price</li>
            <li> This was pretty, and a good price, but the first time I put it on it broke. Guess I didn&#x27;t pull it on in a certain way. My daughter loves hers and wears it all the time</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because it looks delicate, but  it holds my medium course curly hair really well. I also love the color.</li>
            <li> The metallic sweet lady hollow rose flower elastic hair band was not up to my expectations. The bank broke the first time I put it in my hair. Very cheaply made</li>
            <li> This is a cute headband, its pretty comfortable but my hair got stuck in like the openings so it would be very difficult to remove because my hair was all tied up but other than that its good and cute.</li>
            <li> I like the design and the way it looks but it&#x27;s a bit too tight and I&#x27;m afraid of putting it on and breaking it so I only wore it once.</li>
            <li> Great price, shipped fast, super cute! This is a great buy! I wear it across my forehead like a hippie head band :) lol</li>
            <li> but it would not stay on my head.  It kept sliding backwards which does me not good.  I could wear it hippie style around my forehead!</li>
            <li> This is actually really nice! I thought I&#x27;d regret this purchase because it was so inexpensive...&lt;br /&gt;Takes a simple hairdo like a ponytail or just letting your hair down into a whole new level without any effort. Fits tight so it doesn&#x27;t slide out of my head, and the golden color of the (very cute) flower design, really pops out over my brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like it...a lot..</li>
            <li> Band too small for Adult Head.  Maybe child&#x27;s size.  Waiting to see young niece and give it to her.  Not even sure it will fit her.  If not.... Into the trash.</li>
            <li> It was exactly like it said in the ad. It came on time and I had no problems. I enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li> Bought for myself but had to give to a child because it was so tight. Also some of the roses were bent.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly on my head. I was a bit worried about purchasing this product because I was afraid that the flowers would get caught in my hair. Never happened!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this headband! I usually have a hard time finding headbands that don&#x27;t slide off my head after an hour or wear but this is the first one to stay in place! It looks great with my blonde hair and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair. Wish I could find it in another design.</li>
            <li> I love this so cute! But be careful in which the way you grab it.  If you pull on the flowers while putting it on it will brake.  So Make sure when you put it on pull on the elastics.  It should not brake then.  I really like this it&#x27;s so cute!</li>
            <li> meant for a smaller head, I ended up attaching another elastic (about 4&amp;#34;) in order to get it to fit around my head comfortably. I really like the headband it&#x27;s just too small</li>
            <li> This product is super cute but it is a little small for my head, but then again it could be just me. Other than that this headband is super cute!</li>
            <li> Great item and is very cute to wear with many different outfits and items. I would wear with almost anything.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price</li>
            <li> Not so cute when just holding it but put with a hair style its cute. Just be careful with it. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hold up.</li>
            <li> so i got it today it did take a while but i love it! at first i thought it was going to break because it was really tight but it fit just fine (thats what he said) anyways i totally recommend getting this its so beautiful and stays on just fine cause usually when i wear headband bands they slip off in like 5 minutes but so far ive worn it for 3 hours and i havent felt it move a bit love this so much</li>
            <li> I got this for my niece&#x27;s birthday.  She&#x27;s 12yrs, it fits her great and she really liked it.  We did have to pin around the band to hold in place</li>
            <li> looks very pretty, was surprised how pretty it looks in person. i love it and cant wait to grow my hair out to wear it!</li>
            <li> The fit isn&#x27;t great, but I didn&#x27;t break or get caught on my hair. Overall, I am content with the purchase</li>
            <li> I love this hair band . it&#x27;s really cute and adds a sweet feeling to any outfit. I love wearing it. However the metal is a bit soft, so be gentle with it. I pulled on it too hard and the chain had become lose and fell apart in one spot. In it&#x27;s defense I pulled on it a bit hard and the chain didn&#x27;t break so I was able to just clamp it back together . I will probably get another one soon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;re supposed to put this in your hair without breaking it. It&#x27;s too small for head. I&#x27;ll probably end up replacing the rubber-band with a ribbon or something else.</li>
            <li> I like the band but I think it&#x27;s made more for a child. It&#x27;s very tight. I can get it on but it feels tight. I think it would probably fir one of my nieces better.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is very cute and I do love the look of it.</li>
            <li> This is very beautiful,but that is metal，When i bought this hair band,I don&#x27;t know.so I feel regert now，If the hair band is not metal ,that is very good for me</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how fast this shipped out to me from HK as it arrived about 2 weeks earlier than the estimated delivery date window. So bonus points for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the color was slightly off from what I was expecting, instead of a gold color, it was more of a burnt bronze color? But that wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me as it still looks super cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in general pretty good quality I&#x27;d say but the second time I wore it, the jump ring connecting the elastic band and the floral bits snapped open. It was a pretty easy fix as I just had to rehook everything and clamp the ring closed again, so again NBD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am pretty satisfied for this product as it is super cute, shipped out super fast, is pretty good quality and was under $1 when I bought it. Def beats the $5+ it costs at F21. :)</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 2 girls and they love it!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived much quicker than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had been available in silver too</li>
            <li> I like it i think it is pretty it is just a little to small for my big head but if it was a little bit bigger i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The elastic of this one it&#x27;s just perfect for me, cause it&#x27;s not so tight and it feels comfortable! It&#x27;s gold like color!</li>
            <li> When I read through the reviews I though some users just had bad luck. But I realized the band is CHEAP! As soon as I tried to put it on my head the black band broke! This is extremely disappointing! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s the best my friends like it and my mom? I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this piece of trash it comes 2 weeks after the delivery estimate, and on top of the extended wait i get it broken its a piece of trash i my dollar and 30 cents went to low lives who dont know what the meaning of quality is.</li>
            <li> The hair band wouldn&#x27;t fit and broke while I was trying to put it on. It was not very stretchy and was very uncomfortable.  Maybe it would have worked for a child....</li>
            <li> Took forever to get them but I ordered several and had them shipped to daughter&#x27;s house for her and multiple granddaughters and everyone seems to like them. Certainly the price is great and the product is fine. They&#x27;re pretty. Packaged fine.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them but if you want them for a special occasion allow at least a month or 2 processing and shipping time.</li>
            <li> This Elastic Hair Band is really nice. It is lightweight and fit well. Not too tight, so no headache. I am an adult female. I got quite a few compliments. Dresses up an outfit easilly.</li>
            <li> Looks nice have not used it yet, wish it came in silver as well, cant wait to wear it soon</li>
            <li> after a long wait period for shipping i was disappointed by the smaller size of the product. it is smaller than expected and shown in the pictures... but i like the design, can not wear it as it does not fit my head, can not return because the seller shipped it all the way from china.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, however, I think it would work better on a child, its way too small for me to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these for my daughters for  Christmas. The oldest one knew I ordered them so she kept asking everyday when the mail came if they were here.</li>
            <li> this iten is exactly what i wanted but it took over a month to recieve it but all  in all happy with my gold head band</li>
            <li> eh&lt;br /&gt;its okay&lt;br /&gt;small&lt;br /&gt;i feel like it wil break if i stretch it&lt;br /&gt;its good if you want something cheap and dont care about</li>
            <li> i love this headband. i was skeptical at first because people complain that it was too small. but mine fits perfectly!! i love this and wish that there were other designs or colors.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom because she loves headbands... she loved it so much I got her a second one.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, and it appears to be well made. Bear in mind, though, that it is quite small. My 7 year old daughter gave up on it because it was too tight.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute, a little hard to wear, I don&#x27;t expect it to last to many uses, and it&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Love it! I wear it as a headband and it really stands out.  It&#x27;s a bit tight, the clasps that holds the band to the roses have broken twice already but it was easy to reattach and the joints between the roses pull the hair a bit, but if you flip it around to the smoother side, hen the pulling isn&#x27;t a problem.  The price was fantastic and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> I love how this hair band stays in place all day without slipping out. With my fine,thin hair it&#x27;s hard to find a hair accessory that doesn&#x27;t fall out. It keeps my hair pulled back and I love the shiny, gold roses. It&#x27;s so pretty and elegant. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a hair band that acually stays in place without ripping your hair out! ;)</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I tried to place on head. Never been told I have large head. Never had hairbrand of mine break so quickly. I f I would have seen this in store I would have not purchased it.</li>
            <li> the band at the base of this is very, very stiff and the jump rings catch the hair. It&#x27;s better to replace the band with bobby pins and pin into place.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received the headband and attempted to wear it, it snapped in half. It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> i like it and it fit as expected really recomend it to people who are looking for something cute to wear</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t fit any grown-up&#x27;s head that I know of. It does fit my toddler, though! Otherwise it is OK...one of those things that arrives in a strange little package from China (which I find exciting). I kept it in the plastic bag it came into use as geocache swag. Ideal!</li>
            <li> This product broke on the first use.  It must be made for infant size heads.  The clasp that hook the flowers together come of easily and one went flying when I tried it on.  Glad I only paid a dollar.</li>
            <li> Metal is very sharp and coarse, also very thin and will break easily. Elastic is very thin and doesn&#x27;t stretch far.</li>
            <li> great product - fun and works well with everything - do recommend it................ i dont know what else to say</li>
            <li> I really like it. I just got it today and I absolutely love it! I&#x27;m taking so many pictures haha  :D</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to wear this, it broke. One of the links hooking the roses together popped open, I fixed it, but another one immediately broke.  It also gets tangled in your hair really easily.  It&#x27;s pretty small too, and when you try stretching it, you know, like a headband, the links between the roses pop open and go flying. It&#x27;s basically impossible to wear.</li>
            <li> Looks like something out of gumball machine and just as crappy.  Elastic band does not stretch very far at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice headband really but it was small and the flowers get caught in your hair. so if i were you i would put that it is small. it did not even fit my little sisters hair it literally ripped her hair out which i did not like</li>
            <li> This product IMMEDIATELY broke and pieces went flying before I could even put it on my head.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!  I would give it negative stars if I could!</li>
            <li> broke right after I took it out of the package. not worth returning for price. very unhappy. I was so excited for this one</li>
            <li> It is so pretty and the quality is great the only thing is it gets stuck in my hair when I try to take it off but still worth the money even though it was not expensive vary happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I bought this, and wasn&#x27;t really pleased with it :/ I was hoping it would be cute to wear to dress up a messy bun for school, but it gets all stuck in your hair and pulls your hair, I haven&#x27;t worn it at all because of how hard it is to style it so it looks good :/</li>
            <li> I ordered this headband in the end of August, I got it 3 weeks later. Its free shipping but I knocked off 1 star because it took so long. The headband is exactly what is pictured. Its so cute. Its a little tight on my head so I wrapped the two bands around a can to stretch it out and it worked. Its really cute. And made good. Its not cheap thin metal. The roses are strong. I love it and hope it lasts a long time. If not it was only $1. I think I&#x27;ll buy a few more anyways. Thank You</li>
            <li> This is a very great piece for the money. I would buy it again! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it to my sisters wedding</li>
            <li> I bought this and got some compliments the first time I wore it. The second time it broke. Cheap piece. Not very comfortable either. Save yourmoney.</li>
            <li> This headband gets stuck in your hair &amp; pulls your hair. This can&#x27;t be wore unless you want your hair pulled out! Plus the metal is poor quality</li>
            <li> For the couple bucks I paid for this, it&#x27;s really cute. It does snag and tangle a little, so you have to be comitted before you put it on - especially if you don&#x27;t want to snag your up-do! The quality is typical of any low-end costume jewelry, but I think it will hold up just fine.</li>
            <li> great headband takes along time for them to come in but is well worth the wait annd last along time</li>
            <li> So I just received this head band today.  I love the look of it..but I didn&#x27;t anticipate the fact that my hair would get caught in the little grooves by the metal roses.  I&#x27;ll have to master how to put it on without pulling out my hair.  Its a very pretty headband...and should not be worn with curly hair.  I will have to straighten mines and then wear  it out.  I wish the shipping was faster but for this price I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> Product received as promised by promised date. No complaints or defects to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item does catch on hair because of the chain-link style of the flowers. I don&#x27;t think that can be avoided and it&#x27;s not bad if you are careful about removing it from your head.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my head might be a smidgen too big as it has a tendency to slide back as I wear it.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to put it on, it broke. The little clasps holding each gold piece together just broke. A little disappointed, but it was pretty. Make sure you have a small head I guess?? lol</li>
            <li> Other reviews told me that Rose Flower Elastic Hair Band would be a tight fit for an average head.  My head is considered small, but the band was still a tight fit.  I gave it to my granddaughter.  It is very pretty.  It would be a good idea to have a second person near buy to help straighten the individual flower pieces which tend to turn various directions.</li>
            <li> This broke right away bc it was to small for my head. I still love it -I just tied off the elastic which gave me extra length and wore it- looks good as a flat necklace as well</li>
            <li> Guess you get what u pay for. This headband is designed for a child, not an adult. It was too small.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this headband, which I still think is pretty. However, I don&#x27;t understand how adults can wear this all day without getting a headache. It feels like it&#x27;d suit younger kids&#x27; head size...</li>
            <li> It is a very beautiful headband but I couldn&#x27;t get it to fit on my head. I needs to be bigger. It would probably fit a 7  year old but that is it. Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> the quality is not really good. I bought for several days，now it already lost. anyway, i don&#x27;t like it. aa</li>
            <li> this is very nice actually bettter then what picture show its nice and strong.nicely made and the metal dont get tangle in hair</li>
            <li> I really love it, i get so many compliments when wearing it. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It&#x27;s totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Very cute! however, hair may get caught between the loops. It does stay in place. But not worth more than a $1</li>
            <li> I love this head band. It is delicate and lovely with the cut out roses. I did not find the headband to tear my hair and it is not too tight. It is well made and it looks so pretty with an up-do or with your hair down. It shipped super fast. I am 100 percent happy with this elegant headband! Gorgeous simply gorgeous! Thank You for this high quality product!</li>
            <li> I received the headband in the mail as I was walking out the door to an event. I entered the car and as soon as I ATTEMPTED to put the headband on it popped and bounced off two of my windows. Tragic! Save your money people!!!!</li>
            <li> doesnt even fit its too big!!! i hate it. i want my money back okay... u better give me my money back!!1</li>
            <li> Love this little elastic hair band.  It feels a little stronger then I expected.  I truly love it and everyone comments on it positively!</li>
            <li> Item as described was scared i wouldnt like it but it fits great perfect headband I love the roses ordering some for my daughters</li>
            <li> It is a lot better quality than I expected. It however is the size to fit a small child, and will not even fit around my head.</li>
            <li> I got this headband in the mail and as soon as I took it out the package and pulled on the band it broke. Not too sturdy and a bit disappointed with the quality but like I said you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i got this and it literally was so small I couldn&#x27;t even wear it, and neither could my cousin who is 6! its a rip off</li>
            <li> I am speechless about this product!!!! It was packaged neatly and I got it a few days before the deadline. I probably wear this headband everyday of the summer. It&#x27;s really really nice to pull my hair back because its so so hot and this headband did that! It&#x27;s also very flexible and well adjust to your head if you want to wear it hippie style to! It broke 1 time but was super easy to fix and never broke again! Love this product so so much and would definitely purchase over and over again!!!!</li>
            <li> It must be for a child, it&#x27;s too small.  It was not clear what size it was.  It should have stated a size.</li>
            <li> Looks great and my daughter loved it.  The lacing was a little lighter than i expected but it is holding up.  For the price you can no beat it and it shipped in a timely mannor.</li>
            <li> Ordered it over a month ago and never got it.... how disappointing and a waste of money.... dont bother buying..</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying it for my self but my daughter has it and wont give it back.  She loves it worth the money!</li>
            <li> Rose detail was ok, but only tried twice and the band broke. Totally a waste of money, won&#x27;t recommend to anyone. Enough said.</li>
            <li> This is a great headband for the price! Unfortunately my hair is stick straight and baby fine, so it doesn&#x27;t stay in unless I curl or braid my hair. But who can beat it for $1.00? Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I just received this head band today and it&#x27;s really pretty. I thought it will be a bright gold color which I don&#x27;t like but it&#x27;s perfect gold color for me like a copperish gold. My mom in law likes it too! Thank you and hope you&#x27;ll make a lot of pretty things like this.</li>
            <li> Really pretty.  Just as described at a very reasonable price.  Fairly good quality and arrived quickly.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> This headband is super thin and looks cheap :( I am disappointed and hoped for something a little better. However you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> As much as this is a pretty headband, it doesn&#x27;t even fit, and I&#x27;m a very petite woman.  I don&#x27;t think this would fit most women. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Broke the second time I put it on.  Fortunately I did not spend much on it, but that is probably why it broke.  Pretty, but not durable at all.</li>
            <li> Really cute and looks so pretty!!!!! Dont think more about it!! Is a good deal!:) i love how it looks</li>
            <li> Broke the VERY FIRST time i tried to put it on my head. VERY CHEAP. too cheap to even waste a dollar or your time on it. I have already thrown mine away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, a bit tight like most hair bands. Looks really nice on. It is the same quality that you would get anywhere and a great value.</li>
            <li> The band was small and tight enough to fit an infants head. There is no way I could fit this around my head maybe as a bracelet...</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The elastic part seems like it will not lasts forever considering it is held together by a metal clasp, but if that were to happen, I&#x27;d simply use a ribbon to continue using this. I think for how little  I spent, it&#x27;s totally worth my money. It&#x27;s not too bold an accessory which is perfect for me. Just enough to look a little done-up. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> looks so pretty on my head and a definite fashion band for your forehead this is a steal buy A+++</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Looks pretty cute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite tight (and I have a small head)&lt;br /&gt;Took a long time to arrive&lt;br /&gt;Very poorly made. It snapped the second time I tried wearing it, so basically I only got to wear it once for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, but not worth it even so.</li>
            <li> Very cute.  Sometimes I just wear it as a necklace but it&#x27;s a sturdy headband.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breaking or anything.</li>
            <li> I love how this headband looks, but the roses can get caught in your hair, and is a pain to take out because then your hair gets messed up...&lt;br /&gt;Only really good for undos, because the tangling will be a mess with your hair loose.</li>
            <li> It looked like I spent alot of money on it, which is great...But by the third wear, it broke in half! I think I have a pretty averaged sized head, so it couldnt be because my head was too big.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty to look at...runs small for an adult.  It broke the first time I tried to put it on.</li>
            <li> Item is too small for adults and teens - may fit a baby.  Even though it has a stretch piece the link broke the 1st time I tried to put it on.</li>
            <li> First of all for the price of this hairband+quality is amazing and absolutely &#x27;OUTSTANDING!!!!!&#x27;So don&#x27;t doubt yourself of buying this for the quality might not be good.Cause your wrong.It is just FABULOUS!!!!!!Am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this got stuck in my curly hair and broke when trying to get it out. i wilk use the flowers for a bracelet.</li>
            <li> This head band is a piece of crap. It broke within 30 seconds of me putting it on. It is very cheap material but I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> It looks cute but it was broken before I got to use it! It has tight fit as a headband.</li>
            <li> Very small and cheaply made. Neither me nor my little sister could get it over our heads. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> When I received this item is was broken. Sad, glad they did the right thing by refunding me.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more than a $1 for this item.&lt;br /&gt;It got 3 stars for them doing the right thing with the refund&lt;br /&gt;It lost 2 stars for it being broken.</li>
            <li> Do not get it. Right when I get it I try to use it it fell a part I put it back together try to use it again it puld my heir I hit it I wish I can have my money back please do not get it it is not worth it at all</li>
            <li> It is pretty but metal(the roses) is sharp and get stuck in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is too tight to wear and broke easily. I don&#x27;t recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> i love the head band and it fits well. only sometimes your hair might get alittle tangled with the headband which can be annoying, but other than that, its really nice. the flowers and size are perfect , and just a well statement.</li>
            <li> I know this item was very inexpensive, but it broke on the first day.  I don&#x27;t know if it is too small or what, but the elastic doesn&#x27;t allow for much stretch, so a lot of stress is put on the little metal pieces and the links that hold the pieces together.  It&#x27;s very cute, but you&#x27;ll probably get one or two uses out of it before it breaks (unless your head is the size of a child&#x27;s).  Save your money.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money, its for very small head and very delicate. Broke n first use as its attachments are very loose.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite headband. I&#x27;ve worn it practically daily for over a couple months. The elastic is perfect size for your head and does not give a headache like many more expensive headbands. The roses are so beautiful and antique looking! I think I may have to buy a couple more!</li>
            <li> The band is so tight that it keeps sliding off my head. Very uncomfortable but adorable. Not sure if to recommed this.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous headband! Light weight and fits firmly on my head... It is a bit tighter than I expected. Very much worth the price!</li>
            <li> I tried contacting the company (person) who makes these. Both of them broke, as soon as they were put in place. Terribly DISSATISFIED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I am concerned, this was a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I tried contacting the provider, and they never answered. I bought 2 of them. One as a gift, and one for me. When mine broke, I decided to try the second set. Yep. Just like the first one, it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not state that this was for children. Maybe it would work on a child, but not an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, really sad, because I liked the look of these on the page. However, in your hands they are flimsy pieces. I would have gone ahead and wore it anyway, if it had JUST not BROKE on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the company who sold these, would replace them with items that DO not BREAK, I will then amend my comments. Until then, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty, but it is sized very small. It would not fit my 10 year old. It broke when trying to stretch the rubber band part. I put ribbon on it and could still use it, a larger stretch band would also be a solution.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here, but it still arrived within the estimated timeline.  It is what it is, nothing too complicated here.  However it does tangle a bit so just be aware of this.</li>
            <li> Worth the price for certain.  It&#x27;s nice and pretty much came on time just as described.  I wear it often.</li>
            <li> I love this headband. The pictures shoes exactly what it looks like. The rose flowers are so pretty. I&#x27;m surprised its true to picture.</li>
            <li> This headband is definitely cute. It is very comfortable and stylish. The only thing I would caution about it is that its a little small. Thankfully I have a tiny head so it worked out though</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend of mine as a really late birthday gift &amp; she loved it. She&#x27;s mixed with pretty long hair &amp; said it was just the thing she needed.</li>
            <li> Cute, but not worth buying. One use and it no longer had its color.&lt;br /&gt;I even had the gold come off in flakes in my hair......</li>
            <li> So I purchased this item thinking it&#x27;d be cute and simple. Turns out the headband looks very cheap, it hurts my hair when I put it on and it smells pretty cheap too. I mean it&#x27;s alright and only worth a dollar but still a piece of cheap metal and it&#x27;s best for you guys just to save that dollar than spend it. Don&#x27;t believe the other reviews/reviewers. So worth what you&#x27;ve paid for.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS HAIR BAND  ESPECIALLY THE NEW IMPROVED ONES. THEY ARE STRONGER AND THEY  ARE VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. IT IS CERTAINLY AN EYE CATCHER IN A CROWD. ITS LOOKS EXPENSIVE BUT, ITS A GREAT AFFORDABLE PRICE.IT MAKES ME FEEL BEAUTIFUL WHEN I WEAR IT. IT IS ALSO GREAT FOR ALL HAIR LENGTHS,  IF YOU HAVE LONG HAIR YOU CAN WEAR IT ALONE OR PAIR IT WITH A PONY TAIL WEARING BOTH ITEMS AND YOU CAN ALSO WEAR AN UP DO AND ADD THE HAIR BAND AS AN ADDED BONUS,  IT IS WONDERFUL FOR  SHORT HAIR AND GIVES AN AIR OF STYLISH SOPHISTICATION TO ALL OCCASIONS. I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL YOU LADIES THAT LOVE HAIR JEWELRY .</li>
            <li> I liked this product. The headband is beautiful and it doesn&#x27;t break, even though it seems like it will. It was kind of tight on my head at first, but it quickly adjusted. The metal doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can barely feel it there. I enjoy this product thoroughly most days.</li>
            <li> I tried to wear it but first of all it pulls the hair and second of all it broke at the connection. it is better as a choker than hair band.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, arrived before estimated delivery date. Unless you have a child sized head do not buy. This headband is way too small. If i could even get it on my head I can&#x27;t even imagine the headache I would get from wearing this. Very good quality and it is very cute just way too small for the average sized head.</li>
            <li> Exactly fantastic,  but hate how it tangles in my hair and very fragile and it gives me that worry &amp;#34;hope it wont break on me&amp;#34; sort of affect.wonderful accessory though.</li>
            <li> This is meant for little girls I think.  It barely fits my 9 year old daughter, and it definitely does not fit me.  Very pretty though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even worn it due to the fact that it weighs like 2 lbs and looks completely different then the photo.. Will not be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> I took this out of the envelope to see how cheap it is. I tried putting it on and it kept pulling my hair. It&#x27;s hard to put on as well.</li>
            <li> Pretty but runs very small I made adjustments to just be careful a little sharp don&#x27;t ripe hair when putting it on.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite headbands since I bought it. Hold my hair back perfectly. I absoluly love it for the price very well made</li>
            <li> I took it out of the bag it came in, put it on my teeny 5 year old daughter (as it is SO small, it could only fit a petite child), and the thing snapped in half...just like that! It was literally only in my hands intact for maybe a grand total of 30 seconds before it was broken and sliding out of my daughter head to the floor. What had happened is that the elastic band on the back that stretches and holds it in place on your head needs to be slightly stretched while you are sliding the thing on....but just the smallest stretching effort was enough to put too much strain on the incredibly cheap metal looking flower design (which is actually a very soft and low grade plastic that has been painted a metalic gold to look like metal) and the thing snapped right between two of the decorative flowers. It can&#x27;t be fixed because it is sooooo cheap. Gluing it together proved pointless because when it dried and I put it on my daughter again, it only broke in another place. I just tossed it in the garbage and accepted my one dollar loss. I will never buy something so cheap on here again though. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> It fell apart when I tried to put it on! It was so flimsy, and since it was only a dollar I guess I should have know ...</li>
            <li> i love this! it&#x27;s a slight bit too big, but i just tied an extra knot onto it and it fits perfect now. it&#x27;s so pretty, and looks very cute in my hair. i really love this, and it was super cheap!</li>
            <li> Its so cheap that i wont bother returning it. but its way too small..it broke when i tried to put it on and then the other side broke when i was just holding it!!! just had to throw it away in the trash</li>
            <li> It took about a month and a half for the product to arrive. It arrived in a very small package from china. It stretches well and is very pretty. But you hair gets stuck between the roses and tugs if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
            <li> Headband was very small, and broke upon first use. Where can I get my money back.i wish I didn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Adorable! &amp; I get compliments each time I wear it. It is simple but a great accessory when you don&#x27;t feel getting dolled up. Great price for something that exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter, she likes it. But the material was the problem. it changed color, and break easily.</li>
            <li> When I received it the headband was really small. I did not stretch at all, It didn&#x27;t fit my head by any means.</li>
            <li> It was cute but it was really small. It was very uncomfortable to wear and it broke the second time I tried to use it</li>
            <li> It was just so awful because it broke easily. Bad quality. It only last one day. I don&#x27;t like it anyway and don&#x27;t recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> This broke when I first tried to put on, I repaired it but it doesn&#x27;t stretch enough so it was so tight that is was very painful and couldn&#x27;t wear. I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;0&amp;#34; and very petite so I don&#x27;t know how anyone but a child can wear this.</li>
            <li> For the price including shipping this is a great and affordable headband. I love it even more because it does not hurt my head like others and it is very cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> I just received this headbad i think it looks nice but is too tight it hurts and it pulls on my hair. I guess for the price is ok but i wouldnt recomend anyone to buy this it sucks and it pulls out hair when adjusted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute, very elegant, the colors &amp; flowers are nice but it&#x27;s really tight, &amp; i have a pretty normal sized head? I will wear it but i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be wearing it across my forehead like I wanted to cause it fits to tight. Other than that, the design is beautiful.</li>
            <li> i bought this item to my girl as a gift, she really loved it. she is using everytime and its good</li>
            <li> The product did not fit my head. It was WAY too tight. The product is pretty much useless now... disappointed.</li>
            <li> this headband is very cute and fashionable.i live the floral design and  the color ofbthe headband.i definitely recommend it but the only yhing is that it can sometimes get stuck in your hair.</li>
            <li> I would consider my head to be about average, or slightly larger than average, size. That being said, this does not even almost fit my head and I can not imagine it fitting on even a smaller headed adult. I gave it to my eight year old cousin and she seems to be happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect headband but it smells like a whole bunch of coins or something. And it didn&#x27;t come gold, it came orange-ish gold-ish but still cute.</li>
            <li> Great for easy styling. All I do is style my hair in a messy bun and add this beautiful accessory. I already got compliments on it! (:</li>
            <li> It broke between a link on my 1st attempt to put it on...not even worth a dollar and had to wait over a month for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> This thing broke 2 days later, the elastic stretched out to much I guess. Disappointing that I could only wear it once</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I took it out the package!!!I went to stretch the rubber band part and it snapped in half!!the band did,then the rest just fell apart.not only that it was super small like for a toddler</li>
            <li> Received this well over 3 weeks after placing the order and it is junk.  It fell apart before my granddaughter could even wear it.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this a minus star I would, JUNK</li>
            <li> This headpiece is nice in colour and shape, although it&#x27;s a bit small (don&#x27;t buy it if you have a very large head). Also hair get caught a bit, but if you have straight hair (like I do) it won&#x27;t be a problem...you just pay attention when you put it off. I don&#x27;t know with curly hair, though.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as headband, necklace and around my bun. It&#x27;s super pretty!</li>
            <li> I think it is very pretty and feminine.  I look forward to wearing it often to dress up my appearance on many occasions.</li>
            <li> they broke first try&lt;br /&gt;but wearable,, just be careful&lt;br /&gt;it was also sort of small on my head..&lt;br /&gt;just be warned</li>
            <li> Its starting to fade a little bit and I have had to re attach a few times but other than that it is currently my favorite hair accessory.</li>
            <li> This headband looked like a hair catcher (on the metal part) but it wasn&#x27;t.  It looked very cute on my older childs head.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive.  Very small. I attached a hair tie to both sides. Made it a little lose but much more comfortable to wear. After correcting the size issue I like it very much. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! Headband is very comfortable with beautiful flowers on it. Product is made with elastic band making the fit comfortable for just about anybody. Perfect for an everyday outing or a special occasion! I would recommend this product to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I wanted something different to put in my hair. This was just the thing! I would recommend this to teenagers too.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described.  Bought this for my 9 yr old daughter.  It fits her perfectly and she loves it.  Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a smaller head, this headband is pretty tight. It&#x27;s hard to get it to stretch around my head and will leave flower imprints on my skin if it&#x27;s sitting on skin. Overall, the design is pretty and if you can get it in the right spot it doesn&#x27;t move very much, but I do not highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> what a stunning accessory! ...it broke after a month. I paid like $3 for it so...you get what you pay for. I did receive a lot of compliments on it when I had it and it went so perfectly with wavy hair!</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, especially for the price.  However, the elastic part is quite small and it is very tight on my head.  I will just wear it as a necklace.  I don&#x27;t think anyone will know the difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have a big head. Ive seen bigger. most people say I have a small head. I cannot wear this because it simply does not fit comfortably around my head. the flowers get tangled in my hair very easily just by trying to take it off. it is a gorgeous piece tough. I just don&#x27;t know what to do with it now :( took about a month to arrive on the east coast.</li>
            <li> Love this item. However when wearing it,it holds on to my hair and pulled it out. It also changed colors in the first few days. It&#x27;s a shame tho it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> I love the headband, but the elastic band has broken already and my hair tends to get stuck in the floral metal pieces. I&#x27;m just going to take it off the band and glue it to a plastic headband with teeth to make sure it stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;It looks adorable in my hair tho.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, hasn&#x27;t broken yet. But it gets caught in my hair so easily and taking it out is a pain.</li>
            <li> I dont use it very often. It looks very pretty but sometimes it clings to you hair and pulls it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have a big head but this was painful to put on. It barely stretched over my head and dug into my scalp. It broke not long after that. I never even wore it out. It was cute, though. It would probably fit a small child but may still be uncomfortable</li>
            <li> i clicked on this headband and to see it and the one i bought poppedup in this ones place  so i cannot order this one because the ordering status is messed</li>
            <li> I am so upset i never received my package. save your time &amp;money! So not worth it. I&#x27;d give.it a.ZERO start if i could. btw why would they change their product picture?? seems sketchy.</li>
            <li> It broke trying to put it on my head! I waited so long for it and it broke! lucky I fixed it and I&#x27;m able to wear it still,but you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The picture in this one isn&#x27;t what I ordered, and I haven&#x27;t even got my package and two days have passed since it was supposed to get here. So far this sucks and I&#x27;m unhappy and a little pissed.</li>
            <li> the flowers have little medal prongs that get stuck and tangled in your hair and it hurts really  bad .lol</li>
            <li> I wore it the same day I recieved it.  I am so happy with this. I love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute.  Not put together very well, probably cheep materials.  It runs very small with not a lot of give.</li>
            <li> Very Pretty And Modern. Durable But Kinda Tight. I Would Reccomend To Friends And Family For Sure, Worth The money!!</li>
            <li> I never got the chance to even wear it because as soon as I went to put it on, it snapped. It was definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I broke out in hives. this was not safe  metal to wear&lt;br /&gt;from neck to knee i was in pain for 3 days - had to take benadryll to stop the breakout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;should not wear if you have any allergy to metal no matter how &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; you think it is - I&#x27;ve never had a breakout like this before</li>
            <li> Thank you, It is a beautiful head band but mine unfortunately broke when putting it on so I was contacted and refunded. Head band would work well if you have a small head or perfect for children :).</li>
            <li> AT 64 HAIR JEWELRY BRINGS OUT THE 20 YR OLD IN ME.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICES ARE GREAT FROM THIS COMPAY, BUY IT.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t look very good as a head band , made out of a cheap very malleable material but still pretty cute</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this headband! It all came in one piece and I&#x27;m so happy. It is so beautiful!! Just amazing.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Just wish it would be  tighter. I have to hold it in place with bobby pins. Great deal though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute for a child my niece loves it and I like it you could use it for your head if your smart and stretched it out first</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my order satisfied the free shipping over $35. I got this yesterday, and it broke almost right away! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> you get for what you pay for i guess. the metal is a stiff and gets caught in your hair, plus it smells like bronze.</li>
            <li> Came in great condition. I love it. Looks great on too. Looks exactly like the picture. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This really sucks because I orderd this around september 9.... Its october 31.... Its still not here. Were is it???</li>
            <li> I love this headband its so beautiful on I wore it on halloween with my costume  as a fairy and it work perfectly I qm so inlove I might by another one just incase this one breaks.</li>
            <li> very pretty, but a little small on my head... maybe i just have a big head! but yeah, different sizes would help. i had a headache after wearing it too long. but very stylish, got lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> breaks easily, also takes out hair when putting it on,  a waste of money, and also takes longer to do my hair than with a regular headband</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty but it&#x27;s too small for my head to be comfortable or to stay on. It&#x27;s perfect for a child though!</li>
            <li> It is a little bit small for me, but it is gorgeous! Sometimes i even wear it as a necklace, it is so pretty...and the delivery was very quick!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to wear this hair band.When i was trying it on it broke! Cheap material!!! its to small, it doesn&#x27;t really stretch. I&#x27;m very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Uhhhh Its So Tiny Barely Fits My Head . So i Attached It Too Two More Black Chongos . So Now It Doesnt Bug My Head As MUch As Before</li>
            <li> The headband itself is awfully cute, and for the price, it is pretty sturdy.  It does run just a little small.  I could get it on my head but it was pretty tight and after about an hour I had to take it off due to a headache.  I ended up giving it to my daughter and it is pretty cute on her though :)</li>
            <li> It is lovely, very nice, very nice, lovely. just like it was in the picture. there, is that enough words?</li>
            <li> I have very fine (and I mean VERY) hair. It is hard for me to get a headband to stay in my hair properly without slipping off my head especially when bending &amp; working which is the reason I need a headband.  This headband is very nice and looks beautiful when worn so it can be worn for everyday work, casual &amp; dress. But, what I like most is that it is very comfortable, small, and STAYS PUT! Definitely well worth the $1.08 + free shipping!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair band for my daughter. we really liked it. got a lot of compliments. recommended for my friends</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT. I wait almost a month for this product, and it breaks in half when I wear it. It was so small that I couldn&#x27;t even get it around my head. The little flower shapes came off. This wasn&#x27;t even worth the dollar I paid for it!! Very unhappy with my purchase. All that it&#x27;s good for now is arts and crafts.</li>
            <li> it was so small ... it was like a bracelet once i tried to put it on it broke right away</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUPER CUTE AND CHIC.. THE QUALITY IS OK, THE METAL (OR WHATEVER IT IS) A LITTLE THIN AND FLIMSY.. BUT MINE HASNT BROKE AND IVE WORN IT A FEW TIMES.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute. I just got it today, shipping fast, good quality. Fit perfect. Comfortable. And stylish and great price. Would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> So freaking cute! And for the price you&#x27;d be crazy not to buy it! I love it and its not so tight that is squeezes your head. Also its not flimsy.. I was worried it might break before I bought it since it was cheap, but its actually really good quality.</li>
            <li> The gold flowers are very pretty but it is a bit tight and uncomfortable on my head and pulls my hair so it is not the comfortable fit I was hoping it would be. A little more slack or another row of flowers would make this headband a winner.</li>
            <li> It broke the 1st time my daughter put it on. I was able to repair it.Then a different area broke and I was unable to repair it. The elastic part was not long enough or stretchy enough. It was for a very small head.</li>
            <li> I like the design. A little bit too tight but with use it will fit better. It took awhile to ship but was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> The hair band is great, I really like it! The only problem being that it&#x27;s more of a copper color than the gold it says it is. So that&#x27;s a bummer. It still looks nice in copper, I&#x27;m just disappointed that it&#x27;s not the color that&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the headband, I feel in love with it. It so shinny, good,and good quality. It looks good with Every outfit, put my outfit togethere. I love.my headband.</li>
            <li> I use this as a head band and also around one of my hats and it makes the hat unique. It fits very well.</li>
            <li> looks just like the picture and its super cute. It kinda gets stuck in my hair sometimes. But very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for  my daughter and I was surprised how much she liked it. It  is more of a decorative headband.</li>
            <li> nice and lovely hair band, my kids and i love it, the only things is the flower joint with the elastic not too good it came out after a few time wearing it but it can be fix easily just add a clip on it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this headband so much. However, the size is more geared for a childs&#x27; head, and the hooks between each of the flowers don&#x27;t close all the way, leaving them open to snag hair. Sadly, I&#x27;ll never use this again, but it was too cheap to waste time returning.</li>
            <li> Broke even before I could put it on. But then again, for something this cheap, that&#x27;s top be elected almost.</li>
            <li> I really loved the look of the hair band and was excited to wear it.  I tried it on immediately and it broke.  Disappointed.  I&#x27;ve recently returned it.</li>
            <li> It broke within a minute of putting it in my hair. I had to physically fix every little clamp in it with some pliers.</li>
            <li> I think this item is very cute! I received it a couple weeks before the estimated date, the only con is it is a little small, hopefully it will stretch a little after some wear. maybe i just have a big head lol</li>
            <li> the headband came broken. the flowers were not attached and there was no way to attatch them. it doesn&#x27;t look like t would for on your head either. I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> It was way too small!! I ended up throwing it away because it just didn&#x27;t fit and it did not stretch at all. I would only recommend this for a small child.. maybe 2 years or younger..</li>
            <li> it was too tight on the head and it broke after wearing it for a day. it was pretty to look at</li>
            <li> This product was as it was described.  It looked nice, but it broke after one wear.  My 7 year old wore it and of course took it off and on and it snapped.  I would suggest for older users that will not handle it too much.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty but apparently she must have a very small head because it&#x27;s more for kids.  I will see about giving it as a gift.  Hopefully it will set nicely on their head as it looks in this picture. Very pretty and love the price for what I saw..</li>
            <li> The item I received is a metal-and-elastic floral band.  It does NOT look like the image in color, size, or design.  (Well, the elastic is still black.)  However, the product is cute and it was around a dollar, so I am happy enough with it.  Hasn&#x27;t broken yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a chance if you are somewhat flexible about what you receive, I suppose.  However, the seller should probably show accurate images!!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit :( Mabry on a baby&#x27;s head oh we&#x27;ll other then that it gave me a headache  oh well</li>
            <li> Really love this piece! It doesnt feel cheap and I get complements every time that I wear it. I really do suggest this. The price of it being so cheap made me hesitate, but it really is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute, however, it broke the first time I tried to wear it. We had to fix it ourselves, and honestly I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;ll bust again. Very cheap so you get what you pay for. Also, the amount of time for delivery is so long, I had forgotten all about ordering it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it was just what it looks like but it didn&#x27;t fit my head too well and it doesn&#x27;t really stretch it&#x27;s good for a child but not a teen</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear this at all, as soon as I try to put it on...it snags my hair and gets tangled. It&#x27;s my mistake, I should have considered the design more in that I am basically trying to put a tight necklace on my head. It&#x27;s beautiful, just not what I needed</li>
            <li> It changes color and it keeps on popping, but I wont say its a total waste of money because for the first fewdays I had it on, I had lots of compliments</li>
            <li> The wrap around gold headband is way way to tiny to wrap around any adults head. It even hurts my childs head.&lt;br /&gt;She states that &amp;#34;It hurts my head and pulls on my hair.&amp;#34;  Which I believe to be true as when she&#x27;s taken it off, much of her hair is STILL ATTACHED to it.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try it out...Not impressed, it was really small and broke first wear. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I never got the headband. It&#x27;s been about 6 months. I filed a complaint about a week after I was supposed to get it. I asked for another one and never heard back or got one.</li>
            <li> This product is not hat I ordered. I ordered what was on the picture, but instead got a very cheap headband. It had flowers down the whole band, and broke as soon as I used it. Save your money an don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teenager and I don&#x27;t think my head is really big, but when I first got this headband it was really tight on my head and the chain broke. Also noticed since the flowers and chain is metal it is hard material so it might tangle on you hair and hurt your head.</li>
            <li> What I ordered isn&#x27;t even what is pictured here. It took over a month and  half to arrive to my door, and they fell apart before even wearing once. This is what I get for ordering from China. Save yourself the time and effort and do not buy this stuff. The only reason I did was because it was on a couponing site and people said they were nice. Wrong. Total, complete junk and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> very pretty but does tend to get tangled in her hair quite often. I put a piece of fabric behind it and now it works great.</li>
            <li> I loved this headband. It matched with everything.  It looked a little small but it did manage to fit around my big head so I&#x27;d recommend for adults or kids!</li>
            <li> The shipping was great but the product was a problem. It was so tight when I extended it on to my head! The metal and gaps on the rose completely stuck to my hair and it hurt like hell!! DO NOT BUY THIS. Its made entirely out of metal and it will rip your hair off. WASTE OF MY MONEY!!</li>
            <li> This hair band fell apart the first time I used it. Piece of garbage. I would not recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li> The quality of this accessory shocked me. I thought because of its cheap price that the quality would be just as bad. But definitely not the case. This is a great hair accessory made of heavy metal and strong elasticity.  I bought 2 @  the time of purchase and  was able to use as a great gift.</li>
            <li> This headband has a really nice design and it looks great against my dark hair. However, it is a little tight and the metallic roses pull on the hair when the headband is being taken off. Overall, it is good quality for the price. I would order this type of thing again if it was a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I love this headband. It&#x27;s very expensive looking and makes a great gift. It is heavy though, and you may want to take it off slowly if you want to prevent pulling your hair. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> product broke almost immediately ... maybe my head is just too big lol... super cute if you have a tiny head and don&#x27;t mind metal poking you</li>
            <li> I was so exited when my elastic hair band arrived. Its fancy and fun for a night out with friends!</li>
            <li> I realize the item was very inexpensive, I guess you get what you pay for.  I went to put it on for the 1st time, the metal is so cheap it broke before I even got it on my head!  Save your $ and buy yourself a cup of coffee instead!</li>
            <li> It is very pretty but it is waaaayyyyy too small. I would not recommend this to anyone else because it is so tiny. Maybe making it a tie instead of elastic hair ties it may work better.</li>
            <li> I have really short thin hair and this looks just great on me. I love this accessory. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last since some buyers have claimed that this isn&#x27;t so durable but i&#x27;m still happy about it. It took about one month to arrive to my address.</li>
            <li> The product broke as soon as I received it. I tried to put it on, barely stretching it and the flower part broke off. It also pulled out my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted a headband to wear with updo&#x27;s or just to jazz up an outfit and this one does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping takes forever because it&#x27;s coming from China (I live in the USA) but for the price, I&#x27;ll wait a few weeks for something I didn&#x27;t really need anyway.</li>
            <li> This pulls your hair a bit, and it&#x27;s kind of cheesy, but from a distance it looks good and the price was right. Again, doesn&#x27;t look good in my red hair, but looked great in a friends darker hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to get stuck in my hair but, so far it really hasn&#x27;t. It is really tight and I am hoping it will loosen up a little but, it is beautiful!</li>
            <li> This hair band is exactly as described. It does not hurt my head and stays in place all day...even through my gym workout!! If you&#x27;re not careful, your hair can get stuck in the roses and get pulled. However, this has not prevented me from wearing it to date. I have received many compliments regarding this hair band. It was packaged nicely to prevent damage during shipping. However, if you are in a rush, this is not the hair band for you as it does take a few weeks to arrive. Yet, keep in mind, shipping is free. Overall, great purchase!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute and I got a good deal on it! Very happy! I was able to get a few and give as gifts, they also enjoyed.</li>
            <li> it broke right away just as i was trying it on I guess it was a little too small and I don&#x27;t have a big head.</li>
            <li> One dollar!! I love it... It came after 3 weeks though... But is ok... I will order more to have in stock to give with other gifts like for Xmas or Bdays!! When I try to move it after putting in place, it pulls my hair. But thats not an issue.!! I will order more. I recommended it.</li>
            <li> It got stuck in my hair and the first day I tried to use it, it broke. I was not impressed</li>
            <li> Its for small heads . It broke when i tried to stretch it to my head. Its good quiality but only if you have a small head. It came fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute, I&#x27;m very happy with it! Very affordable gift for a little one in my life.  Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT, fits a lil tight on my teen but my younger daughter might nab this away from her.  I would say this is more for a child than an adult.</li>
            <li> The minute i stretched it to put it around my head it snapped. I never even got a chance to wear it. Its too small to fit around an adults head. I don&#x27;t even think it would got around a todlers head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hairband on March 1 and it&#x27;s April 20 and I haven&#x27;t gotten it yet. I can&#x27;t track this and it&#x27;s really upsetting.</li>
            <li> Never ordered this. Don&#x27;t know why this review is here. I don&#x27;t own this and I don&#x27;t like headbands like this</li>
            <li> At the price it is, I knew it would either be cheap and fall apart, or it might actually be nice. There were so many mixed reviews that it was hard to decided but I wasn&#x27;t losing much money to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve worn it so many times and it has held through very well. It stretches very well and makes a simple ponytail look cute. People always ask where I got it and I wasn&#x27;t ashamed to tell them I got it for $1 on Amazon. The only downside is that it gets caught in your hair easily so just be cautious when putting it on so it doesn&#x27;t snag and mess everything up.</li>
            <li> this is not made for an adult head. It&#x27;s pretty for a kids head. Picture should be for a kid not an adult</li>
            <li> it is very cute but very tight and almost impossible to get around my head.  Maybe meant for a little girl?</li>
            <li> Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.</li>
            <li> Initially when I tried to put this on it broke, but I was able to fix it.  It&#x27;s hard to put on and that&#x27;s probably why it broke.  I would not buy another one.</li>
            <li> It took a while for it to come in the mail, i ordered around the holiday season. I completely forgot i had ordered it. It was only $1 so i ordered two, why not. I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to wear it anywhere out yet. I did try it on, its a little tight but it fits my head fine. Maybe a few more times will loosen it up a bit. It looks cute though and it didn&#x27;t pull my hair out when i took it off. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price</li>
            <li> Not everyone has the same size head! LOL I for one have a bigger one than the person who may have made these. Sucks to have a bigger head! It broke when I was trying to put it on, pretty upset because I was very pretty! I would suggest having more of a stretch at the bottom so that it&#x27;d be easier to get through the head and be able to fix.</li>
            <li> Its very cute . I rarely see people with them so I get many compliments BUT its awfly tight AND I had to fix a side of it. It breaks very easily while pulling it you have to be gentle. But I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I tried to put it on and it broke into pieces. I know it is only a dollar but not even worth the time.</li>
            <li> even cheap they look cheaper. i was not happy with mine at all. do not recommend to anyone any age</li>
            <li> I think that it got stretched over time and the color started to fade into this copper color. Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend  unless you don&#x27;t care to waste money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was so small and tight for my head. It wouldn&#x27;t fit any normal human beings head. It broke after one use! I guess it is what you pay for!</li>
            <li> broke as soon as i put it on&lt;br /&gt;very cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;the roses are very cute but the elastic is where it broke at</li>
            <li> I really love this head piece, its neat and very pretty. only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, it pulls my hair when I try to take it off. other than that, love it.</li>
            <li> It is cheap but too tight for me ,may be my head too big, so I cant use that no more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product 4 months ago... still no sign of it. four months people. I doubt it will ever come. I will change my review if/when it comes.</li>
            <li> I took the advice of the other reviewer.  I made sure when I wear it that I carefully put it over my head and wore a style that the flowers won&#x27;t get caught in my hair.  The hair band is so unique and I love, love the rose lace flowers.  I&#x27;m wearing an updo where the front part of my hair is covered with some curls to hide the black band in the front and the back of my hair displays the flower pattern of the headband.  I just love being unique I hope this helps, if anyone is not sure it will work.</li>
            <li> i never even got mine in the mail! its been so long and still nothing. i wish i got it because it looks pretty in the picture.</li>
            <li> These little flowers are made of metal and they get stuck in your hair the second you try and put it on, they get all twisted up and it pulls out your hair. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it once</li>
            <li> the little flowers bend and get stuck because they are metal like and it is very tight on my head...i dont have a big head either.</li>
            <li> I like this product. quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get it and broke while trying to put it on. I figured it would stretch and it snapped and the metal hit me on the side of my face and I bled. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The headband looks great, but my hair gets caught in the joints and gets pulled.  I suppose that was to be expected considering the price.</li>
            <li> This headband is absolutely beautiful. I would have even payed $5 for it. Much better quality than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Like i said i love this hairband.. it&#x27;s great!! and it looks great with everything you wear!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this hairband because it&#x27;s beautiful and looks great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a cute design however it was kind of small and fell apart after one use. I was able to use it by taking the elastic off and using a ribbon instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap it broke the 2nd day I had it, it wraps really tight around your head which makes it uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.  I don&#x27;t mind too much since I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it but if you are debating on purchasing this, I would suggest against it.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It&#x27;s good headband but do beware it will break if not carful. Keeps all hair back, took a while, but I like the product</li>
            <li> The roses are the size of a dime. Pretty gold color just like in the pic. It fits perfectly on my head. I usually have trouble getting hair accessories to stay in my head bc my hair is silky and my head is oval shape, unlike the round shape of most headbands. But this headband will fit any head shape bc it is a chain and also has a stretchy string..rope..thing for the back of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that the links catch in my hair so i have to get it right the first time i put it in, which rlly isnt that hard, bc theres no adjusting it once u put it on bc it catches my hair. A bit of a pain getting it out, but not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But besides that. I absolutely love it. It is so adorable and classy</li>
            <li> If you want your hair ripped out and a headache, buy this headband! My headband didn&#x27;t break putting it on, unlike most reviewers, but after wearing it for a minute I thought my head was going to explode from it being too tight. Also, the roses get tangled in your hair, so, you have to rip your hair out to get the headband off. I would not suggest buying no matter what the price is.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s priced at a dollar says it all! It&#x27;s for a kid definitely not an adult sync I could not adjust the headband to change size.</li>
            <li> The price is great, which is why I gave it three stars. However, when you first get it, take a pair of needle nose pliers, and tighten the links between the roses. They&#x27;re not as securely closed as thy should be, which can lead to some annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be prepared to rip some of your hair out. All those little links snag your hair both putting it on, and taking it off. It is beautiful, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again simply because it can take me a few tries to get it on my head right, and my hair is thin enough as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine how this would work with thick, or curly hair.</li>
            <li> This headband looks great with a variety of hair styles. Its so pretty on, I&#x27;m getting extras for all the girly girls I know.</li>
            <li> this was cute, well made, great price, but its so tight! i couldnt get it on my head without ripping out a bunch of hair. its extremely tight.</li>
            <li> Wore this the other day to give my ponytail an interesting twist. I got so many compliments and felt very good about how my hair looked. Just be sure to only stretch out the elastic part whilst putting it on your head. If not, im afraid the metal part will snap from the pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and cute! It looks exactly how it looks like in the picture. It really did meet my expectations</li>
            <li> item was not like photo and it was nice but broke min. i try to put head band on so becareful photo may not be what iteam is.</li>
            <li> this got caught in my hair and pulled a bunch out... it&#x27;s not very flexable, and honestly the clasps holding the flowers together are just not good... its cute, just not wearable.</li>
            <li> sadly disappointed that this piece never came, it might eventually. But its been 2 months. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your time on this product.</li>
            <li> Never came in the mail. Don&#x27;t bother getting cheap things, some times the added price is added assurance for a better product. Or in this case, a company that promises to send you the product they advertise.</li>
            <li> When i got it i was excited, but nervous upon reading the bad reviews. It was very well packaged. Got it before &#x27;deadline&#x27;. One thing i was concerned was of the color. Mine doesnt look as gold as the one in the pic. Mine looks more like a vintage color. (Rusty gold) [It literally smells like cheap quality]But i still like it. Worn it a couple of times and has not broken..</li>
            <li> This headband is lovely; however, it broke the first time I tried it on. The band is a little to tight for the head and it snapped as I was putting it on.</li>
            <li> went to put it on and the elastic band pulled out of the metal center clip, now its held together with a knot. it was short like for children and wouldve been rediculously tight if it hadnt broken.</li>
            <li> I found it was hard to put on and it got caught in my hair while attempting to put it on.</li>
            <li> great product for the price and my daughter says it is very comfortable and her hair doesnt get caught in it.  got it for less than $1 works great and good quality.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this would be a cute headband for me. As soon as I got it in the mail I couldnt wait to try it on. I tried to be super careful not to break the chain, so it took me a good 10 mins to put it on. Now after I got it on, I tried to replace it, so I took it off. Little did I know that the chains that connected the flowers got stuck in my hair. Not the best......</li>
            <li> It is a really pretty headbands but when I first got it it smells and felt very weird I don&#x27;t use it also often now but I really like it for decoration it was very cheap so I don&#x27;t mind it</li>
            <li> It did not fit my head, I don&#x27;t have an exceptionally large head but the band broke within the 1st minute of purchasing it. I did not bother returning it since it would be a waste of time and money for something so cheap.</li>
            <li> It did arrive a little late but it&#x27;s really cute! A lot of times headbands are tight on me but this one is perfect. I like the cute style. One of my favorite accessories to wear when I&#x27;m going out.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this, because of all the good reviews, but right when I tried it on it ripped! I&#x27;m so sad, but for the price what can I expect, right!?:/</li>
            <li> its nice i tried putting it on and it broke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and it got stuck on my hair its very cute but they should make them bigger.............</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty headband, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it, it stays on my head, and the gold tone flowers are made strong, so I o t fear it breaking. I bought one for me and my daughter. And had one shipped to my sister too!</li>
            <li> The headband looked a little different in person and I hurt a little bit when u wear it, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I am a very petite woman, 5&#x27;2 and 105 pounds and I have small head. This headband would not even go over my head. It broke when I tried to put it over my head. I don&#x27;t mind because I paid less than $2 for it but they should make these for head sizes bigger than a 7 year old. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for one of my young adult daughter, it looks cute on her. Good quality, now I wish I had purchased more for Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> This headband is very cute. The only down side is it&#x27;s very snug on my head. I can&#x27;t wear this for very long before it starts to hurt a little from being so snug. Overall, very well made headband. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it will fall apart after a few times of using it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product but the headband broke as soon as I tried it on.  It was also to small.</li>
            <li> Of course it is metal so if you have a lot of product and /or curly hair, it will get stuck when pulling it out.</li>
            <li> I really liked this headband! It took about 2-3 weeks to send but it was worth it. When they sent me the headband it came with a card saying thank you for the purchase. Over all I really liked this product! :)</li>
            <li> This product surprised me. It was very cheap, but I thought, &amp;#34;hey, lets give it a try!&amp;#34; It came earlier than expected. As opening it, my sister and I both said at the same time, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s so pretty!&amp;#34;. After that, I wore it the remainder of the day and got many compliments. The only flaw was that one time when I was taking it off, it snagged on a piece of my hair.</li>
            <li> came in on time. looks exactly as pictured. its just really pretty and i love it. any suggestions how to wear it thoe?</li>
            <li> I loved the gold, flower design and how strong the band was but when I slid it on I was unable to adjust because of the bars that hold the flowers together. They snagged my hair. So if I flip it around no issues. I accidentally dropped the head band onto the floor. The flowers detached so I had to snap them back together. All and all good.</li>
            <li> It broke before I even finished taking it out of the wrapper! Very disappointed.  Only positive was I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. Both snapped in half the first time I tried to use them :( What pieces of CRAP!!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this they had a picture of a different headband. That&#x27;s what I wanted, not this one. They are completely different styles of bands. I waited forever to get something I didn&#x27;t want. Very disappointed, I recommend buying from a different seller.</li>
            <li> Nice pretty . Don&#x27;t damage my hair . Easy to trait on . Good material . I like the way is look on my hair</li>
            <li> This is too small that cant even fit a baby head . It is very poorly made don&#x27;t order this</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and great bargain. It&#x27;s a cheaper price then at my local hair store. The thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that the flowers are hard metal and hurts to put on the head, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I looked at the reviews and saw that many people said it was good quality. I decided to take a chance on it and buy it; it was cheap.  Of course, I tried to put it on right when I got it, and the elastic part in the back broke. It was obviously made for someone with a smaller head than me, or at least less hair. Fortunately, the elastic was the only thing that broke. The metal flowers are still intact and relatively sturdy. although this didn&#x27;t work out for me as a headband, I&#x27;m sure that I can use the metal rose chain for something, so it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
            <li> So far it has not changed colors and looks cute with a bun or just simply alone. recommend for almost all ages</li>
            <li> It is really cute, but it gets tangled in your hair and a little hard to put on. It broke really fast too which i was a little sad about, but hey you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive, so i knew it would be low quality. Immediately when I put it on, both the rings holding the flowers to the hair band part snapped. I had some similar so I replaced those, but in between the flowers are pieces that hold the flowers together, and they cling to my hair, and I literally have to yank it out very carefully.</li>
            <li> My sister love this hair band.&lt;br /&gt;i have to agree with her, its really adorable.&lt;br /&gt;plus it arrived very early~</li>
            <li> the metal flowers got all mest-up the color fade away and I could no longer wear it.. .. ... ..</li>
            <li> It fell apart in my hands as I was putting it on for the first time. Shouldn&#x27;t be surprised for the price. Unless your head is the size of a Barbie doll, don&#x27;t waste your money, because it won&#x27;t fit. :-(</li>
            <li> Pretty headband especially for the price.  A bit tight on my head but it is bearable.  Took forever to get here of course but I think this was worth buying.</li>
            <li> Had to give it to my 2 year old niece and it barley fits her. It&#x27;s also not even good for her to wear because the flowers get stuck and rip out your hair.</li>
            <li> This headband is awesome. I always wear It on those days when I just don&#x27;t want to do anything with my hair!</li>
            <li> never got it. I wish I did tho it looks cute</li>
            <li> So I bought this because I thought it was cute and I do a lot of buns with my hair so I thought this would be nice to dress it up a little bit. It is waaaay too tight to get around your head. The very first time I went to wear it for school, it completely snapped and now it&#x27;s useless. Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> i was very happy with it exactly what i orderedwill order more in the future and recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> Very cheap tight to wear as a headband so uncomfortable to wear. Would not recommed it to no one  save your money</li>
            <li> This headband was very pretty and I may be able to wear it as a necklace. But it&#x27;s too small to go on my head comfortably.</li>
            <li> It looks very pretty . But when my wife wore it she said it was too tight ( she is not pumpkin headed ) and when she tried to remove it , the metal hairband broke her hair &amp; hurted her.&lt;br /&gt; Its cheap , cute looking but not comfortable at all .</li>
            <li> Looks super cute on .. of course it is metal so you have to be careful to not tangle it in your hair but unlike most headbands it does stay in place.</li>
            <li> Never got product !!!!so hard to even rate maybe if I would have got it I would have liked it</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve actually bought two because I just need them all the time. I think this item is just really great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was super cute. I was pleased when I took it out of the package, and it was cute. However, as soon as I put it on my head it ripped out my hair. I tried taking it off and it broke where the rubberband part connects with the flowers. Don&#x27;t even waste your money on this like I did.</li>
            <li> This, as with many other people, broke when my wife first put it on.  I welded all the openings but it is still small.  Buy two and put two together if you are hard up for buying this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and all but it&#x27;s a bit of a struggle trying to get it in my hair so it looks good and getting it out.</li>
            <li> I have a small head and it still barely fit. The moment I put it on, it just disintegrated and left little gold hooks all in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s wicked cheap, but still.</li>
            <li> Looks really nice in hair and holds well.  Would not fit a large head and band is not too stretchy</li>
            <li> I liked this.  It was very pretty and looks good on me.  The only issue is that taking it out isn&#x27;t easy because my hair gets wrapped around the flowers.</li>
            <li> really bad cheap material, as though it wasnt even meant to be worn. it broke when trying to put it on for the first time and i have a normal sized head!!</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I got my headband up until 30 mins after I put it on. The rings between the roses pull apart easily so I had to fix it with stronger rings. I would reccomend for someone with a smaller head (like a child) or not as much hair (I have thick hair).</li>
            <li> The headband looked really nice, and I wore it several times.  However,  it broke within a short period of time.  I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it..mine got broke when I tried to wear it..the quality of the metal is very inferior.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time my 15 year old put it on. The elastic is very tight and does not stretch well.  It might be good for a little girl however it is too tight for an adult.</li>
            <li> This headband TORE OUT MY HAIR in the front of my head while I was putting it on and taking it off. I really would like to meet the genius who decided to put metal closures between each rose at the front of the headband. Adding insult to injury, the thing took longer than the listed shipping date to reach my house. I had forgotten I even ordered the thing. It&#x27;s cheap for a reason, ladies. DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really cool hair band. It can easily get stuck in your hair though, so be careful when putting it in and out of your hair. Definitely worth the price, and it didn&#x27;t take too long to be shipped here.</li>
            <li> I really like it! Ive had this headband for a while now and it still looks great. I wear it quite often and the rubber band is still in great conditions and hasn&#x27;t stretched all out. I recommend this headband for sure</li>
            <li> It broke the before I got it over my head. You get what you pay for. It looked so cute but it is so tight it will break and is unfixable or will give you headache.</li>
            <li> The head band is very cute and not too tight!  I hope it last for a while and doesn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s color.</li>
            <li> it as described, affordable, looks durable, will recommend to friends and family. it as described, affordable, looks durable, will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a a bigger head than most, but this head band is so tight! the elastic doesn&#x27;t give enough, and I ended up breaking metal chain attempting to get it over my head to slip it on. It is very pretty, and if you don&#x27;t mind the migraine it will give you it&#x27;s a pretty piece. I might try to take the chain off and replace the elastic.</li>
            <li> The product is really small, i think this was meant for a child or someone with a really small head but the flowers are really pretty.</li>
            <li> Much nicer in person. Totally worth it. It&#x27;s cute and pretty and I know who I bought this for will absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> DONT EVEN WASTE .99 cents.  Broke as soon as I put it on.  So tight.  Once you stretch it it go on, the link pops off.  DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I have gotten lots of complements on this head band.  It fits well.  The only downside was that it took forever to get here.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this hair band. When I wear it i get many compliments and people are surprised when I tell them I got it off of Amazon. I love it and would recommend. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap either and it is very comfortable!</li>
            <li> I love it , its very pretty. It IS a little tight, I think I would recommend the seller include an extra gold ring to adjust the size if need be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly afraid to put this on... the gold chain doesn&#x27;t make the head piece the most elastic. I can understand how a bunch of people had theres break first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered: July 21st, Arrived August 3rd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Looks like the picture&lt;br /&gt;2. Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Would probably fit a child better than an adult&lt;br /&gt;2. Easily breakable&lt;br /&gt;3. Get stuck in hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to put it on without breaking:&lt;br /&gt;1. Only stretch the black elastic part, do not even touch the gold when you&#x27;re placing over your head.&lt;br /&gt;2. have your hair be as flat as possible (so don&#x27;t try to put it on after you curl it or something) I pulled mine into a low ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;3. Style your hair with the headband around your neck.&lt;br /&gt;4. To place it on head have chin all the way to your chest and let it just fall onto your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: I like it alot more as a necklace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in looove with this hair band! I was looking for one like this for too long and then I discover this one! It was totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I have been eyeing this product for a while and decided to go for it. when I opened my envelope the flowers looked scratchy on the edges and cheap. The links that keep the flowers together are even worst than the flowers, I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;ll break one day when I try putting it on. The headband itself was really hard to put on and was tight on my head :( Because it was so tight I began to develop a headache and was only able to wear the headband for about 20 minutes. Taking it off was also a hassle because the flowers were pulling my hair and tangling it. I would not recommend this to an adult, maybe a child because it is cute but small. I&#x27;m thinking of giving this to my little cousin because I&#x27;m never wearing this again.</li>
            <li> I  think it is a cute hair band but it was to tight around my head so its only for people with small heads.</li>
            <li> it never showed up and it is not the same as the pic!</li>
            <li> Fits on my head nicely and it&#x27;s super cute. Doesn&#x27;t fall off and it stays in place, and I received it a week early.</li>
            <li> This hair brand is for kids. I tried to put it on, and it broke instantly. The design is just awful.</li>
            <li> The second I put this headband around my head, like it showed in the picture, it broke.  It was made with flimsy material and it was a waste of my money.  Do not buy this unless you are willing for it to break before you even put it on your head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister because she loved the picture. She thinks it is very sturdy and cute. She is generally very picky, and she liked it.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and poor quality broke when recieved it.</li>
            <li> it was way to small and tight, and it gets stuck to your hair since it has metal pieces. It is really pretty and the service was really nice, but I gave it to my niece</li>
            <li> It is very cute. I, honestly, expected it to be terrible quality, but it is not(:&lt;br /&gt;you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This headband ripped as soon as I tried to put it on. Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend it. Hate it.</li>
            <li> Nice headband but slides off and needs to be longer. It is a bit to snug and I can&#x27;t wear for that long. Nice though</li>
            <li> Great price free shipping not tooo tight on my head. could dress up a messy hair style. I want to order more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit too tight on my head, but it&#x27;s so sturdy and pretty that i deal with the pain, LOL.</li>
            <li> This is sharp and your hair gets tangled up in it and you will lose hair when you take the headband off. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This headband Broke when I put it on the first time. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> the roses on the headband are smaller then they look in the picture, but still very cute. A little tight for my head but will make a great girt. Shipped sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> It fits but after awhile I start to get a headache. It doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair too much if I take it out carefully.</li>
            <li> This headband is really cute. It took a while to arrive, and it&#x27;s a bit small, but I consider myself to have a big head so I&#x27;m sure it fits fine on normal girl&#x27;s heads ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few head bands online and never had a problem. This one is super small. I can get it on my head but can only wear it for 5 seconds before I&#x27;m in pain. Can&#x27;t adjust it or anything, at least it was cheap. I&#x27;ll probably turn it into decor for my purse. If you have a small head then it may work for you! It is cute though</li>
            <li> It was nice for the price, for the 3 or 4 times I was able to wear it before it broke. You get what you pay for, I guess? I&#x27;m hoping to fix it, but the quality certainly isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> This is a very cute headband and a very good price for it.  It broke the first time I wore it. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> It is really cute, but it gets stuck in my hair and really hurts to get it out.  I haven&#x27;t worn it at all except to try it on</li>
            <li> Even on small heads, does not fit well, hair gets caught in the flowers on the band frequently, very painful.  Item is very pretty, however.</li>
            <li> I can fit a youth size four wheeler helmet so I didn&#x27;t think the size would matter much. In the picture it looks like it has some leave-way to stretch and such but it doesn&#x27;t really stretch at all. I put it on and immediately had to take it off because it was way too tight. It&#x27;s adorable though and despite the fact that it&#x27;s too small, it seems like it&#x27;s very durable and I don&#x27;t think it would break unless someone was really trying to.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased at all in the headband it looked cheap and when I put it  on it felt uncomfortable on my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it was so cute and perfect for a few of my outfits, turns out I was right! It&#x27;s a little fragile so be careful stretching it too much</li>
            <li> i gave this product a one star. yes, it arrived fast, yes it is cute, but it broke right when i put it on my head. im not mad or anything, i payed less that $2 but it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it. Product came via postal service ~ when I open it, it is already broken ( the chain ) ~ so disappointing .&lt;br /&gt;Also too tight. Can not go around my head . Such a waste of money</li>
            <li> It takes a LONG time to arrive (nearly 2 months) but once I got it, I put it on the next day and I love it. It&#x27;s awesome and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it to work and to job interviews.</li>
            <li> This head band is quite beautiful, I was worried it would be a little tight after going through the reviews ( i have to say it is a little tight but I prefer it that way ) but It looks exactly like the picture it would be a great necklace too if you decided to let your hair down. This is highly recommended especially for the matter of the price and the quality.</li>
            <li> This head piece was very small and the gold roses dig into your scalp. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> The seller was quick with their shipment and it arrived securely. The headband fit my head perfectly and I have a wider head. It felt secure even after I wore it all day long. And the metallic flowers looked very high-end. I received several compliments on it!</li>
            <li> This head band was cute, but it was made to fit the head of a new born. I think it was made in china where humans are small though so it makes sense...</li>
            <li> Headband is beautiful but broke first time it was tried on a 13 yr olds head.  No way the quality of this headband is made to be used as a headband.  Tiny, cheap breakable rings attach each &amp;#34;flower&amp;#34; which all spread apart and broke when placed on the head. :(</li>
            <li> It was tiny! It broke before I even put it on my head. I ended up getting a refund. Don&#x27;t wast your time.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to buy a seemingly beautiful headband at such a low price. When I received it in the mail, however, it snapped apart as soon as I tried putting it on my head. It was so small that it would not have fit my 12 year old sister&#x27;s head, much less mine. Will not be buying from Fashionwu ever again.</li>
            <li> it is very beautiful，but it is not strong enough. when i try to put it on my hair it broke. the metal ring that holds flower and rubber thogether become open when i try to pull it.</li>
            <li> I love it...super cute but also fancy..u can almost wear it with anything..fits very well..its a most have and its very affordable</li>
            <li> Its very pretty but what am I going to do with it? It broke the second I tried it on. The elastic part is too tight and what is holding the metal to the elastic is just a tiny ring that swings open when there is pressure (the pulling of the band being stretched). I might find  a different elastic to fix it and maybe wear it but as of now I still have not been able to wear it. I waited for over a month to get it, and paid very little but definitely not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This headband is too small for an adult, and very cheaply made. The first time it was tried on, one of the tiny clips bent and it fell apart. Also, the tiny clips that connect the flowers catch on the hair, so they mess up hair while putting it on, and then pull hair while trying to take it off. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This hair band is exactly as pictured and will fit and stay in place on the average size head (though probably not a small child). The metal can tend to pull your hair so just be gentle when you take it off</li>
            <li> This is a different picture for the product then they had a couple months ago. Also, I never recieved my headband. I didnt pay much and im glad.</li>
            <li> this did not appear as shown in the picture the picture is of a flower made with material but the one that arrived was made with pure with metal so the picture is wrong but it is still pretty</li>
            <li> It broke, like...straight out of the envelope. I didn&#x27;t even get it on my head- and no, my head is not large. I have been thinking about just sewing the flowers on to a new headband, but the metal is literally so soft that would probably break too. But hey, what did you expect for less than a dollar?</li>
            <li> It broke while I was putting it on. Cheap metal, crappy quality. It&#x27;s like something I would buy out of those 25 cent vending machines. Except those things usually last longer.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this piece for only a dollar on Amazon. Forever 21 has this item for 8 dollars a piece. I would not have purchased this piece if not for a dollar. Kind of tight around the head.</li>
            <li> Broke the first day I recieved it, was never able to wear it. Should make it stronger for big heads &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Very cute. I love it. Stays in place really well. It was a little too big for my head... All elastic headbands usually are.. no complaint there. I just tied the elastic in a knot and it fits perfect and looks good. Great low price. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> First impression is that it is really cute and looks good on. My big problem is the smell of metal from the roses, almost like a cheap metal smell. It also makes my hands smell like metal after touching.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stay in place on my head so if you have straight, thin hair it probably wont stay.</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty it fit a lil to tight and it don&#x27;t stretch much but i would buy it again for the price</li>
            <li> So they sent me the uglier headband, instead of the one with little flowers all connected. In addition to that, it was broken with pieces of it hanging off. Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Too small for my average size head. It also came tarnished in some areas, but cute. Can&#x27;t be mad, it was crazy inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It would be 4 stars except for the fact that it is a bit small, so you have to be careful not to break it, it is delicate.</li>
            <li> Since I have shorter hair, adding style to my hair can well, be difficult. So this really assists in those with shorter hair to add just a little bit of bling to their style!</li>
            <li> I love these! This is the 2nd time I have bought this. Not because they broke but because I wanted to give them as gifts.</li>
            <li> I love love love this ! Looks &amp; fits great.&lt;br /&gt;Actually bought a few more as gifts ! Gave me a whole new look.</li>
            <li> The band is quite small; however the linked roses really helps with the fitting. Although the jumpers sometimes come lose.</li>
            <li> it looks pretty but not flexible enough, hurt hair and also too tight.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s okay to be a necklace though!!!</li>
            <li> It looks pretty but the metal clasps aren&#x27;t closed and smoothed all of the way, so it pulls on your hair a ton and is tricky to get into place. This was too small for my head and might be better for a child?</li>
            <li> I am a regular 19year old college student and Iam a size small in clothes and my head is average size but when I put this headband on it was really tight, It looks adorable but maybe for a 10 year old or something I thnik the sizing from where it was inported is a lot different from the US.</li>
            <li> Never received it. Didn&#x27;t mean to rate of course since I have nothing to review after I waited sooo long</li>
            <li> This item came completely different than pictured, it is not the same headband.</li>
            <li> The picture is NOT what I received in the mail!!!! I am not happy at all!!!! If I could give it no stars i would</li>
            <li> EVERYONE LIKES MY HEADBAND. I LOVE IT AND IT IS SO GOOD QUALITY. I LOVE GOLD AND IT LOOKS GREAT ON.</li>
            <li> This headband is very pretty for the money.  While obviously for the price it&#x27;s plastic, it actually looks very nice and not cheap at all.  I think that if you bought this in a box store, you would pay at least triple the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, the black elastic part of it is not nearly long enough.  So while I was able to momentarily stretch it onto my head, it felt like a vise and then instantly it slid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to pass it along to a friend who has two girls and maybe it will fit one of them,</li>
            <li> I really like this, I was surprised that for the price of it, it didn&#x27;t break the first time I used it. Actually looks nice and fits my head well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about the hair band is really sucky&lt;br /&gt;First it is small and hard to put on.&lt;br /&gt;You have to stretch it out and put it in back of the head first then&lt;br /&gt;Pull it forward! Complicated!!! Then the roses are much smaller in person&lt;br /&gt;They get tangled in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Last it is really tight&lt;br /&gt;I love how it looks..... for like 10 minutes then my head starts hurting... from how tight it is.</li>
            <li> I got the head band it is very pretty but after wearing it on and off for a month the color changed it not gold or silver now</li>
            <li> Cute head band, but won&#x27;t work for big headed people like myself. I ended up breaking and injuring myself the first time putting it on. I am still trying to work with it though, worse comes to worse I will create a bracelet out of it.</li>
            <li> I wore this the other day and got sooo many compliments on it.I wish I had bought more! I really like it</li>
            <li> This digs into my head when it stays on. I can&#x27;t get it to stay on my head and then it gets stuck on my hair and messes it up...glad it wasnt expensive</li>
            <li> The headband is cute looking, but very cheaply made. Too small to fit an adults head and too flimsy to fit a childs head. It broke moments after I opened it. Guess you get what you pay for. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> this headband is gorgeous. doesnt slip off like most headbands. tje flowers are pretty and dainty. does many e seem like it would break if stretched too far.</li>
            <li> broke 2nd time wearing. and EXTREMELY tight on your head. just definition of cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;save your buck and get a redbox or something..</li>
            <li> I love it I got it in yesterday but the thing that sucks is that you have to be really careful in how you put it on or you might break it.&lt;br /&gt;something  I did just the next day that i got it -__- i&#x27;m so mad</li>
            <li> Completely happy with this item. It seems to be made well, looks gorgeous, and feels comfortable on.  I will be looking for more.</li>
            <li> Way too small. Looks just as cheap as you&#x27;d expect but couldn&#x27;t even fit it over my head. I already threw it away as it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> cheap and flimsy,too small for my head and usually things are too big for my head! And it broke! In not one but two places. Disappointed, I want my money back</li>
            <li> It broke 5 minutes after I bought it... I litter ally took it out of the package put it on and it broke</li>
            <li> This headband is so pretty in person.  It is very very well made with strong clasps between the flowers so it holds well and doesn&#x27;t break.  I wear it a few times a week and other people always compliment me on it.</li>
            <li> Fell apart the first time I tried to use it. Boo. I bought two in case they were cheaply made. Yes, they are.</li>
            <li> Thias product has 652 reviews at the time that I type this review. This may be the product with the most reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider my review 1.5 stars. It is very pretty but it is made for very petite people and not full-sized adult women from any non-Asian country. The product is made and ships from China. I can&#x27;t wear it, as is. I&#x27;m going to figure out how to make it bigger but, you know, the modification attempt will never work out. The band was so tight, it felt like an instant headache.  The flowers pulled hair as I took this off my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just talked myself from reducing the rating to 1 star instead of 2, but it&#x27;s still only 1.5 honest rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS read the negative reviews before you buy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this in my mail.&lt;br /&gt;But when i attempted to try it on, It broke.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t even expand it past my eyes before it snapped. Thankfully my head didn&#x27;t get hurt, but it snapped against my hand (it broke skin)&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful and check all part before trying it on. I got lucky and didn&#x27;t injure my eyes. *shudders*</li>
            <li> this is very nice and attractive, I received a lot of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;it gives you a pretty look! however, the color when you get sweating goes off a little but still good to wear&lt;br /&gt;It is beautiful :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product however I ordered it January 30th and I just received it in the mail yesterday March 3rd! On top of that there is no tracking the package available for this -____- Also be careful because your hair can get caught on the rose pedals if your hair is frizzy. Other than that it is worth the price of the product and I actually do like the product. It is a very cute head band :)</li>
            <li> The headband is just way too small. I dont know whos head this would fit. It should definitely be made larger.</li>
            <li> It is defiantly a cute headband although I do not have that large of a head and it is pretty tight. Wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! This just don&#x27;t worth your time nor your money! It is very bad quality and it got broken second time I was trying to wear it...very high price for a disposable item!</li>
            <li> THE BAND DID NOT HOLD FOR VERY LONG WHEN I OUT IT ON MY HEAD. THE RUBBER BAND CAME OFF</li>
            <li> cheap and broke, but you get what you pay for. Its also too tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strechy. SO when i put it on for the first time it broke. Avoid it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Price seem to be very little. But don&#x27;t waste a penny on this product.</li>
            <li> The only reason i ordered this is because i had only a few bucks left on my account and needed to spend it. Don&#x27;t buy this. I couldn&#x27;t even put it on my head it was so tight and then when i tried it broke. I have fixed it at least 6 times now and it has broken every time. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was for an adult. It is clearly a child sized headband, it&#x27;s pretty cute but does me no good seeing as it won&#x27;t fit. :(</li>
            <li> This is a really cute headband.  I do like it but my only problem with it is that you have to put it on using a particular side so it doesnt pull your hair because of the way the metal meets (or doesnt meet) in this case.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this headband. It was a great price and so far it has not broken. Great deal on this headband!</li>
            <li> I love cute headbands and this one imediately caught my eye!&lt;br /&gt;Assembled very nicely, the metal part in the back doesn&#x27;t bother or interfere at all.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;BUUUUTTTt not the best for curly hair. I have long, dark, curly hair and though it looks amazing it hurts coming out! But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I think this is for a child and it should be advertised as such. broke the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> It broke the first day I got it. It was very very small aswell&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty but no good as soon as you strech it to go over your head it snaps</li>
            <li> I bought this headband not really expecting too much out of it. Just a fun little hair accessory for a few different days but when I got it, it totally shocked me.&lt;br /&gt;it looks just like the one in the picture, same color and everything.&lt;br /&gt;really cute flowers and looks amazing in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I do not regret buying this.&lt;br /&gt;totally worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> When purchasing this headband please take into consideration that the stretched out size of the band is smaller than expected.  I purchased it as part of a Halloween costume and ended up giving it to my youngest granddaughter since she has a much smaller head than I.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package and pulled out the headband, I was shocked at the quality. It surpassed any expectations I had, it is a beautiful headband. Unfortunately, I gave this beautiful headband to Mom, as she was eyeballing my new headband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I just ordered another headband for myself. I&#x27;m very pleased with the headband.</li>
            <li> I like it very much not sure how long it will last since it seems a little un-sturdy...but has not broken and I hope it does not because its my only headband right now. I love it so much</li>
            <li> Love it!  Worth the wait! Very nice product.  My daughter loves it! Great buy.  Easy to use.  Stays in place.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and I have never had a headband that fit me quite like this one nor have had it look this cute!</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying: I loooooove this. But it was apparently made with people with Elf sized heads because upon putting it on the first time it snapped and broke without any force. The price is low, but that may be why. A little advice for you Amazon shoppers: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> It is not more than it purports to be.  Maybe that&#x27;s worth a 5, but not quite.  Imagination on the part of the wearer would help.</li>
            <li> It took forever to come &amp; when I opened it, I thought it looked cheap. I will not be giving it as a gift, as planned.</li>
            <li> Fun little headband.  Easy to wear.  Looks cute on.  I don&#x27;t usually wear headbands so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this. I have auburn hair and this is very complimenting with my hair color. It is tight and does not move once in place. Would recommend this to any girl/lady who likes accessories.</li>
            <li> I like it. Every once in awhile my hair tangles in it and that sucks. However, it looks so cute that I&#x27;m willing to put up with it. Plus, it was uber-cheap.</li>
            <li> I just got this is the mail and it is adorable! It fits my head perfectly and the roses are just the right size. Plan on wearing it out tonight!</li>
            <li> I bought a few months ago but it changed colors. this isn&#x27;t the exact one I&#x27;ve purchased it looks like gold coins. I wear it still on occasions but I wished it would&#x27;ve changed colors so quickly. Purchase at your own risk. It&#x27;s very nice for certain events. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter and It fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product is very pretty but pulls the hair.  We now use it as a headband around our forehead instead of it&#x27; intended use</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was not disappointed. It&#x27;s a great buy for $3. It did take a while to ship, but that&#x27;s understandable. It&#x27;s pretty and makes any crazy hair fair look better. It does slide off though</li>
            <li> The headband was really pretty, but it slides off very easily. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else has the same problem, or if it is just me.</li>
            <li> this is beautiful and would be really pretty in your hair but the roses get stuck in my hair and I have to pick them out. I want something with less fuss and pain. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A little tight and the links between flowers are too tight or something, because it&#x27;s stiff and doesn&#x27;t move easily, and the elastic part was put on twisted (an easy fix by opening the fastening ring). The flowers are almost exactly the size of a dime. It really is beautiful, it&#x27;s just so tight that it slid backwards and fell off when i put it on. A better/stretchier elastic would be great.</li>
            <li> Cute very inexpensive.  I like it and I normally don&#x27;t wear head bands because of how they look. Thank u</li>
            <li> Ok it is SMALL. When your put it on your head be carful  because your hair can get caught between the flowers and all.&lt;br /&gt;I have a small head, as been told be many people. So I don&#x27;t use it for a head band. Just a hassle and my head feels like it&#x27;s being strangled when wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I use it as a necklace- seeing if you can get in/out of your head. Looks nice when I put on with one of my collared shirts. But some picky people well comment if that&#x27;s a headband your wearing around your neck there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping came fast I guess, didn&#x27;t forget it about it during the time so yeah.&lt;br /&gt;Quality good-tight  I LIKE IT, yes would recommend to some friends with small heads, younger ages.</li>
            <li> It broke instantly . Cheap material and just not worth it. I regret buying it and it&#x27;s just really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great price. Cute design. Excellent fit… I&#x27;ve worn it often and it hasn&#x27;t stretch out. Got one for all the little girls in my family.</li>
            <li> It is way too tight to wear. As soon as I put it on, it slide right off the back of my head. The clasps that join each little flower are open clasps that catch your hair and make it a very difficult mess to get off.</li>
            <li> This took almost 2 months to arrive, though that was within the delivery estimate. I didn&#x27;t even try it on, though. It looks like the metal would really snag your hair. Plus, it was quite small, so I knew it would give me a headache.</li>
            <li> Really cute but it is pretty tight on my head. But hey for the price I cant complain! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> i love headbands and this one is so cute and comfy. l cant wait to order more headbands woo woo</li>
            <li> The reviews about it being small are unfortunately true. I feel like these would be better suited for a small child. I am going to try and put more metal links on it to make it larger and to fix it. Its cute and of good quality, but it was just too small. Trying it on for the first time, it broke. So I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really love this head band. It&#x27;s Gold color and the design is very nice and does stay on your head very well. The cons are that once its on it stays on when you remove it be vary careful because it will pull your hair not too much that it will hurt only it will mess up your hair design and have to start all over. Also the band is twisted, but its not a huge problem because no one will see it anyways.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the materials weren&#x27;t cheap feeling. I love it its cute and unique. I got allot  of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> It was so adorable I was thrilled when it arrived. When I finally took it out of the packaging and went to slip it over my head the chain links snapped and it broke. Very disappointed I was very happy with its appearance</li>
            <li> cheap and okay.&lt;br /&gt;the only down side is that it hurts my head and gives me massive headaches when i wear it</li>
            <li> When I saw it at the low price it was at, I thought I would get it. It was really cute, and when I got it, I thought it was really beautiful. I stretched it to put it on, and it instantly snapped! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I bought the product thinking it would be good quality and cute and it took almost two months to arrive also it broke within the first two to three days and the clasps and the flowers on the headband got stuck in my hair my opinion don&#x27;t waist your money on this product</li>
            <li> This has no elasticity and broke right away. It is cheaply made (which that is what you get for cheap products sometimes) and very tight on the head.</li>
            <li> It was pretty but broke the same day i got it! That wasnt right, i would expect it to at least last a couple of months</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s very cute it broke with in the first few seconds of putting it on. Luckily I could fix it..</li>
            <li> The black elestic broke after the 3rd time i was wearing it. It just snapped right in half. will not  buy this product again</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I tried to wear it, because it was way too tight. The metal flowers just snapped.</li>
            <li> I wore it for not that long and it broke. Cheap product.I would not suggest this product. On the plus side it is pretty.</li>
            <li> You really get a quality product for a cheep price.  This is something that I can wear or my daughter can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s easy to wear. My wife likes it. It&#x27;s a bit more stylish than a regular head band.</li>
            <li> Broke on the first use. Liked it so much and didn&#x27;t get to even wear out one time. Pretty dissapointing.</li>
            <li> It was pretty, but got tangled in hair easily. The headband broke after 1 use. It was cheaply made and not good quality.</li>
            <li> The headband broke the second I got it on. It didn&#x27;t cost much, so I&#x27;m not really worried about it. It&#x27;s a shame though, because it was so cute!</li>
            <li> it looks almost same like the picture but too tight for head and it broke in 2nd use. i dont recommend it</li>
            <li> I got this headband and I love it&lt;br /&gt;Its absolutely beautiful and looks great. however, I dont know how long will it last. it doesnt feel very durable</li>
            <li> I rated 4 star because it is a little bit hard to wear on head.  It is very nice though.</li>
            <li> I love this head band I bought it along with the donut bun maker and together they look perfect for the hot summer days. it arrived in perfect condition. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, love it. Super cute and adds a touch of fab to any outfit. Was kinda hard to put on since the flowers are all chained together, like they turn one way while the other flower is going the opposite as you&#x27;re trying to put it on. But overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and happy with my purchase. Really cheap as well, when I bought it, it was three for $1.50 but I only wanted one, paying only 50 cents.</li>
            <li> sweet lady rose necklace/ haur band. beautiful. elegant as necklace or hair band. dress up or dress down. shiny and cute</li>
            <li> Love it, but is very tight con head.stretched in time</li>
            <li> I received many compliments from the first day I wore it! It also stayed in place and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The headband is very pretty. However it is too small to go around my head. When i did try to put it on, the elastic being too sturdy did&#x27;not stretch at all and broke right off the rose chain. Not a good buy, though the quality of the metallic roses is good.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected far less. I have very fine hair and this is the first headband ive ever had that doesn&#x27;t slip off my head. Love it and would have paid a lot more for it.</li>
            <li> It is like in pics. seems good quality. Good value for money. Fits well, not too small not too large. Roses are quite golden but not gaudy.</li>
            <li> This is really cute and I definitely would have paid 5 bucks for it so in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it. I was expecting the metal to be thin but this has some weight to it. It did get caught in my hair and pulled some hairs out but to be fair I have curly hair so it was expected lol. I&#x27;ll definitely wear this when I straighten my hair!</li>
            <li> My sister broke it in a week, but I guess that is to be expected since she breaks stuff in weeks. It could be more elastic though, but it looks great.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I hoped it would be. I would totally recomend it to everybody. My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Loved it but broke easily.wish it was better quality.the gold color its nice but does not really stretch.broke apart first time I put it on</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to put it on it snapped in half. I&#x27;m a pretty small person and I cannot comprehend how this would fit anybody. Worst purchase ever.</li>
            <li> This headband wouldnt even fit around my head! I have a normal sized head! very pretty but cheaply made, i bought two and both snapped as I was putting them on for the first time. I was even extra careful with the second one because the first one broke</li>
            <li> I like it because it fits good but not tight and doesn&#x27;t hurt. Its simple but very cute and I can wear it with anything!</li>
            <li> This hair band was a excellent choice I made for my daughter..It is very stylish when she wears it..She is always getting complaints about it</li>
            <li> This headband is super pretty wasn&#x27;t Disappointed at all. It gets stuck in my hair a lot. The paint is kinda coming off after months of wearing it.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this for her 14th birthday from her 8 year old brother. It looks cute on her. This item is prettier than pictured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a cheap thrill. It&#x27;s not made to last for the dollar you pay for it. You get what you are paying for. After a week, the headband changed to a patchy bronze color. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
            <li> Cute for teenagers. I actually ordered it for Halloween, but the shipping process took way to long, so I had to buy a different one.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and it shipped fast considering it was from overseas. I normally run into issues with headbands staying in place but this one doesn&#x27;t require me to place multiple bobbie pins around it to secure it.</li>
            <li> The headband is exactly as pictured. It&#x27;s very lightweight, well-made, &amp; the circumference is large enough that I don&#x27;t get a headache wearing it. The metal links catch in my hair a little, but that is the nature of metal hair accessories. That said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this hair band for people with fine and/or thin hair. All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is cute, but it&#x27;s very delicate, and it gets caught in your hair, making it pretty painful to wear. I don&#x27;t see it lasting long..</li>
            <li> I love this hair band it is such an easy way to add elegance to your look. I think the quality is great and I would consider purchasing more for friends and family.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much since it was so inexpensive but this was a great purchase. Overall, pleasantly surprised and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Will make a nice stocking stuffer for any age. I&#x27;m a little concerned it will slide out of our hair.</li>
            <li> This headband is very pretty &amp; doesn&#x27;t get caught in your hair, but the elastic is very tight on my scalp. I was able to wear it for about 4 hours before I had to take if off because it was irritating me.</li>
            <li> I love this head band - it&#x27;s delicate, yet bold - but not too flashy. And excellent compliment to a cute outfit!</li>
            <li> I like this so much. but oh my goodness does it ever get tingled in your hair! ugh! really cute though! :)</li>
            <li> I love it! I was expecting something more cheap, but is really beautiful! I get a lot of compliments. Love it.</li>
            <li> Cant really say anything about the quality of the headband because mine was never derived.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest it to anyone, its a waste of a dollar!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and fit my large head perfectly. It&#x27;s a little on the flimsy side and could break easily. Buyer be aware before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I chose this head piece because I wanted something a little more than just a band but with little bling.</li>
            <li> pping sucks thats all I can say for now. will update as soon as I get it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I received this and it looked nothing like the picture.. The metal was so thick and the headland was so small it wouldn&#x27;t even fit my 3 year old sister. But I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear with a messy bun- kind of a romantic hairstyle. I like it, the roses were just big enough without being obnoxious and it stayed in place pretty well. (I am not sure the review will show the exact one I purchased- but it was the one with gold metal roses and a black elastic in the back).&lt;br /&gt;I think it was well made, however, once you put it in place do not move it because the links will get caught in your hair and ruin the style (if hair is secured). I would suggest once you get it where you want it, try to secure it somehow so you don&#x27;t ruin the whole hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I get lot sod compliments on this headband. I wish they had a silver one too! It was a bit tight and I simply stretched it out a little before wearing since i get headaches from too tight of headbands.</li>
            <li> This fits great and I get a lot of compliments on it. It comes exactly as pictured and made well.</li>
            <li> for $1 something i thought it would not be good, but i was surprised. not bad quality, size is great ( the roses aren&#x27;t tiny ; which sometimes happens..) its really beautiful! and greater because its super cheap! def buying more!</li>
            <li> This is very pretty. A classic look that anyone can wear. It seems to be made of quality materials. My daughters and I enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself. It is very cute and looks lovely in my hair. It does not like to stay in place. I have to move it back a few times in the day. It likes to catch your hair as well. Its worth the work for how cute it is.</li>
            <li> Just got it today! Very pretty good quality n not tight!:) I really love it! Only thing is it can get caught in ur hair a little:/ but not too bad:)</li>
            <li> This headband is so cute! I was surprised. And it is comfortable, i can&#x27;t feel it poking or anything. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This arrived fairly quickly - from China.  It was given as a gift.  The lady has worn it several times now and is quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but very cheap and gets stuck in my hair lol</li>
            <li> I love it! I didn&#x27;t realize the flower part of the headband is actually metal! i thought it was just gold cloth or something. It&#x27;s super pretty and looks amazing! It takes a while to get here because it ships from China, but for the price it&#x27;s definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair band I get tons of compliments when I&#x27;m at work but one thing that I don&#x27;t like is the fact that it pulls my hair when I am taking it off...its hurts but not enough for me to stop wearing it lol</li>
            <li> I love this headband! It&#x27;s delicate looking but well made, light weight, and comfortable. For the price it&#x27;s a great purchase!</li>
            <li> This hair band is poorly crafted.  It has all of these hooks between each rose that gets caught in your hair.  Then while trying to put it on it broke.  This is a piece of crap and I&#x27;m glad I spent less than $2 on it.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on money on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.  It was so inexpensive it was worth buying and taking the risk of it being broken.  I get a lot of complements on it.</li>
            <li> Well , it was sorta tight on my head. it felt like it was gonna break any minute , but it feels very sturdy</li>
            <li> Hard to get over your head just to get it on as a headband. The flowers get caught on your hair. The elastic band broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> Very playful and cute without looking shabby! Definitely worth the $2 I spent on it.  I would like to find more like this. I love all of the compliments I get when I wear it!</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to put it around my head, it snapped and broke :( It looks really cute though!</li>
            <li> This one is beautiful and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my daughter. My daughter love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Do not even bother purchasing this item. The minute I tried this item it broke in the middle. The material is very cheap and the hooks that keeps the metal pieces together are very loose. Poorly made. Don&#x27;t even buy this.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these: 1 for me and 2 as gifts.. I got alot of compliments when I wore it as a necklace. My sister wore hers as a headband and got alot of compliments too! It does get a little caught in your hair at times but it really didnt pull my hair or break my hair. TIP: when putting it on stretch the bottom part that&#x27;s elastic and try very hard not to pull on the metal.</li>
            <li> This looks so cute on Tubby, The Snuggabull Pitbull.  She can be found on Facebook at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a Diva (in the most positive and complimentary form of the word!), who always dresses very well, so this was a lovely addition to her wardrobe.</li>
            <li> I have a big head.  I wear a size L adult helmet.  Beanies have been known to pop up off of my head.  So I should have known better, but this was so cute, and I thought maybe since it was half elastic that it maybe just maybe would fit... well, it didn&#x27;t.  Not by a long shot.  But I don&#x27;t think it was just me -- the headband I received wouldn&#x27;t have fit someone with even an average sized head.  I repackaged this and gave it to my 6yo niece for Christmas, and it fit her like a gem.  Oh well.  The niece loved it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this headband. Great product for the price. She still wears it and has had it for about a year now.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty hair band, but  I only got to wear it once because it broke as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li> Really...  I know the hairband should be tight so that it can hold the hair.  However, this one is waaay tooo tight.  I can&#x27;t think with it on.  It also doesn&#x27;t hold the hair in a flattering way.  Because it&#x27;s so tight, it pushes the hair flat on your head.  On the bright note, it&#x27;s cheap, so I could use it as a hair tie.  It&#x27;s very pretty, but just doesn&#x27;t work as a headband if you are an adult.</li>
            <li> I loved this but it was too small for my head. I gave it to my mom but it broke the first time she used it :( but i was able to get it back together&lt;br /&gt;i would like it if maybe it could come a little bigger</li>
            <li> This headband is so small for anyone&#x27;s head and way to tight. The rubber band that the flowers are attached too doesnt really stretch and wouldnt be able to fit a normal persons head. gave me a headache!</li>
            <li> This is so well made and very inexpensive. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it as much as I do, but it is a stunning piece :)</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price this headband was good quality.  It fits well and I love the gold. I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> WORST PRODUCT EVER!!! Do not buy this product,it broke the second time i tried to put it on. I tried to fix it and it broke! it may look cute,but it does not have very good quality,it is very cheap!!</li>
            <li> The hair band was better than expected, after I bought it I realized it could look cheap but it is fabulous, I love it, very delicate and elegant. Would recommend it for sure. It also arrived earlier than expected, not even after the estimated delivery date!</li>
            <li> I love this headband!! I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it!! It is very stylish and beautiful!! highly reccomend!! The headband with the two big wihite flowers is not what I recieved as they are advertising, I received a goldish flower hippie headband! And I love it. I gues they are out of them and are now offering this kind.</li>
            <li> I love this headband far by one of the cutest I&#x27;ve bought and such a great price! It was exactly what I wanted something to hold my hair back yet still look fashionable. It sometimes get&#x27;s caught in my hair but very satisfied.</li>
            <li> you will get what you paid for. do not waste your money. IF you expected better quality, it&#x27;s your fault.</li>
            <li> very cute and not cheaply made. the metals thick and well made. it will not stay on my head very well im still trying to figure that out.</li>
            <li> I get rave reviews about this headband. everyone loves it.  It&#x27;s very cute, but does kind of cause some head pain by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The headband looks really cute,the quality is not the best but for the price is okay. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> When I got this product, it looked just like the picture which I am very pleased because sometimes sellers will send something similar to the picture. I gave this product 4 stars because it is beautiful and all, however I wished that the headband would stretch more where the flowers are located. I was being very careful in trying the headband out because I didn&#x27;t want it to break if I stretched it over my head too far.</li>
            <li> It broke the very first time I put it on. Very disappointed, as it is cute. Good think it was super cheap</li>
            <li> In attempt to putting this item on my head it broke instantly I was extremely gentle cheap proud it waist of money</li>
            <li> I have an average Asian head but this head band was very tight. However it was very cute and works with a lot of dresses that i have.</li>
            <li> I loved this. I wore it a lot so it did begin to change colors but over all I was very satisfied with this and it did its job.I would order again</li>
            <li> Very cute! Looks more expensive that it is. Overall good purchase. The item arrived as expected and on time. I am happy with it!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, metal finish, nice color, fits with all clothes and hair, can wear it with casual or elegant outfits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite cute and goes with any outfit. The size is a bit small and it fits tight around my head.</li>
            <li> This thing was so small and so tight that it was painful.  I gave it to my daughter and the first time she put it on it broke within the hour.</li>
            <li> i have never worn anything like this and every time i do people ask me where did i get it. really is pretty.</li>
            <li> My little sister loved it. It&#x27;s pretty although not too stretchy. Doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s still very useful and pretty. I</li>
            <li> I have used it once.&lt;br /&gt;when I saw this after a few months.It turned black ..wastage of money..plz dnt buy</li>
            <li> I guess I have a big head or something because it felt really tight on my head. So then I changed out the elastic for a bigger one that I had at home! It was still too tight! I guess I&#x27;ll reuse the roses to make some other type of jewelry.</li>
            <li> The headband looks the same as it does in the picture.  I really like it.  The headband appears to be durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry to have to report this but although I love the style of the headband, I&#x27;m not sure what size head it is supposed to fit. I&#x27;m usually concerned with headbands being too large for my head but this product is actually way too tight. It&#x27;s disconcerting because I like it and I wish it would work but it was just made very small and now it is unusable.</li>
            <li> Did not fit me very well. But I gave to my daughter to wear, It looks good on her.Thank you;</li>
            <li> The headband broke the first time I put it on. One of the metal connecters broke and the rubber part doesn&#x27;t stretch easily.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different head bands lately and I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality for the price. Will probably purchase more.</li>
            <li> This head band  broke as soon as I tried it on. I had to pull the pieces out of my hair because the gold roses got tangled in my hair instantly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this metallic gold rose flower hair band, it&#x27;s FABULOUS! And super cheap. Can&#x27;t wait to rock it!! :-)</li>
            <li> Because this was so cheap, I thought it would break easily- but it is good material and I love it! Got lots of compliments on it. Definitely will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> this is a nice product. it looks good but the clips that connect each flower is an open hook which catches your hair and it hurts. Also it is a bit small and is a tight squeeze.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly made really well. It gets stuck in my hair all of the time though, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> it was cute verry cheap though</li>
            <li> Is not made large enough to fit over my 8 yr olds head. She doesn&#x27;t have a large head. Pulled apart in the links, when I got that reattached it then pulled apart on the elastic. Will NEVER buy something like this again. Way too cheaply made.</li>
            <li> i was excited to get this product and then right as i was about to place it in my hair it broke :(</li>
            <li> Nice and Easy to wear for your hair, or necklace. i use it as both. i just don&#x27;t have earings to match it with but other than that i like it looks fashionable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable but it&#x27;s VERY small. It&#x27;s more for a pre-teen head than an adult&#x27;s. Very cute though! I am giving it to my sister.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful headband. It was a little small for my head though. Once the seller learned about my problem they quickly refunded my money. I am very pleased with my experience.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this in the mail, but found that it was very small (I promise I don&#x27;t have a huge head, haha!) and not made too well. The gold pieces would come apart from the loops holding them together. I&#x27;m currently stretching it out and I hope I can wear it soon!</li>
            <li> It is super cute...but it broke on the second use. Perhaps I&#x27;ll be able to fix it with a new stretch cord, but then, I don&#x27;t know if it will be worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Quality item, shipped fast. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Affordable and comfortable elastic hairband.  All that, plus it is pretty too.  Have to look on line to see if there are other products from this line.</li>
            <li> The worst thing you can put on your hair, it gets stuck and breaks you hair.  Please don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone I know although it is beautiful. When I got it, I seen that it was very thin, I put it on my head and it snapped. I was very dissatisfied. And that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Or it is too small? Well I think I&#x27;ll save it for my daughter until she is 2 years old since it is not worth my time to return it.</li>
            <li> When the package came at first I was unsure if the headband would even be in one piece(because of packaging)-  lucky for everyone it was! The headband is absolutely gorgeous for the price! It&#x27;s NOT plastic and looks like something I&#x27;d buy from a store where I live. When I began to put it on I did so carefully. Not saying it would break easily, but you really never know. I&#x27;ve worn it about 3 times now and still love it. I can wear it with pretty much everything. I even wore it as a necklace one night! Best of both worlds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it shipped the very next day and I received it in about 3 weeks - a lot sooner than stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing again from Fashionwu very soon!</li>
            <li> It came off my head really easily, and pulls out a lot of hair with it. Though it is very pretty</li>
            <li> This is a complete joke. Like, who puts scratchy metal products in their hair!  Took a month to arrive from an Asian country.  When it finally arrived I took out of plastic bag and it broke.  But honestly, I never would have put this in my hair.  It&#x27;s cheap metal.  What a joke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these one for me and one for my daughter.  The one I gave my daughter broke before getting it over her head and the other one is still fine.  Just depends and the quality of the one you get I guess.</li>
            <li> The hair band is so pretty, I am surprised when I received cause of its delicate. Really good stuff with good price too:)</li>
            <li> I ordered the rose headband and they sent me the leaf one. I&#x27;m soooo upset, I already have the leaf one that I got from another company, I do not need 2. It would be too much hassle trying to return it, so I guess I&#x27;m just going to have to order again and hope they actually send me the right thing this time. Maybe I can give this to a friend or save it in case my other one breaks or something, I don&#x27;t know. Definitely NOT ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> lovely, I really like it, thank you very much.  It&#x27;s good deal for the money, I appreciate it very much.</li>
            <li> too tight didn&#x27;t go over my head to fit, looks good though, will have to get a long black band</li>
            <li> I love this a lot. I like to wear it a lot. It&#x27;s well made and I also get a lot of compliments. But I hate when it gets tangled in my hair or when I go to take it off my hair gets pulled out :( That&#x27;s the only reason why it&#x27;s 4 stars rather than 5. Other than that, I recommend it. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The headband fell apart as soon as I got it and way too tight for head! I do not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> It is so cute, but it&#x27;s so small.  It hurts my head.  It also gets tangled in hair really easily.</li>
            <li> very nice only i have a big head so it slips off need to learn how to do my hair better</li>
            <li> I LOVE this headband however when opened the package they sent me the wrong headband AND it was broken. Remember the price you pay is what you get. I would recommend finding the style from a more reliable source.</li>
            <li> Love the way it looks and how it feels. I love it. Great product. I would buy againg if I had to.</li>
            <li> Great hair piece to add to my collection and what a great price!&lt;br /&gt;It is very dainty and looks great with casual or dressy outfits.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was more to choose from, I would buy more of them!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped from Hong Kong but arrived before it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I am a satisfied customer :-)</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to get here and broke as I was trying it on.  It&#x27;s cute though.  I was able to sew it together.</li>
            <li> I loved it again it was pretty matched my dress I had on its cute . I thought it was great</li>
            <li> Bought two for my two daughters ages 14 and 13 and they both loved them. They wear them constantly. Three thumbs up.</li>
            <li> The shipping took forever. When I had first got it, one of the flowers petals was broken, and that was a downfall. Later, i tried it on that was hard to use, my hair got caught in it multiple times and even ripped a couple strands of my hairs, as cute as the headband is its a pain to get it on.</li>
            <li> Never recieved this headband I got something completely different that I will never wear!! They put the WRONG pic up</li>
            <li> love this headband.  It is very pretty on and it was like the picture.  this headband is very strong but not too tight</li>
            <li> The picture is what i thought i was getting, got something totally different. If you are selling something send what you advertise. Not happy with this transaction</li>
            <li> I may just have a big head , it was pretty tight . My little sister loved it tho!and it&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t pull at the hair like I was afraid it might and it sits lightly on the head so it doesn&#x27;t dig in. It arrived well packaged and speedily.</li>
            <li> I think I only paid like $1 for this, and it&#x27;s so more than worth that. It&#x27;s the same quality of those headbands you see at the department store for $5. I would be careful with it because it is a little fragile, but still, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this product, I get compliments on it all the time, everyone wants one. I&#x27;m in love with them</li>
            <li> This headband is really pretty and looks good in your hair but if you have curly hair it gets easily tangled in your hair. All the little flowers can get tangled in your hair when you are trying to take it out. I still wear it but I make sure I don&#x27;t just pull it off and make sure I am in front a mirror. But its super cute.</li>
            <li> This thing fell apart as soon as I put it on. It would be really cute but the elastic portion is so tight that the weak links between the metal part just bend and fall apart.</li>
            <li> came faster than expected and nice for the price, wish there were more designs to choose from for this price range.</li>
            <li> Super cute and not heavy at all! The color is great!! A really pretty headband it&#x27;s a great buy and it really dresses your hair up!</li>
            <li> I love this headband, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t wear it.  A lot of people have said theirs broke, but despite me trying to stretch it over my average-sized head numerous times, it is still in one piece.  I can get it on, but I take it off within minutes because it gives me such a bad headache.  It also tends to snag in hair, so you have to be really careful.  Overall, its beautiful if you have a small enough head.  I think I&#x27;ll be giving it to my 5 year old niece rather than keeping it even though I wanted to wear it so badly!</li>
            <li> it is an adorable head band but i think its meant for kids because it didnt fit me :/ my head is of normal size by the way when i wore it it was way too tight and hurt to wear for longer than 20 minutes or so, and when i tried stretching it to put it on it ripped and snapped in my face, not cool :/</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. It broke before I could even wear it. You can&#x27;t stretch it to get over your head without snapping the cheap metal roses.</li>
            <li> think about it...if you put this in your hair, it will catch every strand it touches.  super cheap and not worth the few cents spent on it.</li>
            <li> This broke the first time I attempted to put it on my head. My head isn&#x27;t that big!! I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The headband is very pretty, and I was super excited to receive it. The flower part on it is metal and very sturdy, although the links that hold the flowers together brake off very easily. Could not wear the headband, due to the cheapness it was made from. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all</li>
            <li> i really like it but the roses are not the same size as in the picture they are a lot smaller in person.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeee!! this headband!! Gorgeous!! It goes with everything I wear and the product is not cheap at all. Real nice And solid</li>
            <li> Nice, lightweight head band.  Attractive flowers with black elastic at back of neck.  Bought a necklace I thought was similar.  The neclace was junk but this was nice and worth the money.  Much nicer made.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter and her friends love it and looks so pretty on them.  It is light weight and very attractive.  I would definitely recommend it.  As a matter of fact, I ended up ordering two more after receiving my original order.</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I took it out of the package! I attempted to put it back together, but every time I try it on it falls apart again. Not worth the money or the ridiculously long wait!</li>
            <li> When I tried to put it in my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t even fit over my head!! Then it literally fell to pieces! Just minutes after I got it! What a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> When you I buy something cute and inexpensive, I always think there&#x27;s going to be a catch. Either the shipping will take forever, or it will be poorly made, etc. That is not the case with this headband. The roses are absolutely stunning, and the gold is bright and shiny without being costume-y. It is just heavy enough to feel secure without weighing down my head. Shipping was fast, product is amazing, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The fact that this item was so cheap yet works and looks like it costs more makes it a great value. It&#x27;s not fancy at all, but looks like it is described and works as it is described. Shipping isn&#x27;t fast, but it also was not unreasonable.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet, dainty item with the cut out rose design.  It would nicely dress up someone&#x27;s attire without being flashy.</li>
            <li> This headband is great! I bought the rose elastic headband and it is great. Good quality, comfortable. And for such a great price.</li>
            <li> the link is completely different from the picture in the invoice its another item Regardless of the low price of the item</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too fragile and broke after I used it once. But it does look cute when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of the quality but the headband came and was great quality and elicited compliments right away the first day I wore it!</li>
            <li> So I bought this a very long time ago that I had forgotten that I had bought it so I barely wore it today. And as I put it on my head it snapped! LOL! Its alright though cause it was like a dollar and I just tied a knot and fixed it. Its really pretty though, even if it snaps you can totally fix. AND I saw it at Claires for $12 so, you just got yourself a good deal!</li>
            <li> Really cute and got what i ordered</li>
            <li> Did not receive. Got duplicate of a different one.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this less than one star, considering I ordered back in November, but there it is. Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and kind of figured it would be junk, but to my pleasant surprise, I really like it!  It&#x27;s cute, good quality and I like that it lays flat on my head and doesn&#x27;t budge.  Like another reviewer said, I would have paid 5 bucks for it :)</li>
            <li> The product fell apart after two uses.  This product was not the purchase price.  Not sure if buying from again</li>
            <li> very different headband,I&#x27;m always looking for unique head acceries, I have two daughters with long hair.was very happy to find some</li>
            <li> Looks just like the photo... very cute and dainty.&lt;br /&gt;If you love rose designs, you&#x27;ll certainly love this in your collection. :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for Christmas it&#x27;s nice and delicate looking.  I would buy it again. My only complaint is it took to long to get here. I ordered 6 wks before Christmas And I received it 2 weeks after Christmas!  If you plan this as a gift order it more than 10 weeks before needed.</li>
            <li> Love this band for both young and old.&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple, and fresh looking.  It&#x27;s also&lt;br /&gt;very comfy, no pinching or digging in (as with&lt;br /&gt;so many hair accesories).  Very happy with&lt;br /&gt;my purchase.</li>
            <li> this headband was cute but once i tryed to put i on it broke apart i think it&#x27;s terrible quality.</li>
            <li> Should have given it zero stars, but that is not an option. This item is well past due and did not arrive. It was very inexpensive, but it is still irritating to not even get it. I usually get an opportunity to contact the seller, but that didn&#x27;t come up this time, so I can&#x27;t say if there would be redress. Perhaps they don&#x27;t exist anymore!</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend and she loved it. It goes very well in her darker brown hair and she wears it all the time- so if you like compliments, go ahead and get one of these! It was cheap but seems to be well made, as it hasn&#x27;t broken or tarnished after a year of use and stays in place when worn.</li>
            <li> Love it! Just a little small for my head lol</li>
            <li> Picture is deceiving!!!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered thinking I was getting that headband in the picture provided. But got something else instead!&lt;br /&gt;Not even worth shipping it back and all that jazz .... So basically ended up with a headband that I don&#x27;t want and won&#x27;t ever use ;(</li>
            <li> Received different headband than one pictured</li>
            <li> broke on the first day! I put it on and it snapped open and broke. Did not force it in any way</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this on, it broke.</li>
            <li> This is what I purchased what I received was nothin like it I received a metal rose on a hair tye</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with the quality, but you do get what you pay for.  I had bought it for my niece for an event.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly the way the picture looks, it adds a different look to any hair style, its very pretty</li>
            <li> It looks really pretty, very elegant.  You can layer the headband with other accessories actually.  It&#x27;s really affordable.  I&#x27;ve seen boutiques sell head bands similar to this but they sell for $15.  it&#x27;s crazy!  I&#x27;ve gotten a great deal here.</li>
            <li> I love the look it came on time with the leaf headband I ordered just be careful putting it on and taking it off it pulls the hair alittle</li>
            <li> Hot Lovely Metallic Sweet Lady Hollow Rose Flower Elastic Hair Band is awesome. it came on time going to wear it on my birthday</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x60;T EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LIKE THIS HAIR BAND !!... I FEEL LIKE A DISNEY PRINCESS WHILE WEARING IT !!... NO MATTER IF YOU HAD SHORT HAIR OR LONG HAIR, NO MATTER YOUR HAIR COLOR... THIS IS PERFECT FOR EVERYONE... LOVE IT !!</li>
            <li> Initially I was scared to try this on because I thought it&#x27;d break, but it lasted all day and stayed in place. Very cute!</li>
            <li> It looks like the picture and it fits tightly around your head.  For me, I wear it over my hijab and it gives my covering a lot go style.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my preteen nieces, the fit was right and it was really cute until it started to tarnish</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a 5th of a star, that is more than it deserves. I tried to wear it and it broke immediately. I hhave a small head. I could see it breaking if you tried to put it on a basketball but as I am petite, I see no reason for it snapping it like it did. I feel like I deserve a postage paid return envelope and a refund.</li>
            <li> very cute sassy&lt;br /&gt;arrived in a good amount of time&lt;br /&gt;not damaged&lt;br /&gt;and use it in my hair as a hair accessory or a necklace in a pinch</li>
            <li> Not held together the best</li>
            <li> For $1.42 I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to be honest.  Package came 14 days from when I placed my order.  The images for the product looks just like it.  I&#x27;ve only tested it out but so far, the product appears to be very sturdy, beautiful, and easy to use.  Definitely touches up any every day look :)  I&#x27;m thinking about buying more for myself and as gifts!</li>
            <li> Fits my head perfect and it&#x27;s beautiful...can wear it with a pretty evening gown or even with a lazy day outfit. Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Took forever to come in the mail and when it did it was very disappointing. Very cheap looking and even cheaper materials. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but looks like it will break after the first use.</li>
            <li> Love it I always want to throw my hair in a ponytail or messy bun in the summer but this is giving me a nice stylish way to do my hair and stay cool</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s more than I expected to get. The headband is so cute and exceeded my expectations. It looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this item, but disappointed, it broke the first time I put it in my hair, in addition, it got completely tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li> This looked pretty when arrived, but just like the other reviews it broke after 1st use and it got tangled in my hair. It&#x27;s similar to a bracelet with links but for hair. It did turn colors after 1st use. Can&#x27;t complain about the price.</li>
            <li> This headband is very cute and fits perfectly. The only drawback is that the flowers tend snag my hair when I put the band on. It does not pull the hair out. I just have to make sure that my hair is pulled back tightly before I put the band on and then take my hair out once the band is in place. I always get compliments on the hair band.</li>
            <li> For sprucing up a plain bun or ponytail, this does the trick.  I love this, but because it is golden in color I fear it will turn.  To prevent that I would suggest coating in clear finger nail polish. It took awhile to arrive.</li>
            <li> The design is pretty , but whenever I tried to take it off it would get tangled with my hair, it was such a hassle. Over time the flowers started changing color..............</li>
            <li> I love my headband, looks cute and is very useful for me. The all rubber headbands or the fabric ones never stay in my head more than 3 minutes but this one can be in place all day long. Love it!</li>
            <li> The color is actually like bronze, not gold. The elastic is not very strong. Probably my head is not big enough for it</li>
            <li> I just got it and its perfect.its cute and lovely..perfect for a gift or for your self. Very stylish. U will love it.</li>
            <li> This is really cheap looking metalic hair band and slip all the time.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s wasting money totally. buyers think twice.</li>
            <li> Love this, it looks very delacate, but is stronger than it looks.. i got this for a gift for my daughter, she loves it..</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, it looks classy and nice. It works with any pretty dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wear this to keep hair or of my eyes while teaching my fitness classes daily so cute but the metal became discolored Quickly</li>
            <li> Combined Hot Lovely Metallic Sweet Lady Hollow Rose Flower Elastic Hair Band Headband - Gold (New)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Product Image  New Fashion Gold Leaf Festival Grecian Garland Hippy Forehead Head Hair Band (New)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; to make a necklace</li>
            <li> Looks expensive but isn&#x27;t. Just enough decoration not too much. Fits well and doesn&#x27;t slip off like some bands.  Would buy from seller again. Little gold flowers gives you a feminine touch without going over the top.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very pretty piece, but it gets stuck in my hair easily and hurts like crazy to get out! it also has a funky metal smell and discolors easily. but hey, it was cute for a few wears and cheap enough for me not to complain much</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair like another that I&#x27;ve bought, and looks adorable! The flowers are smaller than I expected. I love this band, I catch myself wearing it all the time because it&#x27;s so nice looking.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. She have to use it with everything. Lol its beautiful</li>
            <li> I love this headband! The gold flowers are super cute and it fits nice and snug on my head without slipping off. It looks really nice with a messy bun or updo. I&#x27;ve worn it twice so far and I&#x27;ve already recieved tons of compliments. It also came in a cute little bag that I use to keep loose change in. I wish they had a silver one too because I would definitely buy one in the color.</li>
            <li> Bought it cos of the reviews and the cost. I thought if wasn&#x27;t great at least I wouldn&#x27;t have spent too much on it. But it&#x27;s not fragile or flimsy like I kind of imagined. Really cute and sturdy enough. Can be dressed up or down. I have a short haircut and it looked exquisite on me. I love it. And considering it shipped from outside the country(Hong Kong), shipping was super fast - 5 days if I&#x27;m not mistaken. I&#x27;m just wondering if the gold look will eventually become blackish; hopefully it stays as is. I&#x27;m thinking about getting it for my sisters too. So far I like.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and it looks cheap. It is flimsy and the gold is a bit off. I do not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I guess I should have realized this would of happened because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally tried to put it on as soon as I pulled it out of the package and it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more the size for a young child and not an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> took a little while to get it, but it did come from out of the U.S.  It was all that I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> The headband is a little tight, but it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a month for this to arrive at my house. It was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Its really super cute, but it just won&#x27;t stay on my head!  I had to keep pulling it back into place every couple of minutes!  I don&#x27;t know if I have an odd shaped head, or what.  I ended up just wearing it as a necklace and no one could tell the difference.  Its really nice, but I&#x27;d prefer to have it as a headband.</li>
            <li> Really good quality and very pretty. It fits very well and I love it! Highly recommend getting this hair band.</li>
            <li> i love this head band it stays in my head and it doesnt slide out at all and it looks perfect with sock buns/ messy buns. The price was amazing for this product (:</li>
            <li> It makes any outfit of bad hair day look like a purposeful hairstyle. it came with a great price for what i have and it looks like it isnt breaking any time soon, i would totally do buy this again as a gift</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter since it was only $1 and she wears headbands all the time.  She&#x27;s had it for a week and it is still in the package.</li>
            <li> I actually gave this item 3 stars just because it is pretty, but..... it is definitely way toooooo small, I have a small head ad it bearly fitted. It also tangles in your hair and when you try to take it off it pulls it. Probably I will give it to my 5.5 year old, maybe it will fit her small head.</li>
            <li> Love it, awesome price, &amp; they had their own card with it. So professional. &amp; can&#x27;t wait for people to give me compliments</li>
            <li> It is just awful.  Totally waste of money, however little amount.  The super long shipping time just makes it not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> very  pretty easy to use goes  with everything, wish it came in more colors. good for young and old alike</li>
