            <li>They are much better for your skin than liquid makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage and ease of application with one of their brushes.  </li>
            <li>This cover I haven&#x27;t been able to remove.  </li>
            <li>The warmth is better than the blush as it wakes up your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I use this instead of blush because the color is great for someone with red hair.  </li>
            <li>If you love Bare Minerals, you will love this!</li>
            <li>Great size and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Using the &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; bronzer helps give my olive complexion a little more color and looks great paired with their blush.</li>
            <li>I  have used Bare Escentuals products for more than 15 years, and LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I got it alot less cheaper at Amazon than Sephora.</li>
            <li>Looks great w/a little color.</li>
            <li>Colorscience, however, is worth every penny and feels like a luxury item.</li>
            <li>I love the Bare Escentuals products!  </li>
            <li>I look forward to trying out more of the bare escentuals product line.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Escentuals for many years.  </li>
            <li>I also like to lightly dust some underneath my jawline and use my fingertip to smooth a tiny bit on my lips when I do my makeup and the color</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it does exactly as it promises-</li>
            <li>I am not cheap, I understand good stuff comes with a cost and 18</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look like it has been kissed by the sun and it stays on ALL day (until you are ready to remove it).</li>
            <li>My point here is not to go out and buy Colorscience, but don&#x27;t spend the extra money for Bare Minerals; it is not any better than what you could purchase at CVS.</li>
            <li>As far as the coverage, once you get your brush set-up with the correct amount, it goes on fine, but does not last all day.  </li>
            <li>And as I said, once you&#x27;ve had a product with high pigment concentration....you know the difference.</li>
            <li>Ever since I first swirled, tapped, and buffed this makeup onto my face, I have been a devout user of Bare Escentuals makeup.</li>
            <li>Does what it says and looks fairly natural when I had color!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a little dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>A little swept on as blusher then a light dusting over my nose, forehead, and chin (just like a bronzer)</li>
            <li>giving a natural looking \\&quot;kiss of the sun\\&quot; on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I use a VERY small amount all over my face &amp; more on the cheek bones &amp; under the chin for definition.</li>
            <li>This blush seems extreme at first, but just be sure to only use a very little and keep on blending.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals makeup for over 3 years</li>
            <li>not so with the Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>However i can not use the bare mineral power foundation</li>
            <li>It does not have a high pigment concentration so it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be the same quality as the rest of Bare Escentials.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a regular buyer of bare minerals and the &#x27;warmth&#x27;.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s VERY concentrated which means a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily along with the other bare minerals products (foundation &amp; mineral veil).</li>
            <li> You can brush it on, and have the same glow as someone who spent the day outside.</li>

            <li> You either get too little, too much, or you make a big mess trying to shake off the excess.</li>
            <li> ive found this product for far less money on other sites..will not buy here in the future.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Previous covers were very simple and you could remove them.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I find frustrating is the new cover inside the jar.  </li>
            <li> look with a little extra on my cheeks and the sunkissed area of forehead to nose.</li>
            <li> This is a little coarser, darker tan color, but I mix it with lighter powder and it works well enough.</li>
            <li> Since I am so pale, I find it necessary to \\&quot;spice up\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 and a half years and just ordered my third little tub of blush.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased Colorscience in the past that sells for $50, and there is a definite difference.</li>
            <li> The id bronzer seems a little harder to blend.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get enough of the product out without banging it upside down with the lid on.  </li>
            <li> That is until I received my package and learned it was the tinniest little thing I&#x27;ve ever paid money for.</li>
            <li> and my face looks like it has seen a little sun,</li>
            <li> Just that little touch you need.  </li>
            <li> I have been using warmth for years and have been having trouble finding it,glad Amazon is carrying it.  </li>
            <li> The product stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> But I get really pale in the fall/winter months</li>
            <li> One small container lasts for months.  </li>
            <li> And the packaging makes it hard to control and apply.  </li>
            <li> Follow the instruction in the Bare Escentuals tutorial and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the Bare Escentuals products!  Especially the Warmth.  I use it all over my face as a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; look with a little extra on my cheeks and the sunkissed area of forehead to nose.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it daily along with the other bare minerals products (foundation &amp; mineral veil). I use a VERY small amount all over my face &amp; more on the cheek bones &amp; under the chin for definition. It prevents the need to spend excess time in the sun and put yourself at risk for skin cancer. You can brush it on, and have the same glow as someone who spent the day outside. I look forward to trying out more of the bare escentuals product line.</li>
            <li> This blush seems extreme at first, but just be sure to only use a very little and keep on blending.  Once you get the hang of it, it does exactly as it promises- gives your skin a warm glow.  Follow the instruction in the Bare Escentuals tutorial and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  The effect will last all day, so you won&#x27;t have to reapply.  If you consider this and that you only have to use a tiny bit, this stuff lasts forever!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 and a half years and just ordered my third little tub of blush.  I also like to lightly dust some underneath my jawline and use my fingertip to smooth a tiny bit on my lips when I do my makeup and the color stays with me for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using warmth for years and have been having trouble finding it,glad Amazon is carrying it.  Great all over color that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Best  loose powder money can buy</li>
            <li> Looks great w/a little color. But I get really pale in the fall/winter months and it&#x27;s a little dark for my fair skin. I will try the lighter shade. Does what it says and looks fairly natural when I had color!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals for many years.  The \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot; is their one product I use the most.  It is the perfect blusher.....giving a natural looking \\&quot;kiss of the sun\\&quot; on my cheeks.  One small container lasts for months.  I have not bought another blusher in 6 years!</li>
            <li> The id bronzer seems a little harder to blend.  The almost same bronzer not labeled id blends better, but all around this was a good product for mineral makeup</li>
            <li> Everyone on here seems to be raving and ranting about how wonderful this product is but I won&#x27;t get the chance to try it, I&#x27;ve already printed the return label. I am not cheap, I understand good stuff comes with a cost and 18$ seems like a very good deal. That is until I received my package and learned it was the tinniest little thing I&#x27;ve ever paid money for. It looked like a sample they give you at Nordstrom for crying out loud!</li>
            <li> The product size I received was not the same as what was indicated in the product add.&lt;br /&gt;The product description was indicated as .06 oz and what I received was .05 oz.&lt;br /&gt;This was a smaller size that I wanted and expected.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in the size for the price tag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say I got it alot less cheaper at Amazon than Sephora. I&#x27;m happy and very satisfied with these make up, I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of them and I have received them in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I  have used Bare Escentuals products for more than 15 years, and LOVE them.  They are much better for your skin than liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> Ever since I first swirled, tapped, and buffed this makeup onto my face, I have been a devout user of Bare Escentuals makeup. As a pale and freckled redhead, so much make-up makes it look like I am trying to either cover my freckles, change my skin tone, or both. Since I am so pale, I find it necessary to \\&quot;spice up\\&quot; my skin a bit to keep it from seeming too drab.  This color is perfect for my summertime needs.  A little swept on as blusher then a light dusting over my nose, forehead, and chin (just like a bronzer) and my face looks like it has seen a little sun, but without the worry of wrinkles or skin cancer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals makeup for over 3 years and I have no plans of quitting any time soon. The products go on smoothly and when paired with a primer stay on. Using the &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; bronzer helps give my olive complexion a little more color and looks great paired with their blush.</li>
            <li> This product is average at best. It does not have a high pigment concentration so it doesn&#x27;t last long.  And the packaging makes it hard to control and apply.  You either get too little, too much, or you make a big mess trying to shake off the excess. As far as the coverage, once you get your brush set-up with the correct amount, it goes on fine, but does not last all day.  I have purchased Colorscience in the past that sells for $50, and there is a definite difference. When I go to take off my makeup in the morning (if I forget to remove it before bed) the Colorscience is still there in the morning....not so with the Bare Minerals.  This is not worth the extra money. Colorscience, however, is worth every penny and feels like a luxury item. This does not. My point here is not to go out and buy Colorscience, but don&#x27;t spend the extra money for Bare Minerals; it is not any better than what you could purchase at CVS. I would recommend to save the extra $10-$20, and buy Physicians Formula instead, in a solid pressed container.  Its much cheaper, available at any drug store, easier to apply, and just as good.  If you&#x27;re going to spend the extra money, consider a different product than BM.  Go to a department store or something, but this is not a high-end product in my opinion. I think BM was one of the first to offer mineral powder, but not the best. And as I said, once you&#x27;ve had a product with high pigment concentration....you know the difference.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of blush because the color is great for someone with red hair.  It&#x27;s VERY concentrated which means a little goes a long ways.  Depending on use, it lasts me about a year.  It makes your skin look like it has been kissed by the sun and it stays on ALL day (until you are ready to remove it).</li>
            <li> I can not go without this, sometimes i just use it even without foundation.  Just that little touch you need.  This is it!  However i can not use the bare mineral power foundation this cause irritation on my skin.  But NOT the warmth.</li>
            <li> I find this to be the same quality as the rest of Bare Escentials.  I love the coverage and ease of application with one of their brushes.  The product stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy greasy feeling.  The only thing I find frustrating is the new cover inside the jar.  Previous covers were very simple and you could remove them.  This cover I haven&#x27;t been able to remove.  It&#x27;s hard to get enough of the product out without banging it upside down with the lid on.  But, I will still use it because there&#x27;s nothing out there as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular buyer of bare minerals and the &#x27;warmth&#x27;. I will continue to purchase this product. Great size and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you love Bare Minerals, you will love this! Beautiful color, not heavy, good stuff! Very happy customer and will buy again!</li>
            <li> The warmth is better than the blush as it wakes up your face.&lt;br /&gt;I always feel &amp;#34;washed out&amp;#34;, however the warmth takes this away.</li>
            <li> ive found this product for far less money on other sites..will not buy here in the future. product as described</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same color &#x27;Warmth&#x27; as I&#x27;ve used before. This is a little coarser, darker tan color, but I mix it with lighter powder and it works well enough. If used straight it looks unnatural, where the older version was just perfect.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gf.  She loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love this shade for summer. Gives that tan look.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery great product</li>
