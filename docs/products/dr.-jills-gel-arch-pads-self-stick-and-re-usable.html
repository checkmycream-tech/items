            <li>Good for a pinch</li>
            <li>They stick to the bottom of my foot and have given a good support.</li>

            <li>I love these arch supports!  </li>
            <li>I have used arch pads that stick to your shoe, but I liked the idea of having pads that stick to your foot.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much for the great price too.</li>
            <li>I wear them in my ballet shoes mostly but also in street shoes.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>They worked pretty good with a pair of shoes</li>
            <li>Stayed where I put them and clean up well to reuse - over and over again!  </li>
            <li>These pads provide some arch cushioning and are easy to wear (they stick to the skin).  </li>
            <li>Its easy to switch from sandal  to sports shoe</li>
            <li>Fit easily in my shoes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use again and again.</li>

            <li>Great, I bought this company and the other Dr., but this one worked way better then</li>
            <li>They were originally sold to me by a podiatrist.</li>
            <li>Yes, they have good adhesive and generally stay in place on my foot</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t be a problem when I need to quickly slip on some shoes and go.</li>

            <li>I love Dr. Jill&#x27;s gel pads and will buy more later.</li>
            <li>they eliminate much of my foot pain by giving me strong arch support.</li>
            <li>I have that I really cannot fit an orthotic into.  </li>
            <li>These are worth buying.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to see if this was the right pad that my doctor sold me 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>Also the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a small girl with a good arch</li>
            <li>My feet were killing me and after I purchased these, my feet do not hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>I really like these, although I would of like the thicker ones.</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>They were just enough to make it comfortable wearing them</li>
            <li>They were quite comfortable actually.  </li>
            <li>And, so much for going barefoot or having support in my slippers.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make them better is if they were clear.</li>
            <li>The pad is a thin (maybe 1/8&amp;#34;), uniform thickness, and has no &amp;#34;arch&amp;#34; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any support for your arch is minimal at best.</li>
            <li>They are easy to maintain by washing them and leaving them to dry overnight.  </li>
            <li>They could be a bit thicker for my wife&#x27;s particular foot.</li>
            <li>B0033PSSJO Dr. Scholl&#x27;s FOR HER Hidden Arch Supports, 1-pair Packages (Pack of 3)]], but wanted something that I could quickly wear with any shoe (as setting those sticky, in-shoe inserts takes a bit of time to get it positioned just right), as well as wear barefoot or with my slippers around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, so much for going barefoot or having support in my slippers.e of plastic, I know they still would not offer proper support and would probably provide even bigger lumps in my shoes.</li>
            <li>1/2-to-1 size bigger than I&#x27;m measured to, which means any built-in arch support is too far forward for my foot.</li>
            <li>The fact that they are something extra on my arch offers the tiniest bit of support, but it is not nearly enough to keep my feet from rolling, and also wouldn&#x27;t be enough for someone with fallen arches.</li>
            <li>If you forget, it only takes a few seconds to dry them in the morning with a cool hairdryer.</li>
            <li>These should be a wedge shape, not a flat</li>

            <li> Pretty much useless. Why did I think a piece of flat rubber was going to help?</li>
            <li> They stick well.  Follow directions on box.They provide a good bit of arch support.  They were originally sold to me by a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> Just the amount of lift I need for flat feet.  Great product</li>
            <li> These pads provide some arch cushioning and are easy to wear (they stick to the skin).  They could be a bit thicker for my wife&#x27;s particular foot.</li>
            <li> Stayed where I put them and clean up well to reuse - over and over again!  I have ordered extras for when they finally wear out.</li>
            <li> I use these every day now.  Give me great relief.  Were recommended by my podiatrist.  Fit easily in my shoes.  After washing they continue to restick.</li>
            <li> These are worth buying.  My feet were killing me and after I purchased these, my feet do not hurt as much.  These stick to your arch and can be worn with summer shoes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel good at all.  No support either.</li>
            <li> I have used arch pads that stick to your shoe, but I liked the idea of having pads that stick to your foot.  Its easy to switch from sandal  to sports shoe and you don&#x27;t have to buy a pad for every shoe.  You can even walk barefoot with support. They are easy to maintain by washing them and leaving them to dry overnight.  If you forget, it only takes a few seconds to dry them in the morning with a cool hairdryer. The only draw back is their reaction to sweat.  Even though they fell off after a tennis game, they managed to stay in place under the sock while playing.  They provide good support for those with falling arches.</li>
            <li> I find these to work well for me.  I wear them in my ballet shoes mostly but also in street shoes.  Im on my third order of them because they have rescued my feet...I have very low arches causing all kinds of problems in my feet, ankles and calves in ballet</li>
            <li> I really like these, although I would of like the thicker ones. I&#x27;m a small girl with a good arch but I wanted to use it to maintain my posture and my ankle position while I work standing up. It work well and I keep washing and reusing and they still stick well. I also put a sock over it to keep it in place well and avoid things that might pull it off of stick to it.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  My husband has a foot problem that these things take away the pain he feels.  Easy to clean and use again and again. Thank you very much for the great price too.</li>
            <li> This works really well and I can use it over &amp; over.</li>
            <li> The problem with this product is that it flattens practically after&lt;br /&gt;the first use. Another thing, the glue will not last for long.&lt;br /&gt;But the concept is good. Two stars for that.</li>
            <li> Great, I bought this company and the other Dr., but this one worked way better then the other brand</li>
            <li> They worked pretty good with a pair of shoes I have that I really cannot fit an orthotic into.  They were just enough to make it comfortable wearing them so I definately will use them in shoes that inserts won&#x27;t fit in.  They were quite comfortable actually.  I removed them at the end of the day and washed and dried them as directed and they will work again when needed.</li>
            <li> This is my emergency kit when I am wearing shoes that don&#x27;t accommodate my orthodics. Good for a pinch but obviously don&#x27;t replace custom made orthodics.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stick to the bottoms of my feet at all, even after I had showered and dried my feet. Also, they gave no support at all to my arches.</li>
            <li> These have been working well. They stick to the bottom of my foot and have given a good support. The only thing that would make them better is if they were clear.</li>
            <li> I look at the other reviews here and I wonder if this is the same product I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have metatarsalgia from Morton&#x27;s toe, so I need arch support to keep my feet from rolling inward and putting pressure on that second metatarsal bone. Additionally, my toes are very long, so I have to wear shoes 1/2-to-1 size bigger than I&#x27;m measured to, which means any built-in arch support is too far forward for my foot. As such, I have to buy inserts smaller than the shoes I wear, which means they tend to slide around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had good luck with [[ASIN:B0033PSSJO Dr. Scholl&#x27;s FOR HER Hidden Arch Supports, 1-pair Packages (Pack of 3)]], but wanted something that I could quickly wear with any shoe (as setting those sticky, in-shoe inserts takes a bit of time to get it positioned just right), as well as wear barefoot or with my slippers around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the rave reviews here, and that the image appeared to be of a product that has a wedge-shape and would push my insoles up and keep my feet from rotating inward, I ordered a pair of these. Unfortunately, when they arrived, I was sorely disappointed. Unlike the other inserts I have had luck with, these are a flat piece of gell-plastic. Yes, they have good adhesive and generally stay in place on my foot (after a few tries to get them in just the right place, which takes off a lot of dead skin each time I have to peel it off to try again, which makes them less sticky until I wash and let them dry), but they don&#x27;t _support_. The fact that they are something extra on my arch offers the tiniest bit of support, but it is not nearly enough to keep my feet from rolling, and also wouldn&#x27;t be enough for someone with fallen arches. I also found them to be uncomfortable to walk around in for more than 10 minutes, because they provide this lump in my shoes, as my feet start to roll over onto them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would try the extra thick version of this product, but since I know that they are just a flat piece of plastic, I know they still would not offer proper support and would probably provide even bigger lumps in my shoes. These should be a wedge shape, not a flat shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now that I&#x27;ve wasted $16, I&#x27;m going to go spend just as much to buy three pairs of the other inserts and just load up all of my shoes so it won&#x27;t be a problem when I need to quickly slip on some shoes and go. And, so much for going barefoot or having support in my slippers.e of plastic, I know they still would not offer proper support and would probably provide even bigger lumps in my shoes. These should be a wedge shape, not a flat shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now that I&#x27;ve wasted $16, I&#x27;m going to go spend just as much to buy three pairs of the other inserts and just load up all of my shoes so it won&#x27;t be a problem when I need to quickly slip on some shoes and go. And, so much for going barefoot or having support in my slippers.</li>
            <li> I love these arch supports!  I can wear them with flip flops or while going barefoot around the house.  They provide support at all times and I would definately recommend/purchase them again.  FYI - if you are a person with sweatty feet they may not work for you.</li>
            <li> I NO LONGER USE ANY OTHER INSERTS IN MY SHOES.  DR. JILL&#x27;S FOOT PADS ARE WONDERFUL AND GIVE ME JUST THE SUPPORT ON MY INSTEP THAT I NEED.  I USE THEM EVEY DAY</li>
            <li> The arch supports feel good and offer me the support I need.  If these wear out I will not hesitate to order them again.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like them to. They get porous, little holes appear in the sticky side.</li>
            <li> Picture is deceiving. The pad is a thin (maybe 1/8&amp;#34;), uniform thickness, and has no &amp;#34;arch&amp;#34; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any support for your arch is minimal at best.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Jill&#x27;s gel pads and will buy more later. I just wanted to see if this was the right pad that my doctor sold me 6 months ago. Also the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> flat!!!  no arch support at all.  Get Dr Scholl&#x27;s heavenly arches.</li>
            <li> They work great for me. they eliminate much of my foot pain by giving me strong arch support.</li>
