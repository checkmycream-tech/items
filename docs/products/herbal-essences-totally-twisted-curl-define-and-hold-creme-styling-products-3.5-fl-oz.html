            <li>It also does not make my hair feel greasy at all, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>as does most all of the frizz control serums.)  </li>

            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I really love this Herbal Essences Curl Define creme.  </li>
            <li>Though there have been many great new items to come from this company, this product is not one of them.  </li>
            <li>But Herbal Essences makes some pretty good shampoos/conditioners</li>
            <li>I was so excited about the results!  </li>
            <li>I am beyond excited!</li>
            <li>I got great soft curls without the frizz.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff - fluffy, beautiful hair!  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell.</li>
            <li>This was fine</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE discovery for me.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t amazing for really humid weather, though.  </li>
            <li>I am a 4b/c natural and I have used this product with knot today and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or crispy; just nice and soft.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff, my hair is very tick</li>
            <li>I find this cream to have a much softer, touchable finish that many gels.  </li>
            <li>:) I like the way the bottle pumps the creme, better than a regular pump.</li>
            <li>I was VERY  surprised to find that my fairy knots (single strand knots) were significantly reduced!!!!</li>
            <li>After my first bottle used, my results weren&#x27;t good enough to keep using.  </li>
            <li>Great for a loose style and hold for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely thrilled to find that I could have this product delivered to me and never have to run out again as I use this daily!!</li>
            <li>Smells great and seems to define my waves/curls without being sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li>Herbal Essence appears to be phasing out some older products that are tried and true.  </li>
            <li>I will stick to the Herbal Essences totally twisted curling mousse that I have been using for years at a great price!</li>
            <li>I hope result it still the same, so I&#x27;ll come back and do a full review after I&#x27;ve tried it again &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for awhile and always had a huge problem finding it in other stores, the only place I could fine it was at a Target which is not convent by location to me!</li>
            <li>I have completely straight, very fine hair, and this stuff does not weigh it down at all.  </li>
            <li>My curls are soft, my hair still feels moisturized, and as a natural who has high density fine hair</li>
            <li>This product does not leave my curls smooth, but crunchy and sticky (and I did use little) and in terms of defining curls it didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li>I have fine, long, color-treated curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair that is naturally curly.</li>
            <li>Many of the products dragged down my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the good reviews and it was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more and had a lot less results</li>
            <li>With the same amount of product I have gotten much better results from other curl creams.</li>
            <li>Have used this and another product in this line and both help my totally straight hair have enough body to keep a tousled, textured look going all day!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and without frizz.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for soft, touchable curls.</li>
            <li>Once my hair dries, my hair has soft curls without frizz or unruliness.</li>
            <li>but I was still having to let my hair dry naturally the first day which is a pain.  </li>
            <li>And if you leave it for several hours, the smell fades away and becomes a nice subtle</li>
            <li>OMG - I have been looking and buying so many products for my curly hair, every one I used made it like a &amp;#34;crispy critter&amp;#34;, it was crunchy and stiff and not natural looking at all.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for my Puerto Rican long curly locks.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled and am signing up for the subscription service.</li>
            <li>Even when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my hair and go to sleep straight away, I still have that cute wavy hair the next morning with the same sweet subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and this gives my hair just enough hold to make it bouncy and frizz free.</li>
            <li>When I wear my hair curly, I generally let it air dry naturally.</li>
            <li>Then it generally looks a mess anyway in the back where it just wants to be frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a little wavy, a little straight ... just a hot mess really.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has fine, thin, frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>It seemed fine as it was drying; however, it was heavy &amp; sticky and my hair began to pouf out as it dried.  </li>

            <li> wear this product everyday, it&#x27;s long lasting and it really tames your frizz.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Even my 80-year-old mother uses it because it works well with grey, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Only thing that manages my dry frizzy curls without leaving my hair crunchy or greasy</li>
            <li> I will use this product as long as it&#x27;s made!</li>
            <li> This product is becoming harder and harder to find unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> When my daughter and I discovered this product in a local Target store, we ditched all the other curl products.  </li>
            <li> You can refresh your hair the next day with a little water and the curls bounce back, with softness and touchability.  </li>
            <li> I like to shower, scrunch with product and air dry.</li>
            <li> So I usually let it dry naturally except for the front of my hair which I dry with a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I use this creme every single day for my hair</li>
            <li> Just enough hold,  just enough to tame the frizz</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it to define curls, but to hold my hair in a loose style.  </li>
            <li> Well, we&#x27;re down to our last 2</li>
            <li> I thought to give this a try and it works equally well for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> I put it on wet &amp; let it dry.  </li>
            <li> but at least they look natural and not as if the hair was glued.</li>
            <li> Then I used a wide tooth comb to comb it all out</li>
            <li> to comb/brush, so a wide tooth comb is helpful.</li>
            <li> ; residue feel like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have medium (not thick or thin) hair with a curly/wavy texture.</li>
            <li> I dried the front as usual, then I dried the rest of my hair without brushing it..just flipping over to dry the bottom and scrunching and drying the rest until not quite all the way dry.  </li>
            <li> I had previously been using a salon brand ($10) a tube.  </li>
            <li> It even does a little to keep my hair from frizzing out in the Texas humidity.</li>
            <li> Works fine, Hate the smell</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I bought this all the time a few years ago and our walmart quit carrying it</li>
            <li> It makes your hair stiff and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds frizz control serum&#x27;s and the Argan &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; (which usually has silicone in it....</li>
            <li> It is a thick, creamy, heavily scented product.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be way too thick out of the bottle in order to distribute it well through the hair, even when I rub vigorously through my palms, I even tried adding a bit of water to it in my palm.</li>
            <li> Being unable to get it though the hair well causes &amp;#34;white spots&amp;#34; in areas it goes on to thick, and poor curl definition as the product does not distribute well.</li>
            <li> Around my ears it tends to straighten if I look at it wrong</li>
            <li> It also makes the hair difficult</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use Totally Twisted mousse and Set me Up spray Gel for my curly hair, I was hoping I could replace both products with this.  </li>
            <li> Crazy amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad product, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for my curl.  </li>
            <li> Hate that it isn&#x27;t on subscribe and save anymore.</li>

            <li> This is a HUGE discovery for me.  I&#x27;m beside myself giddy.  I have curly hair BUT not all my hair is curly.  Around my ears it tends to straighten if I look at it wrong and the underneath tends to straighten.  So I usually let it dry naturally except for the front of my hair which I dry with a blow dryer.  Then it generally looks a mess anyway in the back where it just wants to be frizzy. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds frizz control serum&#x27;s and the Argan &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; (which usually has silicone in it....as does most all of the frizz control serums.)  I just happened upon the Herbal Essences Curl Define &amp; Hold Creme because it was on clearance at my Walmart Neighborhood Market.  One morning I tried something different.  I brushed out my hair (which is a no no for curls) and then I took a pump of the creme, rubbed it with both hands and put on my hair.  OH MY MY MY!!!  I was so excited about the results!  I got great soft curls without the frizz.  This was fine but I was still having to let my hair dry naturally the first day which is a pain.  Then this morning I tried something different again.  I dried the front as usual, then I dried the rest of my hair without brushing it..just flipping over to dry the bottom and scrunching and drying the rest until not quite all the way dry.  Then I used a wide tooth comb to comb it all out then I put the creme on.  My husband thought I was nuts the way I was acting after I saw the results.  This makes my hair routine sooo much better!  Two friends at church (unsolicited) commented about how great my hair looks.  I am beyond excited!</li>
            <li> I use this creme every single day for my hair and I absolutely LOVE it. I have naturally very curly hair and this stuff is great. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or crispy; just nice and soft. I also use, in addition, a flexible hold hairspray to help keep it in place. I will use this product as long as it&#x27;s made!</li>
            <li> Just enough hold,  just enough to tame the frizz</li>
            <li> So sticky, it feels like putting glue in my hair! Never again. But Herbal Essences makes some pretty good shampoos/conditioners</li>
            <li> My hair felt just a bit too &#x27;crispy&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile and always had a huge problem finding it in other stores, the only place I could fine it was at a Target which is not convent by location to me! I was absolutely thrilled to find that I could have this product delivered to me and never have to run out again as I use this daily!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in a pinch when our bottle of Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier creme ran out. My daughter has fine, thin, frizzy curly hair. I found this product to be way too thick out of the bottle in order to distribute it well through the hair, even when I rub vigorously through my palms, I even tried adding a bit of water to it in my palm. Being unable to get it though the hair well causes &amp;#34;white spots&amp;#34; in areas it goes on to thick, and poor curl definition as the product does not distribute well. Waste of money and I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Have used this and another product in this line and both help my totally straight hair have enough body to keep a tousled, textured look going all day!</li>
            <li> Nice smell to product. Does not leave a &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; residue feel like other products I&#x27;ve tried. Perfect price.</li>
            <li> Love this. Hate that it isn&#x27;t on subscribe and save anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the good reviews and it was a huge disappointment. This product does not leave my curls smooth, but crunchy and sticky (and I did use little) and in terms of defining curls it didn&#x27;t do anything special. I can do much better with just spraying my hair with a leave-in conditioner which may not create awesome curls but at least they look natural and not as if the hair was glued.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will keep using this product.  I will keep trying it and see how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> Only thing that manages my dry frizzy curls without leaving my hair crunchy or greasy</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I have to ask myself in the morning.  My hair is naturally a little wavy, a little straight ... just a hot mess really.  This stuff, however, brings a lot of curl out of my hair that I didn&#x27;t know existed.  This product is becoming harder and harder to find unfortunately.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells great and seems to define my waves/curls without being sticky or stiff.  Leaves my hair soft and without frizz.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This works well for curly styles.  I had previously been using a salon brand ($10) a tube.  I thought to give this a try and it works equally well for a lot less.  It is a thick, creamy, heavily scented product.  It seems to add weight and texture which helps to define curls and keep them up all day.  It also makes the hair difficult to comb/brush, so a wide tooth comb is helpful.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it! I love it!</li>
            <li> This hair creme does what it says. It makes my hair curl. :) I like the way the bottle pumps the creme, better than a regular pump.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair stiff and crunchy.  I was hoping for soft, touchable curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with shoulder-length curly hair, and women always ask me what I use to make it look so good. All I use is a standard shampoo/conditioner and this curl creme! It helps to prevent my curls from getting frizzy, and keeps them looking sleek and moisturized. And it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair brittle or sticky; I can still run my fingers through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Over priced but nice product. I can find it cheeper at target or walmart.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff, my hair is very tick and it works so great!</li>
            <li> I am a 4b/c natural and I have used this product with knot today and the results are amazing.  My curls are soft, my hair still feels moisturized, and as a natural who has high density fine hair I was VERY  surprised to find that my fairy knots (single strand knots) were significantly reduced!!!! It&#x27;s as though this product and knot today were the best of friends.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for my hair.  I put it on wet &amp; let it dry.  It was just stringy.  I tried it several times varying amounts &amp; got the same type of results.  I have fine, long, color-treated curly hair.  Have not found anything that works yet.  Going to have to buy salon products I think.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for my Puerto Rican long curly locks.  It seemed fine as it was drying; however, it was heavy &amp; sticky and my hair began to pouf out as it dried.  I will stick to the Herbal Essences totally twisted curling mousse that I have been using for years at a great price!</li>
            <li> This product is my holy grail. Crazy amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I wear this product everyday, it&#x27;s long lasting and it really tames your frizz.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell. And if you leave it for several hours, the smell fades away and becomes a nice subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;It holds my curls in place for 24hr+. Even when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my hair and go to sleep straight away, I still have that cute wavy hair the next morning with the same sweet subtle scent. BUY! :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - fluffy, beautiful hair!  Even my 80-year-old mother uses it because it works well with grey, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This product truly helps with my frizzy ends! I use it with herbal essence mousse. And it smells great! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the mousse.  Herbal Essence appears to be phasing out some older products that are tried and true.  Though there have been many great new items to come from this company, this product is not one of them.  It does not control the frizz and makes my hair feel oily to the touch.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  I don&#x27;t use it to define curls, but to hold my hair in a loose style.  I have completely straight, very fine hair, and this stuff does not weigh it down at all.  Great for a loose style and hold for the whole day.  It even does a little to keep my hair from frizzing out in the Texas humidity.</li>
            <li> Works fine, Hate the smell</li>
            <li> AThis product is so incredible at transforming my hair and keeping it from getting frizzy. I have paid a lot more and had a lot less results</li>
            <li> Excellent product for naturally curly hair.  When my daughter and I discovered this product in a local Target store, we ditched all the other curl products.  Then after about a year, our local stores started discontinuing carrying this curl creme but we finally found it in another Target store.  Well we just bought out all 6 they had in stock and kept checking back and buying out the stock until we had about 12 bottles stockpiled.  Well, we&#x27;re down to our last 2 and I should have known I would find it on Amazon.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled and am signing up for the subscription service.</li>
            <li> OMG - I have been looking and buying so many products for my curly hair, every one I used made it like a &amp;#34;crispy critter&amp;#34;, it was crunchy and stiff and not natural looking at all.  Many of the products dragged down my hair.  This product is GREAT, just what I was looking for.  The price was great and it works fantastic.  The creme is the best and it keeps the curls soft and touchable.  You can refresh your hair the next day with a little water and the curls bounce back, with softness and touchability.  I really love this Herbal Essences Curl Define creme.  I don&#x27;t think I can get it in stores here, so Amazon will be place I buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have medium (not thick or thin) hair with a curly/wavy texture. I like to shower, scrunch with product and air dry. With the same amount of product I have gotten much better results from other curl creams. I feel as if I haven&#x27;t used anything at all with this cream...my hair ends up looking frizzy and blah. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have fine blonde hair that is naturally curly. When I wear my hair curly, I generally let it air dry naturally. I use this creme while my hair is still damp to style my hair and structure my curls. Once my hair dries, my hair has soft curls without frizz or unruliness. This creme is perfect for helping curls be natural without looking frozen in place!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for curly hair.  I use it sometimes instead of a heavier gel.  I find this cream to have a much softer, touchable finish that many gels.  It isn&#x27;t amazing for really humid weather, though.  If you are using it in humid weather, you&#x27;ll probably also need some additional anti-frizz products.</li>
            <li> I bought this all the time a few years ago and our walmart quit carrying it so I thought it was discontinued. Imagine my excitement when I saw it today! I hope result it still the same, so I&#x27;ll come back and do a full review after I&#x27;ve tried it again &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I use Totally Twisted mousse and Set me Up spray Gel for my curly hair, I was hoping I could replace both products with this.  Not at all.  My hair was frizzy and the raggly by mid-day.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I have been looking for since a product I loved was discontinued years ago. I have thick wavy hair and this gives my hair just enough hold to make it bouncy and frizz free. That&#x27;s a lot to say for a product living in Houston!  It also does not make my hair feel greasy at all, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because the reviews were good and I have curly hair.  After my first bottle used, my results weren&#x27;t good enough to keep using.  It wasn&#x27;t a bad product, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for my curl.  Perhaps my environment is too humid.</li>
