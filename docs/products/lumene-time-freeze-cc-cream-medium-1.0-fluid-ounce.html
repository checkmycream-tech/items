            <li>I use it alone very good coverage.</li>
            <li>It has great coverage, blends perfectly with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>why is it that all the best products get discontinued?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping and good service.</li>
            <li>Hides my flaws and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to reapply and it gives great coverage.</li>
            <li>I came upon great reviews for Lumene&#x27;s BB cream, and instead tried the CC cream which is often on sale.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great coverage....</li>
            <li>and I decided to try this after reading some great reviews.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great and its so lightweight and creamy.</li>
            <li>This had great reviews</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and this CC cream works great.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the price is great.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad it turned out to be perfect!</li>
            <li>This is the best CC cream I have tried and there have been many.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price is excellent compared to most others.  </li>
            <li>it matched my skin tone perfectly and it sat on top of the pores without sinking in.</li>
            <li>It would be good for all skin types I think.</li>
            <li>Lightweight with good coverage that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The color is good, but the finish is shiny and I have to use a setting powder.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage - no need for additional foundation.</li>
            <li>I have rarely been able to find a makeup that is a perfect match and didn&#x27;t leave the dreaded line around the edges, but this blends perfectly!</li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t look like I plastered my face, but did a good job of hiding imperfections and discolorations.</li>
            <li>But the texture and coverage is good.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this CC cream at my drug store before, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I tried this in medium although I have fair skin</li>
            <li>On my face, it was just as good as the sample I tried on my hand--</li>
            <li>and I am fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved that.</li>
            <li>I love the no make up feel and look with the great coverage.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I still apply this because it makes my skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Lumene bb cream</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a nice glow (not a greasy look).</li>
            <li>It comes in two shades and although I am unfortunately very fair-skinned, the medium is the best match form.</li>
            <li>Brightens skin and evens tone, nice consistency.</li>
            <li>However, despite the nice coverage I think oxidization has caused the product to become lighter in color</li>
            <li>Nice cream,</li>
            <li>I liked the coverage</li>
            <li>Light pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving their products and plan to try more items.</li>
            <li>This has a good color for medium skin tones, but coverage is light.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and is very light feeling yet has good coverage.</li>
            <li>The medium is a good shade---the light is very light and makes me look like Casper.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t settle into my pores or fine lines, it had great coverage that covered my acne and blemishes, a perfect color match, and a dry lightweight finish.</li>
            <li>I have fairly ligt skin, but based on other reviews I ordered a medium and the color is a perfect match!</li>
            <li>I bought medium (its a very light medium).</li>
            <li>like, very light.  </li>
            <li>but the price here is even better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>With summer around the corner; why wear more products than you have to?  </li>
            <li>But most Korean brands either test or are selling China</li>
            <li>It hides my many imperfections well.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would love this product if it was a tad bit darker.</li>
            <li>I love Lumene products except for this one.</li>
            <li>Color is ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li>Someone else may love it.</li>
            <li>Like the medium better than the light.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I use it as a concealer and never found anything better.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Light texture, absorbs quickly, nice semi matte finish.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am a redhead with fair skin and freckles and the light is too light.  </li>
            <li>Was ok.</li>
            <li>Still think Maybelline is better.</li>
            <li>I just have to say that this is a lovely product.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this CC cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This cream is smooth and covers nicely without looking like you are wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>love this CC</li>
            <li>functions as a primer if you want more coverage with foundation or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cc cream was much better, I had it in medium and the shades are not comparable at all to the bb.</li>
            <li>Very good but on me the light is too light and the medium is a tad too dark and I am very fair.</li>
            <li>Feels great on, very light &amp; not heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>the color Is very light for a medium, I would say its a light.</li>
            <li>face looks a lot more healthier and smooth.</li>
            <li>so I looked into a US available brand that was more than a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations and primers hoping to find something that felt light on my skin</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it, goes on smoothly, great light coverage and SPF to boot...</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, matches my skin tone</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone well, and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li>The smell is also not overly strong or make-up like.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but found it too light for my complexion, which is pretty fair.  </li>
            <li>It covers better than most, goes on silky smooth and leaves a nice soft, dewy finish---not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Fills pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Coverage is medium to light, depending on how you apply.</li>
            <li>I like a light amount and this works for that.</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky smooth and looks fabulous with just this product.  </li>
            <li>MEDIUM SHADE is really to light on my skin.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s too light for a medium tone</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too light</li>
            <li>While it I perfect for summer with SPF 20 and the light coverage, I can also see it becoming my year round makeup!</li>
            <li>Mineral powders can be good, but they&#x27;re expensive, don&#x27;t provide the best coverage for blemishes, and the brushes are a breeding ground for acne-causing bacteria.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t  sure at first, but I do enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>A much cheaper CC cream than Juice (I got a sample that I loved) and I like this one so much that I replaced my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is an AMAZING product.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice finish not a harsh matte.</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft glow too, but</li>
            <li>I have tried so many foundations, minerals, powders, creams in recent months and nothing has really had as good coverage and finish as this product.</li>
            <li>it is a really neutral (leaning more toward ashy) tone, not yellow-y like a lot of BB creams.</li>
            <li>Good product but kind of a small tube for the amount you need to use.</li>
            <li>No offensive odor, nice tube with easy to use pointed tip to squeeze out just enough for your preference.  </li>
            <li>and I think other people should know what a great product this is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like super matte</li>
            <li>-I&#x27;m a pretty fair skinned blonde.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>This cc in medium was much lighter than the medium in bb, it took away all my redness and discoloration and matched my light skin tone.</li>
            <li>its worth it</li>
            <li>, this gives you more natural shine that people think you&#x27;re not wearing anything on your face.</li>
            <li>so I rarely put anything on over it.  </li>
            <li>I took a picture after an 8 hour work day and my makeup still looks as fresh as the moment I put it on.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite of the CC Creams.</li>
            <li>I have been using it in place of my regular foundation and it covers beautifully, leaving my skin evened out and covering imperfections without actually looking like I am wearing a ton of make up!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smoothly and seems to last.</li>
            <li>, it went on nicely, but I did have dry spots after putting on the product.</li>
            <li>I love it even more now because the price was a few dollars cheaper when bought from this seller.</li>
            <li>I have fair to medium skin, and I typically use makeup bases that are in the light natural or buff range.</li>
            <li>Overall it was okay</li>
            <li>It evens my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or that I&#x27;m wearing too much (or any at all) makeup!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>Love the finish, the M is a little light if you have a tan.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is sometimes more oily than dry, so keeping my skin&#x27;s natural oiliness in check with a powder feel is important.</li>
            <li>I would say it offers medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel very soft and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>I use less foundation and it is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than I would expect for a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy the cc cream by It Cosmetics but its costs as much as my phone bill</li>
            <li>Not a fan of this product, it leaves too much of a shine.  </li>
            <li>Excelent product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cover much.</li>
            <li>For a &amp;#34;color correction&amp;#34; cream it really does its job.</li>
            <li>I like this because you can really control the amount of product you use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really fuss-free since I still go to school in the mornings, so this has really been a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>I found that it&#x27;s much cheaper buying from Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very blendable.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be buying this again.</li>
            <li>makes my skin looks smooth and younger.</li>
            <li>Very liquidity when applying, but I actually like that texture due to how it goes on a lot more smoothly on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Give this time, I originally used the same brand BB.  </li>
            <li>Holds up well to light sweat and beach time, but anything involving a lot of water (long workout and swimming)</li>
            <li>Covers dark spots better than others I have used</li>
            <li>ok, so I&#x27;ve bought all the CC and BB creams on the market and found most of them to be almost useless.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t rate it high as it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Other foundations have good coverage, but have a wet finish in a way that I feel that my make-up has shifted on my face by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The finish is dewy but it gets a little more matte if you let it set by itself for about a minute.</li>
            <li>The coverage is heavy and blotchy especially in hot weather.</li>
            <li>I also use argan oils normally and found that on humid days this was sufficient, use instead of oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal skin type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find make up that will be more natural and take less time to apply.</li>
            <li>for over a year and is the only thing I use for imperfection coverage and set it with light powder which last me all day&lt;br /&gt;without</li>
            <li>I usually wear light to medium in cc creams, so I was worried this being medium would be too dark, but it is in fact too light!</li>
            <li>I did buy it locally the first time just in case..</li>
            <li>Its exactly the same product as the one I bought at the drug store.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily with large pores and I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and clogged pores but my skin is usually not very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is a natural finish, and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>The formula is not heavy but still covers well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to put anything else on as far as foundation goes.</li>
            <li>Only CC cream I&#x27;ve tried and been absolutely ecstatic about the results.</li>
            <li>This one goes on so soft and almost powdery</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by the shade--</li>
            <li>By the time it dried, it had a light powdery finish.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it has a very noticeable fragrance.</li>
            <li>It matches almost perfectly without looking beige or orange or that annoying whitening that I don&#x27;t want or need at all..</li>
            <li>combination (oilier in summer, drier in winter) and living in new england have had some very hot humid days and dry days recently to test this out thoroughly -</li>
            <li>There is something in it that makes my eye water, but that&#x27;s not unusual because lots of products make my eye (just the right eye) water.</li>
            <li>The coverage is better than any other drugstore brand I&#x27;ve tried, and there is a slight smell</li>
            <li>I did expensive research before ordering and I am so glad I chose this one!</li>
            <li>When i wear this my skin looks smooth, glowy without looking greasy, and I only need a little concealer for bigger breakouts.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough so far about this.</li>
            <li>, I have barely tan skin</li>
            <li>It actually leaves just a slight and pretty dewy glow!</li>
            <li>I have combo skin, this just made me a hot greasy mess before noon!</li>
            <li>I have little problems with blemishes and uneven  skin tone and this product covers all of it up and still feels light like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup at all.</li>

            <li> But I&#x27;m glad it turned out to be perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the best CC cream I have tried and there have been many.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is excellent compared to most others.  </li>
            <li> it matched my skin tone perfectly and it sat on top of the pores without sinking in.</li>
            <li> It would be good for all skin types I think.</li>
            <li> Lightweight with good coverage that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The color is good, but the finish is shiny and I have to use a setting powder.  </li>
            <li> Good coverage - no need for additional foundation.</li>
            <li> I have rarely been able to find a makeup that is a perfect match and didn&#x27;t leave the dreaded line around the edges, but this blends perfectly!</li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t look like I plastered my face, but did a good job of hiding imperfections and discolorations.</li>
            <li> But the texture and coverage is good.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this CC cream at my drug store before, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I tried this in medium although I have fair skin</li>
            <li> On my face, it was just as good as the sample I tried on my hand--</li>
            <li> and I am fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved that.</li>
            <li> I love the no make up feel and look with the great coverage.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> The smell is refreshing and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I still apply this because it makes my skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> I liked the Lumene bb cream</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a nice glow (not a greasy look).</li>
            <li> It comes in two shades and although I am unfortunately very fair-skinned, the medium is the best match form.</li>
            <li> Brightens skin and evens tone, nice consistency.</li>
            <li> However, despite the nice coverage I think oxidization has caused the product to become lighter in color</li>
            <li> Nice cream,</li>
            <li> I liked the coverage</li>
            <li> Light pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving their products and plan to try more items.</li>
            <li> This has a good color for medium skin tones, but coverage is light.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is very light feeling yet has good coverage.</li>
            <li> The medium is a good shade---the light is very light and makes me look like Casper.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t settle into my pores or fine lines, it had great coverage that covered my acne and blemishes, a perfect color match, and a dry lightweight finish.</li>
            <li> I have fairly ligt skin, but based on other reviews I ordered a medium and the color is a perfect match!</li>
            <li> I bought medium (its a very light medium).</li>
            <li> like, very light.  </li>
            <li> but the price here is even better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> With summer around the corner; why wear more products than you have to?  </li>
            <li> But most Korean brands either test or are selling China</li>
            <li> It hides my many imperfections well.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would love this product if it was a tad bit darker.</li>
            <li> I love Lumene products except for this one.</li>
            <li> Color is ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Someone else may love it.</li>
            <li> Like the medium better than the light.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I use it as a concealer and never found anything better.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Light texture, absorbs quickly, nice semi matte finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with fair skin and freckles and the light is too light.  </li>
            <li> Was ok.</li>
            <li> Still think Maybelline is better.</li>
            <li> I just have to say that this is a lovely product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this CC cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is smooth and covers nicely without looking like you are wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> love this CC</li>
            <li> functions as a primer if you want more coverage with foundation or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cc cream was much better, I had it in medium and the shades are not comparable at all to the bb.</li>
            <li> Very good but on me the light is too light and the medium is a tad too dark and I am very fair.</li>
            <li> Feels great on, very light &amp; not heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> the color Is very light for a medium, I would say its a light.</li>
            <li> face looks a lot more healthier and smooth.</li>
            <li> so I looked into a US available brand that was more than a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations and primers hoping to find something that felt light on my skin</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, goes on smoothly, great light coverage and SPF to boot...</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, matches my skin tone</li>
            <li> It matches my skin tone well, and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li> The smell is also not overly strong or make-up like.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but found it too light for my complexion, which is pretty fair.  </li>
            <li> It covers better than most, goes on silky smooth and leaves a nice soft, dewy finish---not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Fills pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Coverage is medium to light, depending on how you apply.</li>
            <li> I like a light amount and this works for that.</li>
            <li> My skin feels silky smooth and looks fabulous with just this product.  </li>
            <li> MEDIUM SHADE is really to light on my skin.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s too light for a medium tone</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too light</li>
            <li> While it I perfect for summer with SPF 20 and the light coverage, I can also see it becoming my year round makeup!</li>
            <li> Mineral powders can be good, but they&#x27;re expensive, don&#x27;t provide the best coverage for blemishes, and the brushes are a breeding ground for acne-causing bacteria.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t  sure at first, but I do enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> A much cheaper CC cream than Juice (I got a sample that I loved) and I like this one so much that I replaced my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is an AMAZING product.  </li>
            <li> This has a nice finish not a harsh matte.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft glow too, but</li>
            <li> I have tried so many foundations, minerals, powders, creams in recent months and nothing has really had as good coverage and finish as this product.</li>
            <li> it is a really neutral (leaning more toward ashy) tone, not yellow-y like a lot of BB creams.</li>
            <li> Good product but kind of a small tube for the amount you need to use.</li>
            <li> No offensive odor, nice tube with easy to use pointed tip to squeeze out just enough for your preference.  </li>
            <li> and I think other people should know what a great product this is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like super matte</li>
            <li> -I&#x27;m a pretty fair skinned blonde.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> This cc in medium was much lighter than the medium in bb, it took away all my redness and discoloration and matched my light skin tone.</li>
            <li> its worth it</li>
            <li> , this gives you more natural shine that people think you&#x27;re not wearing anything on your face.</li>
            <li> so I rarely put anything on over it.  </li>
            <li> I took a picture after an 8 hour work day and my makeup still looks as fresh as the moment I put it on.</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite of the CC Creams.</li>
            <li> I have been using it in place of my regular foundation and it covers beautifully, leaving my skin evened out and covering imperfections without actually looking like I am wearing a ton of make up!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and smoothly and seems to last.</li>
            <li> , it went on nicely, but I did have dry spots after putting on the product.</li>
            <li> I love it even more now because the price was a few dollars cheaper when bought from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have fair to medium skin, and I typically use makeup bases that are in the light natural or buff range.</li>
            <li> Overall it was okay</li>
            <li> It evens my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or that I&#x27;m wearing too much (or any at all) makeup!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Love the finish, the M is a little light if you have a tan.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is sometimes more oily than dry, so keeping my skin&#x27;s natural oiliness in check with a powder feel is important.</li>
            <li> I would say it offers medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel very soft and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> I use less foundation and it is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than I would expect for a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy the cc cream by It Cosmetics but its costs as much as my phone bill</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this product, it leaves too much of a shine.  </li>
            <li> Excelent product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t cover much.</li>
            <li> For a &amp;#34;color correction&amp;#34; cream it really does its job.</li>
            <li> I like this because you can really control the amount of product you use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really fuss-free since I still go to school in the mornings, so this has really been a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I found that it&#x27;s much cheaper buying from Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very blendable.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> makes my skin looks smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> Very liquidity when applying, but I actually like that texture due to how it goes on a lot more smoothly on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Give this time, I originally used the same brand BB.  </li>
            <li> Holds up well to light sweat and beach time, but anything involving a lot of water (long workout and swimming)</li>
            <li> Covers dark spots better than others I have used</li>
            <li> ok, so I&#x27;ve bought all the CC and BB creams on the market and found most of them to be almost useless.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t rate it high as it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Other foundations have good coverage, but have a wet finish in a way that I feel that my make-up has shifted on my face by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The finish is dewy but it gets a little more matte if you let it set by itself for about a minute.</li>
            <li> The coverage is heavy and blotchy especially in hot weather.</li>
            <li> I also use argan oils normally and found that on humid days this was sufficient, use instead of oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal skin type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find make up that will be more natural and take less time to apply.</li>
            <li> for over a year and is the only thing I use for imperfection coverage and set it with light powder which last me all day&lt;br /&gt;without</li>
            <li> I usually wear light to medium in cc creams, so I was worried this being medium would be too dark, but it is in fact too light!</li>
            <li> I did buy it locally the first time just in case..</li>
            <li> Its exactly the same product as the one I bought at the drug store.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily with large pores and I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and clogged pores but my skin is usually not very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is a natural finish, and not heavy.  </li>
            <li> The formula is not heavy but still covers well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to put anything else on as far as foundation goes.</li>
            <li> Only CC cream I&#x27;ve tried and been absolutely ecstatic about the results.</li>
            <li> This one goes on so soft and almost powdery</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by the shade--</li>
            <li> By the time it dried, it had a light powdery finish.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it has a very noticeable fragrance.</li>
            <li> It matches almost perfectly without looking beige or orange or that annoying whitening that I don&#x27;t want or need at all..</li>
            <li> combination (oilier in summer, drier in winter) and living in new england have had some very hot humid days and dry days recently to test this out thoroughly -</li>
            <li> There is something in it that makes my eye water, but that&#x27;s not unusual because lots of products make my eye (just the right eye) water.</li>
            <li> The coverage is better than any other drugstore brand I&#x27;ve tried, and there is a slight smell</li>
            <li> I did expensive research before ordering and I am so glad I chose this one!</li>
            <li> When i wear this my skin looks smooth, glowy without looking greasy, and I only need a little concealer for bigger breakouts.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough so far about this.</li>
            <li> , I have barely tan skin</li>
            <li> It actually leaves just a slight and pretty dewy glow!</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, this just made me a hot greasy mess before noon!</li>
            <li> I have little problems with blemishes and uneven  skin tone and this product covers all of it up and still feels light like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup at all.</li>
            <li> I started trying out alternatives but the coverage was never really adequate anything other than an actual foundation; this did, really.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with bases being too orange or pink for my skin, but this CC cream doesn&#x27;t have that artificial looking warm tinge to it.</li>
            <li> Other foundations I&#x27;ve tried settle into my pores and fine lines making me look tired and emphasizing the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> Usually with the missha I use concealer on top of the foundation for around 6 tiny areas, but with this, concealer is unnecessary except for one area.</li>
            <li> I like a decent coverage foundation, usually revlon 24 hour.</li>
            <li> I started off using Korean BB creams, and when the craze hit the US I avoided those because they were mostly terrible and primarily tinted moisturizers or made by companies that test on animals or sell cheap, low quality cosmetics.</li>
            <li> and I have tried them all, cheap to expensive.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive CC creams, this one totally fits the bill and then some.  </li>
            <li> goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I work and go to school for long days, and I think this makeup holds up well.</li>
            <li> My skin developed breakouts in places I don&#x27;t normally get them, more clogs than usual, dry red weird patches all over both cheeks, and overall my skin just looked unhealthy.</li>
            <li> I am posting a review because there is only one other review</li>
            <li> Lighter than a traditional &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; make up or other CC creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> It also accentuates any dry patches you may have, so please exfoliate.</li>
            <li> This is lighter, and a little different in consistency.  </li>
            <li> It covers red spots, uneven coloring...</li>
            <li> Works in combination with other products, but doesn&#x27;t stand on its own as a base layer, for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> sold on this - am not using any other foundations anymore.</li>
            <li> no more neon white face.  </li>
            <li> I was worried after reading how other BB an CC creams could be oily, but this one states a semi-matte finish and it truly is.</li>
            <li> but I purchased a shade darker (medium) as some of the other reviewers have recommended</li>
            <li> I tend to run oily in the T zone and dry/sensitive other places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other BB creams, but they are either too oily or</li>
            <li> This product was too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> I also use Georgio Armani Luminous Silk foundation which is expensive and this comes very close in quality and feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for a base for a foundation</li>
            <li> Plus its cheaper than a lot of other drugstore brand CC creams!</li>
            <li> I wanted to find products that would allow me to wear less and this stuff does just that.</li>
            <li> I no longer have breakouts and my skin feels much less greasy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> so I am using much less as well.</li>
            <li> It covers even severe imperfections and a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little worried about using it.</li>
            <li> cream-- gives just a little coverage to make skintone even, but appear as if you&#x27;re not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> and BUT it seems to disappear after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble skin at 29</li>
            <li> I opened the tube in the box and there was dried up cream in the cap and tip of the tube.</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research on CC cream as I have always used a heavy liquid foundation plus setting powder.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could have continued wearing it, but it was irritating my skin, especially over time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me look pale or washed out at all.</li>
            <li> but i usually do anyway.</li>
            <li> and they also usually contain whitening elements,</li>
            <li> This is one of the few CC creams that comes in colors!</li>
            <li> (Usually I think I&#x27;m a light-medium?)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t say the same thing about the Lumene BB cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;becoming hard to find in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> The coverage is a bit thick for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tested on animals, it gives full coverage, it&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t have that terrible whitening that Korean BB creams often have.</li>
            <li> might* be too dark since the descriptions are so vague.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> but I wanted this for something to replace my foundation when I am out casually.</li>
            <li> Too bad I cannot wear it with summer coming up.</li>
            <li> I can wear it alone since it&#x27;s tinted, or use as a makeup base.  </li>
            <li> This has replaced my makeup base.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as bad as garniers bb cream, which is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is REALLY GREAT!! I use it alone very good coverage. I liked the Lumene bb cream but I have oily skin and I got shiny with it. This has a nice finish not a harsh matte. It gives my skin a nice glow (not a greasy look). It would be good for all skin types I think. I hope they never stop selling it. The price is great! We used to sell it where I work and it was $15 its worth it but the price here is even better. Its like wearing nothing at all. I love the no make up feel and look with the great coverage. Hides my flaws and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love this! Goes on well, stays on all day, even in humid conditions - just don&#x27;t touch your face. Feels great on, very light &amp; not heavy feeling. Coverage is medium to light, depending on how you apply. This is better than any expensive department store brand I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Very liquidity when applying, but I actually like that texture due to how it goes on a lot more smoothly on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is my third bottle. I&#x27;ve been trying to find make up that will be more natural and take less time to apply. I wanted to find products that would allow me to wear less and this stuff does just that. It says CC Cream but it gives enough coverage where I don&#x27;t even need foundation or BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;My face looks a lot more healthier and smooth. I don&#x27;t like super matte, this gives you more natural shine that people think you&#x27;re not wearing anything on your face.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was well packaged. This product was too dark for my skin. Overall it was okay, it went on nicely, but I did have dry spots after putting on the product.</li>
            <li> Best CC cream I have tried! I have purchased others that are much more expensive and they don&#x27;t come close to the coverage of this product. I use less foundation and it is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have little problems with blemishes and uneven  skin tone and this product covers all of it up and still feels light like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup at all. Especially if your skin is oily it does not feel like it melts off</li>
            <li> Give this time, I originally used the same brand BB.  This is lighter, and a little different in consistency.  I wasn&#x27;t  sure at first, but I do enjoy using this product.  It is a natural finish, and not heavy.  The smell is also not overly strong or make-up like.</li>
            <li> The coverage is heavy and blotchy especially in hot weather. It melted of my face .</li>
            <li> sold on this - am not using any other foundations anymore. I like a light amount and this works for that.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Made my skin look great! Wish they had it in darker shades for the summer.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is an AMAZING product.  I have oily skin and not only does this even my skin tone, but it also absorbs oil.  On days I don&#x27;t wear make-up I still apply this because it makes my skin feel amazing.  My skin feels silky smooth and looks fabulous with just this product.  I only recently discovered Lumene products when I received a sample of the serum.  I&#x27;m really loving their products and plan to try more items.</li>
            <li> Best product out there. It&#x27;s the only one I use. I use it in place of a foundation. You don&#x27;t have to reapply and it gives great coverage. Also the price is unbeatable for the quality.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this CC cream - I&#x27;ll cry if they stop making it!  The medium color is perfect, the texture is divine, the coverage is superb.  I wear this as my foundation and set with an IT Cosmetics powder and it lasts all day.  My tzone is oily, but this cream doesn&#x27;t get schmery or shiny.  I do not have acne prone skin, but even when I accidently sleep in this makeup I don&#x27;t end up with blemishes.  Also, the price CANNOT be beat.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive CC creams, this one totally fits the bill and then some.  The formula is not heavy but still covers well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, goes on smoothly, great light coverage and SPF to boot...&lt;br /&gt;Great product I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 years...i will continue</li>
            <li> Lightweight with good coverage that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than I would expect for a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade. It goes on easily and smoothly and seems to last. There is something in it that makes my eye water, but that&#x27;s not unusual because lots of products make my eye (just the right eye) water. If you have problems with Physicians Formula, you may have problems with this, because I react the same way to both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BB cream and lotions in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing compares to this. It does exactly what it says! It evens my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or that I&#x27;m wearing too much (or any at all) makeup! It&#x27;s weightless on your face. You don&#x27;t need to put anything else on as far as foundation goes. Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It SMELLS AMAZING, too!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!  I can wear it alone since it&#x27;s tinted, or use as a makeup base.  It makes my skin glow so I rarely put anything on over it.  With summer around the corner; why wear more products than you have to?  Makes my face feel very soft and fresh feeling.  Not to mention it has an SPF of 20.  Will be reordering soon so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> The coverage is a bit thick for me.  The color is good, but the finish is shiny and I have to use a setting powder.  I will use the rest- but will look for a tinted moisturizer next time.</li>
            <li> Good product but kind of a small tube for the amount you need to use.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough so far about this. I like a decent coverage foundation, usually revlon 24 hour. I have been trying different ones recently as after using that for years AND seeing that summer is coming needing something with SPF in it I started trying out alternatives but the coverage was never really adequate anything other than an actual foundation; this did, really. I have medium/fair skin, combination (oilier in summer, drier in winter) and living in new england have had some very hot humid days and dry days recently to test this out thoroughly - it passed both, maybe needs a touch of powder later on humid days but i usually do anyway. I also use argan oils normally and found that on humid days this was sufficient, use instead of oil.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly give it a try!! I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I am posting a review because there is only one other review and I think other people should know what a great product this is. I started off using Korean BB creams, and when the craze hit the US I avoided those because they were mostly terrible and primarily tinted moisturizers or made by companies that test on animals or sell cheap, low quality cosmetics. But most Korean brands either test or are selling China and they also usually contain whitening elements, so I looked into a US available brand that was more than a tinted moisturizer. I came upon great reviews for Lumene&#x27;s BB cream, and instead tried the CC cream which is often on sale.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It&#x27;s not tested on animals, it gives full coverage, it&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t have that terrible whitening that Korean BB creams often have. It comes in two shades and although I am unfortunately very fair-skinned, the medium is the best match form. It matches almost perfectly without looking beige or orange or that annoying whitening that I don&#x27;t want or need at all.. It covers red spots, uneven coloring...It won&#x27;t cover under eye circles but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for. Overall I bought 4 of these during the 40% off sale and this is now my staple CC (and replacement for BB!) cream.</li>
            <li> Love the finish, the M is a little light if you have a tan. Good coverage - no need for additional foundation.</li>
            <li> ok, so I&#x27;ve bought all the CC and BB creams on the market and found most of them to be almost useless.  This is one of the few CC creams that comes in colors! Finally! no more neon white face.  It goes on easily, matches my skin tone-I&#x27;m a pretty fair skinned blonde.  It has a nice soft glow too, but and BUT it seems to disappear after a few hours.  Maybe a primer would help, but then why bother w/ a CC cream??</li>
            <li> This product is terrific!  It hides my many imperfections well.  I simply do not understand why it can no longer be found in stores.  I was so glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Where has this product been all my life! I did expensive research before ordering and I am so glad I chose this one! I have fairly ligt skin, but based on other reviews I ordered a medium and the color is a perfect match! I have rarely been able to find a makeup that is a perfect match and didn&#x27;t leave the dreaded line around the edges, but this blends perfectly! I was worried after reading how other BB an CC creams could be oily, but this one states a semi-matte finish and it truly is. It actually leaves just a slight and pretty dewy glow! I have been using it in place of my regular foundation and it covers beautifully, leaving my skin evened out and covering imperfections without actually looking like I am wearing a ton of make up! While it I perfect for summer with SPF 20 and the light coverage, I can also see it becoming my year round makeup!</li>
            <li> I would love this product if it was a tad bit darker. I usually wear light to medium in cc creams, so I was worried this being medium would be too dark, but it is in fact too light! The coverage is better than any other drugstore brand I&#x27;ve tried, and there is a slight smell but it&#x27;s not as bad as garniers bb cream, which is terrible. Too bad I cannot wear it with summer coming up. I could get away with this shade in the winter months though.</li>
            <li> great coverage....Lighter than a traditional &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; make up or other CC creams I have used.  Covers dark spots better than others I have used</li>
            <li> The best CC cream I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried them all!  It covers even severe imperfections and a little goes a long way.  Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Finally!! I wanted to buy the cc cream by It Cosmetics but its costs as much as my phone bill so when i read the reviews on this one and saw the price I had to try it. I have trouble skin at 29 and I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations and primers hoping to find something that felt light on my skin, didn&#x27;t look like I plastered my face, but did a good job of hiding imperfections and discolorations. I bought medium (its a very light medium). When i wear this my skin looks smooth, glowy without looking greasy, and I only need a little concealer for bigger breakouts. Yay!</li>
            <li> I love Lumene products except for this one. Drying my skin out, rests on the wrinkles, I would rather use the BB Creme.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used. Goes on smoothly and is very light feeling yet has good coverage.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this product, it leaves too much of a shine.  Color is ok</li>
            <li> MEDIUM SHADE is really to light on my skin. But the texture and coverage is good.</li>
            <li> Very good but on me the light is too light and the medium is a tad too dark and I am very fair.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Brightens skin and evens tone, nice consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price. Someone else may love it. I find it&#x27;s too light for a medium tone, I have barely tan skin and it&#x27;s too light and it doesn&#x27;t cover much. It&#x27;s better for a base for a foundation but I wanted this for something to replace my foundation when I am out casually. It wasn&#x27;t my fave. I am going to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Missha BB cream in 23 which was a perfect match for my skin tone at the beginning. However, despite the nice coverage I think oxidization has caused the product to become lighter in color and sometimes I just look like a ghost wearing it by itself. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about CC creams and I decided to try this after reading some great reviews. For reference, I have yellow undertones, NC25 in MAC, and I thought the medium *might* be too dark since the descriptions are so vague. (Usually I think I&#x27;m a light-medium?) But I&#x27;m glad it turned out to be perfect! The smell is refreshing and pleasant. The coverage is great and its so lightweight and creamy. The finish is dewy but it gets a little more matte if you let it set by itself for about a minute. For a &amp;#34;color correction&amp;#34; cream it really does its job. Usually with the missha I use concealer on top of the foundation for around 6 tiny areas, but with this, concealer is unnecessary except for one area. It has a tiny applicator not unlike those with La-Roche Posay products. I like this because you can really control the amount of product you use. Plus its cheaper than a lot of other drugstore brand CC creams! I&#x27;m really fuss-free since I still go to school in the mornings, so this has really been a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent as a foundation. Like the medium better than the light.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Lumene is a very good product and the Time Freeze is wonderful.  I use it as a concealer and never found anything better.  Used to purchase Lumene at CVS but they do not carry that line anymore.  Again I am so thankful for Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only CC cream I&#x27;ve tried and been absolutely ecstatic about the results.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, this just made me a hot greasy mess before noon! If you have drier skin it might work for you! I like the coverage upon application and feel, just not the grease!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this CC cream (as a primer) for a couple of days and I love it. It goes on evenly and stays on all day, without getting oily on my already oily-prone skin. I took a picture after an 8 hour work day and my makeup still looks as fresh as the moment I put it on. I have fair skin but I purchased a shade darker (medium) as some of the other reviewers have recommended and I&#x27;m glad I did. It doesn&#x27;t make me look pale or washed out at all. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Good product. Light texture, absorbs quickly, nice semi matte finish. No allergy. Light pleasant fragrance. I use Lumene products for years and like this brand. It knows what our northern skin needs.</li>
            <li> This is the best tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Best CC cream on the market. I also use Georgio Armani Luminous Silk foundation which is expensive and this comes very close in quality and feel on my skin. I have oily t-zone and this helps with the shine. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Just received this item. I&#x27;m a little worried about using it. The box looks like a toddler chewed on it. I opened the tube in the box and there was dried up cream in the cap and tip of the tube.</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research on CC cream as I have always used a heavy liquid foundation plus setting powder. This had great reviews so I thought I would try it. I did buy it locally the first time just in case.. I no longer have breakouts and my skin feels much less greasy at the end of the day. I have normal skin type. I found that it&#x27;s much cheaper buying from Amazon so I bought my second tube via prime. Its exactly the same product as the one I bought at the drug store. A little goes a long way so I am using much less as well. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have been using CC creams for awhile now.  I prefer the CC over the BB.  This one goes on so soft and almost powdery like, very light.  It leaves your face feeling flawless.  It is by far my favorite of the CC Creams.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives me the coverage I want and does not make my skin greasy. It is a matte finish. I have been using this&lt;br /&gt;product for over a year and is the only thing I use for imperfection coverage and set it with light powder which last me all day&lt;br /&gt;without having to retouch.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, the color Is very light for a medium, I would say its a light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this CC cream at my drug store before, and I loved it. I love it even more now because the price was a few dollars cheaper when bought from this seller. This has replaced my makeup base. It matches my skin tone well, and it goes on easy. It&#x27;s very blendable. I would say it offers medium to full coverage. I have fair to medium skin, and I typically use makeup bases that are in the light natural or buff range. I use the Medium Lumene CC Cream. I have an issue with bases being too orange or pink for my skin, but this CC cream doesn&#x27;t have that artificial looking warm tinge to it. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t say the same thing about the Lumene BB cream. I bought it thinking I would love it too, but it has a weird orange color to it. I work and go to school for long days, and I think this makeup holds up well. I just use a translucent powder during the day a couple of times to control some shine. I tend to run oily in the T zone and dry/sensitive other places.</li>
            <li> This is the best CC cream I have tried and there have been many.  It covers better than most, goes on silky smooth and leaves a nice soft, dewy finish---not greasy.  Sometimes I will brush a bit of mineral power over it for extra coverage.  I have rosacea and this CC cream works great.  The medium is a good shade---the light is very light and makes me look like Casper.  I am a redhead with fair skin and freckles and the light is too light.  Also, the price is excellent compared to most others.  No offensive odor, nice tube with easy to use pointed tip to squeeze out just enough for your preference.  I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> Was ok. Still think Maybelline is better.</li>
            <li> I just have to say that this is a lovely product. Seriously. I have tried so many foundations, minerals, powders, creams in recent months and nothing has really had as good coverage and finish as this product. Other foundations I&#x27;ve tried settle into my pores and fine lines making me look tired and emphasizing the size of my pores. Other foundations have good coverage, but have a wet finish in a way that I feel that my make-up has shifted on my face by the end of the day. Mineral powders can be good, but they&#x27;re expensive, don&#x27;t provide the best coverage for blemishes, and the brushes are a breeding ground for acne-causing bacteria. I&#x27;ve used other BB creams, but they are either too oily or the color is off. This CC creams seems to meet all my criteria. I tried this in medium although I have fair skin and I was pleasantly surprised by the shade-- it is a really neutral (leaning more toward ashy) tone, not yellow-y like a lot of BB creams. I put a dab on my hand and I was so impressed-- it matched my skin tone perfectly and it sat on top of the pores without sinking in. By the time it dried, it had a light powdery finish. I have combination skin that is sometimes more oily than dry, so keeping my skin&#x27;s natural oiliness in check with a powder feel is important. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on my face. On my face, it was just as good as the sample I tried on my hand-- it didn&#x27;t settle into my pores or fine lines, it had great coverage that covered my acne and blemishes, a perfect color match, and a dry lightweight finish. Not to mention the price is great. I will absolutely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This has a good color for medium skin tones, but coverage is light. It doesn&#x27;t adhere to my T-zone. Works in combination with other products, but doesn&#x27;t stand on its own as a base layer, for me.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this CC cream. It is perfect for my skin and I am fair skin tone. Loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. A much cheaper CC cream than Juice (I got a sample that I loved) and I like this one so much that I replaced my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer with it. Holds up well to light sweat and beach time, but anything involving a lot of water (long workout and swimming) it will need to be reapplied. But for the price it&#x27;s not a big deal as you will have to do that anyway.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but found it too light for my complexion, which is pretty fair.  This is one of the best foundations I have ever used and I have tried them all, cheap to expensive.  It has great coverage, blends perfectly with my skin tone.  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  Fills pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> This cream is smooth and covers nicely without looking like you are wearing makeup. It leaves your skin soft but not greasy. I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> love this CC cream-- gives just a little coverage to make skintone even, but appear as if you&#x27;re not wearing makeup. functions as a primer if you want more coverage with foundation or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;becoming hard to find in the drug stores. why is it that all the best products get discontinued?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping and good service.</li>
            <li> makes my skin looks smooth and younger. does not cause irration or break outs and I do have sensitive skin. however, it is cakey . luvs ths fact that it has SPF 20!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily with large pores and I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and clogged pores but my skin is usually not very sensitive. I also want to say I did not like the bb cream from this brand, the medium shade of that was so orange and it just felt gross on my face. This cc cream was much better, I had it in medium and the shades are not comparable at all to the bb. This cc in medium was much lighter than the medium in bb, it took away all my redness and discoloration and matched my light skin tone. I loved that. I wish I could have continued wearing it, but it was irritating my skin, especially over time. My skin developed breakouts in places I don&#x27;t normally get them, more clogs than usual, dry red weird patches all over both cheeks, and overall my skin just looked unhealthy. It also accentuates any dry patches you may have, so please exfoliate. Lastly, it has a very noticeable fragrance. All in all I liked the coverage but I can&#x27;t rate it high as it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin at all.</li>
