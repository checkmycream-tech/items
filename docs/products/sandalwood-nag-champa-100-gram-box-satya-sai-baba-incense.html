            <li>/&gt;The smell is a warm, woodsy, affirming, reassuring aroma...</li>
            <li>like a warm hug...</li>
            <li>the kind of smell you&#x27;d associate with relaxation....</li>
            <li>has a kind of &amp;#34;middle&amp;#34; smell...</li>
            <li>A nice woody smell and nice after-smell after the stick is burned.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is another real Nag product, however when this was received there was an opening somewhere in the sealed wrapper that had my front door area smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>Genuine Indian incense is top notch!!</li>
            <li>Very Delicious High Quality Fragrance..</li>
            <li>NEW FAVORITE FLAVOR!!!!</li>
            <li>good product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>She gets headaches extremely easy from scented candles and soaps, and is able to use this with no problems so definitely a good buy for the cautious incense user.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not as good as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It is a bit strong but it makes the house smell nicely.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent of sandalwood, but this product didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I love sandalwood, and it&#x27;s derivates.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.....</li>
            <li>I love this manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I already plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li>more specifically:  </li>
            <li>sure maybe to a more discerning nose, one might smell that</li>
            <li>sure you can always get a refund/return</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances for sure this is a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>If you love the \\&quot;Satya Sandalwood\\</li>
            <li>I love burning incense</li>
            <li>I prefer that sometimes because it&#x27;s the scent that I love, not smoke in the air.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to purchase it as needed depending on price.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand a nd aroma in one box.</li>
            <li>Sample pack was better quality that 100 gram pack.</li>
            <li>I love the inundation of incense in SE Asia, which made me feel so relaxed despite the blaring heat, motorbikes and durian smells.  </li>
            <li>It costs more but as they say, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I love the sandalwood incense from Satya.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is okay</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this smell.....</li>
            <li>I love the Nag Champa and am always satisifed when the package arrives.</li>
            <li>A perennial favorite in our house.  </li>
            <li>It goes along perfectly with deep meditations.</li>
            <li>It has become one of my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li>will buy again, got to love it.</li>
            <li>I love the original Nag Champa and I love sandalwood</li>
            <li>sandalwood has a great intense smell, this package is great because it comes with a pretty large amount of sticks.  </li>
            <li>Since I was already familiar with the product, I am quite satisfied with my order.  </li>
            <li>I am familiar with this brand and usually love their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this one is very close to the best the ancient incense making traditions of the East offers.</li>
            <li>If the box I received has the correct product in it, then I believe if you are a fan of Dhoop, you will really enjoy this Satya Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I bought the 100gr box and the scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li>You have the cheap Sandalwood;</li>
            <li>makes the whole house smell amazing</li>
            <li>This order smells like a cheap perfume from the dollar store...</li>
            <li>Still enjoy lighting it.</li>
            <li>So, if you like Champa, you&#x27;ll enjoy Sandalwood Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>but I have to light each stick 3-4 times as it keeps going out.  </li>
            <li>you just want the sandalwood scent in the air, most sandalwood incenses or candles will do a good enough job of it.</li>
            <li>Great sandalwood scent and long sticks.</li>
            <li>&quot; Fragrance be WARNED it has changed significantly...</li>
            <li>That sickly sweet, cheap incense smell.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this as a gift - but ended up keeping it for myself.</li>
            <li>They smell great and they burn for a long time.</li>
            <li>The sticks are darker in color, burn differently, and not as pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li>It burns for a good 45 minutes and does not irritate your eyes like many other brands.  </li>
            <li>Still very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing, I love a shop or a home with a bit on incense smell.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed very much!.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then make sure your order is somewhat moist and very flaky.</li>
            <li>It has a very rich and refined sandalwood scent - very sublime.</li>
            <li>Not consistent with what I have experienced with this manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>The sellers got the product to me quickly</li>
            <li>Great product obviously made with high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>But this sandalwood is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Such a lovely smell too!</li>
            <li>This particular brand is long lasting, strong, and so beautifully fragranced!</li>
            <li>This sandalwood incense has a very relaxing smooth fragrance that doesn&#x27;t invade your senses.  </li>
            <li>by far my favorite scent ever.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent of Sandalwood, keeps me focused and clear as well as helps me to relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fun time.</li>
            <li>maybe something you&#x27;d have burning right after a shower...</li>
            <li>The small box smelled lovely, fragrant, woodsy and warm.</li>
            <li>It does burn clean and is very fragrant.</li>
            <li>Sandlewood is a very nice, like outdoors fragrance, yet next time I will order the Original Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa fragrance that was sooo relaxing for me for so many years in the past.</li>
            <li>But it really does - for me - have a special place in my&#x27; incense collection.</li>
            <li>However, It has been years since I&#x27;ve found an incense that really evokes the true aroma of Indian sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>Makes my home feel peaceful and calm.  </li>
            <li>my favorite incense, real sandalwood scent, this is a good deal for the price and will last you a long time</li>
            <li>but the smell is definitely, a dry warm wood smell....</li>
            <li>It still smells like sandalwood, however nowhere near as strong as when it was delivered.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not stale, because it looks nice and fresh, like the other box.</li>
            <li>This sandalwood smells almost exactly like Laxmi Dhoop Incense.</li>
            <li>Periodically I place an order here on Amazon and the most recent order</li>
            <li>I do burn Japanese sandalwood incense much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It smells like old socks and cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>I liked the sandalwood the best; it had a mellow, musky undertone that was a little more masculine and less perfumey than the other scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a natural, more pure sandalwood such as you&#x27;d find in the better quality joss sticks, this is definitely impregnated with sandalwood oil, which is not a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(many, many years a friend of their Satya Sai Baba Agarbatti incense); acrid and pungent without a hint of Sandalwood; at least that&#x27;s what my reformed smoker&#x27;s nose is getting.</li>
            <li>but I certainly don&#x27;t...</li>
            <li>But I still love Satya indian incense, nag champa, patchouli forest, super hit, dragons blood, sunrise, celestial, midnite, natural and some other ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to just purchase the 100 gram box of this stuff but based on some reviews I&#x27;ve seen...</li>
            <li>I tried to light it, and actually had to put the stick out and throw it away.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the package it smelled very musty and felt damp as if it had been damaged by water.</li>
            <li>this is one of my faves fast shipping too</li>
            <li>I really like Satya Sai Baba Incense, and the Sandalwood Nag Champa</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing out the whole boxes that I ordered because I am allergic to mold.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>fast shipper.</li>
            <li>I didnt want to give up and ordered a second box a bit better but still smelled like old cardboard was being burned.</li>
            <li>Big fan of the original nag champa.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I purchased a Satya variety pack of incense, mostly due to my love for Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>This smells fantastic and burns for a really long time.</li>
            <li>I went to a local store and bought a 15-gram box (with the blue stripe down the side of the box) &amp; the incense smells great...</li>
            <li>I am hooked on this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>If you like Sai Baba Nag Champa and if you like sandalwood, I highly recommend this incense.</li>
            <li>I sure hope India has taken steps to insure no further over-harvesting of sandalwood trees, and let their crop mature properly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adored the sandalwood incense from that pack (preferred it to Nag Champa!) and wanted a larger box.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to describe the scent, but this is one of my favorite incense scents.</li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t really surprised by this incense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to see if there&#x27;s anyone on here who&#x27;s had the one that came in the assortment, ordered this 100 g box and had it smell the same?....</li>
            <li>The house will keep the soft smell for hours.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised that sandalwood scent was not to my nose in this brand.</li>
            <li>It is rather earthy, and not offensive to my sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;(PS:</li>
            <li>So I recently ordered the 100 gram box of the sandalwood, thinking it would smell the exact same.  </li>
            <li>that is to say, if florals are a high frequency, this one is somewhere in the middle...</li>
            <li>Smell not a good, and much more</li>
            <li>This is a little more lighter than the other incenses I have bought from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and very fragrant but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews stated that they received a poor smelling product, I&#x27;m glad that issue was sorted before I ordered.</li>
            <li>It is very much a champa flower (plumeria) incense, but with a little extra &#x27;wood.  </li>
            <li>the packaging is SLIGHTLY different (2 blue strips down the front left &amp; right sides) but the brand \\&quot;Satya\\&quot; and fragrance \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; are the same (PRINTED ON THE ORANGE BOX)...</li>
            <li>old and unsealed incense will burn like dry wood and you will be disappointed with a great product.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister who loves Sandalwood scents because she cannot tolerate anything strongly scented or that uses false scenting like berry or floral scents.</li>

            <li> Sample pack was better quality that 100 gram pack.</li>
            <li> I love the inundation of incense in SE Asia, which made me feel so relaxed despite the blaring heat, motorbikes and durian smells.  </li>
            <li> It costs more but as they say, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I love the sandalwood incense from Satya.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is okay</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this smell.....</li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champa and am always satisifed when the package arrives.</li>
            <li> A perennial favorite in our house.  </li>
            <li> It goes along perfectly with deep meditations.</li>
            <li> It has become one of my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> will buy again, got to love it.</li>
            <li> I love the original Nag Champa and I love sandalwood</li>
            <li> sandalwood has a great intense smell, this package is great because it comes with a pretty large amount of sticks.  </li>
            <li> Since I was already familiar with the product, I am quite satisfied with my order.  </li>
            <li> I am familiar with this brand and usually love their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this one is very close to the best the ancient incense making traditions of the East offers.</li>
            <li> If the box I received has the correct product in it, then I believe if you are a fan of Dhoop, you will really enjoy this Satya Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I bought the 100gr box and the scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li> You have the cheap Sandalwood;</li>
            <li> makes the whole house smell amazing</li>
            <li> This order smells like a cheap perfume from the dollar store...</li>
            <li> Still enjoy lighting it.</li>
            <li> So, if you like Champa, you&#x27;ll enjoy Sandalwood Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> but I have to light each stick 3-4 times as it keeps going out.  </li>
            <li> you just want the sandalwood scent in the air, most sandalwood incenses or candles will do a good enough job of it.</li>
            <li> Great sandalwood scent and long sticks.</li>
            <li> &quot; Fragrance be WARNED it has changed significantly...</li>
            <li> That sickly sweet, cheap incense smell.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this as a gift - but ended up keeping it for myself.</li>
            <li> They smell great and they burn for a long time.</li>
            <li> The sticks are darker in color, burn differently, and not as pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li> It burns for a good 45 minutes and does not irritate your eyes like many other brands.  </li>
            <li> Still very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing, I love a shop or a home with a bit on incense smell.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed very much!.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then make sure your order is somewhat moist and very flaky.</li>
            <li> It has a very rich and refined sandalwood scent - very sublime.</li>
            <li> Not consistent with what I have experienced with this manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The sellers got the product to me quickly</li>
            <li> Great product obviously made with high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But this sandalwood is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> Such a lovely smell too!</li>
            <li> This particular brand is long lasting, strong, and so beautifully fragranced!</li>
            <li> This sandalwood incense has a very relaxing smooth fragrance that doesn&#x27;t invade your senses.  </li>
            <li> by far my favorite scent ever.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent of Sandalwood, keeps me focused and clear as well as helps me to relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fun time.</li>
            <li> maybe something you&#x27;d have burning right after a shower...</li>
            <li> The small box smelled lovely, fragrant, woodsy and warm.</li>
            <li> It does burn clean and is very fragrant.</li>
            <li> Sandlewood is a very nice, like outdoors fragrance, yet next time I will order the Original Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa fragrance that was sooo relaxing for me for so many years in the past.</li>
            <li> But it really does - for me - have a special place in my&#x27; incense collection.</li>
            <li> However, It has been years since I&#x27;ve found an incense that really evokes the true aroma of Indian sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Makes my home feel peaceful and calm.  </li>
            <li> my favorite incense, real sandalwood scent, this is a good deal for the price and will last you a long time</li>
            <li> but the smell is definitely, a dry warm wood smell....</li>
            <li> It still smells like sandalwood, however nowhere near as strong as when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not stale, because it looks nice and fresh, like the other box.</li>
            <li> This sandalwood smells almost exactly like Laxmi Dhoop Incense.</li>
            <li> Periodically I place an order here on Amazon and the most recent order</li>
            <li> I do burn Japanese sandalwood incense much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It smells like old socks and cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> I liked the sandalwood the best; it had a mellow, musky undertone that was a little more masculine and less perfumey than the other scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a natural, more pure sandalwood such as you&#x27;d find in the better quality joss sticks, this is definitely impregnated with sandalwood oil, which is not a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (many, many years a friend of their Satya Sai Baba Agarbatti incense); acrid and pungent without a hint of Sandalwood; at least that&#x27;s what my reformed smoker&#x27;s nose is getting.</li>
            <li> but I certainly don&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> But I still love Satya indian incense, nag champa, patchouli forest, super hit, dragons blood, sunrise, celestial, midnite, natural and some other ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to just purchase the 100 gram box of this stuff but based on some reviews I&#x27;ve seen...</li>
            <li> I tried to light it, and actually had to put the stick out and throw it away.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package it smelled very musty and felt damp as if it had been damaged by water.</li>
            <li> this is one of my faves fast shipping too</li>
            <li> I really like Satya Sai Baba Incense, and the Sandalwood Nag Champa</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing out the whole boxes that I ordered because I am allergic to mold.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> fast shipper.</li>
            <li> I didnt want to give up and ordered a second box a bit better but still smelled like old cardboard was being burned.</li>
            <li> Big fan of the original nag champa.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I purchased a Satya variety pack of incense, mostly due to my love for Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic and burns for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I went to a local store and bought a 15-gram box (with the blue stripe down the side of the box) &amp; the incense smells great...</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> If you like Sai Baba Nag Champa and if you like sandalwood, I highly recommend this incense.</li>
            <li> I sure hope India has taken steps to insure no further over-harvesting of sandalwood trees, and let their crop mature properly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adored the sandalwood incense from that pack (preferred it to Nag Champa!) and wanted a larger box.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to describe the scent, but this is one of my favorite incense scents.</li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t really surprised by this incense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to see if there&#x27;s anyone on here who&#x27;s had the one that came in the assortment, ordered this 100 g box and had it smell the same?....</li>
            <li> The house will keep the soft smell for hours.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised that sandalwood scent was not to my nose in this brand.</li>
            <li> It is rather earthy, and not offensive to my sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;(PS:</li>
            <li> So I recently ordered the 100 gram box of the sandalwood, thinking it would smell the exact same.  </li>
            <li> that is to say, if florals are a high frequency, this one is somewhere in the middle...</li>
            <li> Smell not a good, and much more</li>
            <li> This is a little more lighter than the other incenses I have bought from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and very fragrant but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews stated that they received a poor smelling product, I&#x27;m glad that issue was sorted before I ordered.</li>
            <li> It is very much a champa flower (plumeria) incense, but with a little extra &#x27;wood.  </li>
            <li> the packaging is SLIGHTLY different (2 blue strips down the front left &amp; right sides) but the brand \\&quot;Satya\\&quot; and fragrance \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; are the same (PRINTED ON THE ORANGE BOX)...</li>
            <li> old and unsealed incense will burn like dry wood and you will be disappointed with a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who loves Sandalwood scents because she cannot tolerate anything strongly scented or that uses false scenting like berry or floral scents.</li>
            <li> Apparently their quality control is slipping, or maybe they just don&#x27;t place a lot of emphasis on consistency at all.</li>
            <li> Every stick of incense in the box had completely disintegrated, leaving a powdery mess everywhere and a bunch of sticks covered in glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go not keep them out of box and open to air, they dry out and wont burn~!</li>
            <li> I had been burning Nag Champa for years before I finally tried some of Satya&#x27;s other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;, and the Sandalwood is now part of my regular incense arsenal.</li>
            <li> The soft mellow frangrance is not the same as I have ordered in the past ...</li>
            <li> What makes this incense stand out is that it&#x27;s smoke will permeate a room, leaving everything with a sandalwood overtone scent long after the incense stick is burned out.</li>
            <li> Even with the stick sitting there, or after putting the stick out, the fragrance will linger for a long time.</li>
            <li> Burns for long time.</li>
            <li> This box smells a little different than last time I ordered from another seller.</li>
            <li> Every stick burns slowly down and completely, I have never had a problem with half burned sticks.  </li>
            <li> I had a japanese sandalwood incense and felt nicer, and less smoky.</li>
            <li> is simply not the same as in the past...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burning sandalwood for 15 years and have never smelled a sandalwood product that remotely resembles Satya Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> There is a wide range of incense products from India and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> Not very Nag Champa at all to my nose</li>
            <li> I should have learned my lesson from the other reviewer, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it was not exactly what i wanted for a scent but will do when i am out of other options.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and have never been disappointed in the quality of it.</li>
            <li> Even some of the other scents by this company are yucky, to me...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues with them staying lit like some other reviewers have.</li>
            <li> In my&#x27; opinion it&#x27; - out of all the other scents that came in the assortment... smelled very pure, very simple and direct....and that was actually a strength and not something that - to me - made it smell dull, boring or overtly predictable...  </li>
            <li> A subtle scent that lingers long after the incense is burned.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to purchase something that will be disappointing...</li>
            <li> This smells bitter, acrid and something like dirty socks, or an unhygienic old lady.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too heavy or overbearing.</li>
            <li> (Some people like the heavy perfume fragrances -</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like old mildewy clothes, and I&#x27;m angry that I stunk up my bedroom burning a stick of this putrid trash.  </li>
            <li> Not sure but seems to have a slightly sweeter smell.</li>
            <li> Got this one twice, first time it was rancid and smelled bad.</li>
            <li> It was not pleasant, extremely pungent.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure, get a small box and give it a try.</li>
            <li> But this is not what I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the one-star negative reviews are all about.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood incense is surprisingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I hate it and am pretty angry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Im not sure of all the poor reviews, but Nag Champa Sandalwood is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> It subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> sorry for the late review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally unusable, messy and disappointing.</li>
            <li> the negative reviews is on a bad batch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> never smelled anything nag champa or sandalwood related that smelled so horrible</li>
            <li> So Sad :~</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a bad product from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> In regards to the Satya-Sandalwood I got from amazon - it was really really bad -</li>
            <li> I have no idea why the box from amazon smelled so bad??</li>
            <li> Must have been a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was a bad batch, but</li>
            <li> thats 100g of bad incense.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this, and I am disappointed and even disgusted.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells terrible.</li>
            <li> but this one gives me a headache NASTY!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Big fan of the original nag champa. I also love the scent of sandalwood, but this product didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Like nag champa, thier sandalwood is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good quality and price. I like th &amp;#34;Nag Champa&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood products are hit or miss. This has a great fragrance. It&#x27;s not overpowering but lingers for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burning sandalwood for 15 years and have never smelled a sandalwood product that remotely resembles Satya Sandalwood. This sandalwood smells almost exactly like Laxmi Dhoop Incense. If the box I received has the correct product in it, then I believe if you are a fan of Dhoop, you will really enjoy this Satya Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I love sandalwood, and it&#x27;s derivates. But I wasn&#x27;t really surprised by this incense. I had a japanese sandalwood incense and felt nicer, and less smoky.</li>
            <li> Great buy, thank you for speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.....</li>
            <li> I love this manufacturer. Sandalwood is second to Nag Champa for me. I would only buy this brand. The sellers got the product to me quickly</li>
            <li> I love the original Nag Champa and I love sandalwood so I took a chance on this incense and I&#x27;m very happy I did. The scent is just right and leaves my living space smelling wonderful. Some reviews stated that they received a poor smelling product, I&#x27;m glad that issue was sorted before I ordered. I already plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m writing to say that I&#x27;ve experienced this incense before and absolutely LOVE it... I prefer it over the blue box nag champa... in fact I prefer it over the others I recieved in the 6 box assortment I got as a christmas gift a couple years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a warm, woodsy, affirming, reassuring aroma... it&#x27;s cozey, it&#x27;s....like a warm hug... the kind of smell you&#x27;d associate with relaxation....laying in bed either to go tosleep, nap, meditate?...maybe something you&#x27;d have burning right after a shower... but the smell is definitely, a dry warm wood smell.... In my&#x27; opinion it&#x27; - out of all the other scents that came in the assortment... smelled very pure, very simple and direct....and that was actually a strength and not something that - to me - made it smell dull, boring or overtly predictable...  It&#x27;s an incense I burn when I don&#x27;t want to be frazzled... has a kind of &amp;#34;middle&amp;#34; smell... that is to say, if florals are a high frequency, this one is somewhere in the middle...although to me it doesn&#x27;t smell floral...  more specifically:  I don&#x27;t smell anything that says &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a flower&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;I have flowers in me&amp;#34;... sure maybe to a more discerning nose, one might smell that but I certainly don&#x27;t...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... the reason I&#x27;m posting here is because....I&#x27;d really like to just purchase the 100 gram box of this stuff but based on some reviews I&#x27;ve seen... I&#x27;d really like to see if there&#x27;s anyone on here who&#x27;s had the one that came in the assortment, ordered this 100 g box and had it smell the same?....anyone?...  I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to purchase something that will be disappointing... sure you can always get a refund/return but i&#x27;d rather not the hassle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, this to me is the sandalwood by which I compare others... I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the best out there because honestly who knows?  But it really does - for me - have a special place in my&#x27; incense collection.</li>
            <li> Every stick burns slowly down and completely, I have never had a problem with half burned sticks.  Love this stuff, smells FAN-TASTIC!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance leaves rooms smelling grear</li>
            <li> Sandlewood is a very nice, like outdoors fragrance, yet next time I will order the Original Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa fragrance that was sooo relaxing for me for so many years in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the one-star negative reviews are all about. I bought the 100gr box and the scent is fabulous. Actually, in my experience it&#x27;s only second to the Nag Champa blue box. If there have been quality-control issues, as some reviews have suggested, then perhaps they have been resolved. I&#x27;ve never had a bad product from this manufacturer. If you&#x27;re not sure, get a small box and give it a try. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s expensive. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I purchased a Satya variety pack of incense, mostly due to my love for Nag Champa. I absolutely adored the sandalwood incense from that pack (preferred it to Nag Champa!) and wanted a larger box. I purchased this, and I am disappointed and even disgusted. I know it&#x27;s not stale, because it looks nice and fresh, like the other box. The small box smelled lovely, fragrant, woodsy and warm. This smells bitter, acrid and something like dirty socks, or an unhygienic old lady. I tried to light it, and actually had to put the stick out and throw it away. I hate it and am pretty angry I wasted my money. I should have learned my lesson from the other reviewer, but I didn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you KNOW what you&#x27;re getting!</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic and burns for a really long time. One of my favorite fragrances for sure this is a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood, of course, smells wonderful.  You have the cheap Sandalwood; the so-so and the great that stays with you.  This one is great.  The house will keep the soft smell for hours.  I love it and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Great sandalwood scent and long sticks.When you burn one of these sticks your room or home will smell great.Sandalwood is the best in my book and for my money Genuine Indian incense is top notch!!</li>
            <li> There is a wide range of incense products from India and elsewhere.  Ingredients are certainly of greatest importance, but also the knowledge that has gone into the product.  I have no doubt this one is very close to the best the ancient incense making traditions of the East offers.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells terrible. never smelled anything nag champa or sandalwood related that smelled so horrible</li>
            <li> What else is there to say?  It is great.  From a brand with issues this product does NOT have any.</li>
            <li> by far my favorite scent ever. makes the whole house smell amazing and it&#x27;s not too heavy or overbearing. LOVE</li>
            <li> 01 13 2012  I went to a local store and bought a 15-gram box (with the blue stripe down the side of the box) &amp; the incense smells great... In regards to the Satya-Sandalwood I got from amazon - it was really really bad - I had to throw it out because it smelled rancid... I have no idea why the box from amazon smelled so bad?? I bought a 100-gram box from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 28 2011 If you love the \\&quot;Satya Sandalwood\\&quot; Fragrance be WARNED it has changed significantly... The soft mellow frangrance is not the same as I have ordered in the past ... Periodically I place an order here on Amazon and the most recent order is simply not the same as in the past... the packaging is SLIGHTLY different (2 blue strips down the front left &amp; right sides) but the brand \\&quot;Satya\\&quot; and fragrance \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; are the same (PRINTED ON THE ORANGE BOX)... This order smells like a cheap perfume from the dollar store... I love burning incense but this one gives me a headache NASTY! (Some people like the heavy perfume fragrances - So this one may be for you)  I am very disappointed! So Sad :~( PLEASE NOTE... The order was received in a timely manor</li>
            <li> this is great incense. this is the best brand and this smells delicious. reminds me of my uncle&#x27;s house. tasty</li>
            <li> In my experience, when it comes to adding scents to to a room, the lightest touch is a candle. Joss sticks are a step up in intensity and permeation, then regular incense sticks or cones. This Satya Sandalwood is one degree of heaviness beyond that. What makes this stand out is that the scent is so intense and heavy. It&#x27;s not like a natural, more pure sandalwood such as you&#x27;d find in the better quality joss sticks, this is definitely impregnated with sandalwood oil, which is not a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want the sandalwood scent in the air, most sandalwood incenses or candles will do a good enough job of it. What makes this incense stand out is that it&#x27;s smoke will permeate a room, leaving everything with a sandalwood overtone scent long after the incense stick is burned out. I prefer that sometimes because it&#x27;s the scent that I love, not smoke in the air.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.  Not consistent with what I have experienced with this manufacturer.  Must have been a bad batch.  It was not pleasant, extremely pungent.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package it smelled very musty and felt damp as if it had been damaged by water.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Great for grounding energy. Arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> Best smelling incense fragrance in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it was not exactly what i wanted for a scent but will do when i am out of other options.</li>
            <li> only 1 star below Nag Champa incense all by itself.  Still very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing, I love a shop or a home with a bit on incense smell.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed very much!.&lt;br /&gt;So sorry for the late review.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to need more soon!</li>
            <li> This is a little more lighter than the other incenses I have bought from Amazon.  A nice woody smell and nice after-smell after the stick is burned.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is another real Nag product, however when this was received there was an opening somewhere in the sealed wrapper that had my front door area smelling wonderful. After I removed the cellophane seal, this fragrance lost its power after 10 days. The sealed wrapper does make an enormous difference. It still smells like sandalwood, however nowhere near as strong as when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> I have been using this incense for about a year. Love the fragrance. This box smells a little different than last time I ordered from another seller. Not sure but seems to have a slightly sweeter smell. Still enjoy lighting it.</li>
            <li> Since I was already familiar with the product, I am quite satisfied with my order.  However, It has been years since I&#x27;ve found an incense that really evokes the true aroma of Indian sandalwood.  I sure hope India has taken steps to insure no further over-harvesting of sandalwood trees, and let their crop mature properly.</li>
            <li> This sandalwood incense has a very relaxing smooth fragrance that doesn&#x27;t invade your senses.  It just pleases them.  I love it and will continue to purchase it as needed depending on price.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand a nd aroma in one box. Great price and wonderful authentic quality. I burn it just because I like the smell and it lingers.</li>
            <li> Sample pack was better quality that 100 gram pack. Smell not a good, and much more dusty.&lt;br /&gt;will find a different supplier that doesn&#x27;t substitute for next order</li>
            <li> sandalwood has a great intense smell, this package is great because it comes with a pretty large amount of sticks.  it&#x27;s hard to describe the scent, but this is one of my favorite incense scents.</li>
            <li> this is one of my faves fast shipping too</li>
            <li> I am familiar with this brand and usually love their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 100gm box of Sandalwood incense and the product I got was unacceptable-- the powdered incense had fallen off all of the sticks. Every stick of incense in the box had completely disintegrated, leaving a powdery mess everywhere and a bunch of sticks covered in glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally unusable, messy and disappointing.</li>
            <li> Got this one twice, first time it was rancid and smelled bad. I didnt want to give up and ordered a second box a bit better but still smelled like old cardboard was being burned. I am surprised that sandalwood scent was not to my nose in this brand. I do burn Japanese sandalwood incense much better in my opinion. But I still love Satya indian incense, nag champa, patchouli forest, super hit, dragons blood, sunrise, celestial, midnite, natural and some other ones.</li>
            <li> I love the inundation of incense in SE Asia, which made me feel so relaxed despite the blaring heat, motorbikes and durian smells.  This stuff makes me nostalgic for my times backpacking through SE Asia..  love it.</li>
            <li> NEW FAVORITE FLAVOR!!!!</li>
            <li> Sandalwood incense is surprisingly hard to find.  Makes my home feel peaceful and calm.  Well worth the price.  I am hooked on this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> my favorite incense, real sandalwood scent, this is a good deal for the price and will last you a long time</li>
            <li> I really like Satya Sai Baba Incense, and the Sandalwood Nag Champa is one of my favorites.  I had been burning Nag Champa for years before I finally tried some of Satya&#x27;s other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;, and the Sandalwood is now part of my regular incense arsenal. It is very much a champa flower (plumeria) incense, but with a little extra &#x27;wood.  So, if you like Champa, you&#x27;ll enjoy Sandalwood Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this ancient fragrance! This particular brand is long lasting, strong, and so beautifully fragranced! Even with the stick sitting there, or after putting the stick out, the fragrance will linger for a long time. Such a lovely smell too! Very genuine!</li>
            <li> This brand is probably the best that I have used of any.  It costs more but as they say, you get what you pay for.  I do recommend it.  It is a bit strong but it makes the house smell nicely.</li>
            <li> This does not smell the same as the Sandalwood incense I&#x27;ve purchased from this brand before--it&#x27;s putrid. It smells like old socks and cheap cologne. I looked elsewhere on amazon and found a two-15g box pack of Sandalwood, and that smelled like it should. But this is not what I&#x27;ve had in the past. It&#x27;s gross and gave me a headache. I got a refund.</li>
            <li> About six months ago I ordered the assortment pack of Satya Saibaba incense. The scents included nag champa, patchouli, sunrise, midnight, celestial, and sandalwood.  I liked the sandalwood the best; it had a mellow, musky undertone that was a little more masculine and less perfumey than the other scents. So I recently ordered the 100 gram box of the sandalwood, thinking it would smell the exact same.  It doesn&#x27;t, at all.  This stuff smells like old mildewy clothes, and I&#x27;m angry that I stunk up my bedroom burning a stick of this putrid trash.  This is going back to amazon immediately, and I will never buy any Satya incense again.  Apparently their quality control is slipping, or maybe they just don&#x27;t place a lot of emphasis on consistency at all. Horrible!</li>
            <li> We order this incense again and again. Love it...</li>
            <li> I love the sandalwood incense from Satya. I tried different ones, but this one is unbeatable! Very fast delivery - I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of Sandalwood, keeps me focused and clear as well as helps me to relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order of Sandalwood incense ended up having a moldy smell &amp; to my gut instinct it was covered in mold. I ended up throwing out the whole boxes that I ordered because I am allergic to mold.</li>
            <li> This box is different from another I received from the same company. The sticks are darker in color, burn differently, and not as pleasant to smell. Not bad, but not as good as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is okay but I have to light each stick 3-4 times as it keeps going out.  I have never had this problem with incense before, even this brand, perhaps it could be this scent.</li>
            <li> Great product obviously made with high quality ingredients.  Long lasting and very fragrant but not overpowering.  I would buy this product again. Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. If you enjoy Nag champa, the sandalwood will be an excellent addition to put into rotation.</li>
            <li> ORDER ARRIVE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this smell.....</li>
            <li> Im not sure of all the poor reviews, but Nag Champa Sandalwood is one of my favorites. It subtle and not overpowering.  It burns for a good 45 minutes and does not irritate your eyes like many other brands.  If you like Regular Nag Champa then you must try this.&lt;br /&gt;If the negative reviews is on a bad batch then make sure your order is somewhat moist and very flaky. old and unsealed incense will burn like dry wood and you will be disappointed with a great product.</li>
            <li> Great Service, arrived at time, just what I put in my order, good packing, and good price, thanks for this.</li>
            <li> I always order this scent for myself.  I love the Nag Champa and am always satisifed when the package arrives.</li>
            <li> I use incense during meditation, to get rid of cooking and pet odors and outside to repel Mosquitos. I have been using this product for many years and have never been disappointed in the quality of it.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean. That sickly sweet, cheap incense smell. Even some of the other scents by this company are yucky, to me...But this sandalwood is my new favorite.  It is rather earthy, and not offensive to my sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;(PS: Stay OUT of Patchouley Forest!)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this as a gift - but ended up keeping it for myself. It does burn clean and is very fragrant.</li>
            <li> These garbage incense sticks stay lit for about 1 minute, then go out. What a disappointment. Maybe it was a bad batch, but thats 100g of bad incense.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who loves Sandalwood scents because she cannot tolerate anything strongly scented or that uses false scenting like berry or floral scents. She gets headaches extremely easy from scented candles and soaps, and is able to use this with no problems so definitely a good buy for the cautious incense user.</li>
            <li> These smell devine and burn great. Go not keep them out of box and open to air, they dry out and wont burn~! A lesson i learned!</li>
            <li> A perennial favorite in our house.  A subtle scent that lingers long after the incense is burned.  Very pleasant and recommended.</li>
            <li> Will reorder when i need them</li>
            <li> The truest sandalwood smell I&#x27;ve found!!! Burns for long time.</li>
            <li> Satya makes the best Sandalwood incense, I always purchase it from them.</li>
            <li> Not very Nag Champa at all to my nose (many, many years a friend of their Satya Sai Baba Agarbatti incense); acrid and pungent without a hint of Sandalwood; at least that&#x27;s what my reformed smoker&#x27;s nose is getting.</li>
            <li> Very Delicious High Quality Fragrance..Permeates My Entire Apartment...Visitors Always Comment and Ask Me What Is That Delicious  Scent...Very Wonderful Sensation For My Soul.</li>
            <li> These are the best sandalwood incense sticks I have found.  They smell great and they burn for a long time.</li>
            <li> great smell, burns wonderfully.</li>
            <li> These smell great and add a nice scent to a room. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with them staying lit like some other reviewers have.</li>
            <li> If you like Sai Baba Nag Champa and if you like sandalwood, I highly recommend this incense. It has a very rich and refined sandalwood scent - very sublime. It goes along perfectly with deep meditations. It has become one of my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> fast shipper. good product, easy to use. nice. a good buy. fun time. will buy again, got to love it.</li>
