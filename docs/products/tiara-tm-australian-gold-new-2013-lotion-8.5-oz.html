            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>Even though my experience here wasn’t the greatest, I have to say that this lotion is awesome.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, no any sunburn</li>
            <li>This lotion is probably one of the best smelling lotions I’ve ever used; Great after tan smell, just like the After All Body Butter.</li>
            <li>hoping.:)it was gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Also great price compared to salon pricing.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend says it smells awesome too, which is always a plus :)</li>
            <li>Great Value and Good Lotion</li>
            <li>Smells great and works amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is supposed to be the best tanning lotion available at my salon</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>SMELLS GOOD, VERY SMOOTH ON SKIN AFTER TANNING.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice pre-tanning lotion that helps you get a darker tan and keep it.</li>
            <li>so it &amp;#34;intensifies&amp;#34; your own skin color (if you are prone to tan, as opposed to burn).</li>
            <li>The lotion smells great and keeps my skin super moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love every thing about it</li>
            <li>ive just ordered mine.im hoping to get the same beautiful color.heres</li>
            <li>Has natural bronzer and smells good too.</li>
            <li>and I will be back for more!!</li>
            <li>so the advantage I had was I was familiar with it before I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is much more reasonable to buy it here!</li>
            <li>, ur tan stay longer and look more natural and healthy</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and in original packaging.  </li>
            <li>so I paid full retail.</li>
            <li>Good lotion and cheap, the lady in tanning center tried to sold me this lotion for 107 $ hahahahahahhaha&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Super quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light on the skin and leaves you feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just what my wife wanted and price was right.  </li>
            <li>I really like Tiara!</li>
            <li>item.she told me she ordered it from here more than once at a third the salon price.so</li>
            <li>just glad I bought it off AMAZON and did not pay the $120 that the local tanning salon wanted.</li>
            <li>got a very nice cocoa looking tan,not gold or orange,but deep dark tropical looking tan from this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the real deal</li>
            <li>but it is very expensive-close to $100.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TAN FAST.</li>
            <li>I only tan about 3 times a week and my tan stays true.</li>
            <li>The benefit of ordering vs. purchasing it directly from the Salon was the cost.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I NOTICED TAN DIRECTLY</li>
            <li>Received the product much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Get dark fast using it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If this was a new product I would have expected a closed seal.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other product after using this.</li>
            <li> Agreeing with other review.</li>
            <li> Seal was broken on arrival but pump was new.</li>
            <li> NOt worth all the hype,</li>
            <li> Looks to be just like what she could have gotten at the tanning salon (for less money).</li>
            <li> It did not get me as dark as other lotions I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> smells the same, apprehensive about using this product, wondering why all the seals are broken on everyone&#x27;s bottle?</li>
            <li> I tried to order the same lotion from Amazon but the bottle was broken</li>
            <li> so I do not like to use heavy bronzers.</li>
            <li> Saw the other reviewers&#x27; comments about getting their lotion bottles and them already being opened so I was wary about this purchase</li>
            <li> Horrible...seal broken lotion everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;Pathetic</li>
            <li> The seals on both bottles were broken.</li>
            <li> I thought it was suspicious that the seal on the lotion was broken.  </li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> The seals were broken and when I looked closely this product was labeled as expired!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the lotion.</li>

            <li> Good lotion and cheap, the lady in tanning center tried to sold me this lotion for 107 $ hahahahahahhaha&lt;br /&gt;I bought here for only 20-something ! Very good quality, no any sunburn, ur tan stay longer and look more natural and healthy</li>
            <li> I really like Tiara! It is a nice pre-tanning lotion that helps you get a darker tan and keep it. I like the feel and the smell of it. I have bought this product at my local tanning salon so the advantage I had was I was familiar with it before I ordered it from Amazon. The benefit of ordering vs. purchasing it directly from the Salon was the cost. It is much more reasonable to buy it here! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> Horrible...seal broken lotion everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;Pathetic</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the real deal or if it&#x27;s fake. The seals were broken and when I looked closely this product was labeled as expired!</li>
            <li> Received the product much sooner than expected. The seal was not broken(this was mentioned in another post). The lotion smells great and keeps my skin super moist and smooth. My boyfriend says it smells awesome too, which is always a plus :)</li>
            <li> Love it.  Use at tanning bed and beach. Even have my sister using it.  Not heavy or greasy feeling. Also great price compared to salon pricing.</li>
            <li> The seals on both bottles were broken. Returning for a refund. Do not buy this mystery goop from FUSION Hardware.</li>
            <li> Seal was broken on arrival but pump was new. smells the same, apprehensive about using this product, wondering why all the seals are broken on everyone&#x27;s bottle?</li>
            <li> Saw the other reviewers&#x27; comments about getting their lotion bottles and them already being opened so I was wary about this purchase but I got mine on time and unopened. Nothing wrong with the lotion. I know where I&#x27;ll be buying my tanning lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> I thought it was suspicious that the seal on the lotion was broken.  If this was a new product I would have expected a closed seal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is supposed to be the best tanning lotion available at my salon but it is very expensive-close to $100.  On Amazon, it&#x27;s priced to move.  Great Value and Good Lotion</li>
            <li> i was charged and found out that this product is fake!  Want my money back and will take back my rating!</li>
            <li> This product is everything they said it would do. Has natural bronzer and smells good too. Get dark fast using it. I only tan about 3 times a week and my tan stays true.</li>
            <li> i found out about this from my friend.she got a very nice cocoa looking tan,not gold or orange,but deep dark tropical looking tan from this item.she told me she ordered it from here more than once at a third the salon price.so ive just ordered mine.im hoping to get the same beautiful color.heres hoping.:)it was gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted and price was right.  Delivered quickly and in original packaging.  Looks to be just like what she could have gotten at the tanning salon (for less money).</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion from my local tanning salon so I paid full retail. I tried to order the same lotion from Amazon but the bottle was broken and I had to return. Even though my experience here wasn’t the greatest, I have to say that this lotion is awesome. This lotion is probably one of the best smelling lotions I’ve ever used; Great after tan smell, just like the After All Body Butter. I have olive skin so I do not like to use heavy bronzers. Tiara is an intensifier so it &amp;#34;intensifies&amp;#34; your own skin color (if you are prone to tan, as opposed to burn). It is extremely light on the skin and leaves you feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this! It smells amazing.  Came with seals intact. Was the same product as at the tanning salon I go to. Super quick shipping.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD, VERY SMOOTH ON SKIN AFTER TANNING. I NOTICED TAN DIRECTLY AFTER  I HAD TANNED. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TAN FAST.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great and works amazing. Won&#x27;t use any other product after using this. Love every thing about it</li>
            <li> It did not get me as dark as other lotions I have used in the past. NOt worth all the hype, just glad I bought it off AMAZON and did not pay the $120 that the local tanning salon wanted.</li>
            <li> Agreeing with other review. Mine came with the seal cracked and re-taped also. Makes me wonder if I&#x27;m using what it says I am. And the pump doesn&#x27;t work well either. Disappointed.</li>
