    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great scent for all genders!</li>
            <li>I give it 6 hours at best.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is awesome!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, tom&#x27;s is an awesome brand you should support!  </li>
            <li>I do think their roll on, unscented, works the best of all their styles of deodorant though.  </li>
            <li>This one works the best for me.</li>
            <li>and I was good to go all day!  </li>
            <li>Good price, great delivery, perfect.</li>
            <li>It goes on great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deodorant.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and liked that it came in a pack of 3.</li>
            <li>Not as great at stopping perspiration, but the alternatives with all those chemicals is not an option.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I must say, this deodorant is great.</li>
            <li>Smells good - and does a great job - for about 7-8 hours.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, and</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>The smell of Tom’s Mountain Spring is very pleasant and the ingredient list appears safe.</li>
            <li>If I shower and don&#x27;t use the product, I stay relatively good smelling unless I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I feel good about using something without aluminum in the ingredients and have never had a &amp;#34;fail&amp;#34; with it.  </li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>The scent is good for both men and women.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t seam to find a good non-antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li>It has good odor control, but not for the heaviest duty sweating and exertion.</li>
            <li>Very Pleased.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using tom&#x27;s for years, and while i&#x27;ve been very satisfied with their products, i was thrilled to have options tailored specifically to men.  </li>
            <li>An effective deodorant.</li>
            <li>I decided to give Tom&#x27;s a try and liked what I had gotten myself into.</li>
            <li>Day one, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it goes on</li>
            <li>It is kind of melon</li>
            <li>I’m going to be brutally honest; I didn’t trust this product at all.  </li>
            <li>this stuff has been nice on my skin but does not cover odor AT ALL.</li>
            <li>I thought Tom&#x27;s Maine would be a good fit for a guy like him,</li>
            <li>, the Adidas cottontech is the most effective...</li>
            <li>Great scent, the lady loves it ;)</li>
            <li>wore it today at work since it was wear your favorite sports shirt day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman and LOVE this deodorant.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m in love with a mens deodorant.</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s unisex. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been fairly pleased with it, except for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the naturalness of this.</li>
            <li>I buy it on the Subscribe and Save program and save even more money.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I find that this larger size is perfect size for adults, too.</li>
            <li>People around you aren&#x27;t going to pass out from any overwhelming fragrance (which is a problem with some men&#x27;s deodorants.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s works for many men -</li>
            <li>However, all I really need it to work for is a day at the office and for that it’s great.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get 24-hour protection from this, but it lasts through most if not all my work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s say&#x27;s mountain spring scent, but I would say it&#x27;s more like a lemon scent.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work pretty well, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was fairly comparable to the first two.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of products that lean more toward the natural/organic end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find that Tom&#x27;s makes an aluminum free, strong deodorant for men and my husband has been liking it.  </li>
            <li>especially since it&#x27;s a deodorant and not an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is that the scent is nice - neutral, low-key and pleasant.</li>
            <li>so it was an easy decision.  </li>
            <li>But my husband has always used whatever strong brand he finds.  </li>
            <li>: you need to apply more frequently, but it does a darn good job.  </li>
            <li>So, at the end of the day, I strongly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I chose Toms lady kind first.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine for me.</li>
            <li>It was easy and smooth to put on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So - four stars for smelling great, and doing the job initially - but 0 stars for &amp;#34;Long Lasting&amp;#34; power.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s aluminum free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine happily for several years now.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to go aluminum free, this is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I like how this product uses natural ingredients and smells good, and I applaud the effort.</li>
            <li>why not spend your money on a business that&#x27;s trying to do some good in the world (natural ingredients, commitment to volunteering, donate to environmental nonprofits), and NOT just about making money?</li>
            <li>It goes on quick and easy, and you&#x27;re on your way.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good deodorant and does a pretty good job of lasting all day.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find his product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that Tom&#x27;s has not started using essence of feline in their products, which leads me to believe something else is causing the irritation.</li>
            <li>Sounds like the original owners sold out and the new owners care more about profit than good natural products.</li>
            <li>results have been pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>Only problem is it works just about as good as not wearing deodorant at all.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and works very well.</li>
            <li>Pros: Smells Nice, Natural&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not an effective deodorant, Absolutely does not last 24 Hrs</li>
            <li>Not bad...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always interested in trying things that are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or more natural than most.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorants and have used them myself for years (love the apricot scent, especially).  </li>
            <li>In my experience, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants are useful in situations where not much is asked of them, not so great for heavy-duty demands, and this one is that way.</li>
            <li>The big thing for us is that we are trying to lessen our &amp;#34;toxic load&amp;#34; by eating better (mostly organic), getting exercise and getting the chemicals out of our house.</li>
            <li>This is probably a decent product compared to most in terms of toxicity.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and it works all day long.</li>
            <li>Not only is the smell much more feminine, smelled like berries to me, it didn&#x27;t burn me!</li>
            <li>Thought I should try a more natural product (as suggested by my wife) and gave this product a try.</li>
            <li>Liked the ingredients and smell, but the product did not last all day.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s, it has been fun</li>
            <li>My husband was distinctly unimpressed.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and the effectiveness of this natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>My husband has primarily used Speed Stick deodorant for many years, and was interested in seeing if this deodorant would give equal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your pits have to detoxify all the aluminum and toxins plugging up your pores from commercial antiperspirants (which make you stinkier by the way) and than can take a couple weeks so this deodorant might now seem effective at first</li>
            <li>The smell is great and, while it only lasts a few hours, it effectively keeps the funk away for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I generally have zero reactions to products, and I don&#x27;t have many allergies aside from cats.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first 3 days then after that my armpits have been bright red and just plain old hurt all over where I apply it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find in Whole Foods near me any more.</li>
            <li>I didn’t even put it on after a fresh shower, most nights showering before bed and just getting up and going the next morning.  </li>
            <li>It does have an underarm &amp;#34;shelf life&amp;#34; for me, I work indoors in an air conditioned office, but, after eiht ot ten hours it looses effectiveness, which is OK with me.  </li>
            <li>but if that&#x27;s what it takes to ditch the chemicals in most commercial antiperspirants then so be it.  </li>
            <li>is my 2nd stick after trying my first about a year ago or more I think.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, I didn&#x27;t have a reaction, but after further review I have noticed that my armpits are irritated and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts longer and smells better than standard Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li>But when the aluminum is the thing you&#x27;re trying to avoid, this one does pretty well.</li>
            <li>But the Mountain Spring scent is pretty benign.  </li>
            <li>(my LORD was it hot).  </li>
            <li>I even tried reapplying it every so often for the first two weeks</li>
            <li>The scent was ok, I&#x27;m going to check out the others next time.</li>
            <li>Smell is great (very mild, barely detectable) and product really works well, even for an active 10 year old boy!</li>
            <li>odor protection seemed adequate, but I usually do not generate a lot of stink.</li>
            <li>consider myself a male who sweats fairly easily, so if that sounds like you, save yourself some time and try something else.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and it can be pretty hot</li>
            <li>They had a mild but pleasing scent that would give protection through the work day, which was all I figured I could reasonably hope for from a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as putting toxic chemicals into my body.</li>
            <li>really like it.  </li>
            <li>what I really like about it is that it&#x27;s paraben-free and aluminum-free.</li>
            <li>it was a weekend, and I didn&#x27;t go out much.</li>
            <li>It will work for 24 hours if I don&#x27;t engage in much high-exertion or high-stress</li>
            <li>I tried this for three days straight.</li>
            <li>It really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>it just didn&#x27;t do much for mine.</li>
            <li>activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients (listed in the Amazon product description) seem natural and safe enough, though they aren&#x27;t hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>First my husband&#x27;s review...he loves the scent, &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; as he said,  It kept him dry and odor free all afternoon after his workout.</li>
            <li>I normally use Irish Spring but it can be a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>I think the additional layers helped as my armpits didn&#x27;t start feeling gross as quick as the first time.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to go towards a more natural deodorant after using Old Spice High Endurance for my whole adulthood (30 yrs old).</li>
            <li>As an example: the other day, I showered, applied the product, went to dinner, came home about three hours later (without sweating), thought this would be a good time for some intimacy, checked my pits and about made myself pass out.</li>
            <li>I normally wear antiperspirant and will probably switch back to it when the weather warms up, but this is fine for cooler months and seems to prevent the rancid sweat smell.</li>
            <li>I made sure my house was hot and uncomfortable just to make sure it could handle the pressure</li>
            <li>this product worked fine for a month of heavy application, then i quickly started developing intensely itchy armpits.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but it just doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>You get a whiff of fresh smell as it&#x27;s going on, then it settles down to unnoticeable, unless you get really close, then fresh again!</li>
            <li>Deodorants without aluminum are far less effective than deodorants with aluminum.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>but, I also live in \\&quot;the real world\\&quot; where being \\&quot;smelly\\&quot; is never (ever) acceptable in the workplace.</li>
            <li>it kept me dry and odor free too.  </li>
            <li>Main Woodspice is the winner in my book.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that it left no marks or residue on my clothing, applied effortlessly, and had a really fresh scent.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: this is not 100% natural - only the fragrance is.  </li>
            <li>Better scent and lasts longer than other natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>this tends to apply at since it is so soft makes you sweat 10x more than using any other deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It took a little while for my body to adjust to the switch, but I&#x27;m glad I switched over to this product.</li>
            <li>but it still just doesn&#x27;t work anywhere close the the normal stuff.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just trying to avoid putting the normal stuff on everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next day, I gave it another go, but this time, I applied maybe twice as much as the first time around.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s funny is that the Tom&#x27;s &amp;#34;Wild Lavender&amp;#34; in the white container works really well for me.</li>
            <li>and my underarms returned to normal.</li>
            <li>I was floored at how fresh the scent was and how lasting it was, despite the copious amounts of sweating I was doing</li>
            <li>Their scents are pleasant enough before I apply them, but they smell like some foul mix of old, wet rag and boys&#x27; high school locker room the second I apply them.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the ingredients are a bit different, so I think it all depends on finding the right ingredients that work for your body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Hopefully will live up to &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; claims.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s new to me is trying the Mountain Spring variety.</li>
            <li>Slightly burns underarms and causes a mild red rash... and doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only purchase if you enjoy smelling like a middle school locker room.</li>
            <li>Texture of the product is smooth and compares to conventional brands.  </li>
            <li>EWG&#x27;s Database Skin Deep, which rates how toxic personal care products are, gives this deodorant a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; on a scale of 0-10 with ten being the most toxic.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant even worked outside on a hot and humid day here in SW Florida.</li>
            <li>Applied it first in the evening and awoke the following day to burning armpits.</li>
            <li>I am going to try a new all natural brand.</li>
            <li>Like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something natural.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use something all natural and get away from antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>nothing like old spice or degree.</li>
            <li>This the only natural deodorant that has worked for me and my sensitive armpits and I have tried quite a few reputable brands that had something my skin didn&#x27;t agree with from tea tree oil to alcohol to baking soda.  </li>
            <li>Also remember to give your body time to adjust to a natural deoderant.  </li>
            <li>So far I had been the Tom&#x27;s of Maine user in the family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before using Tom&#x27;s, I was using Old Spice deodorant and antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised that it works for some of the reviewers before me.</li>
            <li>and I developed a rash under my arms.</li>
            <li>When I would put this on I would be smelly an hour later no matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on scents and fragrances, but I really like this.</li>
            <li>And Tom&#x27;s is as natural as you can get with this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t natural anymore.</li>
            <li>Understanding that everyone&#x27;s body is different and folks have different jobs which cause them to sweat more or less (I mainly sit at a desk)</li>
            <li>I am a naturally decent smelling guy and typically only use deodorant a couple times a week, like before going out on the town.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using the last couple ones that we bulk ordered and have had to find a new, natural deodorant option.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting it is, great for standard day wear with moderate activity, but just an extra application before heavy workout or strenuous sweaty activity.  </li>
            <li>and I applied the same amount as the 2nd day, maybe a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man who sweats easily and has moderate to heavy BO.</li>
            <li>This is the only Toms of Maine deo which doesn&#x27;t have Propolene Glycol (a stain on an otherwise very natural ingredient list).  </li>
            <li>Would like to send back, but will likely use it until gone (which should be fast since I have to reapply often when I use it) and then go back to Arm and Hammer or Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d classify myself as a fairly average user — not a heavy perspirer but in need of some odor protection as the day goes on — and the TOM products used to work reasonably well for me.  </li>
            <li>tbs arrowroot powder, 6 tbs GMO free corn starch, 4 tbs baking soda and lavender and/or tea tree essential oils - usually around 8-10 drops.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Even when I don&#x27;t have apparent sweat, my armpits start to smell a couple of hours after putting this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While i won&#x27;t say there&#x27;s as effective as weird chemical formulations,</li>
            <li>I liked the scent and when i was overheated, you can smell the scent faintly.  </li>
            <li>I threw out the entire stick, which I only used for 3 days, and bought an Old Spice deodorant with no antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Long lasting.... far from it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>My armpits do not smell during the day, and even after being at the gym for almost 2 hours, they probably only smell a little bit, but I really have to stick my nose to my armpits to smell.</li>

            <li> Not as great at stopping perspiration, but the alternatives with all those chemicals is not an option.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I must say, this deodorant is great.</li>
            <li> Smells good - and does a great job - for about 7-8 hours.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, and</li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> The smell of Tom’s Mountain Spring is very pleasant and the ingredient list appears safe.</li>
            <li> If I shower and don&#x27;t use the product, I stay relatively good smelling unless I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I feel good about using something without aluminum in the ingredients and have never had a &amp;#34;fail&amp;#34; with it.  </li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> The scent is good for both men and women.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t seam to find a good non-antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li> It has good odor control, but not for the heaviest duty sweating and exertion.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using tom&#x27;s for years, and while i&#x27;ve been very satisfied with their products, i was thrilled to have options tailored specifically to men.  </li>
            <li> An effective deodorant.</li>
            <li> I decided to give Tom&#x27;s a try and liked what I had gotten myself into.</li>
            <li> Day one, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it goes on</li>
            <li> It is kind of melon</li>
            <li> I’m going to be brutally honest; I didn’t trust this product at all.  </li>
            <li> this stuff has been nice on my skin but does not cover odor AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I thought Tom&#x27;s Maine would be a good fit for a guy like him,</li>
            <li> , the Adidas cottontech is the most effective...</li>
            <li> Great scent, the lady loves it ;)</li>
            <li> wore it today at work since it was wear your favorite sports shirt day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and LOVE this deodorant.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m in love with a mens deodorant.</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s unisex. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fairly pleased with it, except for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the naturalness of this.</li>
            <li> I buy it on the Subscribe and Save program and save even more money.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I find that this larger size is perfect size for adults, too.</li>
            <li> People around you aren&#x27;t going to pass out from any overwhelming fragrance (which is a problem with some men&#x27;s deodorants.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s works for many men -</li>
            <li> However, all I really need it to work for is a day at the office and for that it’s great.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get 24-hour protection from this, but it lasts through most if not all my work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s say&#x27;s mountain spring scent, but I would say it&#x27;s more like a lemon scent.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work pretty well, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was fairly comparable to the first two.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of products that lean more toward the natural/organic end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find that Tom&#x27;s makes an aluminum free, strong deodorant for men and my husband has been liking it.  </li>
            <li> especially since it&#x27;s a deodorant and not an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is that the scent is nice - neutral, low-key and pleasant.</li>
            <li> so it was an easy decision.  </li>
            <li> But my husband has always used whatever strong brand he finds.  </li>
            <li> : you need to apply more frequently, but it does a darn good job.  </li>
            <li> So, at the end of the day, I strongly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I chose Toms lady kind first.</li>
            <li> and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine for me.</li>
            <li> It was easy and smooth to put on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So - four stars for smelling great, and doing the job initially - but 0 stars for &amp;#34;Long Lasting&amp;#34; power.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s aluminum free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine happily for several years now.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to go aluminum free, this is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I like how this product uses natural ingredients and smells good, and I applaud the effort.</li>
            <li> why not spend your money on a business that&#x27;s trying to do some good in the world (natural ingredients, commitment to volunteering, donate to environmental nonprofits), and NOT just about making money?</li>
            <li> It goes on quick and easy, and you&#x27;re on your way.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deodorant and does a pretty good job of lasting all day.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to find his product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that Tom&#x27;s has not started using essence of feline in their products, which leads me to believe something else is causing the irritation.</li>
            <li> Sounds like the original owners sold out and the new owners care more about profit than good natural products.</li>
            <li> results have been pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> Only problem is it works just about as good as not wearing deodorant at all.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent and works very well.</li>
            <li> Pros: Smells Nice, Natural&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not an effective deodorant, Absolutely does not last 24 Hrs</li>
            <li> Not bad...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always interested in trying things that are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or more natural than most.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorants and have used them myself for years (love the apricot scent, especially).  </li>
            <li> In my experience, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants are useful in situations where not much is asked of them, not so great for heavy-duty demands, and this one is that way.</li>
            <li> The big thing for us is that we are trying to lessen our &amp;#34;toxic load&amp;#34; by eating better (mostly organic), getting exercise and getting the chemicals out of our house.</li>
            <li> This is probably a decent product compared to most in terms of toxicity.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and it works all day long.</li>
            <li> Not only is the smell much more feminine, smelled like berries to me, it didn&#x27;t burn me!</li>
            <li> Thought I should try a more natural product (as suggested by my wife) and gave this product a try.</li>
            <li> Liked the ingredients and smell, but the product did not last all day.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s, it has been fun</li>
            <li> My husband was distinctly unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and the effectiveness of this natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> My husband has primarily used Speed Stick deodorant for many years, and was interested in seeing if this deodorant would give equal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your pits have to detoxify all the aluminum and toxins plugging up your pores from commercial antiperspirants (which make you stinkier by the way) and than can take a couple weeks so this deodorant might now seem effective at first</li>
            <li> The smell is great and, while it only lasts a few hours, it effectively keeps the funk away for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I generally have zero reactions to products, and I don&#x27;t have many allergies aside from cats.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first 3 days then after that my armpits have been bright red and just plain old hurt all over where I apply it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in Whole Foods near me any more.</li>
            <li> I didn’t even put it on after a fresh shower, most nights showering before bed and just getting up and going the next morning.  </li>
            <li> It does have an underarm &amp;#34;shelf life&amp;#34; for me, I work indoors in an air conditioned office, but, after eiht ot ten hours it looses effectiveness, which is OK with me.  </li>
            <li> but if that&#x27;s what it takes to ditch the chemicals in most commercial antiperspirants then so be it.  </li>
            <li> is my 2nd stick after trying my first about a year ago or more I think.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, I didn&#x27;t have a reaction, but after further review I have noticed that my armpits are irritated and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts longer and smells better than standard Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> But when the aluminum is the thing you&#x27;re trying to avoid, this one does pretty well.</li>
            <li> But the Mountain Spring scent is pretty benign.  </li>
            <li> (my LORD was it hot).  </li>
            <li> I even tried reapplying it every so often for the first two weeks</li>
            <li> The scent was ok, I&#x27;m going to check out the others next time.</li>
            <li> Smell is great (very mild, barely detectable) and product really works well, even for an active 10 year old boy!</li>
            <li> odor protection seemed adequate, but I usually do not generate a lot of stink.</li>
            <li> consider myself a male who sweats fairly easily, so if that sounds like you, save yourself some time and try something else.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and it can be pretty hot</li>
            <li> They had a mild but pleasing scent that would give protection through the work day, which was all I figured I could reasonably hope for from a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as putting toxic chemicals into my body.</li>
            <li> really like it.  </li>
            <li> what I really like about it is that it&#x27;s paraben-free and aluminum-free.</li>
            <li> it was a weekend, and I didn&#x27;t go out much.</li>
            <li> It will work for 24 hours if I don&#x27;t engage in much high-exertion or high-stress</li>
            <li> I tried this for three days straight.</li>
            <li> It really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t do much for mine.</li>
            <li> activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients (listed in the Amazon product description) seem natural and safe enough, though they aren&#x27;t hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> First my husband&#x27;s review...he loves the scent, &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; as he said,  It kept him dry and odor free all afternoon after his workout.</li>
            <li> I normally use Irish Spring but it can be a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> I think the additional layers helped as my armpits didn&#x27;t start feeling gross as quick as the first time.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to go towards a more natural deodorant after using Old Spice High Endurance for my whole adulthood (30 yrs old).</li>
            <li> As an example: the other day, I showered, applied the product, went to dinner, came home about three hours later (without sweating), thought this would be a good time for some intimacy, checked my pits and about made myself pass out.</li>
            <li> I normally wear antiperspirant and will probably switch back to it when the weather warms up, but this is fine for cooler months and seems to prevent the rancid sweat smell.</li>
            <li> I made sure my house was hot and uncomfortable just to make sure it could handle the pressure</li>
            <li> this product worked fine for a month of heavy application, then i quickly started developing intensely itchy armpits.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice but it just doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> You get a whiff of fresh smell as it&#x27;s going on, then it settles down to unnoticeable, unless you get really close, then fresh again!</li>
            <li> Deodorants without aluminum are far less effective than deodorants with aluminum.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> but, I also live in \\&quot;the real world\\&quot; where being \\&quot;smelly\\&quot; is never (ever) acceptable in the workplace.</li>
            <li> it kept me dry and odor free too.  </li>
            <li> Main Woodspice is the winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I appreciated that it left no marks or residue on my clothing, applied effortlessly, and had a really fresh scent.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT: this is not 100% natural - only the fragrance is.  </li>
            <li> Better scent and lasts longer than other natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> this tends to apply at since it is so soft makes you sweat 10x more than using any other deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It took a little while for my body to adjust to the switch, but I&#x27;m glad I switched over to this product.</li>
            <li> but it still just doesn&#x27;t work anywhere close the the normal stuff.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just trying to avoid putting the normal stuff on everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next day, I gave it another go, but this time, I applied maybe twice as much as the first time around.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s funny is that the Tom&#x27;s &amp;#34;Wild Lavender&amp;#34; in the white container works really well for me.</li>
            <li> and my underarms returned to normal.</li>
            <li> I was floored at how fresh the scent was and how lasting it was, despite the copious amounts of sweating I was doing</li>
            <li> Their scents are pleasant enough before I apply them, but they smell like some foul mix of old, wet rag and boys&#x27; high school locker room the second I apply them.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the ingredients are a bit different, so I think it all depends on finding the right ingredients that work for your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Hopefully will live up to &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; claims.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s new to me is trying the Mountain Spring variety.</li>
            <li> Slightly burns underarms and causes a mild red rash... and doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only purchase if you enjoy smelling like a middle school locker room.</li>
            <li> Texture of the product is smooth and compares to conventional brands.  </li>
            <li> EWG&#x27;s Database Skin Deep, which rates how toxic personal care products are, gives this deodorant a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; on a scale of 0-10 with ten being the most toxic.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant even worked outside on a hot and humid day here in SW Florida.</li>
            <li> Applied it first in the evening and awoke the following day to burning armpits.</li>
            <li> I am going to try a new all natural brand.</li>
            <li> Like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something natural.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use something all natural and get away from antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> nothing like old spice or degree.</li>
            <li> This the only natural deodorant that has worked for me and my sensitive armpits and I have tried quite a few reputable brands that had something my skin didn&#x27;t agree with from tea tree oil to alcohol to baking soda.  </li>
            <li> Also remember to give your body time to adjust to a natural deoderant.  </li>
            <li> So far I had been the Tom&#x27;s of Maine user in the family.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using Tom&#x27;s, I was using Old Spice deodorant and antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised that it works for some of the reviewers before me.</li>
            <li> and I developed a rash under my arms.</li>
            <li> When I would put this on I would be smelly an hour later no matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on scents and fragrances, but I really like this.</li>
            <li> And Tom&#x27;s is as natural as you can get with this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t natural anymore.</li>
            <li> Understanding that everyone&#x27;s body is different and folks have different jobs which cause them to sweat more or less (I mainly sit at a desk)</li>
            <li> I am a naturally decent smelling guy and typically only use deodorant a couple times a week, like before going out on the town.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using the last couple ones that we bulk ordered and have had to find a new, natural deodorant option.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting it is, great for standard day wear with moderate activity, but just an extra application before heavy workout or strenuous sweaty activity.  </li>
            <li> and I applied the same amount as the 2nd day, maybe a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man who sweats easily and has moderate to heavy BO.</li>
            <li> This is the only Toms of Maine deo which doesn&#x27;t have Propolene Glycol (a stain on an otherwise very natural ingredient list).  </li>
            <li> Would like to send back, but will likely use it until gone (which should be fast since I have to reapply often when I use it) and then go back to Arm and Hammer or Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d classify myself as a fairly average user — not a heavy perspirer but in need of some odor protection as the day goes on — and the TOM products used to work reasonably well for me.  </li>
            <li> tbs arrowroot powder, 6 tbs GMO free corn starch, 4 tbs baking soda and lavender and/or tea tree essential oils - usually around 8-10 drops.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Even when I don&#x27;t have apparent sweat, my armpits start to smell a couple of hours after putting this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While i won&#x27;t say there&#x27;s as effective as weird chemical formulations,</li>
            <li> I liked the scent and when i was overheated, you can smell the scent faintly.  </li>
            <li> I threw out the entire stick, which I only used for 3 days, and bought an Old Spice deodorant with no antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.... far from it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> My armpits do not smell during the day, and even after being at the gym for almost 2 hours, they probably only smell a little bit, but I really have to stick my nose to my armpits to smell.</li>
            <li> and you should only buy it if you plan to carry it around all day because you will need to apply it four or five times if you&#x27;re near other people.</li>
            <li> On the first day, I applied about the same amount I usually do with the Old Spice, which is about 4 strokes (2 up and 2 down).</li>
            <li> Long lasting is a total joke.</li>
            <li> Natural, no aluminium, not much of a scent, works for a long time!</li>
            <li> No really, this product just barely works at all</li>
            <li> Calling it 24 Hour Long Lasting is a lie, how can they get away with that?  </li>
            <li> it is indeed long lasting.</li>
            <li> It says long lasting, and it is!</li>
            <li> and it does last all day long!</li>
            <li> few times I felt my pits burning, but I&#x27;ve had burning before and figured my body was just getting used to a new product.</li>
            <li> Many deodorants and especially those with an antiperspirant contain dangerous ingredients that have been linked to breast cancer and even Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with all the snow shoveling of late.</li>
            <li> The long term effects of itching, etc...have never manifested.</li>
            <li> Long lasting,&lt;br /&gt;great value.</li>
            <li> used this for long time but it didnt work all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> This seems to hold true with regard to this specific deodorant, unfortunately.    </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super expensive, and it only comes in women&#x27;s scents.</li>
            <li> Currently I&#x27;m using antiperspirant every other day while using the Tom&#x27;s on the off-days.  </li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t designed to keep you dry, so if you sweat a lot, you may want to go with something else.</li>
            <li> and then you start to stink like you just ran a mile being chased by a polar bear.</li>
            <li> Even with less than moderate sweating the coverage and scent has worn off and your scent starts to come out as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think it will last half the day for any man, sweat or no sweat.</li>
            <li> I probably didn&#x27;t even smell that bad, but still, I wanted to be sure that I wasn&#x27;t the smelly guy at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And they feel unpleasantly wet and clammy under my pits.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected for a deodorant.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel gooey or moist or wet under your arms.  </li>
            <li> While i&#x27;ve had some sensitivity to other Tom&#x27;s deodorants, this wasn&#x27;t one of them.  </li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of the chemicals that the other deodorants have.  </li>
            <li> I usually like Tom&#x27;s products, but this one fell short.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in this product, you should give it a try since it isn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you put your shirt on after applying, unless you like deodorant streaks down the side.</li>
            <li> I first switched to a natural deodorant when I was in High School because the typical brands would give me a terrible rash after a week or two.</li>
            <li> I feel strongly that I shouldn&#x27;t be risking my health to avoid sweating or smelling bad, so I switched to this brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, compared to standard antiperspirant, it&#x27;s not very good.</li>
            <li> Average it out to two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about my only complaint.</li>
            <li> It spreads on thick and white.</li>
            <li> Each ingredient is rated separately, and by far the fragrance in this product is the worse with a &amp;#34;8&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but given a couple weeks, you should see your B.O. go way down.</li>
            <li> But still, it didn&#x27;t get me through half the day.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s odd to say, but it almost smells like a citronella candle.  </li>
            <li> just odd for a deodorant.</li>
            <li> Yes, i was worried that without those chemicals it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s not true.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something a little less noticeable</li>
            <li> One other complaint I have is that it leaves a thick white residue when it dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems a little difference means a lot.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle, not strongly masculine or feminine.  </li>
            <li> went bad or something, so I threw one out and started with a fresh one.</li>
            <li> Plus both lady kinds made my armpits burn and peel for a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and no irritation or stink.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Instead I got a waste of time and cash.</li>
            <li> switched to green tidings</li>
            <li> I have this reservation with all natural products, simply because they don’t always work as they promise, and for someone like me, who has serious sweat issues, I was just afraid that I’d start to stink in a matter of an hour or two.  </li>
            <li> l have tried everything and this stuff just plain works.  </li>
            <li> Actually I was prompted just now to write this review after putting some on before bed last night after a shower and stinking really bad this morning.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and then you will smell like a dirty hippie in an old VW van without A/C</li>
            <li> I do find with Toms, you need to reapply through the day, usually twice for me.</li>
            <li> and I have weird skin flaps under my arms that I wonder are related so when I found out about</li>
            <li> The scent is also not overwhelming in the bottle or when worn.  </li>
            <li> At the end of a workday, where he&#x27;s not sweating or doing manual labor, he said he could tell the deodorant was starting to fail.</li>
            <li> Truly all day protection, at least for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those who have serious perspiration issues you may want to ask your doctor about Drysol.  </li>
            <li> But in the past couple of years, regardless of the scent, all TOM products have become worse than useless for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product fail at its sole purpose so badly.  </li>
            <li> It appears to make me smell worse.</li>
            <li> I hate regular deodorant because it irritates my skin</li>
            <li> Not a good thing!  </li>
            <li> If I shower and then use the product, I can start smelling bad in a matter of minutes to a few hours.</li>
            <li> To bad this product doesnt make it past 6 hours.</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> Somewhere along the line, TOM deodorants have gone horribly wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, TOM.</li>
            <li> I have the lavender scented deodorant for women since unfortunately finding women&#x27;s deodorant without the antiperspirant can be hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Worked for an hour or two before I noticed an unpleasant odor emitted from my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Some people complain it makes you smell bad</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really disappointed...</li>
            <li> Still disappointed with the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hate.</li>
            <li> The TJ&#x27;s is worthless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> USELESS!!!</li>

            <li> it works well for me. Like the natural ingredients. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with BO - I&#x27;ve never been told anyone could smell me - until I started wearing this.  It goes on great.  Not at all sticky.  Smells good - and does a great job - for about 7-8 hours.  And then, kaboom!  You stink!  It&#x27;s like the deoderant is somehow chemically treating the bactieria to delay it&#x27;s odor - but in the meantime during that period, making the BO bacteria stronger - and so, once the fuse of 8 hours is gone you get an explosion of odor.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 30 days - and my wife has mentioned my BO twice after wearing for 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - four stars for smelling great, and doing the job initially - but 0 stars for &amp;#34;Long Lasting&amp;#34; power.  Average it out to two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way this stuff will last 24 hours is if you take a shower every 8 hours and reapply.</li>
            <li> I am a naturally decent smelling guy and typically only use deodorant a couple times a week, like before going out on the town. Thought I should try a more natural product (as suggested by my wife) and gave this product a try. It appears to make me smell worse. If I shower and don&#x27;t use the product, I stay relatively good smelling unless I sweat a lot. If I shower and then use the product, I can start smelling bad in a matter of minutes to a few hours. As an example: the other day, I showered, applied the product, went to dinner, came home about three hours later (without sweating), thought this would be a good time for some intimacy, checked my pits and about made myself pass out. Reapplied the product and went to bed expectantly. During the following proceedings, I could begin to smell myself again. WTF? I refrained from using the product the next three days and had no odor, even at my job which is an outdoor, manual labor type job. Would like to send back, but will likely use it until gone (which should be fast since I have to reapply often when I use it) and then go back to Arm and Hammer or Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Somewhere along the line, TOM deodorants have gone horribly wrong.  I&#x27;d classify myself as a fairly average user — not a heavy perspirer but in need of some odor protection as the day goes on — and the TOM products used to work reasonably well for me.  They had a mild but pleasing scent that would give protection through the work day, which was all I figured I could reasonably hope for from a natural deodorant.  But in the past couple of years, regardless of the scent, all TOM products have become worse than useless for me.  Their scents are pleasant enough before I apply them, but they smell like some foul mix of old, wet rag and boys&#x27; high school locker room the second I apply them.  And they feel unpleasantly wet and clammy under my pits.  Ugh.  I&#x27;ve stopped using the last couple ones that we bulk ordered and have had to find a new, natural deodorant option.  It may be that everyone&#x27;s body responds differently to deodorants...  For me, these are to be avoided.  Sorry, TOM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product fail at its sole purpose so badly.  It lasts for all of 15 minutes and then you will smell like a dirty hippie in an old VW van without A/C</li>
            <li> Liked the ingredients and smell, but the product did not last all day. Had to go back to aluminum deoderant.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> It works for some but not for others.  It worked for me!  I was hesitant to use this but I wanted something natural.  I normally use Irish Spring but it can be a bit strong.  I wanted something a little less noticeable so I purchased this.  I tried it out on a weekend and it worked just fine.  I made sure my house was hot and uncomfortable just to make sure it could handle the pressure and it was a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it today at work since it was wear your favorite sports shirt day and I was good to go all day!  I did not smell any odor and it lasted all day.  I live in Texas and it can be pretty hot so this will be my deodorant of choice.  I purchased this at my local Target store but if they ever stop selling it I will purchase it from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have serious perspiration issues you may want to ask your doctor about Drysol.  I have used Drysol for years and it works well with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and LOVE this deodorant. I wanted to use something all natural and get away from antiperspirants. I chose Toms lady kind first. I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the lavender or apricot, smelled manly to me. Plus both lady kinds made my armpits burn and peel for a few days. I finally quit using. Then my boyfriend brings this mountain spring one home for himself. I decided to try it out one morning…. Whoo! So glad I did. Not only is the smell much more feminine, smelled like berries to me, it didn&#x27;t burn me! This product isn&#x27;t designed to keep you dry, so if you sweat a lot, you may want to go with something else. I do find with Toms, you need to reapply through the day, usually twice for me. That doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as putting toxic chemicals into my body. So I&#x27;m in love with a mens deodorant. I say it&#x27;s unisex. :)</li>
            <li> This product works . . . for about 6 hours and then you start to stink like you just ran a mile being chased by a polar bear. No really, this product just barely works at all and you should only buy it if you plan to carry it around all day because you will need to apply it four or five times if you&#x27;re near other people.</li>
            <li> To bad this product doesnt make it past 6 hours. Maybe its me, but this deoderant does not work. Calling it 24 Hour Long Lasting is a lie, how can they get away with that?  After buying a 3 pack I threw them all away.</li>
            <li> this product worked fine for a month of heavy application, then i quickly started developing intensely itchy armpits. i dont have armpit odor whatsoever, and i only apply for the scent. i do like this product&#x27;s scent, which smells like apricots, and sweat and fruity. nothing like old spice or degree.</li>
            <li> l have tried everything and this stuff just plain works.  It does have an underarm &amp;#34;shelf life&amp;#34; for me, I work indoors in an air conditioned office, but, after eiht ot ten hours it looses effectiveness, which is OK with me.  The long term effects of itching, etc...have never manifested.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant. I first switched to a natural deodorant when I was in High School because the typical brands would give me a terrible rash after a week or two. Recently the brand I’ve been using for years changed their formula and it started giving me the dreaded rash. This one does not do that and it does last all day long! Even when I go out for a 10- 15 mile mountain bike ride in the evening I don’t stink when I get home. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Great scent for all genders!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hate. It works fine for me. Yeah its different but it lasted me all day which is all I ask. Some people complain it makes you smell bad but I did not find that to be the case.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and he likes it.</li>
            <li> Long lasting it is, great for standard day wear with moderate activity, but just an extra application before heavy workout or strenuous sweaty activity.  Great scent, the lady loves it ;)</li>
            <li> Smell is great (very mild, barely detectable) and product really works well, even for an active 10 year old boy!</li>
            <li> Slightly burns underarms and causes a mild red rash... and doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed... I bought 4 of these at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TERRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell... really like it.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. An effective deodorant. Hopefully will live up to &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; claims.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a short amount of time. Long lasting.... far from it.  Even with less than moderate sweating the coverage and scent has worn off and your scent starts to come out as well.  The scent is nice but it just doesn&#x27;t last long at all. It spreads on thick and white. Be careful if you put your shirt on after applying, unless you like deodorant streaks down the side. Compared to the regular 24 Hour TOMS this one doesn&#x27;t hold up. Main Woodspice is the winner in my book.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well. It took a little while for my body to adjust to the switch, but I&#x27;m glad I switched over to this product.</li>
            <li> This the only natural deodorant that has worked for me and my sensitive armpits and I have tried quite a few reputable brands that had something my skin didn&#x27;t agree with from tea tree oil to alcohol to baking soda.  This is the only Toms of Maine deo which doesn&#x27;t have Propolene Glycol (a stain on an otherwise very natural ingredient list).  I have been using it for a few weeks now and no irritation or stink.  The smell is great and, while it only lasts a few hours, it effectively keeps the funk away for the whole day.  Sometimes I do have to reapply once throughout the day but if that&#x27;s what it takes to ditch the chemicals in most commercial antiperspirants then so be it.  Also remember to give your body time to adjust to a natural deoderant.  Your pits have to detoxify all the aluminum and toxins plugging up your pores from commercial antiperspirants (which make you stinkier by the way) and than can take a couple weeks so this deodorant might now seem effective at first but given a couple weeks, you should see your B.O. go way down.</li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorants and have used them myself for years (love the apricot scent, especially).  I feel good about using something without aluminum in the ingredients and have never had a &amp;#34;fail&amp;#34; with it.  But my husband has always used whatever strong brand he finds.  I was glad to find that Tom&#x27;s makes an aluminum free, strong deodorant for men and my husband has been liking it.  No &amp;#34;fails&amp;#34; for him either.  The scent is pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> So far I had been the Tom&#x27;s of Maine user in the family. I have the lavender scented deodorant for women since unfortunately finding women&#x27;s deodorant without the antiperspirant can be hit or miss. I&#x27;ve been fairly pleased with it, except for the price. My husband has primarily used Speed Stick deodorant for many years, and was interested in seeing if this deodorant would give equal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have been pretty good so far. Pleasant scent, and it is indeed long lasting. So the product does work quite well. However, our only issue is the same as with the lavender scented deodorant for me. For the price of the Tom&#x27;s, we can buy two of the Speed Stick. Budget is a big consideration in our household, so for now we&#x27;ll be sticking with the Speed Stick.</li>
            <li> It DOESN&#x27;T.  I hate regular deodorant because it irritates my skin and I have weird skin flaps under my arms that I wonder are related so when I found out about Tom&#x27;s I jumped on the wagon.  I also like to try &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products so it was an easy decision.  I put it on and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  YAY!  Only problem is it works just about as good as not wearing deodorant at all.  Actually I was prompted just now to write this review after putting some on before bed last night after a shower and stinking really bad this morning.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd stick after trying my first about a year ago or more I think.  I wanted to give it another try but it still just doesn&#x27;t work anywhere close the the normal stuff.  Currently I&#x27;m using antiperspirant every other day while using the Tom&#x27;s on the off-days.  Even then it doesn&#x27;t work well, I&#x27;m just trying to avoid putting the normal stuff on everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Tom&#x27;s can come out with something soon that actually works.  Till then, I&#x27;m stuck with the chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s men&#x27;s deodorant for a couple of years. I like this Mountain Spring scent because it&#x27;s not strongly male or female smelling, and it keeps away body odor all day. It needs to be re-applied every day, after showering, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I really like about it is that it&#x27;s paraben-free and aluminum-free. Many deodorants and especially those with an antiperspirant contain dangerous ingredients that have been linked to breast cancer and even Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease. I feel strongly that I shouldn&#x27;t be risking my health to avoid sweating or smelling bad, so I switched to this brand.</li>
            <li> I like how this product uses natural ingredients and smells good, and I applaud the effort. However, this does not even come CLOSE to lasting 24 hours. I give it 6 hours at best. Even when I don&#x27;t have apparent sweat, my armpits start to smell a couple of hours after putting this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using Tom&#x27;s, I was using Old Spice deodorant and antiperspirant. I wanted to try out Tom&#x27;s because the aluminum from the antiperspirant caused underarm stains on my t-shirts. On the first day, I applied about the same amount I usually do with the Old Spice, which is about 4 strokes (2 up and 2 down). After a couple of hours, my armpits started getting sticky and smelly. Good thing it was a weekend, and I didn&#x27;t go out much. The next day, I gave it another go, but this time, I applied maybe twice as much as the first time around. I think the additional layers helped as my armpits didn&#x27;t start feeling gross as quick as the first time. But still, it didn&#x27;t get me through half the day. Alright, third day. I didn&#x27;t have another deodorant to use, so I stuck with Tom&#x27;s and I applied the same amount as the 2nd day, maybe a little bit more. Still disappointed with the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally gave up after the 3rd day. I threw out the entire stick, which I only used for 3 days, and bought an Old Spice deodorant with no antiperspirant. It is working wonders! My armpits do not smell during the day, and even after being at the gym for almost 2 hours, they probably only smell a little bit, but I really have to stick my nose to my armpits to smell. I don&#x27;t think anyone would notice if I just walked by them. CHEMICALS RULE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself a male who sweats fairly easily, so if that sounds like you, save yourself some time and try something else. This will not work for you, unless you don&#x27;t mind reapplying a couple of times a day. I don&#x27;t even think it will last half the day for any man, sweat or no sweat. I&#x27;m actually surprised that it works for some of the reviewers before me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in Whole Foods near me any more. Love the naturalness of this. Works as expected for a deodorant. Very helpful with all the snow shoveling of late.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and liked that it came in a pack of 3. Love the scent and works very well. Very Pleased.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏</li>
            <li> Pros: Smells Nice, Natural&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not an effective deodorant, Absolutely does not last 24 Hrs</li>
            <li> I really wanted to go towards a more natural deodorant after using Old Spice High Endurance for my whole adulthood (30 yrs old). I decided to give Tom&#x27;s a try and liked what I had gotten myself into. The smell was pleasant and not overbearing. It seemed to be working well. (I&#x27;m not a big sweater). I would reapply after 8 hours of work before going to the gym. I probably didn&#x27;t even smell that bad, but still, I wanted to be sure that I wasn&#x27;t the smelly guy at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Tom&#x27;s for probably around 3 weeks. I few times I felt my pits burning, but I&#x27;ve had burning before and figured my body was just getting used to a new product. For the most part, I didn&#x27;t have a reaction, but after further review I have noticed that my armpits are irritated and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Tom&#x27;s, it has been fun but I&#x27;m going to go another direction...Herban Cowboy &amp;#34;Dusk&amp;#34; is next on my list</li>
            <li> After about a month this stuff stopped working and I developed a rash under my arms. I thought maybe it was the stick I was using went bad or something, so I threw one out and started with a fresh one. The smell persisted and the rash did as well. I stopped using this a few days ago. I would not recommend this to any one. Long lasting is a total joke. When I would put this on I would be smelly an hour later no matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li> In my experience, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants are useful in situations where not much is asked of them, not so great for heavy-duty demands, and this one is that way. I can&#x27;t say that it lasts longer than the others I&#x27;ve tried. It will work for 24 hours if I don&#x27;t engage in much high-exertion or high-stress activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients (listed in the Amazon product description) seem natural and safe enough, though they aren&#x27;t hypoallergenic. The ones that are supposed to deodorize are glyceryl laurate, hops extract, and zinc ricinoleate. Glyceryl laurate and hops extract are supposed to prevent odor by inhibiting bacterial growth (which is what produces odors). Zinc ricinoleate is supposed to absorb odors, though the extent to which it does that is debated.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is awesome! The scent is good for both men and women. I buy it on the Subscribe and Save program and save even more money. The big thing for us is that we are trying to lessen our &amp;#34;toxic load&amp;#34; by eating better (mostly organic), getting exercise and getting the chemicals out of our house. It just didn&#x27;t make sense to keep putting all these chemicals ON our bodies when we were trying to get them OUT of our bodies. It&#x27;s good and it works all day long. There is no need to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find his product.  i&#x27;ve been using tom&#x27;s for years, and while i&#x27;ve been very satisfied with their products, i was thrilled to have options tailored specifically to men.  While i won&#x27;t say there&#x27;s as effective as weird chemical formulations, translation: you need to apply more frequently, but it does a darn good job.  While i&#x27;ve had some sensitivity to other Tom&#x27;s deodorants, this wasn&#x27;t one of them.  hooray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, tom&#x27;s is an awesome brand you should support!  why not spend your money on a business that&#x27;s trying to do some good in the world (natural ingredients, commitment to volunteering, donate to environmental nonprofits), and NOT just about making money?</li>
            <li> Does a good job. Glad it&#x27;s aluminum free. Not as great at stopping perspiration, but the alternatives with all those chemicals is not an option.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of products that lean more toward the natural/organic end of the spectrum. But, I have yet to find a deodorant that I can truly trust. This seems to hold true with regard to this specific deodorant, unfortunately.    I tried this for three days straight. Day one, I really liked this product. I appreciated that it left no marks or residue on my clothing, applied effortlessly, and had a really fresh scent. The same applies to day two. Day three was a slightly different story. At the end of the evening, I noticed that I was ... smelly. Ick. It was not a strenuous or stressful day. In fact, it was fairly comparable to the first two. (Lectured, conducted office hours, went home, cooked, wrote, hung out ... nothing physically demanding). I wonder if my body became used to it? Maybe I need to apply it repeatedly during the day?    As a result, I will reserve use of this product for the weekends. I do like the idea of not assaulting my body with \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; ... but, I also live in \\&quot;the real world\\&quot; where being \\&quot;smelly\\&quot; is never (ever) acceptable in the workplace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always interested in trying things that are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or more natural than most.  My husband tried this and I did too.  We both work out an hour a day at lunch, shower and go back to work.  We are both ususally still sweating after the shower and we worry if our deodorants are working to the fullest at times.  First my husband&#x27;s review...he loves the scent, &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; as he said,  It kept him dry and odor free all afternoon after his workout. It was easy and smooth to put on.&lt;br /&gt;my review...I liked the scent and when i was overheated, you can smell the scent faintly.  it kept me dry and odor free too.  I liked the way it goes on and it doesn&#x27;t feel gooey or moist or wet under your arms.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of the chemicals that the other deodorants have.  Yes, i was worried that without those chemicals it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s not true.  It did work. Great product.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Mountain Spring performs well.  The scent is subtle, not strongly masculine or feminine.  The scent is also not overwhelming in the bottle or when worn.  Texture of the product is smooth and compares to conventional brands.  EWG&#x27;s Database Skin Deep, which rates how toxic personal care products are, gives this deodorant a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; on a scale of 0-10 with ten being the most toxic.  Each ingredient is rated separately, and by far the fragrance in this product is the worse with a &amp;#34;8&amp;#34;.  This is probably a decent product compared to most in terms of toxicity.  An unscented version would make it safer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine happily for several years now. If you want a deodorant that does the job, without aluminum and any artifical preservatives going next to your body, then get this. It really works as advertised.  What&#x27;s new to me is trying the Mountain Spring variety. I&#x27;m not big on scents and fragrances, but I really like this. You get a whiff of fresh smell as it&#x27;s going on, then it settles down to unnoticeable, unless you get really close, then fresh again! I find that this larger size is perfect size for adults, too. It goes on quick and easy, and you&#x27;re on your way. Functionality all the way, just like I like it.</li>
            <li> Good price, great delivery, perfect.</li>
            <li> Long lasting,&lt;br /&gt;great value.</li>
            <li> My husband works in an office, and he doesn&#x27;t perspire much, even when he does heavy yard work. I thought Tom&#x27;s Maine would be a good fit for a guy like him, especially since it&#x27;s a deodorant and not an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is that the scent is nice - neutral, low-key and pleasant. People around you aren&#x27;t going to pass out from any overwhelming fragrance (which is a problem with some men&#x27;s deodorants.) And Tom&#x27;s is as natural as you can get with this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in terms of producting against odor? My husband was distinctly unimpressed. At the end of a workday, where he&#x27;s not sweating or doing manual labor, he said he could tell the deodorant was starting to fail. We were going out to dinner, and he took a shower. He said he felt like he hadn&#x27;t used any deodorant at all, and as I said, he&#x27;s not a sweaty or smelly guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 10 for the idea, and a 3 for execution. I&#x27;m sure Tom&#x27;s works for many men - it just didn&#x27;t do much for mine.</li>
            <li> The smell of Tom’s Mountain Spring is very pleasant and the ingredient list appears safe. It’s a deodorant not an antiperspirant so you’ll still sweat but you won’t smell. This deodorant even worked outside on a hot and humid day here in SW Florida. However, all I really need it to work for is a day at the office and for that it’s great. I’ve also used Tom’s of Maine unscented deodorant but that one gave me a painless rash on my armpits if I used it every day. I had to use it sparingly and eventually stopped with it altogether. I haven’t had that issue with this type of Tom’s.</li>
            <li> Natural, no aluminium, not much of a scent, works for a long time!</li>
            <li> Only purchase if you enjoy smelling like a middle school locker room.</li>
            <li> Applied it first in the evening and awoke the following day to burning armpits. I looked in the mirror and they were red like a sunburn. This product isn&#x27;t natural anymore. Sounds like the original owners sold out and the new owners care more about profit than good natural products. It&#x27;s been used once and is going in the bin. USELESS!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!</li>
            <li> Better scent and lasts longer than other natural deodorant.  Just what I would expect from Tom&#x27;s of Maine!</li>
            <li> Worked for an hour or two before I noticed an unpleasant odor emitted from my underarms.  Something about the thickness this tends to apply at since it is so soft makes you sweat 10x more than using any other deodorant.  I was hoping for something that would prevent stains and wasn&#x27;t an antiperspirant... Instead I got a waste of time and cash.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me. What&#x27;s funny is that the Tom&#x27;s &amp;#34;Wild Lavender&amp;#34; in the white container works really well for me. I noticed that the ingredients are a bit different, so I think it all depends on finding the right ingredients that work for your body chemistry. Seems a little difference means a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man who sweats easily and has moderate to heavy BO. I&#x27;ve struggled to find a workable, aluminum-free deodorant for some time now. I&#x27;ve tried this, standard Tom&#x27;s of Maine odorless, Trader Joe&#x27;s cotton, and Adidas cottontech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, the Adidas cottontech is the most effective...but they&#x27;ve stopped manufacturing it, it&#x27;s super expensive, and it only comes in women&#x27;s scents. So I&#x27;ve given up on that one. This one comes in a solid second. It lasts longer and smells better than standard Tom&#x27;s of Maine. The TJ&#x27;s is worthless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get 24-hour protection from this, but it lasts through most if not all my work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, compared to standard antiperspirant, it&#x27;s not very good. Deodorants without aluminum are far less effective than deodorants with aluminum. But when the aluminum is the thing you&#x27;re trying to avoid, this one does pretty well.</li>
            <li> This stuff burned and agitated my underarms. It worked great for the first 3 days then after that my armpits have been bright red and just plain old hurt all over where I apply it. IMPORTANT: this is not 100% natural - only the fragrance is.  I stopped use, gave it a week and my underarms returned to normal. Tried using this again and my underarms became agitated again. I just can&#x27;t seam to find a good non-antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li> used this for long time but it didnt work all day. switched to green tidings</li>
            <li> This Tom&#x27;s brand worked well.  I do think their roll on, unscented, works the best of all their styles of deodorant though.  Unscented works for men and women.  But the Mountain Spring scent is pretty benign.  It is kind of melon like - so doesn&#x27;t seem for ladies only.  It has good odor control, but not for the heaviest duty sweating and exertion.</li>
            <li> I’m going to be brutally honest; I didn’t trust this product at all.  I have this reservation with all natural products, simply because they don’t always work as they promise, and for someone like me, who has serious sweat issues, I was just afraid that I’d start to stink in a matter of an hour or two.  So, I put this bar to the ultimate test; I brought it with me to Disney World and used it solely.  I put it on in the morning, around 7am, and wore it in the sun for HOURS, not getting back to the resort till around 11pm, and guess what; I didn’t stink!  Seriously, this stuff works wonderfully.  I didn’t even put it on after a fresh shower, most nights showering before bed and just getting up and going the next morning.  I was floored at how fresh the scent was and how lasting it was, despite the copious amounts of sweating I was doing (my LORD was it hot).  So, at the end of the day, I strongly recommend this.  It says long lasting, and it is!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deodorant and does a pretty good job of lasting all day.  It&#x27;s say&#x27;s mountain spring scent, but I would say it&#x27;s more like a lemon scent.  I know it&#x27;s odd to say, but it almost smells like a citronella candle.  Not bad...just odd for a deodorant.</li>
            <li> this stuff has been nice on my skin but does not cover odor AT ALL. I even tried reapplying it every so often for the first two weeks but i cant be carrying deodorant around with me putting it on every two hours just to not smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to suppress the odor and it gave me a rash. I felt a &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation after using it for a week under my armpits.</li>
            <li> I usually like Tom&#x27;s products, but this one fell short. For some reason, the ingredients did not react well with my skin. After 5-6 hours of wear, my skin would turn red and itchy. I generally have zero reactions to products, and I don&#x27;t have many allergies aside from cats. I&#x27;m pretty sure that Tom&#x27;s has not started using essence of feline in their products, which leads me to believe something else is causing the irritation. One other complaint I have is that it leaves a thick white residue when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor protection seemed adequate, but I usually do not generate a lot of stink. I am going to try a new all natural brand. If anyone has suggestions, I&#x27;d truly appreciate it. If you&#x27;re interested in this product, you should give it a try since it isn&#x27;t that expensive. As for me, this one is going into retirement.</li>
            <li> My husband needs deodorant without aluminum. I&#x27;d been getting him the unscented version but he wanted a scent.  However this one does not seem to work as well.  He came home complaining that he could smell himself.  Not a good thing!  But everyone is different and I still think it can work for others.</li>
            <li> This seems to work pretty well, and has a pleasant smell. I normally wear antiperspirant and will probably switch back to it when the weather warms up, but this is fine for cooler months and seems to prevent the rancid sweat smell. It&#x27;s not sticky or gummy.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and the effectiveness of this natural deodorant. The scent was ok, I&#x27;m going to check out the others next time.</li>
            <li> Understanding that everyone&#x27;s body is different and folks have different jobs which cause them to sweat more or less (I mainly sit at a desk) I must say, this deodorant is great. Truly all day protection, at least for me. I only give it four stars because the scent name is a bit misleading. The actual scent is quite citrusy and was not what I was expecting. That&#x27;s about my only complaint. If you&#x27;re looking to go aluminum free, this is where it&#x27;s at. Period. Dot.</li>
            <li> It works well and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants. This one works the best for me. I use it with my homemade body powder because I can&#x27;t stand the sticky feeling of deodorant and because the powder I make helps keep the stink away and maintain dryness. I give this 4 stars because without my body powder, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homemade body powder:&lt;br /&gt;6 tbs arrowroot powder, 6 tbs GMO free corn starch, 4 tbs baking soda and lavender and/or tea tree essential oils - usually around 8-10 drops. Stick it in whatever container with a lid that you want and shake it up until the ingredients are mixed.</li>
