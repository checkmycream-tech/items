            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love this product but this one I can&#x27;t get the powder into the brush.</li>

            <li>This is the most convenient and useful sunscreen I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>Perfect for those that want a bit of color without the thick feeling of foundation.</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct shimmer in the day light.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and neck but was able to offer some to a friend when she forgot her high spf face lotion.</li>
            <li>I like this light powder to apply over my lotion sunblock when I play golf for four hours or more, as it adds coverage without the mess of applying more lotion.</li>

            <li>it works fabulously, she did not burn and did not redden further.</li>
            <li>Does it really protect ....</li>
            <li>How ironic.</li>
            <li>Also the EWG gives it a high toxicity rating of 7.</li>
            <li>I purchased this sunscreen last summer &amp; kept it in the car - so easy &amp; convenient to use - especially when I am driving around with sunroof open.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace my old brush which was falling apart...</li>
            <li>it would be better to get the clear version as this colored/tinted version was a little too dark</li>

            <li> However, 30 SPF was not high enough for me</li>

            <li> No greasy or oily crap!!!!</li>

            <li> This a a great sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue on your skin like most sunscreen do. The brush works great too. However, 30 SPF was not high enough for me (I have fair skin and I spend a lot of time outdoors). So I ordered a 50 SPF refill. Now that I am using the brush with the 50 SPF refill I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> perfect for the sidelines as a spectator</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this sunscreen! Someone could look at me wrong and I would break out! This stuff is a godsend! I also use it on my husband and kids, they love it! No greasy or oily crap!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a short time but I like what I&#x27;ve seen. It is easy to use and covers nicely. I wanted something that was light and with sunscreen. I think this will work out just fine.</li>
            <li> I like this light powder to apply over my lotion sunblock when I play golf for four hours or more, as it adds coverage without the mess of applying more lotion.</li>
            <li> it would be better to get the clear version as this colored/tinted version was a little too dark but the other one was not available at time of purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful sun screen.  Goes on so smooth</li>
            <li> No white streaks, no smell, no sticky feeling, does not come off until washed off. I was in the sun all day and no burn at all.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of this product but not crazy about the color.  It left an orange tint on my skin.  Perfect for the kiddos though!</li>
            <li> Love this!  It works!  And adds just a little color as well as keeping your face less shiny in the heat!  Easy to apply to ears!</li>
            <li> I expected it to have more of a bronze tone. Therefore, somewhat dissappointed</li>
            <li> Should add instructions on how to get the powder out; very little comes out.</li>
            <li> I play a lot of tennis and am in the sun for hours. Sunforgettable works well in preventing sunburn on my fair skin. I do reapply after about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> This is the most convenient and useful sunscreen I have used. I use it on my face and neck but was able to offer some to a friend when she forgot her high spf face lotion. Her shoulders were reddening in the sun and we were on a boat so I suggested she put Sunforgettable on the shoulder area...it works fabulously, she did not burn and did not redden further. Love it! And it lasts for ever. I bought this one to replace my old brush which was falling apart...the previous one lasted 4 years (with a refill). I still have at least half the refill bottle in my makeup drawer. I&#x27;m a fan for life.</li>
            <li> Its okay but no more than that.  At least it&#x27;s not greasy.  Does it really protect .... I guess some.  It&#x27;s handy on the golf course.</li>
            <li> I love this product but this one I can&#x27;t get the powder into the brush.</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my skin. It evens out my skin tones. I apply it after other lotions. I like the way it flows on my skin, so subtle I don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Wonderful protection doesn&#x27;t come off on clothes and just gives a kiss of color.  Perfect for those that want a bit of color without the thick feeling of foundation.</li>
            <li> I like the way this looks. It does have a distinct shimmer in the day light. If that&#x27;s what you want please know it is very obvious and looks a little disco for every day activities. Also the EWG gives it a high toxicity rating of 7. The ingredients are potentially harmful which is a bummer because I like how it covers. I wish they would stick with the mineral ingredients and not use all the harmful chemicals and I would give this five stars. I never cared until I noticed my skin pigment getting blotchy. I realized after research and consulting a dermatologist it&#x27;s caused from using foundation and powders on my skin like this! How ironic. I bought this to cover my splotchy complexion and it is what&#x27;s causing it! Yikes</li>
            <li> This is a great mineral based sunscreen. It not only protects you from the sun, but it also smooths out your face. It applies as a thin barrier and goes on very naturally. It can be reapplied as needed through our the day and doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothing. Great convenient sun protection!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Use it daily :-)</li>
            <li> I keep this in my car and apply for an extra layer of sunscreen on my face, neck and hands.  It&#x27;s so light you won&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on.</li>
