            <li>I liked the scent of the shampoo, so that is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kind of reminded me of Tide.</li>
            <li>After I got out of the shower my hair was very shiny and smelled great!</li>
            <li>I have a nice lightweight bounce to my hair which I haven’t had in a while.</li>
            <li>I received it to review, and this is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not trying to spend $70-80 to wash my own damn hair.</li>
            <li>I liked how the product worked after about a week.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading the good results from more than 250 reviews about the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>Fairly effective at making hair softer though.</li>
            <li>great product, great price, fast ship</li>
            <li>It has a nice shine to it too.  </li>
            <li>It had a seal in the inside that you had to remove before using which I liked.  </li>
            <li>My hair always feels so nice when it dries after using.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I could easily run my fingers through my hair immediately after rinsing, which is always a good sign.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t me more in love with this stuff if I tried!</li>
            <li>I love to run my fingers through it and get that amazing smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair with a nice healthy shine.</li>
            <li>This thing smelled amazing and my hair literally looked and felt better then ever.  </li>
            <li>This has a pleasant, clean scent that is not over powering.</li>
            <li>I have always had a very fine textured hair.</li>
            <li>I smell it periodically, reassuring me that my hair still smells nice and clean!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the great aroma it has.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair easy to manage ,very soft and has a wonderful scent!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked how easy it was to spread throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell strong nor like chemicals but just has a pleasant clean scent.</li>
            <li>I really could not tell that this did anything great for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was just ok.</li>
            <li>Your hair will look much more hydrated, healthy and silky after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their hair is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am highly impressed after using this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love how it has also helped with my dandruff</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine most people wanting to smell like chemical cleaners all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the more I used this</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t know that Israel and India also use &amp;#34;Mineral oil&amp;#34; in alot of their products as well as Brazil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars if the smell was better.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the fact that there&#x27;s a couple things I didn&#x27;t really like about it, the conditioner made my hair feel great.</li>
            <li>I like to focus on my ends since that&#x27;s where I have the most damage, and troublesome areas.</li>
            <li>I have already given my review on it, so be sure to look for my thoughts on that as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always loved the Dead Sea products but until now I have never found any that were an awesome price.  </li>
            <li>I was very easily able to run my brush through my hair.</li>
            <li>I probably will not use it every day, as the shampoo works great without it if I am not going to style my hair much.</li>
            <li>( I throw it in a bun most days.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this deep conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>love some of the ingredients in the conditioner as well:&lt;br</li>
            <li>of these things I would never expect to be in here :)</li>
            <li>love this conditioner, i have been coloring my hair for over 20 years and</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it too.  </li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair has magically gotten softer, I do like how it works in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost gone again, which is probably my favorite part of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than some.</li>
            <li>works well for me  love the smell  will reorder</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo these guys have, but the conditioner can make my hair a bit itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure if it is the salt or</li>
            <li>The smell though will not stop me from buying more of this product</li>
            <li>His hair is looking so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li>My tresses felt divine and more than rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This conditioner is definitely top drawer.</li>
            <li>Cetrimonium chloride is a salt often used in premium hair conditioners because it reduces static electricity and acts as a detangler.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I must say this is probably the best conditioner I have ever tried at home, and the leave in conditioner is no longer necessary.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Said allergic issues were mostly with leave on conditioners rather than rinse off like this one.  </li>
            <li>I liked that my hair was shiny, smooth and felt protected.</li>
            <li>OK this product came lightning fast!!!!  </li>
            <li>The smell is also extremely pleasant, very airy!</li>
            <li>then I flat ironed it and truly my hair was still looking awesome.  </li>
            <li>amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to rinse it off easily and my hair felt very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>just clean and nice.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this to review and love it!</li>
            <li>I use a fraction of the product that I would normally use and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I know some people love the smell of the products but for me it is a bit on the strong side</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely fragrance, just strong.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t do a very impressive job of moisturizing / conditioning my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>husband uses it more often than I do and loves it because it rinses easily and doesn&#x27;t cause any buildup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rate it as the &#x27;best&#x27; on really thick hair, but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>I liked the shampoo on it&#x27;s own, but can absolutely tell a difference when using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Adovia makes amazing products, that smell like products you would pay a lot more for from the spa, I highly recommend this brand.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li>this great product fixed!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is a light creamy formula, and it went on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair which tends not to be friends with most mass market conditioners.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when it came to brushing her hair because it was easy!</li>
            <li>My hair looks more smooth and silkier.</li>
            <li>it magically coated the hair leaving it moisturized and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I have drier hair, but I think cheap Dove conditioner does a better job.</li>
            <li>Truth is while God (and my credit card and husband) know that I have a draw full of inexpensive and luxury price makeup items, nonetheless when it comes to my hair and skincare, only the BEST touches those two places.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily and also leaves my hair smelling nice (like a fresh scent).</li>
            <li>I was even more excited.  </li>
            <li>It is easily prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>The bottle made it easy to squeeze to get the product out.</li>
            <li>so if strong smells give you a headache</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair with the slightest of odors, nothing so strong it draws the bee’s</li>
            <li>The scent is so strong that it gave me a headache after I used it for two days in a row.</li>
            <li>Scent is really really really strong.</li>
            <li>I needed something new because the shampoo I was using was not doing anything good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been lucky to be able to receive this product for free to review on my blog.</li>
            <li>but I see a huge difference after using this product.</li>
            <li>you are considering purchasing this, I would feel comfortable recommending that you try this and see for yourself.</li>
            <li>so I have been searching for an alternative free of harmful hormone disrupting ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free, for testing purposes, in exchange of my review.</li>
            <li>Although the product was free, all opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing is that it has a light scent.</li>
            <li>I was given this product free to try and review</li>
            <li>It washed out easily and my hair felt squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I figured since I was getting it for free, what did I have to lose.</li>
            <li>could tell my hair had conditioner in it just by the way it felt - smooth and silky with no tangles -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so utterly smooth and light.</li>
            <li>but I got this for free from Tomoson to test and review.</li>
            <li>I squeezed the bottle and noticed how smooth and non-greasy</li>
            <li>It rinsed out clean and easily.</li>
            <li>I give this product a 5 star rating and do recommend it to anyone looking to revive their long lost beautiful hair again.</li>
            <li>It had some natural curl which was a good sign.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I tried this conditioner and loved it.</li>
            <li>What I loved the most was that it left my hair feeling silky!  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant clean scent that I enjoy, not overly perfumed like other conditioners.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking for softer and more hydrated hair!</li>
            <li>Even the Balsam fragrance – a lovely light woodsy scent appropriate for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not all of the ingredients in Adovia Dead Sea Hair Conditioner are organic, those that aren’t have been certified as safe and effective by the Cosmetics Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a very strong perfume smell - too much for my taste.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the scent is amazing and leaves my hair smelling fresh and clean (not fruity or floral).</li>
            <li>This conditioner moisturizes my scalp and hair to a fair degree, but my scalp still seems to be a bit dry and my hair even more so.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed I did.</li>
            <li>I have now found them and I am so excited.  </li>
            <li>So we were excited for him to try it.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better, its so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Adore the clean smell, and it works to condition.</li>
            <li>but I also LOVE clean and fresh scents - and this smelled like clean linen and fresh air -</li>
            <li>and it smells so clean.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and smooth and gave it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh light floral fragrance that it awesome, not overwhelming but</li>
            <li>It is soft, manageable, and looks healthy and shiny!  </li>
            <li>It dispenses easily with no problem and has a lovely scent and texture to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to apply it the way I normally do.  </li>
            <li>I have wanted to try this product (as well as Adovia&#x27;s other products) after a friend of mine told me how good they are, and I was able to find this at a promotional price in order to test it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too, a soft clean scent.</li>
            <li>Adovia has very high quality products - better than some salon products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Adovia has very high quality products - better than some salon products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this and after blow drying my hair</li>
            <li>I started using a better shampoo but hadn&#x27;t found a conditioner that really healed my hair like I needed.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I loved how this conditioner made my hair feel and look after using it only a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I like sweet smelling products</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li>You can read my full review here  </li>
            <li>I had no bad experiences using Adovia Mineral Skincare Balsam Conditioner.</li>
            <li>The conditioner feels good, it makes my hair easy to come and soft, but its not the most manliest of scents and it takes some getting used to initially.</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner with the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, and I just LOVED it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You saw my daughter&#x27;s hair for yourself, but yes, in my case it most definitely looked hydrated and healthy, and it did feel silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural and cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick to use.  </li>
            <li>can find out all you need to know about the tremendous products at Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice-</li>
            <li>and so I was not surprised that I loved the Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>It felt so soft, clean, and smooth!</li>
            <li>I love finding new products to try when it comes to hair care also so when I was offered the opportunity to try out Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner</li>
            <li>I am very passionate about good quality hair and skincare products.  </li>
            <li>All in all I would say that if you are looking for something to hydrate and nourish your dry hair this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>The ingredients, overall were pretty good, although there were a couple that concerned</li>
            <li>The fragrance was a little overwhelming for me when I applied it but after rinsing, it was ok!</li>
            <li>Her hair gets so tangled its not even funny!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>My hair absorbs the product easily and leaves it soft, shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t girly, it&#x27;s a very natural, healthy smell, and I honestly can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>The product comes in a nice decent bottle that is very easy to hold in your hand while wet.</li>
            <li>Unlike the cheapo brands that are readily available, the Adovia conditioner doesn&#x27;t require much.</li>
            <li>it leaves it feeling really smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>It actually felt and smelled like a spa experience in my own shower.</li>
            <li>What you find below is my honest opinion after personally trying this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I got this product via a promotion however the opinions expressed above are my own.</li>

            <li>think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>Again, I wish it were more natural...</li>
            <li>inclusion of cetrimonium chloride (29%) proves the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>I normally use gobs of Pantene Classic Conditioner because my hair is fine and tends to tangle easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cetyl alcohol is an effective moisturizer that also protects the cuticles of hair by making them lie flat.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>they were right.  </li>
            <li>It seems to moisturizer the right amount.</li>
            <li>Unlike some conditioners, this one rinsed right out</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you exactly what kind of scent it is, but it is definitely not a chemical scent.</li>
            <li>After trying Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner  for the past two weeks I can honestly say that I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The Conditioner has a pleasant mild fresh scent- not overwhelming-</li>
            <li>it was pleasant) and left no heavy residue either.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this conditioner and the Dead Sea shampoo!</li>
            <li>like that it is animal cruelty free but even more so that it has so many natural ingredients and minerals that I feel safer using it on my children in a pinch than I would the million other kinds I could get at the store around here.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great because my hair is fine and thin and usually staticky and fly away.  </li>
            <li>I am dandruff free at the moment so this will be my new anti dandruff solution.</li>
            <li>first thing I did when this arrived to my house was use it right away...</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve received it to try, I can honestly say I have not had a single scalp blemish or worrisome bump to complain about.</li>
            <li>The silkiness level of my hair from Adovia Mineral Skin Care&#x27;s- Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner, IS PHENOMENAL AND WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!!</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this thick conditioner was pleasant and mild.</li>
            <li>have tried several off the shelf conditioners, my favorite of which is Infusium</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly have a lot of hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair soft and frizz free in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love Adovia&#x27;s other products, and was excited to get to try this.</li>
            <li>After I used it for the first time, for my surprise, my mind changed.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Dead Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.</li>
            <li>This conditioner by Adovia works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>is my first time trying Adovia products on my hair</li>
            <li>conditioner arrived first in so I waited until my shampoo arrived to use it.</li>
            <li>, I wash first with my shampoo, rinse, then add the conditioner into my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and natural.</li>
            <li>I will probably keep trying different brands of shampoo and conditioner, but mostly because that is just what I do.</li>
            <li>The bottle says to shampoo first and then use the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It says to use a dime size amount, butI made sure that I used enough to cover every hair.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk</li>
            <li>This Adovia conditioner has all the healthy benefits for your your hair so that is a big plus!</li>
            <li>But it does it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li>It helped make a big difference in my hair and in these more humid months, I needed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love using deep conditioner</li>
            <li>So I read up on the product first</li>
            <li>Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
            <li>I normally first shampoo and then re-condition my hair again.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair tangle free, soft and feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair first with shampoo and opened the conditioner to use it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves your hair feeling soft, supple and manageable while also smelling beautifully fresh!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that it has a pretty strong perfume smell (the shampoo has the same scent).</li>
            <li>Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner does have a light scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner does have a light scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>So imagine my excitement when I had the incredible opportunity to try out the Dead Sea Salt Deep Conditioner as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One wash and my hair felt super soft and was really shiney!</li>
            <li>so I did have to use a bit more than recommended as I have long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back and forth over hair products, trying to find a good combination of enough moisture to stave off dryness and itching without being so much that it clogs my scalp or causes oiliness.</li>
            <li>I really loved pairing this with my Dead Sea Mud Shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I didn’t have to use very much, a little went a long way, which is incredible for conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it does not weigh my hair down, which is extremely important to me since my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft, voluminous and frizz</li>
            <li>The description says it will hydrate hair, in fact it did make my hair more dry.</li>
            <li>I guess I should start with the scent - which is better than anything I have ever smelled in my entire live.</li>
            <li>My hair was noticeably less frizzy and more calm, I guess you could say.</li>
            <li>And finally, my hair was super soft, tangle free and felt great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really been one to use conditioner in my hair since it tends to weigh it down BUT, using this once a week; sometimes make makes my hair feel SO good!</li>
            <li>It was very tick and left my hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>the properties in the Dead Sea products are amazing.</li>
            <li>Plus the hair I do have is very &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>To me the product is very overrated.</li>
            <li>I was like: really?</li>
            <li>first I thought it was going to be just another normal conditioner that does nothing.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend these hair products!</li>
            <li>so I chose to cut my budget for a while by spending a whole dollar on a bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li>Her hair is very curly and mine is like a wave-curl.</li>
            <li>The conditioner really makes my hair shiny and hydrated.</li>
            <li>That was a bit too much</li>
            <li>I really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner  worked really well with my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has left my hair looking and feeling smooth and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the scent</li>
            <li>very well could, since it has a guarantee.</li>
            <li>It was really made my hair shiny and just felt like silk when I ran my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I immediately notice the scent, which is very fragrant, nourishing and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them.</li>
            <li>With the application of the Dead Sea Salt Conditioner, I purposely skipped this step because I wanted to see what the results of this conditioner were like all on its own.</li>
            <li>I actually have sensitive skin and allergies to many things but didn&#x27;t have a reaction this this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is a high quality product that is meant for dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>If you have and scalp condition or frequent scalp irritation, Adovia could be just the right answer.  </li>
            <li>I love it SO much, that I reached out to the seller to ask if they carried this scent in other products (like laundry soap, lotion, body wash, wax melts, etc).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other conditioners before that have made my hair more greasy looking</li>
            <li>recieved this product and was so so so excited to use it that I jumped in the shower about 30 minutes later and gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a clean and luxurious aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using both the conditioner and the dead sea shampoo together for the past week with great results!</li>
            <li>i have been getting compliments about it left and right!</li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW, my new favorite conditioner BY FAR.</li>
            <li>That meant this conditioner was not weighing my hair down the way most of them do.</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair so using a new bottle of conditioner paired up nicely with the ½ bottle of shampoo I had left</li>
            <li>That said, I really really tried to use the suggested amount, but probably did a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Almost like flowers:) it left my hair shiny and bouncy and not flat.</li>
            <li>far as actually conditioning, it&#x27;s really light</li>
            <li>My long, thick hair combed through beautifully without any effort, and after drying and styling my hair, it felt just like it does</li>
            <li>When your hair is dry it feels very soft and strong.</li>
            <li>I really loved the shampoo and suspected this would be a high quality conditioner since it also contained dead sea salt and was a deep hair conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first pic is flat unwashed hair and the second vavoom shine bounce and a silky soft feeling:)</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and no frizz and usually no tangles</li>
            <li>After the use of this treatment my scalp was not itching anymore I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>, fact is it is a high end product</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their line of products.y of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their line of products.</li>
            <li>I ordered this with high hopes but it does not work well for my hair.</li>
            <li>( I have pretty long hair that tangles easily, so that is a big deal for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>actually felt like my hair took a big drink of vitamins and just came out so healthy and soft!</li>
            <li>Instead my hair had a little bit more bounce and volume to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adovia&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner run about $20 per bottle which is a little more than I would like to spend, but my hair needs some TLC.</li>
            <li>that note – if you’re looking for a cute little gift basket or pick me up for a friend or family member, try the Adovia bar soap, shampoo, and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I went for a couple months without using conditioner because I started using shampoo that was more moisturizing, less stripping, and just plain better.</li>
            <li>it is 100% pure and genuine for an infusion of 21 minerals essential for proper skin and hair hydration.</li>
            <li>So I was super excited to try the Dead Sea Salt Conditioner!  </li>
            <li>They have made an amazing Dead Sea Mud shampoo and a Dead Sea Salt conditioner that work fabulously with textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used this with just normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioner for both of</li>
            <li>Not sure why people love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>There were no frizzies like I normally get.</li>
            <li>like I normally do either.</li>
            <li>It is totally manageable and looks and feels so much better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>I was more than overjoyed to try out the hydrating and nourishing Dead Sea Mud</li>
            <li>It was not overpowering, and smelled as refreshing as the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was not hard for either of us.</li>
            <li>but I do have dry hair more than occasionally and</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is so strong, it&#x27;s like walking into a laundromat or walking down the laundry soap isle at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>my itchy dry scalp gone, my lifeless hair with split ends gone, now my only trouble is my hair is so soft and beautiful</li>
            <li>you are in search for something new, give this conditioner a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>with Real Dead Sea Salt - 100% Pure and Genuine for an infusion of 21 Minerals Essential to Proper Skin and Hair Function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Hair Looking Hydrated, Healthy and Silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it is worth mentioning that I have really long hair, but it is not particularly thick.</li>
            <li>So when Adovia contacted Everything Beauty and Beyond to try out their Adovia Mineral Balsam Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner you know I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>The scent was light and fresh and the product itself was creamy but not too thick.</li>
            <li>I do tend to have dry hair sometimes and damaged hair because for awhile I was straightening my hair with a hot tool iron and it would damaged my hair and I&#x27;ve stopped doing that because I love my natural curly hair, so I leave this in my hair after massaging it all around my head/scalp and leave it in for about ten minutes and you can definitely feel the difference afterwards when you rinse off</li>
            <li>Hair feels very soft after.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s always a good thing since the aroma of a conditioner usually lasts even after you rinse and dry your hair.</li>
            <li>hair is soft, silky, and shiney!</li>
            <li>But with this conditioner it leaves it soft and flowing and shiny!</li>
            <li>First I received this at a low cost to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a very silky soft white conditioner and you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>Works the same way any other conditioner does but with much better results.</li>
            <li>and wow do I regret that!</li>
            <li>I didn’t shampoo my hair first because I don’t like to use shampoo daily.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft in my life!</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong..</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft and lively after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>My hair was less fly away and had less frizz the next morning.</li>
            <li>However,when blow drying it a few minutes later, my hair felt more straw-like than normal.</li>
            <li>Secondly, this conditioner rinsed off super well, without leaving a waxy feel behind like most conditioners.</li>
            <li>with real Dead Sea salt - 100% pure and genuine for an infusion of 21 minerals essential to proper skin and hair function&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair looking hydrated, healthy, and silky&lt;br /&gt;Helps to reduce the appearance of dandruff and dry flaky scalp</li>
            <li>Once that time as gone by, I will rinse my hair with cooler water, and do so until the water runs clear and no bubbles.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised in how well it performed</li>
            <li>So far Adovia products have worked for me.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for soft and shiny-that is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Using it leaves my hair soft and manageable and also improved the breakage issues.  </li>
            <li>I still wasn&#x27;t ready to write a review or recommend this conditioner as I wanted to see what regular use would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>My fault completely.</li>
            <li>In fact, it reminds me of natural scents I would smell outdoors.</li>
            <li>In fact, it reminds me of natural scents I would smell outdoors.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive and while I know this is for hair it also touches the scalp</li>
            <li>However, that aside, I was a bit surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that needs plenty of moisture in order for it to &amp;#34;act right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>(come on you long haired ladies – you know exactly what I mean…always running out of conditioner well before shampoo)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, we have an 8 month old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised they would have these in this conditioner as these are preservatives that can cause allergic reactions and sometimes contact sensitivity.</li>
            <li>My hair felt instantly hydrated and really soaked up the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Mixed in with the healthy dead sea mud, olive oil, grape seed oil is Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, and Cocamide Dea.  </li>
            <li>Each ingredient in Adovia Dead Sea Conditioner was chosen for its specific properties and what it can do for healthy hair and scalps.</li>
            <li>I love Dead Sea Salt Deep hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like that the adovia conditioner has dead sea minerals at the top of the ingredients and also various oils.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job conditioning my thin hair</li>
            <li>It was easy to cover my hair with a small</li>
            <li>but given the way typical conditioners work on my hair, I figured better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>product, while hydrating and conditioning, is a little dry to spread, so I found myself having to use more than the &amp;#34;dime-sized&amp;#34; amount suggested.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other conditioner I have used at home has ever made my hair feel this soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I became a huge fan of Adovia products when I tried the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo!  </li>
            <li>The product really goes a long way</li>
            <li>have been using this along with the shampoo that Adovia offers in this line and have seen a real difference, especially with the heat and humidity outside.</li>
            <li>I recently tested out the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner and it is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy hair and this conditioner has helped me tame it!</li>
            <li>tend to have a very itching dry scalp and colored hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before: My hair is very curly and dry.</li>
            <li>really helps control my curly dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been at least six months since I have started using better hair products, not only Adovia, and my hair keeps</li>
            <li>It is made with Real Dead Sea Salt, which is 100% Pure and Genuine for an infusion of 21 Minerals Essential to Proper Skin and Hair Function.  </li>
            <li>Ill be buying more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely continue to use it because it has been working for me so far</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this natural product.</li>
            <li>My hair is left soft, hydrated, and as manageable as it gets.</li>
            <li>But it left my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I was surprised as I thought the bottle would be larger but thankfully, it didn&#x27;t take a ton of the conditioner to get the job done.</li>
            <li>They tend to take my hair which is already lifeless, and just add more weight on to it, making it look that much worse.</li>
            <li>As I was giving it a chance the more it is even worse.</li>
            <li>I used this for a whole week, left my hair dry and my scalp itchy and</li>
            <li>and right now I am using Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Also, my scalp and hair didn&#x27;t feel dry like they normally feel after my hair dries.</li>
            <li>One good thing though is the smell is faint after washing so that is a plus!</li>
            <li>Okay, it weighs my hair down a little!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get the back of my hair to calm down as it has felt and stood out like a tumbleweed by using this product!</li>
            <li>size of the bottle isn&#x27;t anywhere near as big as the stuff you find at your local stores, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be.</li>
            <li>I spread the conditioner through my  hair, I only needed about a palm full for my hair that is way past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I usually wash my hair about 2x/wk and this line keeps it looking, smelling, and feeling fresh in between washes.</li>
            <li>Lately since the weather has finally just started getting warm, I have been getting into dead sea salt/mud everything.  </li>
            <li>But, I mean, it is not a bad smell, just not the floral/fruity scent of my fave shampoo</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and this conditioner paired with the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Nonetheless this conditioner really helped in making it less</li>
            <li>There are a few Shampoos and conditioners from Japan, and ONLY from Japan that I use SPARINGLY that have Mineral oil that don&#x27;t do this much damage!</li>
            <li>When I put it up in a pony tail, it is easy to remove the fabric band without my hair getting tangled or broken</li>
            <li>When I put it up in a pony tail, it is easy to remove the fabric band without my hair getting tangled or broken</li>
            <li>I just recently tried the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Conditioner for the first time.</li>
            <li>it is so dry, brittle and dull looking, after using this conditioner for just over a week I notice a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and my waves were not flat at all.</li>
            <li>it from within this deep conditioner is made with pure dead sea salt and minerals, chamomile, vitamin E and aloe vera.</li>

            <li> They smell great, work as well as they promise, and they’re a great value.</li>
            <li> but this made my hair look great.  </li>

            <li> I liked the scent of the shampoo, so that is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kind of reminded me of Tide.</li>
            <li> After I got out of the shower my hair was very shiny and smelled great!</li>
            <li> I have a nice lightweight bounce to my hair which I haven’t had in a while.</li>
            <li> I received it to review, and this is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not trying to spend $70-80 to wash my own damn hair.</li>
            <li> I liked how the product worked after about a week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the good results from more than 250 reviews about the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> Fairly effective at making hair softer though.</li>
            <li> great product, great price, fast ship</li>
            <li> It has a nice shine to it too.  </li>
            <li> It had a seal in the inside that you had to remove before using which I liked.  </li>
            <li> My hair always feels so nice when it dries after using.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I could easily run my fingers through my hair immediately after rinsing, which is always a good sign.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t me more in love with this stuff if I tried!</li>
            <li> I love to run my fingers through it and get that amazing smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair with a nice healthy shine.</li>
            <li> This thing smelled amazing and my hair literally looked and felt better then ever.  </li>
            <li> This has a pleasant, clean scent that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> I have always had a very fine textured hair.</li>
            <li> I smell it periodically, reassuring me that my hair still smells nice and clean!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the great aroma it has.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair easy to manage ,very soft and has a wonderful scent!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I liked how easy it was to spread throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell strong nor like chemicals but just has a pleasant clean scent.</li>
            <li> I really could not tell that this did anything great for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was just ok.</li>
            <li> Your hair will look much more hydrated, healthy and silky after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their hair is more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am highly impressed after using this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love how it has also helped with my dandruff</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine most people wanting to smell like chemical cleaners all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the more I used this</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t know that Israel and India also use &amp;#34;Mineral oil&amp;#34; in alot of their products as well as Brazil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars if the smell was better.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the fact that there&#x27;s a couple things I didn&#x27;t really like about it, the conditioner made my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> I like to focus on my ends since that&#x27;s where I have the most damage, and troublesome areas.</li>
            <li> I have already given my review on it, so be sure to look for my thoughts on that as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always loved the Dead Sea products but until now I have never found any that were an awesome price.  </li>
            <li> I was very easily able to run my brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> I probably will not use it every day, as the shampoo works great without it if I am not going to style my hair much.</li>
            <li> ( I throw it in a bun most days.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this deep conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> love some of the ingredients in the conditioner as well:&lt;br</li>
            <li> of these things I would never expect to be in here :)</li>
            <li> love this conditioner, i have been coloring my hair for over 20 years and</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll love it too.  </li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair has magically gotten softer, I do like how it works in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost gone again, which is probably my favorite part of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than some.</li>
            <li> works well for me  love the smell  will reorder</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo these guys have, but the conditioner can make my hair a bit itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure if it is the salt or</li>
            <li> The smell though will not stop me from buying more of this product</li>
            <li> His hair is looking so much better.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> My tresses felt divine and more than rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> This conditioner is definitely top drawer.</li>
            <li> Cetrimonium chloride is a salt often used in premium hair conditioners because it reduces static electricity and acts as a detangler.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I must say this is probably the best conditioner I have ever tried at home, and the leave in conditioner is no longer necessary.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Said allergic issues were mostly with leave on conditioners rather than rinse off like this one.  </li>
            <li> I liked that my hair was shiny, smooth and felt protected.</li>
            <li> OK this product came lightning fast!!!!  </li>
            <li> The smell is also extremely pleasant, very airy!</li>
            <li> then I flat ironed it and truly my hair was still looking awesome.  </li>
            <li> amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to rinse it off easily and my hair felt very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> just clean and nice.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this to review and love it!</li>
            <li> I use a fraction of the product that I would normally use and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I know some people love the smell of the products but for me it is a bit on the strong side</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely fragrance, just strong.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t do a very impressive job of moisturizing / conditioning my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> husband uses it more often than I do and loves it because it rinses easily and doesn&#x27;t cause any buildup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rate it as the &#x27;best&#x27; on really thick hair, but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo on it&#x27;s own, but can absolutely tell a difference when using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Adovia makes amazing products, that smell like products you would pay a lot more for from the spa, I highly recommend this brand.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> this great product fixed!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a light creamy formula, and it went on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair which tends not to be friends with most mass market conditioners.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when it came to brushing her hair because it was easy!</li>
            <li> My hair looks more smooth and silkier.</li>
            <li> it magically coated the hair leaving it moisturized and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I have drier hair, but I think cheap Dove conditioner does a better job.</li>
            <li> Truth is while God (and my credit card and husband) know that I have a draw full of inexpensive and luxury price makeup items, nonetheless when it comes to my hair and skincare, only the BEST touches those two places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It washes out easily and also leaves my hair smelling nice (like a fresh scent).</li>
            <li> I was even more excited.  </li>
            <li> It is easily prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> The bottle made it easy to squeeze to get the product out.</li>
            <li> so if strong smells give you a headache</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair with the slightest of odors, nothing so strong it draws the bee’s</li>
            <li> The scent is so strong that it gave me a headache after I used it for two days in a row.</li>
            <li> Scent is really really really strong.</li>
            <li> I needed something new because the shampoo I was using was not doing anything good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been lucky to be able to receive this product for free to review on my blog.</li>
            <li> but I see a huge difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> you are considering purchasing this, I would feel comfortable recommending that you try this and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> so I have been searching for an alternative free of harmful hormone disrupting ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I received this product for free, for testing purposes, in exchange of my review.</li>
            <li> Although the product was free, all opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing is that it has a light scent.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to try and review</li>
            <li> It washed out easily and my hair felt squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I figured since I was getting it for free, what did I have to lose.</li>
            <li> could tell my hair had conditioner in it just by the way it felt - smooth and silky with no tangles -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so utterly smooth and light.</li>
            <li> but I got this for free from Tomoson to test and review.</li>
            <li> I squeezed the bottle and noticed how smooth and non-greasy</li>
            <li> It rinsed out clean and easily.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star rating and do recommend it to anyone looking to revive their long lost beautiful hair again.</li>
            <li> It had some natural curl which was a good sign.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I tried this conditioner and loved it.</li>
            <li> What I loved the most was that it left my hair feeling silky!  </li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant clean scent that I enjoy, not overly perfumed like other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone looking for softer and more hydrated hair!</li>
            <li> Even the Balsam fragrance – a lovely light woodsy scent appropriate for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not all of the ingredients in Adovia Dead Sea Hair Conditioner are organic, those that aren’t have been certified as safe and effective by the Cosmetics Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a very strong perfume smell - too much for my taste.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the scent is amazing and leaves my hair smelling fresh and clean (not fruity or floral).</li>
            <li> This conditioner moisturizes my scalp and hair to a fair degree, but my scalp still seems to be a bit dry and my hair even more so.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed I did.</li>
            <li> I have now found them and I am so excited.  </li>
            <li> So we were excited for him to try it.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better, its so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Adore the clean smell, and it works to condition.</li>
            <li> but I also LOVE clean and fresh scents - and this smelled like clean linen and fresh air -</li>
            <li> and it smells so clean.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and smooth and gave it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh light floral fragrance that it awesome, not overwhelming but</li>
            <li> It is soft, manageable, and looks healthy and shiny!  </li>
            <li> It dispenses easily with no problem and has a lovely scent and texture to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to apply it the way I normally do.  </li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product (as well as Adovia&#x27;s other products) after a friend of mine told me how good they are, and I was able to find this at a promotional price in order to test it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too, a soft clean scent.</li>
            <li> Adovia has very high quality products - better than some salon products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Adovia has very high quality products - better than some salon products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this and after blow drying my hair</li>
            <li> I started using a better shampoo but hadn&#x27;t found a conditioner that really healed my hair like I needed.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I loved how this conditioner made my hair feel and look after using it only a couple of times.</li>

            <li> I had no bad experiences using Adovia Mineral Skincare Balsam Conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner feels good, it makes my hair easy to come and soft, but its not the most manliest of scents and it takes some getting used to initially.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner with the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, and I just LOVED it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You saw my daughter&#x27;s hair for yourself, but yes, in my case it most definitely looked hydrated and healthy, and it did feel silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is a natural and cruelty free product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick to use.  </li>
            <li> can find out all you need to know about the tremendous products at Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice-</li>
            <li> and so I was not surprised that I loved the Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> It felt so soft, clean, and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love finding new products to try when it comes to hair care also so when I was offered the opportunity to try out Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner</li>
            <li> I am very passionate about good quality hair and skincare products.  </li>
            <li> All in all I would say that if you are looking for something to hydrate and nourish your dry hair this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> The ingredients, overall were pretty good, although there were a couple that concerned</li>
            <li> The fragrance was a little overwhelming for me when I applied it but after rinsing, it was ok!</li>
            <li> Her hair gets so tangled its not even funny!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> My hair absorbs the product easily and leaves it soft, shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t girly, it&#x27;s a very natural, healthy smell, and I honestly can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a nice decent bottle that is very easy to hold in your hand while wet.</li>
            <li> Unlike the cheapo brands that are readily available, the Adovia conditioner doesn&#x27;t require much.</li>
            <li> it leaves it feeling really smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> It actually felt and smelled like a spa experience in my own shower.</li>
            <li> What you find below is my honest opinion after personally trying this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I got this product via a promotion however the opinions expressed above are my own.</li>

            <li> have been left with soft silky hair and it is a joy to touch.&lt;br</li>

            <li> think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> Again, I wish it were more natural...</li>
            <li> inclusion of cetrimonium chloride (29%) proves the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I normally use gobs of Pantene Classic Conditioner because my hair is fine and tends to tangle easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cetyl alcohol is an effective moisturizer that also protects the cuticles of hair by making them lie flat.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> they were right.  </li>
            <li> It seems to moisturizer the right amount.</li>
            <li> Unlike some conditioners, this one rinsed right out</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you exactly what kind of scent it is, but it is definitely not a chemical scent.</li>
            <li> After trying Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner  for the past two weeks I can honestly say that I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The Conditioner has a pleasant mild fresh scent- not overwhelming-</li>
            <li> it was pleasant) and left no heavy residue either.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this conditioner and the Dead Sea shampoo!</li>
            <li> like that it is animal cruelty free but even more so that it has so many natural ingredients and minerals that I feel safer using it on my children in a pinch than I would the million other kinds I could get at the store around here.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great because my hair is fine and thin and usually staticky and fly away.  </li>
            <li> I am dandruff free at the moment so this will be my new anti dandruff solution.</li>
            <li> first thing I did when this arrived to my house was use it right away...</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve received it to try, I can honestly say I have not had a single scalp blemish or worrisome bump to complain about.</li>
            <li> The silkiness level of my hair from Adovia Mineral Skin Care&#x27;s- Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner, IS PHENOMENAL AND WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this thick conditioner was pleasant and mild.</li>
            <li> have tried several off the shelf conditioners, my favorite of which is Infusium</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair soft and frizz free in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love Adovia&#x27;s other products, and was excited to get to try this.</li>
            <li> After I used it for the first time, for my surprise, my mind changed.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.</li>
            <li> This conditioner by Adovia works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> is my first time trying Adovia products on my hair</li>
            <li> conditioner arrived first in so I waited until my shampoo arrived to use it.</li>
            <li> , I wash first with my shampoo, rinse, then add the conditioner into my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and natural.</li>
            <li> I will probably keep trying different brands of shampoo and conditioner, but mostly because that is just what I do.</li>
            <li> The bottle says to shampoo first and then use the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It says to use a dime size amount, butI made sure that I used enough to cover every hair.</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk</li>
            <li> This Adovia conditioner has all the healthy benefits for your your hair so that is a big plus!</li>
            <li> But it does it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li> It helped make a big difference in my hair and in these more humid months, I needed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love using deep conditioner</li>
            <li> So I read up on the product first</li>
            <li> Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
            <li> I normally first shampoo and then re-condition my hair again.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair tangle free, soft and feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair first with shampoo and opened the conditioner to use it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves your hair feeling soft, supple and manageable while also smelling beautifully fresh!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it has a pretty strong perfume smell (the shampoo has the same scent).</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner does have a light scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner does have a light scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> So imagine my excitement when I had the incredible opportunity to try out the Dead Sea Salt Deep Conditioner as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One wash and my hair felt super soft and was really shiney!</li>
            <li> so I did have to use a bit more than recommended as I have long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back and forth over hair products, trying to find a good combination of enough moisture to stave off dryness and itching without being so much that it clogs my scalp or causes oiliness.</li>
            <li> I really loved pairing this with my Dead Sea Mud Shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I didn’t have to use very much, a little went a long way, which is incredible for conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it does not weigh my hair down, which is extremely important to me since my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft, voluminous and frizz</li>
            <li> The description says it will hydrate hair, in fact it did make my hair more dry.</li>
            <li> I guess I should start with the scent - which is better than anything I have ever smelled in my entire live.</li>
            <li> My hair was noticeably less frizzy and more calm, I guess you could say.</li>
            <li> And finally, my hair was super soft, tangle free and felt great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been one to use conditioner in my hair since it tends to weigh it down BUT, using this once a week; sometimes make makes my hair feel SO good!</li>
            <li> It was very tick and left my hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> the properties in the Dead Sea products are amazing.</li>
            <li> Plus the hair I do have is very &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> To me the product is very overrated.</li>
            <li> I was like: really?</li>
            <li> first I thought it was going to be just another normal conditioner that does nothing.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend these hair products!</li>
            <li> so I chose to cut my budget for a while by spending a whole dollar on a bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li> Her hair is very curly and mine is like a wave-curl.</li>
            <li> The conditioner really makes my hair shiny and hydrated.</li>
            <li> That was a bit too much</li>
            <li> I really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner  worked really well with my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has left my hair looking and feeling smooth and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the scent</li>
            <li> very well could, since it has a guarantee.</li>
            <li> It was really made my hair shiny and just felt like silk when I ran my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I immediately notice the scent, which is very fragrant, nourishing and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them.</li>
            <li> With the application of the Dead Sea Salt Conditioner, I purposely skipped this step because I wanted to see what the results of this conditioner were like all on its own.</li>
            <li> I actually have sensitive skin and allergies to many things but didn&#x27;t have a reaction this this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is a high quality product that is meant for dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> If you have and scalp condition or frequent scalp irritation, Adovia could be just the right answer.  </li>
            <li> I love it SO much, that I reached out to the seller to ask if they carried this scent in other products (like laundry soap, lotion, body wash, wax melts, etc).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other conditioners before that have made my hair more greasy looking</li>
            <li> recieved this product and was so so so excited to use it that I jumped in the shower about 30 minutes later and gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a clean and luxurious aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using both the conditioner and the dead sea shampoo together for the past week with great results!</li>
            <li> i have been getting compliments about it left and right!</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW, my new favorite conditioner BY FAR.</li>
            <li> That meant this conditioner was not weighing my hair down the way most of them do.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair so using a new bottle of conditioner paired up nicely with the ½ bottle of shampoo I had left</li>
            <li> That said, I really really tried to use the suggested amount, but probably did a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Almost like flowers:) it left my hair shiny and bouncy and not flat.</li>
            <li> far as actually conditioning, it&#x27;s really light</li>
            <li> My long, thick hair combed through beautifully without any effort, and after drying and styling my hair, it felt just like it does</li>
            <li> When your hair is dry it feels very soft and strong.</li>
            <li> I really loved the shampoo and suspected this would be a high quality conditioner since it also contained dead sea salt and was a deep hair conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first pic is flat unwashed hair and the second vavoom shine bounce and a silky soft feeling:)</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and no frizz and usually no tangles</li>
            <li> After the use of this treatment my scalp was not itching anymore I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> , fact is it is a high end product</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend their line of products.y of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend their line of products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with high hopes but it does not work well for my hair.</li>
            <li> ( I have pretty long hair that tangles easily, so that is a big deal for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> actually felt like my hair took a big drink of vitamins and just came out so healthy and soft!</li>
            <li> Instead my hair had a little bit more bounce and volume to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adovia&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner run about $20 per bottle which is a little more than I would like to spend, but my hair needs some TLC.</li>
            <li> that note – if you’re looking for a cute little gift basket or pick me up for a friend or family member, try the Adovia bar soap, shampoo, and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I went for a couple months without using conditioner because I started using shampoo that was more moisturizing, less stripping, and just plain better.</li>
            <li> it is 100% pure and genuine for an infusion of 21 minerals essential for proper skin and hair hydration.</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to try the Dead Sea Salt Conditioner!  </li>
            <li> They have made an amazing Dead Sea Mud shampoo and a Dead Sea Salt conditioner that work fabulously with textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this with just normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioner for both of</li>
            <li> Not sure why people love this product so much.  </li>
            <li> There were no frizzies like I normally get.</li>
            <li> like I normally do either.</li>
            <li> It is totally manageable and looks and feels so much better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was more than overjoyed to try out the hydrating and nourishing Dead Sea Mud</li>
            <li> It was not overpowering, and smelled as refreshing as the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not hard for either of us.</li>
            <li> but I do have dry hair more than occasionally and</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is so strong, it&#x27;s like walking into a laundromat or walking down the laundry soap isle at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> my itchy dry scalp gone, my lifeless hair with split ends gone, now my only trouble is my hair is so soft and beautiful</li>
            <li> you are in search for something new, give this conditioner a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> with Real Dead Sea Salt - 100% Pure and Genuine for an infusion of 21 Minerals Essential to Proper Skin and Hair Function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Hair Looking Hydrated, Healthy and Silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it is worth mentioning that I have really long hair, but it is not particularly thick.</li>
            <li> So when Adovia contacted Everything Beauty and Beyond to try out their Adovia Mineral Balsam Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner you know I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> The scent was light and fresh and the product itself was creamy but not too thick.</li>
            <li> I do tend to have dry hair sometimes and damaged hair because for awhile I was straightening my hair with a hot tool iron and it would damaged my hair and I&#x27;ve stopped doing that because I love my natural curly hair, so I leave this in my hair after massaging it all around my head/scalp and leave it in for about ten minutes and you can definitely feel the difference afterwards when you rinse off</li>
            <li> Hair feels very soft after.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s always a good thing since the aroma of a conditioner usually lasts even after you rinse and dry your hair.</li>
            <li> hair is soft, silky, and shiney!</li>
            <li> But with this conditioner it leaves it soft and flowing and shiny!</li>
            <li> First I received this at a low cost to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a very silky soft white conditioner and you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> Works the same way any other conditioner does but with much better results.</li>
            <li> and wow do I regret that!</li>
            <li> I didn’t shampoo my hair first because I don’t like to use shampoo daily.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft in my life!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong..</li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft and lively after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> My hair was less fly away and had less frizz the next morning.</li>
            <li> However,when blow drying it a few minutes later, my hair felt more straw-like than normal.</li>
            <li> Secondly, this conditioner rinsed off super well, without leaving a waxy feel behind like most conditioners.</li>
            <li> with real Dead Sea salt - 100% pure and genuine for an infusion of 21 minerals essential to proper skin and hair function&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair looking hydrated, healthy, and silky&lt;br /&gt;Helps to reduce the appearance of dandruff and dry flaky scalp</li>
            <li> Once that time as gone by, I will rinse my hair with cooler water, and do so until the water runs clear and no bubbles.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised in how well it performed</li>
            <li> So far Adovia products have worked for me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for soft and shiny-that is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Using it leaves my hair soft and manageable and also improved the breakage issues.  </li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t ready to write a review or recommend this conditioner as I wanted to see what regular use would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> My fault completely.</li>
            <li> In fact, it reminds me of natural scents I would smell outdoors.</li>
            <li> In fact, it reminds me of natural scents I would smell outdoors.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and while I know this is for hair it also touches the scalp</li>
            <li> However, that aside, I was a bit surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that needs plenty of moisture in order for it to &amp;#34;act right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> (come on you long haired ladies – you know exactly what I mean…always running out of conditioner well before shampoo)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, we have an 8 month old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised they would have these in this conditioner as these are preservatives that can cause allergic reactions and sometimes contact sensitivity.</li>
            <li> My hair felt instantly hydrated and really soaked up the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Mixed in with the healthy dead sea mud, olive oil, grape seed oil is Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, and Cocamide Dea.  </li>
            <li> Each ingredient in Adovia Dead Sea Conditioner was chosen for its specific properties and what it can do for healthy hair and scalps.</li>
            <li> I love Dead Sea Salt Deep hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like that the adovia conditioner has dead sea minerals at the top of the ingredients and also various oils.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job conditioning my thin hair</li>
            <li> It was easy to cover my hair with a small</li>
            <li> but given the way typical conditioners work on my hair, I figured better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> product, while hydrating and conditioning, is a little dry to spread, so I found myself having to use more than the &amp;#34;dime-sized&amp;#34; amount suggested.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other conditioner I have used at home has ever made my hair feel this soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I became a huge fan of Adovia products when I tried the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo!  </li>
            <li> The product really goes a long way</li>
            <li> have been using this along with the shampoo that Adovia offers in this line and have seen a real difference, especially with the heat and humidity outside.</li>
            <li> I recently tested out the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner and it is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy hair and this conditioner has helped me tame it!</li>
            <li> tend to have a very itching dry scalp and colored hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before: My hair is very curly and dry.</li>
            <li> really helps control my curly dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been at least six months since I have started using better hair products, not only Adovia, and my hair keeps</li>
            <li> It is made with Real Dead Sea Salt, which is 100% Pure and Genuine for an infusion of 21 Minerals Essential to Proper Skin and Hair Function.  </li>
            <li> Ill be buying more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely continue to use it because it has been working for me so far</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this natural product.</li>
            <li> My hair is left soft, hydrated, and as manageable as it gets.</li>
            <li> But it left my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I was surprised as I thought the bottle would be larger but thankfully, it didn&#x27;t take a ton of the conditioner to get the job done.</li>
            <li> They tend to take my hair which is already lifeless, and just add more weight on to it, making it look that much worse.</li>
            <li> As I was giving it a chance the more it is even worse.</li>
            <li> I used this for a whole week, left my hair dry and my scalp itchy and</li>
            <li> and right now I am using Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also, my scalp and hair didn&#x27;t feel dry like they normally feel after my hair dries.</li>
            <li> One good thing though is the smell is faint after washing so that is a plus!</li>
            <li> Okay, it weighs my hair down a little!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get the back of my hair to calm down as it has felt and stood out like a tumbleweed by using this product!</li>
            <li> size of the bottle isn&#x27;t anywhere near as big as the stuff you find at your local stores, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be.</li>
            <li> I spread the conditioner through my  hair, I only needed about a palm full for my hair that is way past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair about 2x/wk and this line keeps it looking, smelling, and feeling fresh in between washes.</li>
            <li> Lately since the weather has finally just started getting warm, I have been getting into dead sea salt/mud everything.  </li>
            <li> But, I mean, it is not a bad smell, just not the floral/fruity scent of my fave shampoo</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this conditioner paired with the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Nonetheless this conditioner really helped in making it less</li>
            <li> There are a few Shampoos and conditioners from Japan, and ONLY from Japan that I use SPARINGLY that have Mineral oil that don&#x27;t do this much damage!</li>
            <li> When I put it up in a pony tail, it is easy to remove the fabric band without my hair getting tangled or broken</li>
            <li> When I put it up in a pony tail, it is easy to remove the fabric band without my hair getting tangled or broken</li>
            <li> I just recently tried the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Conditioner for the first time.</li>
            <li> it is so dry, brittle and dull looking, after using this conditioner for just over a week I notice a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and my waves were not flat at all.</li>
            <li> it from within this deep conditioner is made with pure dead sea salt and minerals, chamomile, vitamin E and aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry, desert climate and it makes my hair and skin so dry, but this conditioner is the answer!</li>
            <li> it is so hard to keep your hair in top shape, now i have a little Adovia help and i wouldn&#x27;t trade that for the world!</li>
            <li> With only a dime-size amount was enough for my hair (15 inches long approx).</li>
            <li> it was pretty soft and not fly away.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this conditioner for anyone who is looking to use dead sea salt for their hair.  </li>
            <li> If you are familiar with other Adovia products, then you might have a idea of what I mean.</li>
            <li> On my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is less thick, it does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> people must of thought I was a hair &amp;#34;junkie&amp;#34; literally because I was sniffing my hair all day long and for the next two days.  </li>
            <li> My husband is using this Deep Conditioner for dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> the Aloe Vera in it deeply nourishes the scalp and hair it helps to reduce the appearance of Dandruff and Dry, Flaky Scalp.</li>
            <li> Normally I have pretty dull hair with very little sheen to it</li>
            <li> smell of the conditioner is a very natural, mineral, dead sea type of scent.</li>
            <li> The gray hair has a different texture and is very dry.  </li>
            <li> it smells like a high end product that you would pay a small fortune for</li>
            <li> I have thin and fine hair, and it does not build up or weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I like having soft silky hair, not the dry frizzy mess</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and very thick, yet I was able to condition all of it with less than half of what i&#x27;d use with the regular stuff</li>
            <li> Who knew my hair could be so silly smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I tend to go through it at least twice as fast as the shampoo, if not three times.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and haven&#x27;t been taking care of it was well as I should have.</li>
            <li> I massaged the conditioner into my scalp and then spread it throughout my long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioners her curls stayed soft and bouncy and when it was time to comb through them</li>
            <li> The chemical is diluted, but if someone asked if I would like a tiny bit of arsenic in my coffee, I would say no thanks.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (below my shoulder)</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if I am going to use my hair dryer or any other styling aids, I will definitely be adding conditioner to protect my hair and repair damage.</li>
            <li> Other than the one time, the only evidence that I had used conditioner was the softness and controllability of my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 2nd day hair (I wash my hair every other day because it is healthier for your hair and scalp)</li>
            <li> No better, no worse than other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried recently, though it is a little less expensive than most</li>
            <li> and I can smell it even after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling horribly dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I then air dry, and comb.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is so dry</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with dry damaged hair..</li>
            <li> It has reduced his dandruff and his dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to use dry shampoo</li>
            <li> conditioner claims to hydrate and replenish the health of your hair while reducing the appearance of dandruff, and a dry flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helps to Reduce the appearance of Dandruff and Dry, Flaky Scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> A lot of other conditioners I have used always leave it looking flat yet with this conditioner</li>
            <li> I have used sulfate-free products that were significantly higher in cost than this, and made no difference whatsoever, or made it worse.</li>
            <li> Sometimes deep conditioners weigh it down, but I have not had that experience with this product.</li>
            <li> but that I did not use hair conditioner on a regular basis as it weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> the shampoo, the conditioner leaves a light scent behind, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Usually deep conditioners come in a small bottle since you don’t use them as often and regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner shortened my blow dry time by about 5 minutes, not much</li>
            <li> Both of us tend to get very dry</li>
            <li> I was experiencing a very dry, flaky and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR WAS VERY DRY AFTER USING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> This little bottle packs a big punch.</li>
            <li> I went on vacation, I bought some little traditional travel shampoo and conditioner bottles.</li>
            <li> I normally apply a leave in conditioner to my hair as well since we have hard water and the extra conditioning usually helps my hair from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> Formulated for dry and damaged hair this conditioner also helps reduce the appearance of dandruff and dry, flaky scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found after using this treatment my hair was softer and less damaged .I</li>
            <li> At least this one has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> but this was not the case using Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner.</li>
            <li> So I had nothing to lose when I saw the opportunity to review the Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner, so</li>
            <li> I encourage you to try this Dead Sea Deep Hair Conditioner.</li>
            <li> The scent of the conditioner is similar to the Dead Sea Mud shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was looking for that, since I have only ever tried dead sea minerals on the face and hands</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Contains the following hair restructuring minerals which include:&lt;br /&gt;•Magnesium</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adovia uses isopropyl myristate because it helps the scalp absorb the nutrients, moisture, and medicinal properties of the carefully chosen ingredients in this formula.</li>
            <li> After years of straightening my thick curly hair, I&#x27;ve decided to go natural.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, it has a really strong smell that is unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have to wear boots to work when I&#x27;m not on my harley, I am not a pretty boy who has manicured nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this again because amazon ate the other, so Just to let you know it has been about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail this afternoon and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it because I have other Adovia products</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry for about a half hour and then blow dried until completely dry.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair after a few minutes like other conditioners - I can smell it when I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair and this bottle will last me quite awhile.</li>
            <li> My hair combed right through for the first time in maybe a year since we moved in to the worst well water house this side of the Mississippi!!!</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;d look down on my shoulders and see a couple specks.</li>
            <li> The Adovia conditioner doesn’t weigh my hair down – it looks shiny without being greasy</li>
            <li> No more dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It came with quite a bit in this bottle, I usually go through conditioner the quickest and with this one when they say a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very curious about this item as I have never tried dead sea salt for the hair anything.  </li>
            <li> But after using this conditioner they have less knots.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the amount to dime and a half.</li>
            <li> Plus, I may have a slight conditioner problem....</li>
            <li> Less of my hair is falling out</li>
            <li> The thing is that as light as it is, it will take over the scent of your shampoo :(</li>
            <li> have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea salt and mud are formulated with  lanolin, chamomile, papaya, and aloe vera to treat and nourish naturally, without harsh chemicals or unnecessary additives.</li>
            <li> The dry dull look is gone.</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud shampoo.</li>
            <li> In my opinion you do need to spend a little money on hair</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from the sun and over processing a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I dried it a bit with the towel I went to check on the mirror</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea is known for its therapeutic and detox properties.</li>
            <li> Hair loss can be prevented and treated through the use massaging Dead Sea salts into the scalp.</li>
            <li> I used the Dead Sea salt conditioner for the 1st time today along with the Dead Sea mud shampoo.</li>
            <li> But after a few uses I noticed it less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> couple of weeks ago I wrote a Product Review about Adovia’s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I had to wait until my hair dried to see what the result would be.</li>
            <li> He has been using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the Dead Sea Salt scare you, you won&#x27;t look like a swamp monster...</li>
            <li> I saw that they also had a dead sea mud shampoo with I</li>
            <li> This conditioner contains Dead Sea Minerals, chamomile extract, Vitamin E, olive oil, shea butter oil grapeseed oil, aloe vera and algae extract.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using the shampoo and conditioner and it seems to be helping her hair look less oily after a day, so we are liking that as she has been having trouble with oily hair this year!</li>
            <li> the bottle seems small, don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> Just apply it to your hair and slide your fingers through it, let it sit a few minutes and rinse!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance in the conditioner, and I&#x27;m not sure of the purpose of the fragrance, and usually stray away from items with fragrance altogether.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that it was pretty watery</li>
            <li> It is 7.4 fl oz, which is difficult to find in a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Why have not many people spoken about the scent of this stuff.</li>
            <li> we had very few</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have horrible well water where I live and my hair is dead and dry and literally feels like grass.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find both a shampoo and conditioner that work so well together to provide the assistance that my hair truly needs.</li>
            <li> I have horrible thin hair that I always put up in a pony tail because it&#x27;s always static and all over the place.</li>
            <li> At least, for me, it worked.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a secondary mask for my hair</li>
            <li> wanted to use the shampoo and conditioner together for at least 2 weeks before reviewing them.</li>
            <li> so my hair has been struggling through the post-partum stages lately.</li>
            <li> product is a made with real dead sea salt</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, so I&#x27;m picky about my conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I received this for reviewing purposes and was skeptical to what the Dead Sea minerals would smell like but to my surprise it smelled so aromatic.</li>
            <li> It is keeping my hair softer than normal and restoring a lot of the moisture I lost during the frigid winter.  </li>
            <li> the worse my hair</li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> It made the condition of my scalp worse.</li>
            <li> and I hate to have it down just because it is always in my way.</li>
            <li> Sadly, they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This item is a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> used expensive shampoo and conditioner before I had kids.</li>
            <li> Like I do with all beauty products, I twisted off the cap and smelled the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Twisted Mommy</li>
            <li> This was the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this hasn&#x27;t helped with my scalp psoriasis at all.</li>
            <li> My dry ends didn&#x27;t look horrible and my hair didn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I also color my hair, so needless to say my hair needs all the TLC it can get!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying this conditioner when the bad ingredients are taken out</li>
            <li> Although I like the way this conditioner works, I&#x27;m disappointed in the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> My girls get very bad knots.</li>
            <li> This one, the &amp;#34;Biosilk Hydrating&amp;#34; Set, Matrix &amp;#34;So Silver&amp;#34; shampoo are a couple of the WORST hair products I have used! &amp;#34;Fruitopia&amp;#34;&#x27;s Moisturising Acai set was HORRIBLE too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using it either because the smell is awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really could not tell that this did anything great for my hair.  It was just ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. I guess I should start with the scent - which is better than anything I have ever smelled in my entire live. I love it SO much, that I reached out to the seller to ask if they carried this scent in other products (like laundry soap, lotion, body wash, wax melts, etc). Sadly, they don&#x27;t. If they did, I&#x27;d work overtime just to have the fund to buy it in bulk! There&#x27;s just nothing like it. It&#x27;s such a clean and luxurious aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the bottle isn&#x27;t anywhere near as big as the stuff you find at your local stores, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be. A little goes a long way! Unlike the cheapo brands that are readily available, the Adovia conditioner doesn&#x27;t require much. My hair is very long and very thick, yet I was able to condition all of it with less than half of what i&#x27;d use with the regular stuff I buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, silky, and shiney! The best part?? The scent lasts all day! I couldn&#x27;t me more in love with this stuff if I tried!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product for your hair, it came in a timely manner .It was packaged perfect and was in perfect condition on it&#x27;s arrival .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a made with real dead sea salt it is 100% pure and genuine for an infusion of 21 minerals essential for proper skin and hair hydration. Aloe Vera deeply nourishes the scalp and hair .Hydrating it from within this deep conditioner is made with pure dead sea salt and minerals, chamomile, vitamin E and aloe vera.You will have Bbautifully shiny, silky and manageable hair can be yours again.Your hair will look much more hydrated, healthy and silky after using this conditioner. Formulated for dry and damaged hair this conditioner also helps reduce the appearance of dandruff and dry, flaky scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found after using this treatment my hair was softer and less damaged .I tend to have a very itching dry scalp and colored hair.After the use of this treatment my scalp was not itching anymore I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It actually felt like my hair took a big drink of vitamins and just came out so healthy and soft! My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years! And the scent is relaxing and beautiful. It actually felt and smelled like a spa experience in my own shower. I have horrible thin hair that I always put up in a pony tail because it&#x27;s always static and all over the place. But with this conditioner it leaves it soft and flowing and shiny! I love to run my fingers through it and get that amazing smell. I have to recommend this container! I could never go back to buying another bottle off of a store shelf!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this conditioner at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Please mark my review helpful if you found it to be.</li>
            <li> First I received this at a low cost to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick hair. Used this with just normal shampoo. Works well. Smells good. Even if your not a fan of the smell it goes away! I had to use extra to keep my hair from knotting. Its an every day kind of conditioner. I really liked it. Now to try and find the shampoo that goes with it to see if it works any better!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product (as well as Adovia&#x27;s other products) after a friend of mine told me how good they are, and I was able to find this at a promotional price in order to test it. What you find below is my honest opinion after personally trying this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;If the bottle seems small, don&#x27;t worry. A little goes a long way with this stuff. I use a fraction of the product that I would normally use and it does a great job. I do not have dandruff but I do have dry hair more than occasionally and this stuff is working.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell strong nor like chemicals but just has a pleasant clean scent. Also, it is worth mentioning that I have really long hair, but it is not particularly thick. Sometimes deep conditioners weigh it down, but I have not had that experience with this product. It tames the frizzies and makes my hair look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering purchasing this, I would feel comfortable recommending that you try this and see for yourself. I was pleasantly surprised in how well it performed and I think you will be as well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Leaves your hair with a nice healthy shine. Hair feels very soft after. I use it in my children&#x27;s hair. My girls get very bad knots. But after using this conditioner they have less knots. Their hair is more hydrated. The dry dull look is gone. Love this! Would recommend buying the shampoo to use with this conditioner. Both work amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am highly impressed after using this deep conditioner! Who knew my hair could be so silly smooth and shiny. I used it after a regular show and let it sit in my hair for 2 minutes then I washed it out to discover these awesome results. I love how it has also helped with my dandruff, I&#x27;ve always had dandruff since I was a kid and nothing has helped but I see a huge difference after using this product. I got this product via a promotion however the opinions expressed above are my own.</li>
            <li> *Edit* I used this for a whole week, left my hair dry and my scalp itchy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several off the shelf conditioners, my favorite of which is Infusium but it contains parabens so I have been searching for an alternative free of harmful hormone disrupting ingredients.  That search led me to Amazon and products that my local stores don&#x27;t carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so strong, it&#x27;s like walking into a laundromat or walking down the laundry soap isle at the grocery store.  I don&#x27;t mind scented products, but this overwhelms anything else and stays with you all day.  I can&#x27;t imagine most people wanting to smell like chemical cleaners all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as actually conditioning, it&#x27;s really light and my hair got frizzier and drier looking over the week that I used this.  I have straight hair and no frizz and usually no tangles but the more I used this the worse my hair became.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product and for 3x the price of off-the-shelf conditioners that work; I would stay away!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner.  My hair is damaged from the sun and over processing a few months ago.  I started using a better shampoo but hadn&#x27;t found a conditioner that really healed my hair like I needed.  I received this conditioner to test and its amazing.  My hair has never looked better, its so soft and healthy.  It also smells amazing.  Combine this with some argan oil and you will be good to good, with silky hair along for the ride.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair sort and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I have to wear boots to work when I&#x27;m not on my harley, I am not a pretty boy who has manicured nails. This stuff is great. Had an issue with dandruff, have always used head and shoulders but every now and then I&#x27;d look down on my shoulders and see a couple specks. Since I&#x27;ve started using this I have had 0 issues. The smell isn&#x27;t girly, it&#x27;s a very natural, healthy smell, and I honestly can&#x27;t get enough of it. I don&#x27;t exactly have a lot of hair so this bottle will last me a couple months. Plus the hair I do have is very &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;? Which the girlfriend doesn&#x27;t complain about, so I&#x27;m alright with it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them. This conditioner is a winner!</li>
            <li> I used this a total of 3 times and I found out it has &amp;#34;Mineral Oil&amp;#34; in it! I went to take this stuff off my hair and it just WREAKED HAVOC on it! This one, the &amp;#34;Biosilk Hydrating&amp;#34; Set, Matrix &amp;#34;So Silver&amp;#34; shampoo are a couple of the WORST hair products I have used! &amp;#34;Fruitopia&amp;#34;&#x27;s Moisturising Acai set was HORRIBLE too! There are a few Shampoos and conditioners from Japan, and ONLY from Japan that I use SPARINGLY that have Mineral oil that don&#x27;t do this much damage! I&#x27;m still trying to get the back of my hair to calm down as it has felt and stood out like a tumbleweed by using this product! Didn&#x27;t have this problem before use! Even when using Biosilk, Matrix and Fruiopia&#x27;s Acai set! I sold what was left at a Garage sale for .50 cents. Most people don&#x27;t know that Israel and India also use &amp;#34;Mineral oil&amp;#34; in alot of their products as well as Brazil. I have learned to ask sellers now if there is ANY Mineral Oil in the product before I buy! I gave one star for the GREAT SMELL!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a really great conditioner. I have color treated hair and I have 3 children so I don&#x27;t have alot of time or money for my hair. This conditioner made my hair soft and frizz free in about 3 minutes. I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars if the smell was better. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell just not one that I am fond of.</li>
            <li> So far Adovia products have worked for me. This Conditioner helps detangle my hair and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this conditioner and the Dead Sea shampoo! I usually wash my hair about 2x/wk and this line keeps it looking, smelling, and feeling fresh in between washes. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for softer and more hydrated hair!</li>
            <li> Adore the clean smell, and it works to condition.</li>
            <li> I love Adovia&#x27;s other products, and was excited to get to try this. I have really long hair and haven&#x27;t been taking care of it was well as I should have. I love the fact that this is a high quality product that is meant for dry or damaged hair. It made my hair smell amazing, and helped it feel a lot softer and smoother. I used it in conjunction with the mud shampoo, and you can see my review on that in my profile. Adovia makes amazing products, that smell like products you would pay a lot more for from the spa, I highly recommend this brand.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> First of all, I loved the scent of this wonderful hair conditioner. It has a fresh light floral fragrance that it awesome, not overwhelming but just right. I loved how this conditioner made my hair feel and look after using it only a couple of times. My hair looks more smooth and silkier. I&#x27;ve used other conditioners before that have made my hair more greasy looking but this was not the case using Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. To me the product is very overrated.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free, for testing purposes, in exchange of my review. Although the product was free, all opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never in my life had dandruff. As soon as I moved to California I started seeing it in my hair. I hated it. Even coming out of the shower, after washing my hair with dandruff shampoo you would notice it. I was like: really? I just washed my freaking hair! So I had nothing to lose when I saw the opportunity to review the Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner, so I applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was going to be just another normal conditioner that does nothing. After I used it for the first time, for my surprise, my mind changed. With only a dime-size amount was enough for my hair (15 inches long approx). As soon as I dried it a bit with the towel I went to check on the mirror and, woohoo, no dandruff visible! Also, my scalp and hair didn&#x27;t feel dry like they normally feel after my hair dries. Even my waves looked better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that it has a light scent. I cannot tell you exactly what kind of scent it is, but it is definitely not a chemical scent. The thing is that as light as it is, it will take over the scent of your shampoo :( But, I mean, it is not a bad smell, just not the floral/fruity scent of my fave shampoo haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use it because it has been working for me so far and I am glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing has worked for your dandruff problem I encourage you to try this Dead Sea Deep Hair Conditioner. At least, for me, it worked.</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo for a few weeks. I wash my hair about 1-2 times a week and have used this each time I shampoo my hair. The first thing I noticed about the conditioner was that is has an awesome scent! I like sweet smelling products but I also LOVE clean and fresh scents - and this smelled like clean linen and fresh air - and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair after a few minutes like other conditioners - I can smell it when I towel dry my hair and I can smell it even after my hair is dry. It is a very silky soft white conditioner and you don&#x27;t need much at all. Just apply it to your hair and slide your fingers through it, let it sit a few minutes and rinse! Works the same way any other conditioner does but with much better results. The Dead Sea is known for its therapeutic and detox properties. People have traveled to its shores to soak in the salty waters and apply the mud to their face, body, and hair. &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium. (Adovia) These minerals are known to treat, detoxify, and cleanse. Hair loss can be prevented and treated through the use massaging Dead Sea salts into the scalp.

            <li> I have really thick hair, so I&#x27;m picky about my conditioner.  This conditioner by Adovia works pretty well.  I wouldn&#x27;t rate it as the &#x27;best&#x27; on really thick hair, but it does a good job.  On my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is less thick, it does a fabulous job. I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance in the conditioner, and I&#x27;m not sure of the purpose of the fragrance, and usually stray away from items with fragrance altogether. Although I like the way this conditioner works, I&#x27;m disappointed in the ingredient list.  Mixed in with the healthy dead sea mud, olive oil, grape seed oil is Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, and Cocamide Dea.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying this conditioner when the bad ingredients are taken out the more awesome stuff is put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I LOVE what this conditioner did for my hair! My hair was feeling horribly dry and frizzy. I needed something new because the shampoo I was using was not doing anything good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying Adovia products on my hair and I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed I did. I have been using both the conditioner and the dead sea shampoo together for the past week with great results! My hair feels softer and looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner arrived first in so I waited until my shampoo arrived to use it. The first thing I noticed was that it has a pretty strong perfume smell (the shampoo has the same scent). I know some people love the smell of the products but for me it is a bit on the strong side so if strong smells give you a headache this may not be for you. When I squeezed some out I was a bit disappointed that it was pretty watery so I did have to use a bit more than recommended as I have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that there&#x27;s a couple things I didn&#x27;t really like about it, the conditioner made my hair feel great. This item is a bit on the expensive side so I would only purchase this when I feel like splurging a bit on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Such a nice lightweight conditioner that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair which tends not to be friends with most mass market conditioners. They tend to take my hair which is already lifeless, and just add more weight on to it, making it look that much worse. I found that using this conditioner did not give me those results. Instead my hair had a little bit more bounce and volume to it. I am the type of person who has to wash their hair daily, otherwise I just feel gross. I also color my hair, so needless to say my hair needs all the TLC it can get! This conditioner gives it just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this, I wash first with my shampoo, rinse, then add the conditioner into my hair. I like to focus on my ends since that&#x27;s where I have the most damage, and troublesome areas. I let it sit on my hair for a good 3-5 minutes. Once that time as gone by, I will rinse my hair with cooler water, and do so until the water runs clear and no bubbles. I then air dry, and comb. My hair is super soft, voluminous and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the conditioner is a very natural, mineral, dead sea type of scent. If you are familiar with other Adovia products, then you might have a idea of what I mean. It&#x27;s nothing offensive, but it also isn&#x27;t like the scents you will find at mass retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this along with the Adovia Dead Sea Shampoo, which I also highly recommend checking out! I have already given my review on it, so be sure to look for my thoughts on that as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the Dead Sea products but until now I have never found any that were an awesome price.  I have now found them and I am so excited.  I had already tested the shampoo and I loved it so when I got the chance to try out the conditioner I was even more excited.  The conditioner was wonderful.  It was very tick and left my hair silky and smooth.  It came with quite a bit in this bottle, I usually go through conditioner the quickest and with this one when they say a little goes a long way they were right.  I have very thick and long hair and this bottle will last me quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner with the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, and I just LOVED it! Firstly, the scent is amazing and leaves my hair smelling fresh and clean (not fruity or floral). Secondly, this conditioner rinsed off super well, without leaving a waxy feel behind like most conditioners.And finally, my hair was super soft, tangle free and felt great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend these hair products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this again because amazon ate the other, so Just to let you know it has been about 3 weeks now i have been using the conditioner and my hair is amazing i have been getting compliments about it left and right! i have been spreading the word to all of my friends and now to you! The scent is amazing it smells like a high end product that you would pay a small fortune for, fact is it is a high end product but you wont pay a fortune for! my itchy dry scalp gone, my lifeless hair with split ends gone, now my only trouble is my hair is so soft and beautiful i don&#x27;t want to wear my scarfs anymore and have to get an under cap so i don&#x27;t damage my hair this great product fixed! My hair just eats it up and being a red head it is so hard to keep your hair in top shape, now i have a little Adovia help and i wouldn&#x27;t trade that for the world! I was given this product free to try and review and like i say i wont give a good review just for anything so Like i say on my blog and i will here too  don&#x27;t take my word try it yourself what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> I used the Dead Sea salt conditioner for the 1st time today along with the Dead Sea mud shampoo. I received both as trials to give my review. The scent is light and natural. I always use about a quarter sized amount and that was all I needed. I leave it in while I shower for about 10 minutes. It washed out easily and my hair felt squeaky clean. However,when blow drying it a few minutes later, my hair felt more straw-like than normal. I was hoping for soft and shiny-that is why I gave it 4 stars. Overall, I like this natural product.</li>
            <li> I have been lucky to be able to receive this product for free to review on my blog. The scent of the conditioner is similar to the Dead Sea Mud shampoo. I liked the scent of the shampoo, so that is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the shampoo, the conditioner leaves a light scent behind, but not overwhelming. The conditioner is a light creamy formula, and it went on very smoothly. It was easy to cover my hair with a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to rinse it off easily and my hair felt very smooth afterwards. I was very easily able to run my brush through my hair. ( I have pretty long hair that tangles easily, so that is a big deal for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been left with soft silky hair and it is a joy to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with the conditioner- I probably will not use it every day, as the shampoo works great without it if I am not going to style my hair much. ( I throw it in a bun most days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I am going to use my hair dryer or any other styling aids, I will definitely be adding conditioner to protect my hair and repair damage.</li>
            <li> This little bottle packs a big punch. The directions say to use only a DIME sized amount and I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work. I normally use gobs of Pantene Classic Conditioner because my hair is fine and tends to tangle easily. I put the suggested amount in at it magically coated the hair leaving it moisturized and tangle free. When your hair is dry it feels very soft and strong. Because you only need a tiny bit, this bottle will last forever. The smell is a little strong..kind of reminded me of Tide. But after a few uses I noticed it less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Complimentary press sample received.</li>
            <li> I went for a couple months without using conditioner because I started using shampoo that was more moisturizing, less stripping, and just plain better. I realized that the shampoo makes all the difference and right now I am using Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo. Adding the Mineral Balsam Conditioner has been good. It seems to compliment the shampoo well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used expensive shampoo and conditioner before I had kids. It was amazing and I loved it. Now I stay home so I chose to cut my budget for a while by spending a whole dollar on a bottle of shampoo and wow do I regret that! In my opinion you do need to spend a little money on hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner run about $20 per bottle which is a little more than I would like to spend, but my hair needs some TLC. It&#x27;s been at least six months since I have started using better hair products, not only Adovia, and my hair keeps improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the Mineral Balsam Conditioner does not leave a film on my hair or body or make my hair feel or get greasy. It seems to moisturizer the right amount. I will probably keep trying different brands of shampoo and conditioner, but mostly because that is just what I do. I feel like I have to change it up.</li>
            <li> First impression: I was impressed by the size of the bottle. It is 7.4 fl oz, which is difficult to find in a deep conditioner. Usually deep conditioners come in a small bottle since you don’t use them as often and regular conditioner. Like I do with all beauty products, I twisted off the cap and smelled the conditioner. It has a musty smell, kind of like a deep cologne or perfume. I personally love the smell. It leaves an amazing scent on your hair for the rest of the day after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before: My hair is very curly and dry. Since my hair is so dry it’s gets tangled every time I wash and condition it. The bottle says to shampoo first and then use the conditioner. It directs you to leave the conditioner on your hair for 2 minutes. I didn’t shampoo my hair first because I don’t like to use shampoo daily. I massaged the conditioner into my scalp and then spread it throughout my long hair. It says to use a dime size amount, butI made sure that I used enough to cover every hair. I didn’t have to use very much, a little went a long way, which is incredible for conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After: By the time 2 minutes was up, I rinsed the conditioner out of my hair and boy was I happy! My hair felt amazing as I was rinsing it out! It felt so soft, clean, and smooth! After I got out of the shower my hair was very shiny and smelled great! My boyfriend even commented on how good my hair smelled. I am very happy with this deep conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review here: [...]</li>
            <li> My hair is left soft, hydrated, and as manageable as it gets. It does leave my hair with the slightest of odors, nothing so strong it draws the bee’s and mosquitoes when I go outside.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this to review and love it! I have fine, frizzy hair and this conditioner has helped me tame it! The fragrance was a little overwhelming for me when I applied it but after rinsing, it was ok! It&#x27;s a lovely fragrance, just strong. But it left my hair soft and silky. It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have always had a very fine textured hair. It is easily prone to breakage. After trying Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner  for the past two weeks I can honestly say that I am pleased with this product. It has a very pleasant clean scent that I enjoy, not overly perfumed like other conditioners. Using it leaves my hair soft and manageable and also improved the breakage issues.  I also noticed that it does not weigh my hair down, which is extremely important to me since my hair is so fine. A lot of other conditioners I have used always leave it looking flat yet with this conditioner I have a nice lightweight bounce to my hair which I haven’t had in a while. All in all I would say that if you are looking for something to hydrate and nourish your dry hair this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I received it to review, and this is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, while hydrating and conditioning, is a little dry to spread, so I found myself having to use more than the &amp;#34;dime-sized&amp;#34; amount suggested.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the results are fantastic. This conditioner leaves your hair feeling soft, supple and manageable while also smelling beautifully fresh! The scent is like that of a beautiful flower :)&lt;br /&gt;I love some of the ingredients in the conditioner as well:&lt;br /&gt;*Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;*Chamomile Extract&lt;br /&gt;*Dead Sea Minerals&lt;br /&gt;*Papaya Extract&lt;br /&gt;*Aloe Vera Gel&lt;br /&gt;*Grape Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;*Swee Almond Oil&lt;br /&gt;*Carrot Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;*Olive Oil&lt;br /&gt;*Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these things I would never expect to be in here :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is honestly a great product... the only thing I would change is the price tag! I do think it&#x27;s a tad bit expensive to use on a regular basis :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this conditioner! smells so good and works great!</li>
            <li> OK this product came lightning fast!!!!  2 days ship time and making me smile!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product and was so so so excited to use it that I jumped in the shower about 30 minutes later and gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have horrible well water where I live and my hair is dead and dry and literally feels like grass. I have been looking for a conditioner to soften and strengthen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked very very nicely. It smells nice too, a soft clean scent. It said to put a dime size amount in hair and let set for two minutes. My hair is below my shoulders so i increased the amount to 2 dime size dollops and waited about 5 minutes before rinsing and WOW WOW WOW, my new favorite conditioner BY FAR. My hair combed right through for the first time in maybe a year since we moved in to the worst well water house this side of the Mississippi!!! It dried much softer than it has since then as well. The smell didn&#x27;t linger in my hair(although it was pleasant) and left no heavy residue either. I give this product a 5 star rating and do recommend it to anyone looking to revive their long lost beautiful hair again. The silkiness level of my hair from Adovia Mineral Skin Care&#x27;s- Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner, IS PHENOMENAL AND WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!!</li>
            <li> This is great conditioner for irritated scalp. I have thin and fine hair, and it does not build up or weigh my hair down. It has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial. &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP5243e260d7bb7fab383896d8d77166f3&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner, i have been coloring my hair for over 20 years and it is so dry, brittle and dull looking, after using this conditioner for just over a week I notice a huge difference in my hair.  It is soft, manageable, and looks healthy and shiny!  I would recommend this to anyone with dry damaged hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM5243e260d7bb7fab383896d8d77166f3&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I am always on the look out for quality hair care products that are good for textured hair. I have gone through so many different shampoos and conditioners all claiming to smooth, hydrate, nourish, blah blah blah. I have heard of some that &amp;#34;really work&amp;#34; but to pay the prices they want I may as well go to the salon. I am not trying to spend $70-80 to wash my own damn hair. Uh uh...no way! Well, the Adovia folks seem to feel the same way I do! They have made an amazing Dead Sea Mud shampoo and a Dead Sea Salt conditioner that work fabulously with textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I are both mixed. Her hair is very curly and mine is like a wave-curl. Both of us tend to get very dry and although you can always run your fingers through our hair, sometimes it looks like a sheep&#x27;s butt. Not attractive. I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioner for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioners her curls stayed soft and bouncy and when it was time to comb through them we had very few tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my comparison from what Adovia says and what I experienced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: Adovia Says:&lt;br /&gt;Made with real Dead Sea salt - 100% pure and genuine for an infusion of 21 minerals essential to proper skin and hair function&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair looking hydrated, healthy, and silky&lt;br /&gt;Helps to reduce the appearance of dandruff and dry flaky scalp&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera deeply nourishes the scalp and hair - hydrating it from within&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: Twisted Mommy Says:&lt;br /&gt;Again, I trust what they say is in it, is in it.&lt;br /&gt;You saw my daughter&#x27;s hair for yourself, but yes, in my case it most definitely looked hydrated and healthy, and it did feel silky.&lt;br /&gt;No dandruff, no flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found my shampoo and conditioner. I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk this shampoo and conditioner combo is DEFINITELY for you! Now I need Adovia to make a detangler, a leave in conditioner, and a daily moisturizer and I will be a seriously happy mom with an even happier curly kid who no longer goes through ouchies when its time to get her hair washed.LY for you! Now I need Adovia to make a detangler, a leave in conditioner, and a daily moisturizer and I will be a seriously happy mom with an even happier curly kid who no longer goes through ouchies when its time to get her hair washed.</li>
            <li> This was the wrong product.  Had to return it.  Your return policy is excellent and I thank you for the ease with which it works.</li>
            <li> After years of straightening my thick curly hair, I&#x27;ve decided to go natural.  Problem is my hair would not curl as before.  I had high hopes for this product and I was not disappointed!  My hair absorbs the product easily and leaves it soft, shiny and frizz free.  I&#x27;ve found my go to conditioner and you&#x27;ll love it too.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend using any product containing methylchloroisothiazolinone. It is corrosive, and linked to neuronal damage. The chemical is diluted, but if someone asked if I would like a tiny bit of arsenic in my coffee, I would say no thanks. There are safer options out there. As for its performance as a conditioner, I don&#x27;t know. When I saw the ingredient methylchloroisothiazolinone, I threw the product in the trash.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this hasn&#x27;t helped with my scalp psoriasis at all. I don&#x27;t like using it either because the smell is awful. It sticks with my hair and I end up smelling it all day...</li>
            <li> I already tried the Face Mask and the Soap and the Shampoo and so I was not surprised that I loved the Conditioner as well. The Conditioner has a pleasant mild fresh scent- not overwhelming- just clean and nice. The conditioner really makes my hair shiny and hydrated. I am dandruff free at the moment so this will be my new anti dandruff solution. I love that it is a natural and cruelty free product. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago I wrote a Product Review about Adovia’s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo. I mentioned then that there was a #hairconditioner that went along with the shampoo but that I did not use hair conditioner on a regular basis as it weighed my hair down. Then I was given the opportunity to try the Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner. I figured since I was getting it for free, what did I have to lose. I really loved the shampoo and suspected this would be a high quality conditioner since it also contained dead sea salt and was a deep hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the back of the bottle say to use a dime sized amount. I have long hair (below my shoulder) so that wasn&#x27;t quite enough. I adjusted the amount to dime and a half. I wondered as I was rubbing it into my hair if that would be enough or not but given the way typical conditioners work on my hair, I figured better safe than sorry. I waited two minutes and then rinsed the conditioner out of my hair. Unlike some conditioners, this one rinsed right out so there was no slimy residue left to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tell my hair had conditioner in it just by the way it felt - smooth and silky with no tangles - but I had to wait until my hair dried to see what the result would be. My hair was less fly away and had less frizz the next morning. It had some natural curl which was a good sign. That meant this conditioner was not weighing my hair down the way most of them do. I still wasn&#x27;t ready to write a review or recommend this conditioner as I wanted to see what regular use would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next week I washed and conditioned my hair nightly. I even used a double dime size amount one night just to see what would happen. That was a bit too much and I could tell my hair had conditioner in it. My fault completely. Other than the one time, the only evidence that I had used conditioner was the softness and controllability of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner does have a light scent that is quite pleasant. It does not bother my allergies at all. In fact, it reminds me of natural scents I would smell outdoors. I really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels soft, looks shiny and healthy plus has bounce. When I put it up in a pony tail, it is easy to remove the fabric band without my hair getting tangled or broken which was a problem before using this conditioner. Adovia has very high quality products - better than some salon products I have tried. I highly recommend their line of products.y of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner does have a light scent that is quite pleasant.

            <li> I like having soft silky hair, not the dry frizzy mess I wake up to every morning. This conditioner  worked really well with my hair and skin. It did not irritate and it got the job done. While I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair has magically gotten softer, I do like how it works in my hair. My skin is really sensitive and while I know this is for hair it also touches the scalp and it didn&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in search for something new, give this conditioner a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job conditioning my thin hair</li>
            <li> The scent is so strong that it gave me a headache after I used it for two days in a row.</li>
            <li> Not sure why people love this product so much.  It did not condition my hair well.  I have drier hair, but I think cheap Dove conditioner does a better job.</li>
            <li> I love shampoos and conditioners! I love finding new products to try when it comes to hair care also so when I was offered the opportunity to try out Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner I was all for it. When it came I used it as directed: Apply after shampoo, leave 1 minute, rinse. I have thick hair and I hate to have it down just because it is always in my way. I have to say it did make my hair feel smoother and softer. The scent was light and fresh and the product itself was creamy but not too thick. I liked how the product worked after about a week. My hair was noticeably less frizzy and more calm, I guess you could say. I will continue to use and purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can order your bottle from Amazon and let me know what you think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

            <li> I previously reviewed Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud shampoo. Now I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try the accompanying conditioner. I liked the shampoo on it&#x27;s own, but can absolutely tell a difference when using the conditioner. Plus, I may have a slight conditioner problem.... I tend to go through it at least twice as fast as the shampoo, if not three times. That said, I really really tried to use the suggested amount, but probably did a little bit more. The conditioner has left my hair looking and feeling smooth and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went on vacation, I bought some little traditional travel shampoo and conditioner bottles. And I got that flaking back on my scalp by the time I came home. It&#x27;s almost gone again, which is probably my favorite part of this shampoo and conditioner. Again, I wish it were more natural...but it&#x27;s better than some.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful smelling and beneficial conditioner! I received this for reviewing purposes and was skeptical to what the Dead Sea minerals would smell like but to my surprise it smelled so aromatic. Almost like flowers:) it left my hair shiny and bouncy and not flat. I have wavy hair and my waves were not flat at all. Here is my before and after picture. The first pic is flat unwashed hair and the second vavoom shine bounce and a silky soft feeling:) This Adovia conditioner has all the healthy benefits for your your hair so that is a big plus!</li>
            <li> No better, no worse than other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried recently, though it is a little less expensive than most</li>
            <li> My hair is the same. I see/feel no difference. It doesn&#x27;t even help detangle. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the good results from more than 250 reviews about the effectiveness of this product. I was experiencing a very dry, flaky and itchy scalp. I was hoping for a relief but it came out a disaster. It made the condition of my scalp worse. As I was giving it a chance the more it is even worse. So I gave up and called customer service for the return of this product. I got my money back.</li>
            <li> Why have not many people spoken about the scent of this stuff. It&#x27;s like they dropped an ENTIRE bottle of perfume in this tiny conditioner bottle. However, that aside, I was a bit surprised by this product. Still not the at home deep conditioner I&#x27;m looking for. But it does it&#x27;s job pretty well. I thought it dried out my hair, but when my hair dried it was silky smooth. Scent is really really really strong.</li>
            <li> really helps control my curly dry hair.  saw a difference at once.  its great stuff</li>
            <li> works well for me  love the smell  will reorder</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo these guys have, but the conditioner can make my hair a bit itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it is the salt or what. Fairly effective at making hair softer though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing to your hair! One wash and my hair felt super soft and was really shiney! I used it on my daughters hair too. Her hair gets so tangled its not even funny! I was really excited when it came to brushing her hair because it was easy! Was not hard for either of us. One thing I do not like about this product is the smell. When you smell it from the bottle its ehh. One good thing though is the smell is faint after washing so that is a plus! The smell though will not stop me from buying more of this product I was able to test! Ill be buying more!</li>
            <li> great product, great price, fast ship</li>
            <li> Helps with psoriasis symptoms</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I just love how my hair feels and helping my damaged hair! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Okay, it weighs my hair down a little!</li>
            <li> My husband is using this Deep Conditioner for dry and damaged hair.  He has all gray hair.  The gray hair has a different texture and is very dry.  He also has dandruff. So we were excited for him to try it.  He has been using it for a few days.  He washes his hair every two days.  His hair is looking so much better.  No more dry hair.  It has so much more body to it and looks so much healier.  It has a nice shine to it too.  It has reduced his dandruff and his dry scalp.  It&#x27;s quick to use.  He only has to leave it on for one minute. That he likes.  It&#x27;s very affordable.  I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the scent and it doesn&#x27;t do a very impressive job of moisturizing / conditioning my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner because it helps moisturize without being greasy.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft in my life! There were no frizzies like I normally get. My 2nd day hair (I wash my hair every other day because it is healthier for your hair and scalp) did not feel or look greasy. I didn&#x27;t even have to use dry shampoo like I normally do either. To see my full review visit my blog at [...]</li>
            <li> I have tried many products from this company and been impressed so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I tried this conditioner and loved it. My hair honestly feels so soft after using this conditioner. It is totally manageable and looks and feels so much better than it has in a long time. I live in a dry, desert climate and it makes my hair and skin so dry, but this conditioner is the answer! It washes out easily and also leaves my hair smelling nice (like a fresh scent). Don&#x27;t let the Dead Sea Salt scare you, you won&#x27;t look like a swamp monster...the properties in the Dead Sea products are amazing. You will NOT regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I would recommend for sure! Great price, amazing quality. It helped make a big difference in my hair and in these more humid months, I needed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review here:  [...]</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product. It lasts in your hair throughout the entire day. I smell it periodically, reassuring me that my hair still smells nice and clean! Makes hair feel noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back and forth over hair products, trying to find a good combination of enough moisture to stave off dryness and itching without being so much that it clogs my scalp or causes oiliness. I have used sulfate-free products that were significantly higher in cost than this, and made no difference whatsoever, or made it worse. At least this one has natural ingredients. It has done well to have no ill-effects that I was dealing with before. Since I&#x27;ve received it to try, I can honestly say I have not had a single scalp blemish or worrisome bump to complain about. Which  I very well could, since it has a guarantee. I was looking for that, since I have only ever tried dead sea minerals on the face and hands but I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it more often than I do and loves it because it rinses easily and doesn&#x27;t cause any buildup.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is animal cruelty free but even more so that it has so many natural ingredients and minerals that I feel safer using it on my children in a pinch than I would the million other kinds I could get at the store around here.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this conditioner paired with the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I was more than overjoyed to try out the hydrating and nourishing Dead Sea Mud Shampoo(See&lt;br /&gt;Here)- So imagine my excitement when I had the incredible opportunity to try out the Dead Sea Salt Deep Conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dead Sea Salt Contains the following hair restructuring minerals which include:&lt;br /&gt;•Magnesium&lt;br /&gt;•Calcium&lt;br /&gt;•Sulfur&lt;br /&gt;•Bromide&lt;br /&gt;•Iodine&lt;br /&gt;•Sodium&lt;br /&gt;•Zinc&lt;br /&gt;•Potassium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner claims to hydrate and replenish the health of your hair while reducing the appearance of dandruff, and a dry flaky scalp. I put a dollop in my hand and rubbed it in.. I could actually feel my hair exhale and allow the conditioner to penetrate my locks. I have naturally curly hair that needs plenty of moisture in order for it to &amp;#34;act right&amp;#34;. I let it set for awhile and then rinsed. I could easily run my fingers through my hair immediately after rinsing, which is always a good sign. The fragrance of this thick conditioner was pleasant and mild. It was not overpowering, and smelled as refreshing as the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I loved this pairing as a strategy to combat my curly mane. It is hard for me to find both a shampoo and conditioner that work so well together to provide the assistance that my hair truly needs. My tresses felt divine and more than rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find out all you need to know about the tremendous products at Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice- This is the 3rd product I have tried and I am elated with the outcome of each:&lt;br /&gt;•Dead Sea Mud Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;•Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;•Dead Sea Mud Soap</li>
            <li> I love using deep conditioner it&#x27;s like a secondary mask for my hair it leaves it feeling really smooth and gentle. I do tend to have dry hair sometimes and damaged hair because for awhile I was straightening my hair with a hot tool iron and it would damaged my hair and I&#x27;ve stopped doing that because I love my natural curly hair, so I leave this in my hair after massaging it all around my head/scalp and leave it in for about ten minutes and you can definitely feel the difference afterwards when you rinse off it&#x27;s so utterly smooth and light.</li>
            <li> Lately since the weather has finally just started getting warm, I have been getting into dead sea salt/mud everything.  So when Adovia contacted Everything Beauty and Beyond to try out their Adovia Mineral Balsam Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner you know I was thrilled.  I am very passionate about good quality hair and skincare products.  Truth is while God (and my credit card and husband) know that I have a draw full of inexpensive and luxury price makeup items, nonetheless when it comes to my hair and skincare, only the BEST touches those two places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very curious about this item as I have never tried dead sea salt for the hair anything.  So I read up on the product first like I always do.  According to their item description this product is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made with Real Dead Sea Salt - 100% Pure and Genuine for an infusion of 21 Minerals Essential to Proper Skin and Hair Function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Hair Looking Hydrated, Healthy and Silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps to Reduce the appearance of Dandruff and Dry, Flaky Scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Deeply Nourishes the Scalp and Hair - Hydrating it from Within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome SOLD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first thing I did when this arrived to my house was use it right away...of course.  The product comes in a nice decent bottle that is very easy to hold in your hand while wet. It had a seal in the inside that you had to remove before using which I liked.  It dispenses easily with no problem and has a lovely scent and texture to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to apply it the way I normally do.  I put it in my hair the night before and slept on it.  I then woke up the next day, showered and washed it out of my hair. I normally first shampoo and then re-condition my hair again.  The product really goes a long way so you don&#x27;t need tons of this conditioner in hand inorder to get it through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell you, people must of thought I was a hair &amp;#34;junkie&amp;#34; literally because I was sniffing my hair all day long and for the next two days.  This thing smelled amazing and my hair literally looked and felt better then ever.  I have to say I was completely impressed.  It was really made my hair shiny and just felt like silk when I ran my fingers through it.  I let my hair air dry then I flat ironed it and truly my hair was still looking awesome.  My dry ends didn&#x27;t look horrible and my hair didn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.  I have dandruff that I get every time I have a baby and normally last about a year.  My last baby was born eight months ago and I am still dealing with this issues.  Nonetheless this conditioner really helped in making it less flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this conditioner for anyone who is looking to use dead sea salt for their hair.  I saw that they also had a dead sea mud shampoo with I am itchy try! I will probably buy it soon!</li>
            <li> This product is great! The smell is very light and pleasant, nothing over-powering. It leaves your hair tangle free, soft and feeling hydrated. My husband has been using the product as well! Will definitely consider getting this again when it runs out!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this conditioner from Tomoson to review!!  My daughter has been using the shampoo and conditioner and it seems to be helping her hair look less oily after a day, so we are liking that as she has been having trouble with oily hair this year!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is definitely top drawer. If you have and scalp condition or frequent scalp irritation, Adovia could be just the right answer.  Dead Sea salt and mud are formulated with  lanolin, chamomile, papaya, and aloe vera to treat and nourish naturally, without harsh chemicals or unnecessary additives. Each ingredient in Adovia Dead Sea Conditioner was chosen for its specific properties and what it can do for healthy hair and scalps. Even the Balsam fragrance – a lovely light woodsy scent appropriate for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not all of the ingredients in Adovia Dead Sea Hair Conditioner are organic, those that aren’t have been certified as safe and effective by the Cosmetics Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inclusion of cetrimonium chloride (29%) proves the quality of this product. Cetrimonium chloride is a salt often used in premium hair conditioners because it reduces static electricity and acts as a detangler. The bonus is that  it also has antimicrobial and antiseptic properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl alcohol is an effective moisturizer that also protects the cuticles of hair by making them lie flat. It helps hair retain moisture and resist stripping and in doing so leaves hair shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia uses isopropyl myristate because it helps the scalp absorb the nutrients, moisture, and medicinal properties of the carefully chosen ingredients in this formula. To put it simply, isopropyl myristate helps the good stuff work evenbetter.</li>
            <li> I love Dead Sea Salt Deep hair conditioner. My hair always feels so nice when it dries after using. I&#x27;ve never really been one to use conditioner in my hair since it tends to weigh it down BUT, using this once a week; sometimes make makes my hair feel SO good! i love it.</li>
            <li> I recently tested out the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner and it is fabulous!  It is made with Real Dead Sea Salt, which is 100% Pure and Genuine for an infusion of 21 Minerals Essential to Proper Skin and Hair Function.  What I loved the most was that it left my hair feeling silky!  I know it is keeping it healthy and hydrated but can&#x27;t get over how wonderful it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the Aloe Vera in it deeply nourishes the scalp and hair it helps to reduce the appearance of Dandruff and Dry, Flaky Scalp. Dead Sea Salt contains more than 21 skin and hair rebuilding minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this along with the shampoo that Adovia offers in this line and have seen a real difference, especially with the heat and humidity outside. It is keeping my hair softer than normal and restoring a lot of the moisture I lost during the frigid winter.  The smell is also extremely pleasant, very airy! This is truly a salon quality product, without the salon pricetag!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  It seems to condition well and it smells so clean.  I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I just recently tried the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Conditioner for the first time. The first thing I noticed was the great aroma it has. That&#x27;s always a good thing since the aroma of a conditioner usually lasts even after you rinse and dry your hair. I normally apply a leave in conditioner to my hair as well since we have hard water and the extra conditioning usually helps my hair from getting frizzy. With the application of the Dead Sea Salt Conditioner, I purposely skipped this step because I wanted to see what the results of this conditioner were like all on its own. I must say this is probably the best conditioner I have ever tried at home, and the leave in conditioner is no longer necessary. My long, thick hair combed through beautifully without any effort, and after drying and styling my hair, it felt just like it does when I come home from the salon, not to mention how great it smelled. No other conditioner I have used at home has ever made my hair feel this soft and silky. I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I tried the Adovia shampoo first and was quite impressed (I believe I gave it 5 stars). I then tried out their soap and was blown away by how great the lather and smell were. It only made sense to try the conditioner as well. I have long curly hair so using a new bottle of conditioner paired up nicely with the ½ bottle of shampoo I had left (come on you long haired ladies – you know exactly what I mean…always running out of conditioner well before shampoo)!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use the shampoo and conditioner together for at least 2 weeks before reviewing them. Keep in mind, we have an 8 month old so my hair has been struggling through the post-partum stages lately. After 2 weeks I can say with certainty:&lt;br /&gt;• Less of my hair is falling out&lt;br /&gt;• My hair feels healthier and thicker&lt;br /&gt;• I have fewer fly aways when I put my hair in a pony tail or bun&lt;br /&gt;• I love the smell&lt;br /&gt;• The Adovia conditioner doesn’t weigh my hair down – it looks shiny without being greasy&lt;br /&gt;On that note – if you’re looking for a cute little gift basket or pick me up for a friend or family member, try the Adovia bar soap, shampoo, and conditioner. They smell great, work as well as they promise, and they’re a great value. It’s a way to bring a spa day to a friend!</li>
            <li> I became a huge fan of Adovia products when I tried the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo!  So I was super excited to try the Dead Sea Salt Conditioner!  I loved it!  It made my hair soft and smooth and gave it a nice shine. Normally I have pretty dull hair with very little sheen to it but this made my hair look great.  I really loved pairing this with my Dead Sea Mud Shampoo!  Its a great combo.  You can read my full review here  [...]</li>
            <li> The conditioner feels good, it makes my hair easy to come and soft, but its not the most manliest of scents and it takes some getting used to initially. However, the smell does not linger so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem</li>
            <li> The description says it will hydrate hair, in fact it did make my hair more dry. I am too dissatisfied. How can I have my money back?</li>
            <li> MY HAIR WAS VERY DRY AFTER USING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail this afternoon and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it because I have other Adovia products and I&#x27;ve been a happy camper.  This came well packaged to prevent leakage. I used my regular organic shampoo and then conditioned my hair.  This has a pleasant, clean scent that is not over powering. I was surprised as I thought the bottle would be larger but thankfully, it didn&#x27;t take a ton of the conditioner to get the job done. The ingredients, overall were pretty good, although there were a couple that concerned me listed at the bottom of the ingredient list.  These ingredients are Methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone. I&#x27;m actually surprised they would have these in this conditioner as these are preservatives that can cause allergic reactions and sometimes contact sensitivity. Said allergic issues were mostly with leave on conditioners rather than rinse off like this one.  I actually have sensitive skin and allergies to many things but didn&#x27;t have a reaction this this conditioner. I like that the adovia conditioner has dead sea minerals at the top of the ingredients and also various oils. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this and after blow drying my hair it was pretty soft and not fly away. That&#x27;s great because my hair is fine and thin and usually staticky and fly away.  2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> works great!  I can feel the softness.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with high hopes but it does not work well for my hair. It did not function as a deep conditioner and I did not feel any noticeable improvement in the condition of my hair. Additionally, it has a really strong smell that is unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair and I am always looking for a good moisturizing conditioner. I found Adovia Mineral Skincare Balsam Conditioner on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It is $19 for a 7.4oz. bottle but I got this for free from Tomoson to test and review. This conditioner contains Dead Sea Minerals, chamomile extract, Vitamin E, olive oil, shea butter oil grapeseed oil, aloe vera and algae extract. It is supposed to protect hair with essential oils while infusing it with  moisture and herbal extracts. It is for use on all hair types. This product is made in Israel. I washed my hair first with shampoo and opened the conditioner to use it. I immediately notice the scent, which is very fragrant, nourishing and luxurious. I squeezed the bottle and noticed how smooth and non-greasy the conditioner is. The bottle made it easy to squeeze to get the product out. I spread the conditioner through my  hair, I only needed about a palm full for my hair that is way past my shoulders. I liked how easy it was to spread throughout my hair. My hair felt instantly hydrated and really soaked up the conditioner. I left it on my hair for about 2 minutes to give it time to work. It rinsed out clean and easily. It left no residue at all. My hair felt so soft and lively after rinsing it out. I let my hair dry for about a half hour and then blow dried until completely dry. This conditioner shortened my blow dry time by about 5 minutes, not much but it is a difference. My hair was easier to style, stayed manageable and hydrated and the scent lingered all day which was a bonus. I liked that my hair was shiny, smooth and felt protected. My hands and body were even softer after using in the shower. I had no bad experiences using Adovia Mineral Skincare Balsam Conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner moisturizes my scalp and hair to a fair degree, but my scalp still seems to be a bit dry and my hair even more so.  It also has a very strong perfume smell - too much for my taste.</li>
