            <li>My dermatologist started me on this skin cream over a year ago and, at age 64, I can honestly say that I now have the best skin of my life!  </li>

            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>this product s remarkable...</li>
            <li>The good brands like Neocutis and NuNutrients use plant based derivatives to stimulate skin stem cell growth / protection of existing stem cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchase it through my dermatologist because I know that it is good and not expired or sat in a sales reps car for awhile....</li>
            <li>Good seller</li>
            <li>would recommend it to a friend because I have had good luck with it.  </li>
            <li>good product.  </li>
            <li>good packaging.</li>
            <li>I trust the company to make a good product.  </li>
            <li>It is so good because contains somebody else skin in it.</li>
            <li>With my mild Rosacea,  this cream has worked out the best.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, very smooth.</li>
            <li>Am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Very pleased  with my purchase</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>So keep lathering it on people, your supporting a great company!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this company!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>and she is so appreciative that I told her about this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product was AMAZING</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and (hoping this is not my imagination)</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the skinny from my research, but please do your own.</li>
            <li>so I have no way to say it is effective.</li>
            <li>smooth and grease free - best of all it keeps me rosacea and sunburn</li>
            <li>However she didn&#x27;t pass the products of conception on her own and had to have a D&amp;C.  </li>
            <li>It is not a miracle worker, but it does have a nice texture &amp; no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very healing, perfect amount of moisture.  </li>
            <li>I use their eye cream which I have found to be very effective in reducing fine lines.</li>
            <li>This product feels wonderful and really quenches my skin as well as performing all of the magic of anti-aging in the process.  </li>
            <li>recommendation is to try both and see which one is better suited for your needs, if you can get away with using a cheaper product then more power to you!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have something that can go on my skin on top of the tretinoin and reduce the peeling.</li>
            <li>This is a controversial product since it uses PSP stem cells.  </li>
            <li>It Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the reviews say and for the money I thought it would be more effective.</li>
            <li>BioCream is by far one of the best anti-aging moisturizers out there...</li>
            <li>Love love love this cream!</li>
            <li>After I ran out I realized it was the cream not the peel that was making my face look better.</li>
            <li>Top does not stay on....</li>
            <li>During the day I hid the bruising and tried to cover the blisters with a combination of the whitest dermablend leg and body cream then coverblend in a shade that matches my skin on top of that, followed by powder.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried way too many creams on my way to this one, but here I&#x27;ll stay.  </li>
            <li>Of all the products I have tried, this is definitely the best on the market.</li>
            <li>So... while I love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products over the years)</li>
            <li>better results at a fraction of the cost and no redness or inflammation.</li>
            <li>Sure, some of that is genetics</li>
            <li>Note to Neocutis: I imagine many of your users are over 40yo</li>
            <li>so please consider some variance in your packaging or better typeface with increased contrast.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>price is better through Amazon and delivery was as promised.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it visibly making a difference on the scar but it is also wonderful on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>, she thought it was ok too.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>and I love the results</li>
            <li>I have used Neocutis for years and love the product.</li>
            <li>One of the top Dermatologists in Texas recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>No one ever guesses my age correctly, so maybe it helps. :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>every day!&lt;br /&gt;It is cosmetically elegant and is packed with the latest ingredients to improve your skins appearance.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>i use it on top of both of those and like that it isn&#x27;t a greasy or shine finish...</li>
            <li>My skin feels more supple.</li>
            <li>I will try a more potent cream from them.</li>
            <li>I love these products and have been using them for years.  </li>
            <li>It did such a great job in keeping the signs of age away!</li>
            <li>This is a product my dermatologist sells for a lot more.  </li>
            <li>It has no scent and is my favorite thing before bed.  </li>
            <li>My face feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it too</li>
            <li>but otherwise ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it can get better</li>
            <li>They sell many lines and I decided to go with this one after talking with my consultant.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>the BIoCream helps brighten your face. :)</li>
            <li>I love the product but not so sure about the packaging.  </li>
            <li>my sking look so much better ...</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite beauty items.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for</li>
            <li>Neocutis is an excellent line, especially for ageing skin.</li>
            <li>I started using Neoocutis Skin care products several months ago and my skin feels great!  </li>
            <li>I was able to get this for $78 now its like $95.  </li>
            <li>Over-the-counter Cerave is actually better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please return to the old style bottle which was perfect or reintroduce it as the compact travel friendly line option.  </li>
            <li>It really does work!!!!</li>
            <li>very excited.</li>
            <li>Although, if you have oiler skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as its very rich.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at my  doctor&#x27;s office and loved it.  </li>
            <li>excellent product but cap is loose on the dispenser so if try to pick up by top it drops</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I use Cetaphil cleanser and a Roc gentle Retinol serum and have had as good or better results.</li>
            <li>Pleased to find this on Amazon with a bit of a discount, and so far it&#x27;s always been delivered to me in great condition, as if I had just picked it up at the Derm&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Is there something equally good at a more reasonable price?</li>
            <li>all three are excellent products on their own, but really are meant to be used together for ultimate benefit.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin; fair and allergic to many things.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, is odorless, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after using.  </li>
            <li>Helps minimized fine lines.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished but I still notice them.</li>
            <li>I have seen fine lines decrease in appearance, its lightweight and people have noticed how radient my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I have excema and this has already helped tremendously!</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in my skin quality, softness, reducing redness, and reducing fine lines.</li>
            <li>Thank you for having it available at such great prices.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist said it was important to add growth factor and gave me this to try.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Together, they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Neocutis is a great cream, especially if you have had procedures done like microdermabrasion or laser treatments.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and soft and looks good.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing; I look years younger than my real age; but I&#x27;ll never tell and you&#x27;d never be able to guess!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not this is not the original.</li>
            <li>It is especially good when I&#x27;ve damaged my skin with too much sun or too many harsh chemical creams.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best daily use skin cream I have ever used...</li>
            <li>Please go back to the old bottle, it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Neocutis products though have a special batch of aborted fetal cells to enhance their product.</li>
            <li>Price more reasonable than through my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I love this product however its going up in price way too much.  </li>
            <li>The product was not expired and came in full packaging, so I don&#x27;t expect that it was a phony.</li>
            <li>Did not have the great experience of other reviewers.</li>
            <li>Creamy, but absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The first night that I used the tretinoin I waited an hour after applying it, and then put a light coating of the Biorestorative Cream over it.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful cream and last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>(my eyes are very sensitive to most products but this one I can put on my eye lids and under neith without any irritation).  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li>a awhile however this bottle had a very peculiar odor!!</li>
            <li>Very soothing cream; it is helping to reduce fine lines in my face.</li>
            <li>Its ability to calm irritated skin is practically immediate.  </li>
            <li>It takes up so much space in my hygiene bag when I want to travel light and compact.  </li>
            <li>Light, penetrating, soothing and smoothing, great ingredients, only cream I can use that lessens irritation and redness, hydrates and no perfume so no eye or facial swelling</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>And I had far better results with a $9 eye cream from Garnier than I did with this one.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin ever</li>
            <li>and whats the price to pay to have healthy young looking skin.....</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and looks more supple since I&#x27;ve been using it (about 3 months).  </li>
            <li>I laugh everytime</li>
            <li>It is pricy but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I preferred the original one without the heavy covering even though it is definitely more handsome.</li>
            <li>It is now VERY BULKY and NOT travel friendly.  </li>
            <li>it did right after my UV Laser Treatment, which I recommend to all.</li>
            <li>and i get rash right away</li>
            <li>This is an average- good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products from Sephore, Nerium and a few others and this is the BEST cream ever.</li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth, no greasiness or shininess-</li>
            <li>It is best for average- moderately dry skin.</li>
            <li>I like this product, very much.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my doctor because of some very intense winter dryness and it helped with that.</li>
            <li>I first tried it after a peel at my dermatologist office.</li>
            <li>What exactly is that?</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, it&#x27;s my first time using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to All!</li>
            <li>I have been reading about inferior/fake products being sold under the name of the brand product and think I just had my first experience with this situation.</li>
            <li>I bought it via &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; which obviously did not guarantee better quality.</li>
            <li>Supposedly there is no skin cream that actually &amp;#34;reverses aging,&amp;#34; as many claim.</li>
            <li>But I swear Neocutis comes pretty close to it.</li>
            <li>U THINK U HAVE MORE PRODUCT THAN U ACTUALLY DO, AND CAP NECER STAYS ON</li>
            <li>I love it as a face moisturizer and it is the only thing I use before I put on Makeup</li>
            <li>The scar on my face is undetectable - I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I cannot express enough how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>drys real fast and at this point i already have another bottle ready to go on with my trial.....</li>
            <li>I have used this product for almost a year and have been happy with it until lately.  </li>
            <li>This cream really works!</li>
            <li>I really like!</li>
            <li>First bought this through a doctor&#x27;s clinic.  </li>
            <li>It helps in the healing process after peels and is a good moisturizer for everyday as well.</li>
            <li>I have very minor wrinkles around my eyes and honestly can&#x27;t tell if it has really made a difference there or not.</li>
            <li>I used the vitamin C serum with this cream as recommended by a previous review, and the result is magical!</li>
            <li>Use at night before Retina-A to help it absorb better and keep your skin from getting too dry.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see how much you have used and unless the packaging is more environmentally friendly ( although it looks like there is more plastic not less), the packaging change was unnecessary.</li>
            <li>The reason why I mention the other stem-cell treatment is that it has remarkable properties that have really made my skin feel ‘younger’.</li>
            <li>The old design of the bottle and pump worked perfectly so you were able to use every single bit of this expensive lotion and not lose any to those goobers.</li>
            <li>so I lost so much of this way overpriced cream.</li>
            <li>Keeps sensitive skin/rosacea calm.</li>
            <li>which I do not feel everyone wants or needs.</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t really see much result in improvement of my skin over using the inexpensive products from the drug store that I&#x27;ve discovered over the years.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with texture and gives a glow.</li>
            <li>Presbyopia is real and unavoidable.</li>
            <li>but I really like the product.</li>
            <li>but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the really thing.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes very well without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Very silky on your skin and the sunscreen is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal and an investment in your skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle does not show you how much you have used, so you don&#x27;t know when you age running out.  </li>
            <li>but with this product my skin got so much healthyer .....</li>
            <li>Amount the size of a pea is all that is needed for the whole face.  </li>
            <li>Very displeased.</li>
            <li>Too much $ but its addicting.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that I have found that makes my hormone-induced malasma nearly disappear for most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love these products and thanks to Amazon for giving me access to buy them somewhere other than the dermatologist</li>
            <li>This face cream was originally recommended by my plastic surgeon after facial cancer surgery.  </li>
            <li>The expiration date was the same but the new cream was fine.  </li>
            <li>They have a contract with a company called Synomex, who manufacture taste enhancers, and other uses for aborted fetal cells to other well known and large companies to put into popular foods, and drinks that most of you buy on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This helps keep my skin hydrated and smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li>Noteably, I have had no irritation of my eyes from the Lumiere eye cream and my eyes are pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>then the rest of the squeezes which makes me think that its kept in a facility that is too hot which causes the ingredients to coagulate.&lt;br /&gt;I would not waste the money on this.</li>
            <li>finishing up this first bottle  lasted 1&amp;1/2  months so far........</li>
            <li>For example, Neocutis, while I LOVE the way it makes me feel doesn’t actually have particularly special peptides or that topically help human stem cells.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new packaging much.  </li>
            <li>Was glad to find I could get it online for about 50% less.</li>
            <li>These factors make you look older.</li>
            <li>Except for my most recent one (went through labor, etc.), the others were all medically classified as &amp;#34;aborted&amp;#34; fetus&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I did this time buy this bigger size hoping it will last more then a month.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>(normal result of having the under the surface blood vessels destroyed).  </li>
            <li>This is THEE only face cream the lives up to its promises, It&#x27;s worth the investment</li>
            <li>It provides a beautiful base under foundation - my makeup goes on smoothly and it puts the finishing touch on my night-time skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>the other just fine??</li>
            <li>amazing product, my skin looks younger, less wrinkly, i recommend it 100%...  </li>
            <li>The previous white bottle was nice, neutral, and clinical looking.  </li>
            <li>i live in FL and you need spf all of the time</li>
            <li>I need something new to replace this product.</li>
            <li>The first 40 squeezes from the bottle had a different consistency</li>
            <li>/&gt;While other brands might do a basic job (there are lots of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; skin creams), this one is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I find this product to keep you skin fresh, non-oily all day long.  </li>
            <li>I developed a fine rash on my face after using this cream for less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am not convinced that it makes me look younger but it makes my skin less dry and feels good.</li>
            <li>Like other cells they will replicate using the right auger (remember bio 101?!).  </li>
            <li>This year however, even after the blazing Cambodian sun, I managed to survive with just a light bit of bumpiness (but no itching or redness) on my forehead, but no full blown outbreak or sunburn for that matter.</li>
            <li>since i use retin a and the hyluronic acid with it  its tough to see what its impact is as these products are already amazing  .....</li>
            <li>First of all, you really want to look at the ingredients in the product you’re buying, to see if they truly have active or natural ingredients that can activate ‘bio’ properties and protect your skin.</li>
            <li>When used daily it really makes a difference</li>
            <li>It seems to bring out the natural tones in your skin versus &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Just bought my 79 year old mother the bio-restorative eye cream with psp to try.  </li>
            <li>in the morning: Replenix Serum and Eucerin Sensitive Skin Spf 30 Day</li>
            <li>: Cleanse with Cetaphil, then Roc Skin Renewing Serum; and Eucerin Sensitive Skin Q10 Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 32-year old man</li>
            <li>Go to your dermatologist and pay the extra money for the real deal.</li>
            <li>My skin might be too sensitive for it as I felt a stinging and burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Extra gentle -</li>
            <li>Makes you skin feel so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>If I had to guess in five years I&#x27;ll thank this product for keeping my face looking so young.</li>
            <li>This is a product developed in Sweden.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>This was a baby who was wanted, but the parents signed off on his use for research hoping something good could come out of something so sad.</li>
            <li>I had cut back to 2 or 3 times a week with the tretinoin due to the peeling and hope to now be able to use it every night with this Biorestorative applied an hour later.</li>
            <li>Great product but the new design creates that icky hard lotion goober every time you use pump - the old design did not do that</li>
            <li>use this along with 4 other treatments daily (Skin medica TNS serum, Skin medica VIT C, Lumyxyl for pigmentation problems,  Neocutis Creme Rich eye cream &amp;Sunscreen</li>
            <li>so i have to mix it with other moisturizer but other than that i love it</li>
            <li>I did not go back to my high end cream that I use to use.</li>
            <li>Terrific product but with a high price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, so I do like this product as it is one of the few that does&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin with Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT PLEASE GO BACK TO OLD PACKAGING, CANT TELL HOW MUCH IS REMANING IN BOTTLE AND IS TOO BIG</li>
            <li>:B00TKJET7W this true stem cell treatment]], asides from the fact that Neocutis is a lot more expensive!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>Even my Board Certified MD Dermatologist agreed saying the new bottle looks too commercial now and is incongruous with a clinical image it needs to exemplify the growth factors ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Amazon sent me a new one from this same seller.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin that gets very crepe-y in the winter.</li>
            <li>the Eucerin Sensitive Skin line also works well for a night cream and for the SPF 30 Day Cream is non-irritating and costs a tiny fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It is more difficult to tell how much you have left.  </li>
            <li>This product was developed in Switzerland and initially was not researched for cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>This makes me curious as to what this seller is really selling.  </li>
            <li>I am 46 years old, and I am constantly asked what I use on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, others have noticed as well since I&#x27;ve  received compliments on the appearance of my skin since I began using this line of skin care.</li>
            <li>and I tried it because I have some spider veins on my chin and a few of those lovely dark spots on the side of my face.  </li>
            <li>You have to use it right away and everyday preferably twice a day.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles and fine lines have seriously softened.  </li>
            <li>I had discarded the original box so a hard lesson and $85</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-forties and live in an extremely dry climate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin does not dry out during the day and it works well with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about purchasing something like this online, so I went to a place I trusted - Amazon.com - and got exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>For the first few days after having the work done I used an over the counter, anti-bacterial product called polysporin.  </li>
            <li>Disturbing to read on your insurance benefits summary; however, medically speaking spontaneous abortion and miscarriage are the same.</li>
            <li>It is the one product that my dry sensitive skin can&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne and it&#x27;s unbelievable how quickly it can heal and clear up scabs or dark spots left by pimples.  </li>
            <li>I like the eye cream in this line, and the tinted moisturizer with high SPF, but this is fairly average to me for the price.  </li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> this product s remarkable...</li>
            <li> The good brands like Neocutis and NuNutrients use plant based derivatives to stimulate skin stem cell growth / protection of existing stem cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchase it through my dermatologist because I know that it is good and not expired or sat in a sales reps car for awhile....</li>
            <li> Good seller</li>
            <li> would recommend it to a friend because I have had good luck with it.  </li>

            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this company!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> and she is so appreciative that I told her about this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product was AMAZING</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and (hoping this is not my imagination)</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the skinny from my research, but please do your own.</li>
            <li> so I have no way to say it is effective.</li>
            <li> smooth and grease free - best of all it keeps me rosacea and sunburn</li>
            <li> However she didn&#x27;t pass the products of conception on her own and had to have a D&amp;C.  </li>
            <li> It is not a miracle worker, but it does have a nice texture &amp; no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very healing, perfect amount of moisture.  </li>
            <li> I use their eye cream which I have found to be very effective in reducing fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product feels wonderful and really quenches my skin as well as performing all of the magic of anti-aging in the process.  </li>
            <li> recommendation is to try both and see which one is better suited for your needs, if you can get away with using a cheaper product then more power to you!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have something that can go on my skin on top of the tretinoin and reduce the peeling.</li>
            <li> This is a controversial product since it uses PSP stem cells.  </li>
            <li> It Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the reviews say and for the money I thought it would be more effective.</li>
            <li> BioCream is by far one of the best anti-aging moisturizers out there...</li>
            <li> Love love love this cream!</li>
            <li> After I ran out I realized it was the cream not the peel that was making my face look better.</li>
            <li> Top does not stay on....</li>
            <li> During the day I hid the bruising and tried to cover the blisters with a combination of the whitest dermablend leg and body cream then coverblend in a shade that matches my skin on top of that, followed by powder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried way too many creams on my way to this one, but here I&#x27;ll stay.  </li>
            <li> Of all the products I have tried, this is definitely the best on the market.</li>
            <li> So... while I love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products over the years)</li>
            <li> better results at a fraction of the cost and no redness or inflammation.</li>
            <li> Sure, some of that is genetics</li>
            <li> Note to Neocutis: I imagine many of your users are over 40yo</li>
            <li> so please consider some variance in your packaging or better typeface with increased contrast.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> price is better through Amazon and delivery was as promised.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it visibly making a difference on the scar but it is also wonderful on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> , she thought it was ok too.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> and I love the results</li>
            <li> I have used Neocutis for years and love the product.</li>
            <li> One of the top Dermatologists in Texas recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> No one ever guesses my age correctly, so maybe it helps. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> every day!&lt;br /&gt;It is cosmetically elegant and is packed with the latest ingredients to improve your skins appearance.  </li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> i use it on top of both of those and like that it isn&#x27;t a greasy or shine finish...</li>
            <li> My skin feels more supple.</li>
            <li> I will try a more potent cream from them.</li>
            <li> I love these products and have been using them for years.  </li>
            <li> It did such a great job in keeping the signs of age away!</li>
            <li> This is a product my dermatologist sells for a lot more.  </li>
            <li> It has no scent and is my favorite thing before bed.  </li>
            <li> My face feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it too</li>
            <li> but otherwise ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it can get better</li>
            <li> They sell many lines and I decided to go with this one after talking with my consultant.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> the BIoCream helps brighten your face. :)</li>
            <li> I love the product but not so sure about the packaging.  </li>
            <li> my sking look so much better ...</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite beauty items.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for</li>
            <li> Neocutis is an excellent line, especially for ageing skin.</li>
            <li> I started using Neoocutis Skin care products several months ago and my skin feels great!  </li>
            <li> I was able to get this for $78 now its like $95.  </li>
            <li> Over-the-counter Cerave is actually better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please return to the old style bottle which was perfect or reintroduce it as the compact travel friendly line option.  </li>
            <li> It really does work!!!!</li>
            <li> very excited.</li>
            <li> Although, if you have oiler skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as its very rich.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my  doctor&#x27;s office and loved it.  </li>
            <li> excellent product but cap is loose on the dispenser so if try to pick up by top it drops</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I use Cetaphil cleanser and a Roc gentle Retinol serum and have had as good or better results.</li>
            <li> Pleased to find this on Amazon with a bit of a discount, and so far it&#x27;s always been delivered to me in great condition, as if I had just picked it up at the Derm&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Is there something equally good at a more reasonable price?</li>
            <li> all three are excellent products on their own, but really are meant to be used together for ultimate benefit.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin; fair and allergic to many things.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy, is odorless, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after using.  </li>
            <li> Helps minimized fine lines.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminished but I still notice them.</li>
            <li> I have seen fine lines decrease in appearance, its lightweight and people have noticed how radient my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I have excema and this has already helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in my skin quality, softness, reducing redness, and reducing fine lines.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having it available at such great prices.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said it was important to add growth factor and gave me this to try.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Together, they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Neocutis is a great cream, especially if you have had procedures done like microdermabrasion or laser treatments.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and soft and looks good.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing; I look years younger than my real age; but I&#x27;ll never tell and you&#x27;d never be able to guess!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not this is not the original.</li>
            <li> It is especially good when I&#x27;ve damaged my skin with too much sun or too many harsh chemical creams.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best daily use skin cream I have ever used...</li>
            <li> Please go back to the old bottle, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Neocutis products though have a special batch of aborted fetal cells to enhance their product.</li>
            <li> Price more reasonable than through my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I love this product however its going up in price way too much.  </li>
            <li> The product was not expired and came in full packaging, so I don&#x27;t expect that it was a phony.</li>
            <li> Did not have the great experience of other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Creamy, but absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> The first night that I used the tretinoin I waited an hour after applying it, and then put a light coating of the Biorestorative Cream over it.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream and last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> (my eyes are very sensitive to most products but this one I can put on my eye lids and under neith without any irritation).  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> a awhile however this bottle had a very peculiar odor!!</li>
            <li> Very soothing cream; it is helping to reduce fine lines in my face.</li>
            <li> Its ability to calm irritated skin is practically immediate.  </li>
            <li> It takes up so much space in my hygiene bag when I want to travel light and compact.  </li>
            <li> Light, penetrating, soothing and smoothing, great ingredients, only cream I can use that lessens irritation and redness, hydrates and no perfume so no eye or facial swelling</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> And I had far better results with a $9 eye cream from Garnier than I did with this one.</li>
            <li> So worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin ever</li>
            <li> and whats the price to pay to have healthy young looking skin.....</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and looks more supple since I&#x27;ve been using it (about 3 months).  </li>
            <li> I laugh everytime</li>
            <li> It is pricy but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I preferred the original one without the heavy covering even though it is definitely more handsome.</li>
            <li> It is now VERY BULKY and NOT travel friendly.  </li>
            <li> it did right after my UV Laser Treatment, which I recommend to all.</li>
            <li> and i get rash right away</li>
            <li> This is an average- good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products from Sephore, Nerium and a few others and this is the BEST cream ever.</li>
            <li> Very soft and smooth, no greasiness or shininess-</li>
            <li> It is best for average- moderately dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product, very much.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my doctor because of some very intense winter dryness and it helped with that.</li>
            <li> I first tried it after a peel at my dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> What exactly is that?</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, it&#x27;s my first time using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to All!</li>
            <li> I have been reading about inferior/fake products being sold under the name of the brand product and think I just had my first experience with this situation.</li>
            <li> I bought it via &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; which obviously did not guarantee better quality.</li>
            <li> Supposedly there is no skin cream that actually &amp;#34;reverses aging,&amp;#34; as many claim.</li>
            <li> But I swear Neocutis comes pretty close to it.</li>
            <li> U THINK U HAVE MORE PRODUCT THAN U ACTUALLY DO, AND CAP NECER STAYS ON</li>
            <li> I love it as a face moisturizer and it is the only thing I use before I put on Makeup</li>
            <li> The scar on my face is undetectable - I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I cannot express enough how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> drys real fast and at this point i already have another bottle ready to go on with my trial.....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost a year and have been happy with it until lately.  </li>
            <li> This cream really works!</li>
            <li> I really like!</li>
            <li> First bought this through a doctor&#x27;s clinic.  </li>
            <li> It helps in the healing process after peels and is a good moisturizer for everyday as well.</li>
            <li> I have very minor wrinkles around my eyes and honestly can&#x27;t tell if it has really made a difference there or not.</li>
            <li> I used the vitamin C serum with this cream as recommended by a previous review, and the result is magical!</li>
            <li> Use at night before Retina-A to help it absorb better and keep your skin from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see how much you have used and unless the packaging is more environmentally friendly ( although it looks like there is more plastic not less), the packaging change was unnecessary.</li>
            <li> The reason why I mention the other stem-cell treatment is that it has remarkable properties that have really made my skin feel ‘younger’.</li>
            <li> The old design of the bottle and pump worked perfectly so you were able to use every single bit of this expensive lotion and not lose any to those goobers.</li>
            <li> so I lost so much of this way overpriced cream.</li>
            <li> Keeps sensitive skin/rosacea calm.</li>
            <li> which I do not feel everyone wants or needs.</li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t really see much result in improvement of my skin over using the inexpensive products from the drug store that I&#x27;ve discovered over the years.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with texture and gives a glow.</li>
            <li> Presbyopia is real and unavoidable.</li>
            <li> but I really like the product.</li>
            <li> but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the really thing.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes very well without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Very silky on your skin and the sunscreen is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal and an investment in your skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle does not show you how much you have used, so you don&#x27;t know when you age running out.  </li>
            <li> but with this product my skin got so much healthyer .....</li>
            <li> Amount the size of a pea is all that is needed for the whole face.  </li>
            <li> Very displeased.</li>
            <li> Too much $ but its addicting.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that I have found that makes my hormone-induced malasma nearly disappear for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love these products and thanks to Amazon for giving me access to buy them somewhere other than the dermatologist</li>
            <li> This face cream was originally recommended by my plastic surgeon after facial cancer surgery.  </li>
            <li> The expiration date was the same but the new cream was fine.  </li>
            <li> They have a contract with a company called Synomex, who manufacture taste enhancers, and other uses for aborted fetal cells to other well known and large companies to put into popular foods, and drinks that most of you buy on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my skin hydrated and smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li> Noteably, I have had no irritation of my eyes from the Lumiere eye cream and my eyes are pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> then the rest of the squeezes which makes me think that its kept in a facility that is too hot which causes the ingredients to coagulate.&lt;br /&gt;I would not waste the money on this.</li>
            <li> finishing up this first bottle  lasted 1&amp;1/2  months so far........</li>
            <li> For example, Neocutis, while I LOVE the way it makes me feel doesn’t actually have particularly special peptides or that topically help human stem cells.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new packaging much.  </li>
            <li> Was glad to find I could get it online for about 50% less.</li>
            <li> These factors make you look older.</li>
            <li> Except for my most recent one (went through labor, etc.), the others were all medically classified as &amp;#34;aborted&amp;#34; fetus&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I did this time buy this bigger size hoping it will last more then a month.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> (normal result of having the under the surface blood vessels destroyed).  </li>
            <li> This is THEE only face cream the lives up to its promises, It&#x27;s worth the investment</li>
            <li> It provides a beautiful base under foundation - my makeup goes on smoothly and it puts the finishing touch on my night-time skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> the other just fine??</li>
            <li> amazing product, my skin looks younger, less wrinkly, i recommend it 100%...  </li>
            <li> The previous white bottle was nice, neutral, and clinical looking.  </li>
            <li> i live in FL and you need spf all of the time</li>
            <li> I need something new to replace this product.</li>
            <li> The first 40 squeezes from the bottle had a different consistency</li>
            <li> /&gt;While other brands might do a basic job (there are lots of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; skin creams), this one is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I find this product to keep you skin fresh, non-oily all day long.  </li>
            <li> I developed a fine rash on my face after using this cream for less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am not convinced that it makes me look younger but it makes my skin less dry and feels good.</li>
            <li> Like other cells they will replicate using the right auger (remember bio 101?!).  </li>
            <li> This year however, even after the blazing Cambodian sun, I managed to survive with just a light bit of bumpiness (but no itching or redness) on my forehead, but no full blown outbreak or sunburn for that matter.</li>
            <li> since i use retin a and the hyluronic acid with it  its tough to see what its impact is as these products are already amazing  .....</li>
            <li> First of all, you really want to look at the ingredients in the product you’re buying, to see if they truly have active or natural ingredients that can activate ‘bio’ properties and protect your skin.</li>
            <li> When used daily it really makes a difference</li>
            <li> It seems to bring out the natural tones in your skin versus &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just bought my 79 year old mother the bio-restorative eye cream with psp to try.  </li>
            <li> in the morning: Replenix Serum and Eucerin Sensitive Skin Spf 30 Day</li>
            <li> : Cleanse with Cetaphil, then Roc Skin Renewing Serum; and Eucerin Sensitive Skin Q10 Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32-year old man</li>
            <li> Go to your dermatologist and pay the extra money for the real deal.</li>
            <li> My skin might be too sensitive for it as I felt a stinging and burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Extra gentle -</li>
            <li> Makes you skin feel so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> If I had to guess in five years I&#x27;ll thank this product for keeping my face looking so young.</li>
            <li> This is a product developed in Sweden.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> This was a baby who was wanted, but the parents signed off on his use for research hoping something good could come out of something so sad.</li>
            <li> I had cut back to 2 or 3 times a week with the tretinoin due to the peeling and hope to now be able to use it every night with this Biorestorative applied an hour later.</li>
            <li> Great product but the new design creates that icky hard lotion goober every time you use pump - the old design did not do that</li>
            <li> use this along with 4 other treatments daily (Skin medica TNS serum, Skin medica VIT C, Lumyxyl for pigmentation problems,  Neocutis Creme Rich eye cream &amp;Sunscreen</li>
            <li> so i have to mix it with other moisturizer but other than that i love it</li>
            <li> I did not go back to my high end cream that I use to use.</li>
            <li> Terrific product but with a high price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, so I do like this product as it is one of the few that does&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin with Rosacea.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT PLEASE GO BACK TO OLD PACKAGING, CANT TELL HOW MUCH IS REMANING IN BOTTLE AND IS TOO BIG</li>
            <li> :B00TKJET7W this true stem cell treatment]], asides from the fact that Neocutis is a lot more expensive!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Even my Board Certified MD Dermatologist agreed saying the new bottle looks too commercial now and is incongruous with a clinical image it needs to exemplify the growth factors ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Amazon sent me a new one from this same seller.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin that gets very crepe-y in the winter.</li>
            <li> the Eucerin Sensitive Skin line also works well for a night cream and for the SPF 30 Day Cream is non-irritating and costs a tiny fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It is more difficult to tell how much you have left.  </li>
            <li> This product was developed in Switzerland and initially was not researched for cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> This makes me curious as to what this seller is really selling.  </li>
            <li> I am 46 years old, and I am constantly asked what I use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, others have noticed as well since I&#x27;ve  received compliments on the appearance of my skin since I began using this line of skin care.</li>
            <li> and I tried it because I have some spider veins on my chin and a few of those lovely dark spots on the side of my face.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it right away and everyday preferably twice a day.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles and fine lines have seriously softened.  </li>
            <li> I had discarded the original box so a hard lesson and $85</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-forties and live in an extremely dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin does not dry out during the day and it works well with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about purchasing something like this online, so I went to a place I trusted - Amazon.com - and got exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> For the first few days after having the work done I used an over the counter, anti-bacterial product called polysporin.  </li>
            <li> Disturbing to read on your insurance benefits summary; however, medically speaking spontaneous abortion and miscarriage are the same.</li>
            <li> It is the one product that my dry sensitive skin can&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne and it&#x27;s unbelievable how quickly it can heal and clear up scabs or dark spots left by pimples.  </li>
            <li> I like the eye cream in this line, and the tinted moisturizer with high SPF, but this is fairly average to me for the price.  </li>
            <li> It is very, very expensive at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, so I was happy to see it for less here.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I start to feel like my face is getting tight, I immediately apply the cream and instantly the skin loosens a bit and feels as soft a</li>
            <li> The one product that I can&#x27;t live without over the years is the Replenix Serum with Green Tea.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> i said 95 % because my skin is really dry and dont last me all day ...</li>
            <li> I went to charged me at least twice as much for the same product.</li>
            <li> Spreads thin and super emollient.  </li>
            <li> I tried going back to other products, but I have returned to Bio Cream and, as long as I can afford it, I will use only this to soften the ravages of age!</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift after a minor cancer removal on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I use it on any minor cuts that I get that just won&#x27;t heal.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin skin with lots of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would be too heavy for me, but my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li> My face seems to be having a little problem with tiny white bumps.  </li>
            <li> miss not using it because it does moisturize my skin,especially in dry and windy weather.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cap is so loose on mine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but I&#x27;m seeing much clearer and smoother skin wherever I apply it, and some dark spots are fading...</li>
            <li> I contacted amazon and asked them if they could send me the real thing instead of a fake and the second one didn&#x27;t cause a rash.</li>
            <li> This was a recommendation from my skin center.  </li>
            <li> Feels like the bottle came already empty..</li>
            <li> (the bottle was not as wide).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide the hydration I expected.</li>
            <li> This, on the other hand, is not real.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I actually use both, as the Renewal Cream differs in texture than Neocutis, I actually find that it’s easier to wear during the day, and I don’t like the new pump design that Neocutis has implemented – it leaves a hard residue of lotion on the tip that a) wastes product, b) makes it hard to squirt out if you don’t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use with retin-a and under all other make-up to prevent redness.</li>
            <li> If other users are like me and don&#x27;t wear reading glasses when washing their face</li>
            <li> It treats post surgery scars and other scars extremely well.  </li>
            <li> They were studied and collagen 3, as well as other growth factors, fibroblasts, and Interleukins were extracted.  </li>
            <li> It has been made into hospital cream for wound healing, post skin graft, and burn healing amongst other dermatologic uses including aesthetics.  </li>
            <li> yes i think it does compliment my other products and would recommend it...  </li>
            <li> It also is dispensed via a pump,ian advantage  over jar based cream , as bacteria  can degrade the contents (due to exposure to the air.)</li>
            <li> Forget all your other over the counter JUNK.</li>
            <li> im extremely alergic</li>
            <li> Normally, a small dab will glide across my skin and the product will last me for months.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I am in my mid 50s and have seen a dramatic difference on my face, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money if you do not have problem skin.  </li>
            <li> the dark spots seem to be fading a bit.  </li>
            <li> and I get compliments about my complex, daily.</li>
            <li> Expensive but much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> No more dry skin.</li>
            <li> It costs half the price of the gels in this line and lasts twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see the ads on TV for the newest GIMMICK that can&#x27;t even penetrate your skin surface much less repair it.</li>
            <li> At times I&#x27;ve had budget pressures and have rotated to other brands, but always come back to Neocutis when my skin starts looking tired</li>
            <li> It also loosely rotates 360 degrees making it difficult to press down without constantly slipping when your finger is typically wet with lotion or from a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You wont know when to reorder because they changed the bottle color to an opaque green.  </li>
            <li> The cap ALWAYS come off in my bag exposing the pump to waste product.  </li>
            <li> What is used is cells donated for research and development from one sad, but natural occurrence.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday as my nighttime moisturize.</li>
            <li> The other treatment I mentioned comes in a screw-cap bottle which is convenient for small dabs with your ring finger.rew-cap bottle which is convenient for small dabs with your ring finger.</li>
            <li> But I use a very small amount so on an annual basis isn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t expensive and may help me avoid deeper wrinkles as I get older.  </li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re sunburned or your nose is red and painful from a cold - Neocutis goes on smooth and pain-free and since it&#x27;s a post-surgery creme, it helps reduce the redness and the burn away rather quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Products are expensive but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive but a little does a long way.</li>
            <li> Either they have changed the formula, this is a bad batch, or it&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without this facial cream.  </li>
            <li> I will be wary the next time I make a purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> This product is usually sold in physician offices, but buy from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but since hard plastic it does not break  </li>
            <li> Hard core dimple-wrinkles have been diminished.  </li>
            <li> I did for one day and my make-up looked dull..</li>
            <li> Wow have we all got different ideas about what is expensive!!!</li>
            <li> There’s quite a lot of chatter lately about ‘bio’ creams… be they “biorestorative’ like Neocutis, or Stem Cell treatments, like the ones you get at a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida sun requires a minimum of 30 for those of us with delicate skin.</li>

            <li> today I have no visible scars except a few behind my ears that I could not see and therefore did not treat...</li>
            <li> I have seen this cream work wonders on other&#x27;s, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> – it’s actually almost impossible to do this.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by the estetician in my dermatologists office but is less expensive to purchase through amazon.</li>
            <li> As long as I keep using the product, it stays VERY faint.</li>
            <li> Her first order made her get a horrible rash</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received it gave me a horrible rash and made me itch.</li>
            <li> Plus, the price on Amazon is WAY less expensive if I get it from my surgeon!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive - but to not have to suffer through days of itching, redness and just looking miserable - I&#x27;d say well worth it.</li>
            <li> Well it’s a trade secret, but from what I’ve read and how it applies to my skin</li>
            <li> also they will stand behind it if for some reason it does not agree with me.</li>
            <li> What Neocutis doesn&#x27;t tell you, is the secret ingredient in their products.</li>
            <li> The creme smells terrible - it should not have much of a scent at all.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and stop perpetuating inaccurate, false information and do your research.</li>
            <li> well, Holy cow, this is a bloody fortune!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is unnecessarily difficult to tell the difference between a Luminere bottle or Biorestorative Cream.</li>

            <li> used to buy this from the Dermatologist&#x27;s office, which of course was expensive.</li>

            <li> Horribly expensive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you greasy and doesn&#x27;t get your necklines dirty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it! very excited. I first tried it after a peel at my dermatologist office. After I ran out I realized it was the cream not the peel that was making my face look better. My skin is prone to also breakout and this product is not a concern in that area either.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. I started using it after a surgical procedure on my doctors recommendation. I did not go back to my high end cream that I use to use. I won&#x27;t ever change.</li>
            <li> Terrible packaging. Top does not stay on....so I lost so much of this way overpriced cream.</li>
            <li> Recently I had laser treatment on some red blood vessels from my rosacea, and IPL for background redness the same day.  The visible capillaries around my nostrils blistered - those must have been closer to the surface than the ones on my cheeks (or perhaps the seb derm irritation around my nostrils caused the blistering).  For the first few days after having the work done I used an over the counter, anti-bacterial product called polysporin.  During the day I hid the bruising and tried to cover the blisters with a combination of the whitest dermablend leg and body cream then coverblend in a shade that matches my skin on top of that, followed by powder.  When this product arrived in the mail from Amazon I switched from the antibacterial polysporin to this.  The Biorestorative Cream seemed to speed up the healing around my nose and may or may not have sped up the fading of the bruises on my cheeks (normal result of having the under the surface blood vessels destroyed).  The dermatologist said I could go back to using 0.025% tretinoin (the generic version of Retin A) one week after the laser and IPL treatments.  The first night that I used the tretinoin I waited an hour after applying it, and then put a light coating of the Biorestorative Cream over it.  The next morning I had NO peeling - none, zip, nada!  I have ALWAYS had peeling skin the morning AFTER using the tretinoin- even though I&#x27;m on a low dose. I am thrilled to have something that can go on my skin on top of the tretinoin and reduce the peeling. I had cut back to 2 or 3 times a week with the tretinoin due to the peeling and hope to now be able to use it every night with this Biorestorative applied an hour later. I wouldn&#x27;t put them on at the same time for fear of reducing the effectiveness of the tretinoin.  I&#x27;ve been using the Neocutis Lumiere eye cream for a year.  I have very minor wrinkles around my eyes and honestly can&#x27;t tell if it has really made a difference there or not. But I use a very small amount so on an annual basis isn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t expensive and may help me avoid deeper wrinkles as I get older.  Noteably, I have had no irritation of my eyes from the Lumiere eye cream and my eyes are pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my  doctor&#x27;s office and loved it.  I tried going back to other products, but I have returned to Bio Cream and, as long as I can afford it, I will use only this to soften the ravages of age!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money if you do not have problem skin.  I will switch back to L&#x27;Oreal which does the same thing for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> There’s quite a lot of chatter lately about ‘bio’ creams… be they “biorestorative’ like Neocutis, or Stem Cell treatments, like the ones you get at a dermatologist. First of all, you really want to look at the ingredients in the product you’re buying, to see if they truly have active or natural ingredients that can activate ‘bio’ properties and protect your skin. For example, Neocutis, while I LOVE the way it makes me feel doesn’t actually have particularly special peptides or that topically help human stem cells. This is one of the reasons why they can’t actually advertise that it’s a stem cell treatment, and use the word “Bio” instead. What they do claim to have is “Processed Skin Proteins” their patented PSP trademark. What exactly is that? Well it’s a trade secret, but from what I’ve read and how it applies to my skin it does feel like a collagen restorative cream. It is actually quite similar in feel to [[ASIN:B00TKJET7W this true stem cell treatment]], asides from the fact that Neocutis is a lot more expensive! The reason why I mention the other stem-cell treatment is that it has remarkable properties that have really made my skin feel ‘younger’. They’re not marketing it the same way, as I believe they’re not using embryonic stem cells – it’s actually almost impossible to do this. The good brands like Neocutis and NuNutrients use plant based derivatives to stimulate skin stem cell growth / protection of existing stem cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to try both and see which one is better suited for your needs, if you can get away with using a cheaper product then more power to you! I actually use both, as the Renewal Cream differs in texture than Neocutis, I actually find that it’s easier to wear during the day, and I don’t like the new pump design that Neocutis has implemented – it leaves a hard residue of lotion on the tip that a) wastes product, b) makes it hard to squirt out if you don’t use it everyday. The other treatment I mentioned comes in a screw-cap bottle which is convenient for small dabs with your ring finger.rew-cap bottle which is convenient for small dabs with your ring finger.</li>
            <li> Keeps sensitive skin/rosacea calm. When used daily it really makes a difference and I do not have to use medicated creams. I use with retin-a and under all other make-up to prevent redness. It is the one product that my dry sensitive skin can&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li> I had a mini face and neck lift almost 3yrs ago and following the removal of sutures I starting using the bio creme on the scars immediately ..today I have no visible scars except a few behind my ears that I could not see and therefore did not treat...this product s remarkable...I recommended it to my neice who had  double mastectomy and she is so appreciative that I told her about this amazing product. I purchase it through my dermatologist because I know that it is good and not expired or sat in a sales reps car for awhile....also they will stand behind it if for some reason it does not agree with me. all in all a wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried way too many creams on my way to this one, but here I&#x27;ll stay.  It&#x27;s subtle, doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but I&#x27;m seeing much clearer and smoother skin wherever I apply it, and some dark spots are fading...</li>
            <li> This is a controversial product since it uses PSP stem cells.  I have been happy with it. It has smoothed the transition from my orbital eye bone to the skin underneath my eyes. When you age, you have face section separation. The eye area separates from your cheeks. Your cheeks separate from your mouth. These factors make you look older. This product allows the production of collagen and improves the appearance of the skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, it&#x27;s my first time using it. A little goes a long way so it lasted close to 2 months. Very soft and smooth, no greasiness or shininess- moisturizes well. It seems to bring out the natural tones in your skin versus &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; which I do not feel everyone wants or needs. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand 4 years ago.  Of all the products I have tried, this is definitely the best on the market. Have used both the eye and face cream with PSP.  Products are expensive but a little goes a long way and you can save when you buy on Amazon. If you purchase through select phsyicans they are 30-40% more expensive. I am in my mid 50s and have seen a dramatic difference on my face, especially around the eyes. Wrinkles and fine lines have seriously softened.  I get complements all the time on my skin.  Just bought my 79 year old mother the bio-restorative eye cream with psp to try.  Will follow up with her review in month.</li>
            <li> Wow have we all got different ideas about what is expensive!!! I think this is a fortune at $100 for the cream; and if you use the spf cream and the eye cream, and the gel...well, Holy cow, this is a bloody fortune!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I do like this product as it is one of the few that does&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin with Rosacea.  That said, I don&#x27;t really see much result in improvement of my skin over using the inexpensive products from the drug store that I&#x27;ve discovered over the years.  For instance...the Eucerin Sensitive Skin line also works well for a night cream and for the SPF 30 Day Cream is non-irritating and costs a tiny fraction of the price. I use Cetaphil cleanser and a Roc gentle Retinol serum and have had as good or better results. And I had far better results with a $9 eye cream from Garnier than I did with this one. So... while I love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products over the years), I&#x27;m going back to the Eucerin line and saving myself $175 a month that I can spend to get my house cleaned regularly. The one product that I can&#x27;t live without over the years is the Replenix Serum with Green Tea. It costs half the price of the gels in this line and lasts twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the morning: Replenix Serum and Eucerin Sensitive Skin Spf 30 Day Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night: Cleanse with Cetaphil, then Roc Skin Renewing Serum; and Eucerin Sensitive Skin Q10 Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila...better results at a fraction of the cost and no redness or inflammation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, recommended by my dermatologist. It&#x27;s amazing. Seriously. I&#x27;ve never used anything that worked so well. People compliment my skin all the time. Sure, some of that is genetics but this product has definitely helped me stave off the march of time across my face. It really helps with texture and gives a glow.Try it. So worth the price. Note to Neocutis: I imagine many of your users are over 40yo so please consider some variance in your packaging or better typeface with increased contrast. Presbyopia is real and unavoidable. If other users are like me and don&#x27;t wear reading glasses when washing their face it is unnecessarily difficult to tell the difference between a Luminere bottle or Biorestorative Cream.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 5 years now. Was recommended by my dermatologist. Am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new packaging much.  It is more difficult to tell how much you have left.  Otherwise, I love this product.  I have the most sensitive skin ever and this stuff has been awesome and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> This face cream was originally recommended by my plastic surgeon after facial cancer surgery.  It is helpful, used daily, in repairing scarred skin.</li>
            <li> all three are excellent products on their own, but really are meant to be used together for ultimate benefit.</li>
            <li> Terrific product but with a high price. Use at night before Retina-A to help it absorb better and keep your skin from getting too dry. I have used it for years at my doctor&#x27;s suggestion.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without this facial cream.  I&#x27;m a 32-year old man and I&#x27;ve had problematic skin since I was 15.  I&#x27;ve tried every facial cream under the sun and have not found anything like this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and I can&#x27;t get over the results.  My skin has never looked better.  Even tone, diminished red spots, smaller pores, refined lines.  Its ability to calm irritated skin is practically immediate.  I have struggled with acne and it&#x27;s unbelievable how quickly it can heal and clear up scabs or dark spots left by pimples.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> What Neocutis doesn&#x27;t tell you, is the secret ingredient in their products. Aborted baby cells. They have a contract with a company called Synomex, who manufacture taste enhancers, and other uses for aborted fetal cells to other well known and large companies to put into popular foods, and drinks that most of you buy on a regular basis. Neocutis products though have a special batch of aborted fetal cells to enhance their product. It is specifically from fetal matter from 2nd trimester aborted babies. The good stuff! That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so expensive. So keep lathering it on people, your supporting a great company!</li>
            <li> These are all products that I use on a daily basis.  I have very sensitive skin; fair and allergic to many things.  These products are superior;&lt;br /&gt;the price is better through Amazon and delivery was as promised.  Thanks to All!</li>
            <li> The cream is great----new packaging is not.  You can&#x27;t see how much you have used and unless the packaging is more environmentally friendly ( although it looks like there is more plastic not less), the packaging change was unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I like this product, very much.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product and I tried it because I have some spider veins on my chin and a few of those lovely dark spots on the side of my face.  Goes on nicely and (hoping this is not my imagination) the dark spots seem to be fading a bit.  Only been using it for about 2 weeks but I really like the product.</li>
            <li> They absurdly redesigned the bottle in 5 dysfunctional ways:&lt;br /&gt;1) It is now VERY BULKY and NOT travel friendly.  It takes up so much space in my hygiene bag when I want to travel light and compact.  It&#x27;s ALWAYS questioned at airports when the internal volume is still only the 1.69 oz.  Furthermore you cannot remove the bulky decorative outer shell.&lt;br /&gt;2) You wont know when to reorder because they changed the bottle color to an opaque green.  Before you could see through the white bottle letting you know when you are about to run out.&lt;br /&gt;3) As a man, I do not want an EXTREMELY FEMALE looking bottle.  The previous white bottle was nice, neutral, and clinical looking.  Even my Board Certified MD Dermatologist agreed saying the new bottle looks too commercial now and is incongruous with a clinical image it needs to exemplify the growth factors ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;4) The cap ALWAYS come off in my bag exposing the pump to waste product.  The cap is so loose on mine it falls off from simply turning the bottle upside down.&lt;br /&gt;5) The pump head is now curved shape and not ergonomic.  It also loosely rotates 360 degrees making it difficult to press down without constantly slipping when your finger is typically wet with lotion or from a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please return to the old style bottle which was perfect or reintroduce it as the compact travel friendly line option.  Please keep it at the same price point or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company and they never replied.  It seems nobody there is thinking or listening or cares.  Whoever the marketing team is that thought a more expensive looking bottle would sell better is wrong.  At a minimum it just eliminated the male customers demographic and the endorsement of my MD.  Very disappointed. Just terrible!!!</li>
            <li> It Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the reviews say and for the money I thought it would be more effective.</li>
            <li> Good product ! Good seller</li>
            <li> Read a review another review about this product and heard someone say that she ordered 2 of these. Her first order made her get a horrible rash so she contacted amazon and got another bottle which didn&#x27;t cause a rash. I had the same problem happen to me. The first bottle I received it gave me a horrible rash and made me itch. I contacted amazon and asked them if they could send me the real thing instead of a fake and the second one didn&#x27;t cause a rash. Although the second one dries out my skin. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not this is not the original. If it is, it is kept in a horrible facility. The first 40 squeezes from the bottle had a different consistency then the rest of the squeezes which makes me think that its kept in a facility that is too hot which causes the ingredients to coagulate.&lt;br /&gt;I would not waste the money on this. I have tried the neocutis biorestorative eye cream which is a different product on amazon but it is the real deal. This, on the other hand, is not real. Go to your dermatologist and pay the extra money for the real deal.</li>
            <li> The med spa that I go to recommended this for my scars that I got from surgery. He showed me pictures of burn victims and after 6 months you couldn&#x27;t even tell they had been burnt. You have to use it right away and everyday preferably twice a day.</li>
            <li> Great for scars.  Had stomach surgery and used this and it was amazing.  Just wish I could afford to use it for my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neocutis for over a year now. I am 46, going on 47 and would say that the Neocutis system is simple to use (only 4 steps in the morning and another 4 at night). (1) Cleanse (however, I use Obagi&#x27;s facial cleanser b/c I prefer it over Neocutis&#x27;); (2) eye cream or balm (I use the cream); (3) BioSerum; (4) Journee Day Cream, SPF 30 in the AM and BioCream at night. My skin looks great for my age. On a side note, I read a review regarding Neocutis&#x27; use of an aborted boy baby for it&#x27;s use in research in making their product line. It had me stunned, so I looked into it. Here&#x27;s the skinny from my research, but please do your own. (1) They received a patch about the size of a postage stamp (this can be reproduced) to make a product that would help heal scarring of abused children/babies (burns, repeated beatings that removed the skin, etc. ). I saw the photos of the before, during and after. BREAKS your heart to see such abuse. (2) The boy baby was not viable. Now, I have had six pregnancies where the baby (fetus) was not viable. For me it meant that they had died (heart stopped and they quit growing). Except for my most recent one (went through labor, etc.), the others were all medically classified as &amp;#34;aborted&amp;#34; fetus&#x27;. Disturbing to read on your insurance benefits summary; however, medically speaking spontaneous abortion and miscarriage are the same. (4) Neocutis used their findings to create their skincare line. (4) In summary, this was not an aborted unwanted baby. This was a baby who was wanted, but the parents signed off on his use for research hoping something good could come out of something so sad. I, too, have donated two my of six babies.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, very smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what would happen if I didn&#x27;t use it so I have no way to say it is effective.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by my doctor post-surgery for the scar on my face after MOHS surgery. Not only is it visibly making a difference on the scar but it is also wonderful on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have extremely dry skin that gets very crepe-y in the winter. This helps keep my skin hydrated and smooth all winter long. Yes, it is expensive but a little does a long way. I only use it in the winter so I only buy 1 per year.</li>
            <li> Light, penetrating, soothing and smoothing, great ingredients, only cream I can use that lessens irritation and redness, hydrates and no perfume so no eye or facial swelling</li>
            <li> I have seen this cream work wonders on other&#x27;s, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I developed a fine rash on my face after using this cream for less than two weeks.  I had discarded the original box so a hard lesson and $85 later I have a cream I cant use.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this product is great but I definitely broke out from it. My skin might be too sensitive for it as I felt a stinging and burning sensation. Disappointed. I gave it to my mom after, she thought it was ok too. She didn&#x27;t notice any visible changes compared to Olay/Roc.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle purchased from Amazon.  I love this cream.  Thank you for having it available at such great prices.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. It was referred to be my my Plastic Surgeon, Dr Bucko in La Jolla, CA. It is wonderful. Anytime I start to feel like my face is getting tight, I immediately apply the cream and instantly the skin loosens a bit and feels as soft a it did right after my UV Laser Treatment, which I recommend to all. I use it morning and night. Plus, the price on Amazon is WAY less expensive if I get it from my surgeon!</li>
            <li> This is THEE only face cream the lives up to its promises, It&#x27;s worth the investment and I love the results</li>
            <li> Very soothing cream; it is helping to reduce fine lines in my face.</li>
            <li> I have used Neocutis for years and love the product. However, the last one I received broke apart within minutes. The casing was shabby and not of the standard I was used to. I have been reading about inferior/fake products being sold under the name of the brand product and think I just had my first experience with this situation. I bought it via &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; which obviously did not guarantee better quality. I will be wary the next time I make a purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. It goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ll be turning 48 in 5 days and I get compliments about my complex, daily.</li>
            <li> excellent product but cap is loose on the dispenser so if try to pick up by top it drops but since hard plastic it does not break  just annoying</li>
            <li> I have chemical peels every six weeks and this cream is the perfect complement to keeping my skin tone even and glowing. It helps in the healing process after peels and is a good moisturizer for everyday as well. It was recommended by the estetician in my dermatologists office but is less expensive to purchase through amazon. She herself said she would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Cell phone where not unlock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off since 2005. One of the top Dermatologists in Texas recommended it to me. At times I&#x27;ve had budget pressures and have rotated to other brands, but always come back to Neocutis when my skin starts looking tired again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While other brands might do a basic job (there are lots of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; skin creams), this one is outstanding. Supposedly there is no skin cream that actually &amp;#34;reverses aging,&amp;#34; as many claim. But I swear Neocutis comes pretty close to it. It makes a huge difference in my skin quality, softness, reducing redness, and reducing fine lines. No one ever guesses my age correctly, so maybe it helps. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this from the Dermatologist&#x27;s office, which of course was expensive. Pleased to find this on Amazon with a bit of a discount, and so far it&#x27;s always been delivered to me in great condition, as if I had just picked it up at the Derm&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> -wonderful face moisturizer  which actually does not break out my skin. However, it does not list the sun protector factor.  Is it a 15, 30? Living in Florida sun requires a minimum of 30 for those of us with delicate skin.</li>
            <li> lUV THIS PRODUCT.  WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST, HAVE HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE TELL ME I HAVE A GREAT COMPLEXION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT PLEASE GO BACK TO OLD PACKAGING, CANT TELL HOW MUCH IS REMANING IN BOTTLE AND IS TOO BIG, MAKES U THINK U HAVE MORE PRODUCT THAN U ACTUALLY DO, AND CAP NECER STAYS ON</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it is the only thing that has improved my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year now - goes on smooth and grease free - best of all it keeps me rosacea and sunburn free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Extra gentle - Even if you&#x27;re sunburned or your nose is red and painful from a cold - Neocutis goes on smooth and pain-free and since it&#x27;s a post-surgery creme, it helps reduce the redness and the burn away rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;- Helped keep my rosacea in check - I suffer from sun-triggered rosacea, so every time I travel to tropical climes, or when the weather warms up, my skin freaks out (my cheeks look like orange peels). This year however, even after the blazing Cambodian sun, I managed to survive with just a light bit of bumpiness (but no itching or redness) on my forehead, but no full blown outbreak or sunburn for that matter. I do admit that I was using the cream multiple times during the evenings after I had washed off the sunscreen and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s expensive - but to not have to suffer through days of itching, redness and just looking miserable - I&#x27;d say well worth it.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift after a minor cancer removal on my face.  This product was AMAZING and I have now returned the favor and given it as gifts to others who have had similar surgeries.  I love it as a face moisturizer and it is the only thing I use before I put on Makeup and I use it on any minor cuts that I get that just won&#x27;t heal.  The scar on my face is undetectable - I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Could not be happier</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It treats post surgery scars and other scars extremely well.  It has greatly reduced the keloiding of my scars, along with the look of the scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also purchased the NeoCutis Biorestorative Cream at Amazon.com for years!  This cream is amazing; I look years younger than my real age; but I&#x27;ll never tell and you&#x27;d never be able to guess!!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this product does not cause irritation, redness, or breakouts.  It is very, very expensive at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, so I was happy to see it for less here.  Is there something equally good at a more reasonable price?</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it helps</li>
            <li> NOT ABORTED FETAL CELLS!! I am an authorized seller of neocutis, although I do not sell on Amazon.  I have read multiple inaccurate reviews talking about it being made by aborted fetal cells.  This product was developed in Switzerland and initially was not researched for cosmetics.  However researchers with the university of Switzerland were studying collagen type 3 which is in abundance prior to 24 weeks gestation, and essentially gone at birth.  A patient miscarried at about 10 weeks.  The fetus in question was incompatible with life.  She did not abort, but miscarried.  However she didn&#x27;t pass the products of conception on her own and had to have a D&amp;C.  She was asked if she wanted the products, wanted them to be destroyed, or wanted to donate them to science and research.  She chose to donate them.  They were studied and collagen 3, as well as other growth factors, fibroblasts, and Interleukins were extracted.  As is commonly done these cells were placed on auger plates or growth medium to replicate and grow.  Some of the researchers eventually branched out and created neocutis using these harvested cells.  Like other cells they will replicate using the right auger (remember bio 101?!).  The auger medium alone contains no human growth factor.  That is still what is used to make PSP.  They do not use &amp;#34;aborted fetal cells&amp;#34;.  What is used is cells donated for research and development from one sad, but natural occurrence.  It has been made into hospital cream for wound healing, post skin graft, and burn healing amongst other dermatologic uses including aesthetics.  Do yourself a favor and stop perpetuating inaccurate, false information and do your research.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on so smooth and you don&#x27;t need much. I have only been using it for 2 weeks and can see a difference already.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is recommended after laser treatments because it has healing properties so why not use it every day!&lt;br /&gt;It is cosmetically elegant and is packed with the latest ingredients to improve your skins appearance.  Psp stimulates collegen and plumps up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with 4 other treatments daily (Skin medica TNS serum, Skin medica VIT C, Lumyxyl for pigmentation problems,  Neocutis Creme Rich eye cream &amp;Sunscreen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the really thing. Product comes in sealed package from manufacture.  Helps minimized fine lines. I can see a difference after a week using it.</li>
            <li> With my mild Rosacea,  this cream has worked out the best.  I like the texture, and need very tiny dots to do the job.</li>
            <li> I cannot express enough how much I love this product.  Creamy, but absorbs quickly.  Dermatologist said it was important to add growth factor and gave me this to try.  LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fantastic. Although, if you have oiler skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as its very rich.</li>
            <li> Price more reasonable than through my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> first,the vendor is fantastic,communicative,second the product is very good.I have been using it only for 1 week,skin is different,luminous and supple.very satisfied,I will buy again</li>
            <li> finishing up this first bottle  lasted 1&amp;1/2  months so far........ since i use retin a and the hyluronic acid with it  its tough to see what its impact is as these products are already amazing  ..... i use it on top of both of those and like that it isn&#x27;t a greasy or shine finish... drys real fast and at this point i already have another bottle ready to go on with my trial..... yes i think it does compliment my other products and would recommend it...  and whats the price to pay to have healthy young looking skin.....</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years!  It is by far the best daily use skin cream I have ever used...Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> No problems with my order.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for men as well.  If you are like me your skin gets oily later int he day.  I find this product to keep you skin fresh, non-oily all day long.  This product is usually sold in physician offices, but buy from Amazon.  Much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! It really does work!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Amazon  is excellent to deal with as well! I had an issue and with one email all was handled with ease and speed. Love this company!</li>
            <li> This is an average- good moisturizer. It is best for average- moderately dry skin. It is not a miracle worker, but it does have a nice texture &amp; no fragrance. It also is dispensed via a pump,ian advantage  over jar based cream , as bacteria  can degrade the contents (due to exposure to the air.)</li>
            <li> Been using for about a month. My skin feels more supple. Fine lines are diminished but I still notice them. I will try a more potent cream from them.</li>
            <li> Spreads thin and super emollient.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love these products and have been using them for years.  Excellent quality and excellent results everytime.&lt;br /&gt;Can recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday as my nighttime moisturize. I love these products and thanks to Amazon for giving me access to buy them somewhere other than the dermatologist otherwise I could not afford the line.</li>
            <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s a wonderful product. I use it every day. Makes you skin feel so hydrated and soft. Great smell too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost a year and have been happy with it until lately.  My face seems to be having a little problem with tiny white bumps.  I stopped using the cream and after two weeks or so the bumps do go away.&lt;br /&gt;I miss not using it because it does moisturize my skin,especially in dry and windy weather.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to a friend because I have had good luck with it.  Maybe I just used it too often!  It did such a great job in keeping the signs of age away! lol&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the Neocutis Bio-gel a turn to see if I am happier with that product.</li>
            <li> I use their eye cream which I have found to be very effective in reducing fine lines. At my age nothing topical will get rid of the deeper ones.&lt;br /&gt;The face cream is the same. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin does not dry out during the day and it works well with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this cream in conjunction with the serum to make the serum last longer.  Together, they are fantastic.  Hard core dimple-wrinkles have been diminished.  This product was recommended by my dermatologist - she uses it - and I have been really happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a product my dermatologist sells for a lot more.  I have been using for about 4 weeks and I definately see a result with skin smoothness, tightening and reduction in redness.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-forties and live in an extremely dry climate.  This product moisturizes very well without feeling greasy.  My skin is soft and looks more supple since I&#x27;ve been using it (about 3 months).  It is the only product that I have found that makes my hormone-induced malasma nearly disappear for most of the day. As long as I keep using the product, it stays VERY faint.</li>
            <li> does the job, my life loves it... what else is there?</li>
            <li> My dermotologist recommended me this product and told me that it&#x27;s the one that she has used for years.  It has no scent and is my favorite thing before bed.  As a product it is labeled for post-surgury.  I use it as an eye cream (my eyes are very sensitive to most products but this one I can put on my eye lids and under neith without any irritation).  face cream and on my neck before bed.  If I had to guess in five years I&#x27;ll thank this product for keeping my face looking so young.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist started me on this skin cream over a year ago and, at age 64, I can honestly say that I now have the best skin of my life!  This product feels wonderful and really quenches my skin as well as performing all of the magic of anti-aging in the process.  It provides a beautiful base under foundation - my makeup goes on smoothly and it puts the finishing touch on my night-time skin care routine.  My face feels and looks healthy.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough.</li>
            <li> Great product. My Plastic recommended it and it works. No more dry skin. You should buy it you&#x27;ll love it too</li>
            <li> Neocutis is a great cream, especially if you have had procedures done like microdermabrasion or laser treatments.  Very healing, perfect amount of moisture.  Not greasy.  Soothing.</li>
            <li> It is way too expansive but only moisturizer/lotion I am not allergic to.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not spf but otherwise ok.  i live in FL and you need spf all of the time so i seldom use it.</li>
            <li> The consistency is great. It doesn&#x27;t make you greasy and doesn&#x27;t get your necklines dirty. I use it under sunscreen and makeup and it works. It was recommended by my doctor because of some very intense winter dryness and it helped with that. I am not convinced that it makes me look younger but it makes my skin less dry and feels good. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> When I initially ordered this, the cream stung my face and the smell was pungent.  My dermatologist told me that it was a fake cream.  Amazon sent me a new one from this same seller.  The expiration date was the same but the new cream was fine.  No problems with bad smell or stinging.  This makes me curious as to what this seller is really selling.  Why was one cream, with the same expiration, so toxic but the other just fine??</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist&#x27;s aesthetician.  I don&#x27;t think it is emollient enough, but I am trying it.  She uses it not only as an after-treatment product, but also as a regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> Best hgh on market according to my Derm</li>
            <li> I like the eye cream in this line, and the tinted moisturizer with high SPF, but this is fairly average to me for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate deeply to me</li>
            <li> Been using this for 2 months. I have very good skin to begin with. Didn&#x27;t think it can get better but it did. My skin looks much younger and smoother. This stuff is amazing. I used the vitamin C serum with this cream as recommended by a previous review, and the result is magical!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this cream. I&#x27;ve tried several products from Sephore, Nerium and a few others and this is the BEST cream ever. I have seen fine lines decrease in appearance, its lightweight and people have noticed how radient my skin looks. I will never buy anything else</li>
            <li> This was a recommendation from my skin center.  They sell many lines and I decided to go with this one after talking with my consultant.  I  have used for 3 years and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I also use the eye cream.  I have tried the most expensive products from Saks etc. (LaMer) and I always go back to this gem.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream and last quite a long time.  Very silky on your skin and the sunscreen is a real plus.  Really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> All I can say is \\&quot;why can&#x27;t we make a product of this quality in the USA.\\&quot;  This is a product developed in Sweden. I was introduced to it by my Dr. after having a laser treatment. I have very thin skin with lots of fine lines. This product has saved my skin texture.  Forget all your other over the counter JUNK. This is the real deal and an investment in your skin. The 1.69 ounce lasts about 6 months and should be used sparingly.  I laugh everytime I see the ads on TV for the newest GIMMICK that can&#x27;t even penetrate your skin surface much less repair it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The packaging is terrible.  The lid will not stay on well enough to travel.  The bottle does not show you how much you have used, so you don&#x27;t know when you age running out.  Please go back to the old bottle, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Great sale and price. BioCream is by far one of the best anti-aging moisturizers out there...it helps with overall skin tone, texture, and appearance. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 years now and never plan on switching. I did for one day and my make-up looked dull..the BIoCream helps brighten your face. :)</li>
            <li> Feels like the bottle came already empty.. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I love the product but not so sure about the packaging.  It is a bit bulky for traveling.  I preferred the original one without the heavy covering even though it is definitely more handsome.</li>
            <li> This cream really works! I use it at night and it only takes one pump to moisturizer my face. I awake in the morning to smoother, firmer looking skin.</li>
            <li> Just putting on make up this morning and thinking how great my skin feels! I have excema and this has already helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> i said 95 % because my skin is really dry and dont last me all day ... so i have to mix it with other moisturizer but other than that i love it my sking look so much better ... im extremely alergic and i get rash right away but with this product my skin got so much healthyer .....</li>
            <li> Very pleased  with my purchase</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product at a great price!</li>
            <li> amazing product, my skin looks younger, less wrinkly, i recommend it 100%...  I use it with the gel and the eye cream</li>
            <li> Amount the size of a pea is all that is needed for the whole face.  Skin feels smooth and soft and looks good. Have been using for about 2 weeks but expect to get great results.</li>
            <li> great anti-aging product.  good product.  good packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Either they have changed the formula, this is a bad batch, or it&#x27;s not the real thing. The creme smells terrible - it should not have much of a scent at all.  It also does not spread well. Normally, a small dab will glide across my skin and the product will last me for months. This product is not gliding on at all and I have to mix it with another creme to get coverage over my face. Very displeased.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite beauty items.  I was afraid that it would be too heavy for me, but my skin has never looked better!  I am 46 years old, and I am constantly asked what I use on my skin.  This is one of my must haves!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for a awhile however this bottle had a very peculiar odor!! I used the product and seems to work the same.. I hope the next bottle does not smell this&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li> Great cream for the face. Expensive but much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> I use this under my regular sunscreen during the day and under my night cream at night.  It is especially good when I&#x27;ve damaged my skin with too much sun or too many harsh chemical creams.</li>
            <li> Great product but the new design creates that icky hard lotion goober every time you use pump - the old design did not do that plus it was easier to hold (the bottle was not as wide).  The old design of the bottle and pump worked perfectly so you were able to use every single bit of this expensive lotion and not lose any to those goobers.</li>
            <li> Neocutis is an excellent line, especially for ageing skin. A dermatologist I went to charged me at least twice as much for the same product. I was a little nervous about purchasing something like this online, so I went to a place I trusted - Amazon.com - and got exactly what I was looking for. It is pricy but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, doesn&#x27;t cause break outs. I think it has helped with my pigmentation and overall clarity. I really like!</li>
            <li> wife uses this all the time and loves it</li>
            <li> I started using Neoocutis Skin care products several months ago and my skin feels great!  Apparently, others have noticed as well since I&#x27;ve  received compliments on the appearance of my skin since I began using this line of skin care.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  I have been using this cream for a couple of years.  I have sensitive skin and this cream doesn&#x27;t cause any breakout.</li>
            <li> I love this product however its going up in price way too much.  I was able to get this for $78 now its like $95.  Too much $ but its addicting. I need something new to replace this product.</li>
            <li> I had used Neocutis before.  It is a great night cream that I use in conjunction with a Tretinoin Cream  nightly. It was somewhat cheaper on line then at the doctors office.</li>
            <li> Love love love this cream! The only downside is I wash my face 2 x a day I use 2 pumps twice a day it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. I did this time buy this bigger size hoping it will last more then a month.</li>
            <li> I trust the company to make a good product.  First bought this through a doctor&#x27;s clinic.  Was glad to find I could get it online for about 50% less.</li>
            <li> My skin has been wonderful since I started using this cream and it has sunscreen. I have been using this product for 3 years</li>
            <li> I got this after having Fraxel.  It goes on easy, is odorless, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after using.  It&#x27;s overpriced and ineffective.</li>
            <li> This cream contains remains of aborted fetous. It is so good because contains somebody else skin in it. Google it if you do not believ me.</li>
            <li> Huh. Did not have the great experience of other reviewers. It doesn&#x27;t provide the hydration I expected. Leaves my skin a little dry.  Over-the-counter Cerave is actually better.  The product was not expired and came in full packaging, so I don&#x27;t expect that it was a phony. Just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Horribly expensive. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    </ol>
