            <li>With this product, the ear repair, I am able to wear earrings again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad that they are on Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>so glad i found them:)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to order this product online as it&#x27;s no longer in stores.  </li>
            <li>I love Lobe Wonder.  </li>
            <li>I am able to avoid costly plastic surgery with this easy to use ear lobe cover pad.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery, as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, I would recommend anyone that has a stretch or slid ear lope to buy Lobe Wonder.  </li>
            <li>And they arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear any other than extremely lightweight earrings if it weren&#x27;t for these wonderful \\&quot;reinforcements\\&quot; for earlobes.</li>
            <li>I have already used this product in the past, so I knew it was great.  </li>
            <li>I Love these ingenious little things!</li>
            <li>Earrings stay snug and I am so pleased that I can wear pierced earrings despite my stretched openings.</li>
            <li>Will work really well</li>
            <li>They really help my torn ear lobe so my earrings don&#x27;t droop.  </li>
            <li>Worth it for those poor souls like me not blessed to have nice taut earlobe skin...</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because these new earrings are fish hook style and not post style, but</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without Lobe Wonder.  </li>
            <li>When I was young I ripped my ear wearing wire earrings while sailing.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try these because I bought some gorgeous hand-crocheted glass bead earrings that unfortunately weigh a ton (10 grams each) and stretch my lobes to unsightly levels.  </li>
            <li>I come across some really unique earrings and they are usually heavy.  </li>
            <li>My ear holes are not stretched as I usually wear very low weight diamond studs on a daily basis and rarely any costume/heavy earrings.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t usually write reviews; have used these before and found them to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li> they last for a long time, so don&#x27;t need to re&#x3D;order</li>
            <li> For someone with stretched pierced earring holes, this is the only way to go.  </li>
            <li> It was repaired but anytime I wore earrings with any weight it stretched.</li>
            <li> one ear has a larger hole that the other and my earrings kept falling out.  </li>
            <li> Without these stickers, I would be limited to my earring selection.  </li>
            <li> i can finally wear my heavy earrings again without my earholes being stretched and hurting!!</li>
            <li> I hope they can send me the other 3</li>
            <li> My ear lobes had become enlarged due wearing of heavy earrings over the years.  </li>
            <li> Use them everyday due to tear in my earlobe.</li>
            <li> seriously these things do not work at all and do not stick to the back of your ear lobe.  </li>
            <li> I now can wear all of my hoops and heavy pierced earrings and</li>
            <li> was unable to wear an earring in my left ear all day.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!  :(</li>
            <li> I would just remove it when it started to feel painful and just wore one earring the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> With this product, the ear repair, I am able to wear earrings again.  My ear lobes had become enlarged due wearing of heavy earrings over the years.  I am able to avoid costly plastic surgery with this easy to use ear lobe cover pad.</li>
            <li> I Love these ingenious little things! I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear any other than extremely lightweight earrings if it weren&#x27;t for these wonderful \\&quot;reinforcements\\&quot; for earlobes. And they arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li> When I was young I ripped my ear wearing wire earrings while sailing.  It was repaired but anytime I wore earrings with any weight it stretched. Now I just use Lobe Wonders on that ear and I can wear any earring.  Before I found these I could only use clip earrings.</li>
            <li> I come across some really unique earrings and they are usually heavy.  Without these stickers, I would be limited to my earring selection.  I saw a review on YouTube about these stickers and I just had to try them.  Now I am hooked, I buy batches at a time.  Earrings that I could only wear for 30 minutes because of the heaviness, I can now wear for 4 - 8 hours comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that they are on Amazon Prime so I don&#x27;t have to drive all the way to the mall to get them.</li>
            <li> These are great, my mother- in -law is really happy with them.  Claims their the best product on the market</li>
            <li> Product is excellent!  It will save your ears from future tearing-which mine did.  After surgery and one year, I wear any earrings with Lobe Wonder.  Save your ears!</li>
            <li> Will work really well once I learn to get to sticky thing over the hole in the back of my ear.  It will take a lot of practice.</li>
            <li> these are awesome! i can finally wear my heavy earrings again without my earholes being stretched and hurting!! so glad i found them:)</li>
            <li> These are great!  Don&#x27;t usually write reviews; have used these before and found them to be very helpful.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have already used this product in the past, so I knew it was great.  My unsightly hanging ear pierce holes no longer droop when wearing these Lobe Wonders with earrings.  Some times have to use two on each ear depending upon the weight.&lt;br /&gt;This was a great deal - getting three boxes of 120.  Worth it for those poor souls like me not blessed to have nice taut earlobe skin...</li>
            <li> They really help my torn ear lobe so my earrings don&#x27;t droop.  they last for a long time, so don&#x27;t need to re&#x3D;order</li>

            <li> I love this product. I now can wear all of my hoops and heavy pierced earrings and my earlobes look oerfect.</li>
            <li> I will use this product forever! I can now wear both earrings, the dangling, fashionable, styles, ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to wear an earring in my left ear all day. I would just remove it when it started to feel painful and just wore one earring the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product years ago so I just decided to give it a try. So glad I did. I have no problem giving my earlobes the added support they needed.</li>
            <li> one ear has a larger hole that the other and my earrings kept falling out.  These help keep the earrings in great.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this wonderful product years ago....  Cannot wear earrings without the support lobe.</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to order this product online as it&#x27;s no longer in stores.  Great price and quality. Very quick delivery, as well.  Will definitely reorder when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> I only received a case of 3 , not 6 as advertised.  I hope they can send me the other 3 as i PAID FOR THEM</li>
            <li> Great product for torn/stretched ear lobes.  My girls even use these and they don&#x27;t have the problem, but it protects their piercings . . .</li>
            <li> Use them everyday due to tear in my earlobe.</li>
            <li> I love these Lobe Wonders and have used them for many years!  For someone with stretched pierced earring holes, this is the only way to go.  Earrings stay snug and I am so pleased that I can wear pierced earrings despite my stretched openings. Thank you lobe wonder!</li>
            <li> I love Lobe Wonder.  I can&#x27;t live without Lobe Wonder.  It&#x27;s fantastic, I would recommend anyone that has a stretch or slid ear lope to buy Lobe Wonder.  You will love it!</li>
