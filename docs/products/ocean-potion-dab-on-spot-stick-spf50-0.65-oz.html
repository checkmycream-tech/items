            <li>Also, as a fair skined blond, I need to reapply often when skiing.  </li>

            <li>and I will buy more!</li>
            <li>They find it so easy to use that they use it!</li>
            <li>I have to keep my nose protected and this handy stick is easy to keep with me in case</li>
            <li>Buy multiples because you will want more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>I bought these years ago for my kids&#x27; ears and exposed scalp after parting their hair, and fell in love with the product.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with it</li>
            <li>lightweight, clear and great SPF</li>
            <li>This stick is more of a liquid and dries clear and clean... LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>not greasy, easy to apply to face.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>this is my absolute favorite &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; sunscreen ... goes on easy with the dab on feature....</li>
            <li>If I am super methodical about the strokes to apply it, it&#x27;s fine, though.</li>
            <li>He really likes this product so I ordered more than one unit.</li>
            <li>Super convenient form factor.</li>
            <li>Goes on quickly and evenly and protects you from burning without and greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get comfortable using on my kids because I can&#x27;t really tell where it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Okay on sensitive baby skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and protects your nose in particular.</li>
            <li>for products that contain these particular chemicals (which have been questioned is high dosages), Ocean Potion is a safe product and the company does not test on animals.</li>
            <li>so have to be careful to get good coverage since you can&#x27;t really see where you have put the product.</li>
            <li>Way better than the solid stick sunscreens out there now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Ocean Potion products for years, but this was the first time I tried this one.</li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t what I expected and requires more skill to apply than should be necessary for facial sunblock, it is effective and I&#x27;ll finish it while looking for something else that works better for me.</li>
            <li>trick is to get the flow of sunblock going without it starting to drip all over the place, which isn&#x27;t all that easy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and is only has a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>It burned for HOURS with no relief at all, despite how much I flushed.</li>
            <li>If you end up with too much, you have to spread it around and it takes longer to dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s a lot like those old gold and silver metallic pens with spongey points that smelled like paint and had to be shaken really</li>
            <li>The only downside is, I wish it came in a smaller size that would EASILY fit in my pocket.</li>
            <li>I need  a few more words to complete this review</li>
            <li>My 9 year old son who hates putting sunscreen on his face loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes, you may find the vapors disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it is relatively short-lived and mostly disappears once the sunblock has dried.</li>
            <li>If you can manage to apply the proper amount, it does dry quickly as advertised.</li>

            <li> Ocean Potion is one of a very few facial products that I can use and know my sensitive and allergic skin will not break out.  </li>
            <li> It also does dry matte and is non-greasy.</li>

            <li> Use extreme caution and I would not use this on kids at all.</li>
            <li> I think you expect something to burn a little if it gets in your eyes, but this is severe.</li>
            <li> You press the applicator firmly against your skin until the sponge soaks up the liquid block and transfers it to your skin.</li>
            <li> The rim around my eye was actually swollen and red and the inside of my eye was burned so badly, I thought it would require an ER visit.   </li>

            <li> It does not have that annoying greasy feeling and it does not smear when you wipe sweat.</li>
            <li> All of us got terribly burned on our faces and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not greasy, easy to apply to face. If you are sweatinng you should reapply. Container does not leak in the heat. I keep a supply for golf and all summer activities.</li>
            <li> It works great on my kids heads, providing protection along the part line in their hair.....since they won&#x27;t wear hats!  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and is only has a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Works for hours.  Easy to use.  Okay on sensitive baby skin.  Buy multiples because you will want more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Super convenient form factor. I can&#x27;t get comfortable using on my kids because I can&#x27;t really tell where it&#x27;s on. If I am super methodical about the strokes to apply it, it&#x27;s fine, though.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old son who hates putting sunscreen on his face loves this stuff.  It goes on like water - no greasy feeling!  Provides great sun protection and he can put it on himself.  Only down side is there is no color so have to be careful to get good coverage since you can&#x27;t really see where you have put the product.</li>
            <li> I dabbed this on my forehead and I guess a drop dripped into my eye. It burned for HOURS with no relief at all, despite how much I flushed. I think you expect something to burn a little if it gets in your eyes, but this is severe. I don&#x27;t believe something that is marketed for use on the face should cause such a severe chemical eye burn.  The rim around my eye was actually swollen and red and the inside of my eye was burned so badly, I thought it would require an ER visit.   Use extreme caution and I would not use this on kids at all.</li>
            <li> As a strawberry-blonde with very fair skin, my scalp ALWAYS burns. I hate the other sticks because they are so greasy and thick, that a hair washing immediately after - is necessary! This stick is more of a liquid and dries clear and clean... LOVE IT!! Buy multiples- you will want more!</li>
            <li> I bought these years ago for my kids&#x27; ears and exposed scalp after parting their hair, and fell in love with the product.  Now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere, but online.  Non greasy, easy application, great product!  Way better than the solid stick sunscreens out there now.  I bought two, one for home and one for the diaper bag!</li>
            <li> my Husband and my Son can not stand the way sunscreen feels once applied to their face...this is the way to go!! lightweight, clear and great SPF</li>
            <li> I used this all over me and my kids. All of us got terribly burned on our faces and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, but it offered no protection for my family.</li>
            <li> Me and my dad both use this when we ride. It goes on easy and protects your nose in particular. It does not have that annoying greasy feeling and it does not smear when you wipe sweat.</li>
            <li> I have to keep my nose protected and this handy stick is easy to keep with me in case I wash my face or go in the water. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ocean Potion products for years, but this was the first time I tried this one. Based on the &amp;#34;dab-on&amp;#34; description, I was expecting this product to be like one of those ginormous Chapstick sunblocks, a solid material that rubbed on the skin. It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s actually a liquid with a spongey applicator. You press the applicator firmly against your skin until the sponge soaks up the liquid block and transfers it to your skin. (It&#x27;s a lot like those old gold and silver metallic pens with spongey points that smelled like paint and had to be shaken really well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to get the flow of sunblock going without it starting to drip all over the place, which isn&#x27;t all that easy. If you can manage to apply the proper amount, it does dry quickly as advertised. It also does dry matte and is non-greasy. If you end up with too much, you have to spread it around and it takes longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it may technically be fragrance-free, it is a chemical sunblock (as opposed to a physical one) so it isn&#x27;t odorless. The scent is strongish, especially when applied to the face, which was the reason I bought it. However, it is relatively short-lived and mostly disappears once the sunblock has dried. If you have sensitive eyes, you may find the vapors disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for products that contain these particular chemicals (which have been questioned is high dosages), Ocean Potion is a safe product and the company does not test on animals. While it isn&#x27;t what I expected and requires more skill to apply than should be necessary for facial sunblock, it is effective and I&#x27;ll finish it while looking for something else that works better for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my husband who plays golf and is out in the sun quite often.  He puts it on his face and it protects him from burning.  He really likes this product so I ordered more than one unit.</li>
            <li> This stick is great for faces and or kids!  Goes on quickly and evenly and protects you from burning without and greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Ocean Potion is one of a very few facial products that I can use and know my sensitive and allergic skin will not break out.  Also, as a fair skined blond, I need to reapply often when skiing.  With this product, I can avoid getting sunburned.  I like the dab-on packaging, so I can carry it in my jacket pocket.  The only downside is, I wish it came in a smaller size that would EASILY fit in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Smells awful. Reminds me of a bug repellant. I need  a few more words to complete this review BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD</li>
            <li> I get these for every man I know.  They find it so easy to use that they use it!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I received when they told me I was supposed to be receiving. Satisfied with it and I will buy more!</li>
            <li> this is my absolute favorite &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; sunscreen ... goes on easy with the dab on feature....does not burn when re-applied...excellent coverage!!</li>
