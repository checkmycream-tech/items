            <li>It is a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>I love Liz Claiborne products.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Cute box, though.</li>
            <li>and i wasn&#x27;t sure what it would smell like.</li>
            <li>and hubby says he likes it too! :)</li>

            <li>Not at all like the men&#x27;s scent, which I absolutely love...</li>
            <li>This perfume leave you with a warm very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, one of those scents that smells so familiar for some reason, yet I can&#x27;t put my finger on it.</li>
            <li>, I make sure I am stocked up with 5 or more Curve perfumes, because everyone wants to know what is it that I wearing, that smells so good.</li>
            <li>but it kind of reminds me of cotton candy but not  too sweet... and rhe smell lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>Loved it was everything I expected and came in great time.</li>
            <li>This perfume is a nice scent of light sweet florals it is not over powering.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong.  </li>
            <li>the packaging is a purple tin box which is delightful to put on your table top and keeps the sunlight from the bottle  preventing excessive evaporation.</li>
            <li>Love that it showed up at my door so quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the mild scent.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great and last all day.</li>
            <li>IS LIGHT AND SWEET.</li>
            <li>I love this fragance so much</li>

            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Got this one for my girlfriend because the price it right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite floral, but it&#x27;s a deep womanly smell, no word to describes it better than &#x27;sexy&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Prices are so much higher when you order it else where.</li>
            <li>So glad I ordered from Amazon much cheaper and bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li>i decided to wait and check the price here on Amazon before purchasing it there since i can usually get prettty good deals on items through amazon.</li>
            <li>I have never written a fragrance review, which is a little funny consider I own 40 colognes for myself.</li>
            <li>my lil teen cousin loves this very much, she sports this scent all day!!</li>
            <li>This perfume is very seductive.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to know what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot ups...  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon..  </li>
            <li>Thanks Liz...  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not wearing it very often.  </li>
            <li>It arrived fast...</li>
            <li>less than a week:)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended ....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a gift or for yourself</li>
            <li>Was I ever surprised !!  </li>
            <li>and the smell is very soft...</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and it lasts through the day unbelievably.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little too strong for my taste</li>
            <li>One of my co-workers was wearing it and when I found out what it was I thought it might just be a fragrance for the young</li>
            <li>This has to be one of my least favorite perfumes that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Too much musk, not enough floral.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Stay classy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, only sometimes it smells a little like musk or a guys perfume than a flirty female fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is really hard to describe this scent but it is a very  light and really doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>so I thought Ok at least let me try it !</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this perfume after sampling it at a department store. i decided to wait and check the price here on Amazon before purchasing it there since i can usually get prettty good deals on items through amazon. This perfume is very seductive. i get alot of compliments whenever i wear it. If you are into the flirty slightly sweet scents then you will like this!! i love it!!</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift for my birthday ! I thought \\&quot;oh I don,t know about this\\&quot; ,never had experienced this fragrance.I love Tre&#x27;sor so I thought Ok at least let me try it !Was I ever surprised !!

            <li> I Bought this for my girlfriend and I&#x27;m in love with  this scent.. It lingers on her clothes for quite a while also.... Highly recommended ....</li>
            <li> Curve Crush is wonderful! I have been getting a lot of compliments since I started using it. And the scent is not overpowering like some fragrances can be. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok.. no staying power at all. Scent is gone within the hour.</li>
            <li> So lovely, this fragrance blows you away!  Love it!  I where it and get lots of compliments on it.  Always having to order again ...so good.</li>
            <li> my lil teen cousin loves this very much, she sports this scent all day!! This was a lovely lil gift for her.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not overpowering or bothersome.  It is a nice light scent.  Love that it showed up at my door so quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells nice. It is not too strong.  It works well in a closed environment.  I enjoy using it.  I love Liz Claiborne products. I have used her products before and they work well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and it lasts through the day unbelievably. One of my co-workers was wearing it and when I found out what it was I thought it might just be a fragrance for the young but I decided to take a chance and when I wear it I always get complements.  I would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> smell very nice and for cheap price</li>

This has to be one of my least favorite perfumes that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, only sometimes it smells a little like musk or a guys perfume than a flirty female fragrance. Not a favorite. Cute box, though.</li>
            <li> I remember this smell from when I was younger but I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;ve changed the formula. Too much musk, not enough floral. Smells like baby powder. I use it with other perfume to get the smell I&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li> Wow. I have never written a fragrance review, which is a little funny consider I own 40 colognes for myself. Got this one for my girlfriend because the price it right. It smells amazing, one of those scents that smells so familiar for some reason, yet I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. Maybe because I&#x27;ve smelled it in my dreams! Who knows. It&#x27;s infatuating. It&#x27;s not quite floral, but it&#x27;s a deep womanly smell, no word to describes it better than &#x27;sexy&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And kudos to Amazon, because initially I had requested a refund because the package was not at my door even tho it said it was delivered. But today a lady dropped it off, saying it had been delivered to the wrong address and ups wouldn&#x27;t pick it up to redeliver! Thanks a lot ups...  Stay classy. Anyways I told amazon to recharge me for the item cuz I didn&#x27;t wanna rip them off. And they told me because I was honest, to just keep the package and they won&#x27;t charge me again. Can&#x27;t beat service like that! Thanks amazon..  Thanks Liz...  And screw you, UPS.</li>
            <li> I Wear this all the time so I have always loved the smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent and a very good price! Very happy!</li>
            <li> ordered this perfume when i had no idea what to order and i wasn&#x27;t sure what it would smell like. loved it...and hubby says he likes it too! :)&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I simply love this scent on me ladies!</li>

            <li> This perfume leave you with a warm very fresh feeling. the packaging is a purple tin box which is delightful to put on your table top and keeps the sunlight from the bottle  preventing excessive evaporation.</li>
            <li> Fragrance last almost all day. Love the mild scent. Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is one of my favorites. Prices are so much higher when you order it else where. So glad I ordered from Amazon much cheaper and bigger bottle.  The smell is great and last all day. Shipping was very fast. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast... less than a week:) and the smell is very soft... maybe its just me but it kind of reminds me of cotton candy but not  too sweet... and rhe smell lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> very good, on time, excelent product</li>
            <li> Delightful fragrance love it.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the men&#x27;s scent, which I absolutely love...oh, well, I tried it.</li>
