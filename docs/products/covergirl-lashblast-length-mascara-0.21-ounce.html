            <li>So basically great with length</li>
            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>It is actually perfect for bottom lashes since the formula is light and the brush is actually very good for definition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Not as great as their lashblast and the mascara drys up kind of clumpy.</li>

            <li>The difference in before and after is amazing, and that&#x27;s WITHOUT curling, primer, and my meticulous separation technique.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it adds an amazing amount of length.</li>

            <li>What I especially liked about the old formula was the brush.  </li>

            <li>Came quickly!!</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>But Covergirl lashblast is much better, the purple or orange tube.</li>

            <li>I have gotten so many comments on my hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>Hopefully product is better.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite mascara now.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Woo-Hoo :)</li>
            <li>I got more of it on my eyelids than my lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I love the end result</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Once your done, I&#x27;d suggest saving the brush to apply your favorite formula to bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, the product is very light, but does a wonderful job making lashes look longer.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush on this product and felt that it did a good job of separating my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get much smudging or flaking, so that was good.  </li>
            <li>I have the original CoverGirl lashblast and its one of my favorite mascara&#x27;s i</li>
            <li>This washes of easily</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s holding strong.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself was fine, I just did not like how it looked on my eye lashes.</li>
            <li>I strongly prefer the original Lashblast in the chunky  orange tube.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky smooth without all the greasy residues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; so to speak, look and this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>a few coats to see the mascara&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great Mascara!</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, looks good on and last all day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed in that at all.</li>
            <li>I LIKE THE ORIGINAL AND LASH BLAST LUXE</li>
            <li>have fun!</li>
            <li>but it had no volume like the original LashBlast to me.</li>
            <li>but I have lenght+volume with my original CoverGirl lashblast.</li>
            <li>Great for girls with lots of lashes that are really long.</li>
            <li>This mascara is very easy to use and makes my lashes look nice and long.</li>
            <li>It always applies cleanly without any clumps and never flakes or smears under my eyes during the day.  </li>
            <li>She thinks the color (black) is great and that it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post more pics when I have time to really play with it.    </li>
            <li>This is my go-to mascara for a nice daytime natural lash look.  </li>
            <li>I received a product rebate in the mail today for full value of the product</li>
            <li>Like most mascaras, it takes a few applications to get a really good result.  </li>
            <li>It really does add some nice length but not that much volume.</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe not an 80% increase in length, but more than enough for me.</li>
            <li>This mascara is great for an everyday or &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; make up look and is very gentle and easy to remove on my lashes.</li>
            <li>The formula isn&#x27;t thick at all, so if you&#x27;re going for a fresh and natural look, it&#x27;s perfect for your top lashes as well.</li>
            <li>I first bought the above mascara while on holiday in the States, and found it really good, as it doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>Now is only it could it could just magically \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the rest of my face!.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway CoverGirl!!</li>
            <li>If (like me) you prefer a more natural look to your make-up then give this product a try!</li>
            <li>have yet to find the perfect mascara, but Covergirl&#x27;s old version in the black and gray bottle was the closest I had come and worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>Not clumpy not too much just enough to notice and look good not like I&#x27;m goin out clubbing.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this is the pretty yellow tube, which is almost pleasant enough to make you forget about how much this mascara sucks.</li>
            <li>although it looked great at first, after a couple of hours my eyelashes &amp;#34;fell flat&amp;#34; which does not happen with the mascara I usually use.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it my lashes look so long and full</li>
            <li>Unlike the old version, it does not wipe off easily.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the wand very much.</li>
            <li>Like this mascara very much.  </li>
            <li>Made my lashes unbelievably long and not a single clump - it lives up to its promises and has fibers in it to make your lashes look super long - it is the best mascara I have ever tried</li>
            <li>I think I like the regular Lashblast Mascara better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one for makeup, and my eyelashes have always been long/dark enough, but since I started wearing BB cream I like to put something on my eyes to make them pop a bit more.</li>
            <li>I guess, when I first seen it in the stores I said to myself I have to have this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using this brand</li>
            <li>I prefer maybeline colassal which gives good volume and length and Loreals voluminous carbon black (but be careful with this one, don&#x27;t put too many coats or it will look too clumpy).</li>
            <li>Bought this mascara with high hopes -- haven&#x27;t worn eye makeup in fifteen years, so was excited to try out the new mascaras.</li>
            <li>When I got my 2nd tube, I used the original brush and saved the new clean brush for a lash comb.</li>
            <li>Also, it is easy to wash off with regular face soap.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lengthen the way it claims and certainly does nothing for volume.</li>
            <li>So, it has always been hard to find good mascara to seperated my lashes.</li>
            <li>However if you want something with über volume and intense lengthening then look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll have to get a real waterproof mascara, not just a water-resistent one.</li>
            <li>It extends my eyelashes very well without clumping.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>This mascara really brings my lower lashes out so that I don&#x27;t have to wear eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I ended up not using the whole tube of it--</li>
            <li>I swear by this mascara, it really makes your lashes longer.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not flakey like some mascaras, it&#x27;s really greasy looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gummy and sticky and would just smear across my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>I only use the water proof and it acts like a regular mascara, very easy to take off</li>
            <li>AND THIS MASCARA GAVE THEM SOME LENGTH, BUT THE OTHER COVER GIRL MASCARAS GAVE MORE DEPTH AND FULLNESS.</li>
            <li>This went on well, clumped very little, lengthened nicely.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very, very long, but they are fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a great mascara, and I have certainly tried a ton of them - everything from drugstore brands to expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>It does darken lashes a bit and separate and define decently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple mascaras (some good, some bad), but this one is clump free, flake free, and well defines your lashes.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high hope for this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 and have been using mascara since high school, so I have some</li>
            <li>Yes, it does make your lashes longer, but I felt like the lashes themselves were thinner and a little more brittle after I used this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for the ideal mascara.  </li>
            <li>I am a brunette with green eyes, so I appreciate a product that adds length (and a bit of color) without overwhelming my shadow or eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, save it for a better quality mascara.</li>
            <li>Nice deep black color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark, applies easily, and it&#x27;s not clumpy.</li>
            <li>I have very thin lashes and this product is great for me.</li>
            <li>it seemed like it wasent that new</li>
            <li>This mascara smells odd, and the scent is strong.</li>
            <li>Package looks very old.</li>
            <li>This mascara is very natural looking and never gets cake or clumpy.</li>
            <li>I have honestly about 10 different brands and they all make my lashes messy and stuck together this one WORKS!</li>
            <li>They clearly warn you to use their mascara in a sanitary manner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far my one and only mascara, I found that by using this as layer one (and optional for the divas out there a layer three) it really extended my lashes with out clumps.</li>
            <li>Clearly this does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>But Amazon very graciously sent me three replacements, but all of them gave the same results (practically zero).    </li>
            <li>Maybe I got an old tube or something, but there was basically nothing there.  </li>
            <li>It definitely lengthens, but does not give too much volume, which it isn&#x27;t for anyways.</li>
            <li>All clumpy, she said she thinks it was really old.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have never been sensitive to makeup before</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I was sent an old product or</li>
            <li>So far this is my favourite mascara.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a great mascara for teenage girls just starting to wear makeup, who don&#x27;t want to dramatic of a look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, if you want dramatic, thick lashes you might need to try another mascara but for a natural look it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It has been very hard to come by in New Zealand, so managed to get some more through Amazon.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are already long, so I think that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li>My lashes are pretty long and dark as is, so I can&#x27;t speak too well to the lengthening claim, but it gives mine slightly more volume to them without going overboard and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Adds length to short eyelashes, but very natural feeling.</li>
            <li>Lastly it came a day early!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the original LashBlast, but this was hugely disappointing.</li>
            <li>I had to end up taking it off completely and starting over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes - in fact, it barely did anything to them at all.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and it doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes hours later like some of the more expensive brands do.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when I put the brand new applicator wand into the mascara and pulled out the wand with a long hair wrapped around it.     </li>
            <li>I went back to my old standard, Lash Out.</li>
            <li>It clumps &amp; the brush is nothing special at all making it hard to wear ...</li>
            <li>Maybe I somehow got an old tube (a problem in and of itself), but it seemed incredibly dry and didn&#x27;t want to stick to either the wand or my lashes.</li>
            <li>My mascara that I received was pretty dried up and only lasted for about a week.</li>
            <li>This mascara was pretty disappointing compared to the original Lash Blast.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Woo-Hoo :)</li>
            <li> I got more of it on my eyelids than my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I love the end result</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Once your done, I&#x27;d suggest saving the brush to apply your favorite formula to bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, the product is very light, but does a wonderful job making lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush on this product and felt that it did a good job of separating my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get much smudging or flaking, so that was good.  </li>
            <li> I have the original CoverGirl lashblast and its one of my favorite mascara&#x27;s i</li>
            <li> This washes of easily</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s holding strong.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself was fine, I just did not like how it looked on my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I strongly prefer the original Lashblast in the chunky  orange tube.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky smooth without all the greasy residues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; so to speak, look and this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> a few coats to see the mascara&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great Mascara!</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, looks good on and last all day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed in that at all.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE ORIGINAL AND LASH BLAST LUXE</li>
            <li> have fun!</li>
            <li> but it had no volume like the original LashBlast to me.</li>
            <li> but I have lenght+volume with my original CoverGirl lashblast.</li>
            <li> Great for girls with lots of lashes that are really long.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very easy to use and makes my lashes look nice and long.</li>
            <li> It always applies cleanly without any clumps and never flakes or smears under my eyes during the day.  </li>
            <li> She thinks the color (black) is great and that it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post more pics when I have time to really play with it.    </li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara for a nice daytime natural lash look.  </li>
            <li> I received a product rebate in the mail today for full value of the product</li>
            <li> Like most mascaras, it takes a few applications to get a really good result.  </li>
            <li> It really does add some nice length but not that much volume.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe not an 80% increase in length, but more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for an everyday or &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; make up look and is very gentle and easy to remove on my lashes.</li>
            <li> The formula isn&#x27;t thick at all, so if you&#x27;re going for a fresh and natural look, it&#x27;s perfect for your top lashes as well.</li>
            <li> I first bought the above mascara while on holiday in the States, and found it really good, as it doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li> Now is only it could it could just magically \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the rest of my face!.</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway CoverGirl!!</li>
            <li> If (like me) you prefer a more natural look to your make-up then give this product a try!</li>
            <li> have yet to find the perfect mascara, but Covergirl&#x27;s old version in the black and gray bottle was the closest I had come and worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> Not clumpy not too much just enough to notice and look good not like I&#x27;m goin out clubbing.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this is the pretty yellow tube, which is almost pleasant enough to make you forget about how much this mascara sucks.</li>
            <li> although it looked great at first, after a couple of hours my eyelashes &amp;#34;fell flat&amp;#34; which does not happen with the mascara I usually use.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it my lashes look so long and full</li>
            <li> Unlike the old version, it does not wipe off easily.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the wand very much.</li>
            <li> Like this mascara very much.  </li>
            <li> Made my lashes unbelievably long and not a single clump - it lives up to its promises and has fibers in it to make your lashes look super long - it is the best mascara I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I think I like the regular Lashblast Mascara better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for makeup, and my eyelashes have always been long/dark enough, but since I started wearing BB cream I like to put something on my eyes to make them pop a bit more.</li>
            <li> I guess, when I first seen it in the stores I said to myself I have to have this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this brand</li>
            <li> I prefer maybeline colassal which gives good volume and length and Loreals voluminous carbon black (but be careful with this one, don&#x27;t put too many coats or it will look too clumpy).</li>
            <li> Bought this mascara with high hopes -- haven&#x27;t worn eye makeup in fifteen years, so was excited to try out the new mascaras.</li>
            <li> When I got my 2nd tube, I used the original brush and saved the new clean brush for a lash comb.</li>
            <li> Also, it is easy to wash off with regular face soap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really lengthen the way it claims and certainly does nothing for volume.</li>
            <li> So, it has always been hard to find good mascara to seperated my lashes.</li>
            <li> However if you want something with über volume and intense lengthening then look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll have to get a real waterproof mascara, not just a water-resistent one.</li>
            <li> It extends my eyelashes very well without clumping.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> This mascara really brings my lower lashes out so that I don&#x27;t have to wear eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I ended up not using the whole tube of it--</li>
            <li> I swear by this mascara, it really makes your lashes longer.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not flakey like some mascaras, it&#x27;s really greasy looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gummy and sticky and would just smear across my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I only use the water proof and it acts like a regular mascara, very easy to take off</li>
            <li> AND THIS MASCARA GAVE THEM SOME LENGTH, BUT THE OTHER COVER GIRL MASCARAS GAVE MORE DEPTH AND FULLNESS.</li>
            <li> This went on well, clumped very little, lengthened nicely.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very, very long, but they are fine.  </li>
            <li> This is a great mascara, and I have certainly tried a ton of them - everything from drugstore brands to expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> It does darken lashes a bit and separate and define decently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple mascaras (some good, some bad), but this one is clump free, flake free, and well defines your lashes.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hope for this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 and have been using mascara since high school, so I have some</li>
            <li> Yes, it does make your lashes longer, but I felt like the lashes themselves were thinner and a little more brittle after I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for the ideal mascara.  </li>
            <li> I am a brunette with green eyes, so I appreciate a product that adds length (and a bit of color) without overwhelming my shadow or eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, save it for a better quality mascara.</li>
            <li> Nice deep black color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark, applies easily, and it&#x27;s not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I have very thin lashes and this product is great for me.</li>
            <li> it seemed like it wasent that new</li>
            <li> This mascara smells odd, and the scent is strong.</li>
            <li> Package looks very old.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very natural looking and never gets cake or clumpy.</li>
            <li> I have honestly about 10 different brands and they all make my lashes messy and stuck together this one WORKS!</li>
            <li> They clearly warn you to use their mascara in a sanitary manner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far my one and only mascara, I found that by using this as layer one (and optional for the divas out there a layer three) it really extended my lashes with out clumps.</li>
            <li> Clearly this does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> But Amazon very graciously sent me three replacements, but all of them gave the same results (practically zero).    </li>
            <li> Maybe I got an old tube or something, but there was basically nothing there.  </li>
            <li> It definitely lengthens, but does not give too much volume, which it isn&#x27;t for anyways.</li>
            <li> All clumpy, she said she thinks it was really old.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have never been sensitive to makeup before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was sent an old product or</li>
            <li> So far this is my favourite mascara.</li>
            <li> I think this would be a great mascara for teenage girls just starting to wear makeup, who don&#x27;t want to dramatic of a look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, if you want dramatic, thick lashes you might need to try another mascara but for a natural look it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It has been very hard to come by in New Zealand, so managed to get some more through Amazon.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are already long, so I think that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li> My lashes are pretty long and dark as is, so I can&#x27;t speak too well to the lengthening claim, but it gives mine slightly more volume to them without going overboard and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Adds length to short eyelashes, but very natural feeling.</li>
            <li> Lastly it came a day early!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the original LashBlast, but this was hugely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had to end up taking it off completely and starting over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes - in fact, it barely did anything to them at all.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and it doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes hours later like some of the more expensive brands do.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I put the brand new applicator wand into the mascara and pulled out the wand with a long hair wrapped around it.     </li>
            <li> I went back to my old standard, Lash Out.</li>
            <li> It clumps &amp; the brush is nothing special at all making it hard to wear ...</li>
            <li> Maybe I somehow got an old tube (a problem in and of itself), but it seemed incredibly dry and didn&#x27;t want to stick to either the wand or my lashes.</li>
            <li> My mascara that I received was pretty dried up and only lasted for about a week.</li>
            <li> This mascara was pretty disappointing compared to the original Lash Blast.</li>
            <li> I like the fine bristles but the brush itself is weak and too bendable, and a bit too long.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite because it doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on easily, and does not leave those annoying black smears under your eyelid at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> If you stumble across a product that you do like, it is sure to be discontinued, and you start that expensive hunt all over again looking for an exceptable product.    </li>
            <li> This product is clearly not sanitary, and since I am now grossed out with it, why would I buy the same product again?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very much volume like the regular cover girl mascara</li>
            <li> , you would not believe how horrid expensive looking mascara is on them, espcially with a huge brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if your just looking for a natural everyday look to your eyes</li>
            <li> Maybe it was old and dried up or something because it did NOTHING to my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thinner lashes, but a lot of them, esp.</li>
            <li> I might have gotten a tube that sat around for too long, but I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Not really mega-lengthening or anything, but it definitely lengthens.  </li>
            <li> this is a great base as it darkens and slightly</li>
            <li> I wear this every day and each tube lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This creates a problem when choosing mascara, it always clumps or sticks my short little eye lashes together</li>
            <li> I bought this because the brush was the closest to the old brush, but the mascara just sucks.</li>
            <li> This is going in the trash, a definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful not to rub my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> result is not as I expected</li>
            <li> Like an empty tube.</li>
            <li> I am normally a clinique fanatic, but recently I found that they changed their formula and it was like wearing waterproof mascara every day, which was too hard to remove.</li>
            <li> It was easier to wash off compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I was always skeptical of the &amp;#34;cheap drugstore&amp;#34; products, but this one really came through!</li>
            <li> It lengthens as much as an other mascara, but it applies extremely well compared to others.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand the other glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to finally have found a mascara that is not clumpy, too dark, too impossible to remove, or too expensive!</li>
            <li> it flakes really badly, and smudges easily.</li>
            <li> - gonna buy tons of it now because it is a limited editon!!!</li>
            <li> Another problem was that this product seems to have less mascara compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> This product was not worth having.  </li>
            <li> as this mascara is a little thin, also I seem to be buying a new tube every month or so, thank god</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes you do need to build it up a little with 2 or 3</li>
            <li> It had these short, pointy little rubber nubs that separated the lashes while you applied, yet it allowed it to go on thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the mascara anyway</li>
            <li> No need to spend all kinds of crazy money on those expensive mascaras when this does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t have black around my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> and it is very black.</li>
            <li> If i get a mascara like this usually if i put a few coats on it builds up to give some sort of volume or length.</li>
            <li> I returned this because it adds very little product to your lashes.</li>
            <li> No volume, very little length.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are waay too small.  </li>
            <li> The brush is small and seperates each lash.</li>
            <li> The wand is very thin and does not hold much product, so the application is very subtle.</li>
            <li> I usually have dull lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> The lashblastlength mascara I purchased is dry and clumpy, and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Was hard to get my lower lashes</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say not to at least try this.</li>
            <li> I would have complained to the seller but it was so inexpensive</li>
            <li> At least it did stick to my lashes, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more spider lashes!</li>
            <li> unless they mean for you to just paint them onto your eyelids with it.  </li>
            <li> Brush very very small</li>
            <li> I am tired of working so hard on the delicate area around my eyes to wash mascara off.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one hoping for some serious lengthening.  </li>
            <li> The waterproof bit isn&#x27;t so bad either (as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes while they&#x27;re wet, you won&#x27;t get bad streaking.</li>
            <li> My wife said to post a review about this because it was total crap.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the Covergirl thickening mascara in the orange bottle, but the brush is SO fat that it got all over my eyelids even worse than this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless.    </li>
            <li> This mascara is useless compared to Rimmel&#x27;s Lash Accelerator mascara.</li>
            <li> Downside to this is that for me, it is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Horrible hate it, refund</li>
            <li> One of the worst mascara a I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> WORST drugstore mascara I have ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The reason why I bought this is because of the length they guaranteed and I&#x27;m not disappointed in that at all. It&#x27;s not very much volume like the regular cover girl mascara but if your just looking for a natural everyday look to your eyes then this is the mascara for you. However if you want something with über volume and intense lengthening then look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I returned this because it adds very little product to your lashes. It&#x27;s useless.    I thought it was just dried-up from sitting on the warehouse shelf. But Amazon very graciously sent me three replacements, but all of them gave the same results (practically zero).    Lesson learned - I&#x27;ll never buy Cover Girl mascara again.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got an old tube or something, but there was basically nothing there.  I had to keep on working at it, using coat after coat, till I finally noticed a difference.  This is going in the trash, a definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> They clearly warn you to use their mascara in a sanitary manner. Imagine my surprise when I put the brand new applicator wand into the mascara and pulled out the wand with a long hair wrapped around it.     I&#x27;ve been using makeup for over 50 years; it has been one of the biggest money wasters in my life. Non-clumping mascara still clumps, non-creasing eye shadow still creases, and lipstick is never the color that they portray it to be; but once you buy it you are stuck with it. If you stumble across a product that you do like, it is sure to be discontinued, and you start that expensive hunt all over again looking for an exceptable product.    This product is clearly not sanitary, and since I am now grossed out with it, why would I buy the same product again?</li>
            <li> Do not order this from AMAZON! They only send 1. The description says 3 and the receit does not. I explained that to amazon rep but he sent me paid return slip in which I had to find a UPS store and send it back and than he reordered it.  Guess what Same thing again. Sent me a prepaid postage and I had to visit the UPS store again. WHAT A HASSLE. As for the mascara its ok (I&#x27;ve used it before) But Covergirl lashblast is much better, the purple or orange tube.</li>
            <li> Do not order this thinking 3 will come. Amazon send only 1 NOT 3 like the description says. And than they inconveience you and tell you to send it back to get your money back. I&#x27;ve previously used the mascara anyway and I would get better Mascara. For example Almay 1 coat or Covergirl lashblash. I thought 3 would arrive like the description says, if I knew only 1 would arrive I would not have ordered it and stuck with the others.</li>
            <li> Like most mascaras, it takes a few applications to get a really good result.  It&#x27;s dark, applies easily, and it&#x27;s not clumpy. It really does add some nice length but not that much volume. I think there is better but I wouldn&#x27;t say not to at least try this.</li>
            <li> I think I like the regular Lashblast Mascara better. But then again, I like my eyelashes to look fuller. My eyelashes are already long, so I think that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li> I first bought the above mascara while on holiday in the States, and found it really good, as it doesn&#x27;t clump.  It has been very hard to come by in New Zealand, so managed to get some more through Amazon.</li>
            <li> ....BUT THIS LASHBLAST LENGTH WASNT ALL THAT....I LIKE THE ORIGINAL AND LASH BLAST LUXE SO MUCH MORE.....I LIKE MY EYELASHES TO \\&quot;POP\\&quot; AND THIS MASCARA GAVE THEM SOME LENGTH, BUT THE OTHER COVER GIRL MASCARAS GAVE MORE DEPTH AND FULLNESS.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara. It is comparable to department store brands. It definitely lengthens, but does not give too much volume, which it isn&#x27;t for anyways.</li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes, but I have tons of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creates a problem when choosing mascara, it always clumps or sticks my short little eye lashes together, you would not believe how horrid expensive looking mascara is on them, espcially with a huge brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far my one and only mascara, I found that by using this as layer one (and optional for the divas out there a layer three) it really extended my lashes with out clumps. I suggest layers though as this mascara is a little thin, also I seem to be buying a new tube every month or so, thank god it&#x27;s only 8 bucks but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the nylon stretch material, but the non water proof does flake so beware! I only use the water proof and it acts like a regular mascara, very easy to take off and I have to be careful not to rub my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the short lashes of the world.... have fun!</li>
            <li> My wife said to post a review about this because it was total crap.  All clumpy, she said she thinks it was really old.  So be warned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m THRILLED. Clearly this does what it says it will. Ok, maybe not an 80% increase in length, but more than enough for me. The difference in before and after is amazing, and that&#x27;s WITHOUT curling, primer, and my meticulous separation technique. I&#x27;ll post more pics when I have time to really play with it.    [...]</li>
            <li> I strongly prefer the original Lashblast in the chunky  orange tube. This one requires several coats to make a noticeable difference. Also, I have never been sensitive to makeup before but this product burns my eyes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this mascara with high hopes -- haven&#x27;t worn eye makeup in fifteen years, so was excited to try out the new mascaras. This went on well, clumped very little, lengthened nicely. Was hard to get my lower lashes covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it flakes really badly, and smudges easily. Guess I&#x27;ll have to get a real waterproof mascara, not just a water-resistent one.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes unbelievably long and not a single clump - it lives up to its promises and has fibers in it to make your lashes look super long - it is the best mascara I have ever tried - gonna buy tons of it now because it is a limited editon!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is great! My eyelashes are blonde and none on the bottom. So, it has always been hard to find good mascara to seperated my lashes. I have honestly about 10 different brands and they all make my lashes messy and stuck together this one WORKS! My lashes are easly fanned out like they should be. I&#x27;m very happy with the results! Now is only it could it could just magically \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the rest of my face!.</li>
            <li> This product was not worth having.  Maybe it was old and dried up or something because it did NOTHING to my lashes.  I would have complained to the seller but it was so inexpensive I didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with it.</li>
            <li> Oh I am in love! It makes my hair silky smooth without all the greasy residues. Also my hair has a shine like never before. I usually have dull lifeless hair. Well not now. And it smells awesome!  I have gotten so many comments on my hair. Lastly it came a day early! Thanks for the great products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. It extends my eyelashes very well without clumping.</li>
            <li> One of the worst mascara a I&#x27;ve used. Doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush on this product and felt that it did a good job of separating my lashes.  However, it did not hold the curl well and although it looked great at first, after a couple of hours my eyelashes &amp;#34;fell flat&amp;#34; which does not happen with the mascara I usually use.  Also, there was a lot of smudging under my eyes after about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> WORST drugstore mascara I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product. When I put on the mascara I didn&#x27;t see anything different. It&#x27;s as if I didn&#x27;t put anything on. If i get a mascara like this usually if i put a few coats on it builds up to give some sort of volume or length. This did not do anything. No volume, very little length.  One plus is that it didn&#x27;t clump, but for that I just won&#x27;t put any mascara on. I also don&#x27;t like the wand very much. The bristles are waay too small.  I do not recommend this product.  I prefer maybeline colassal which gives good volume and length and Loreals voluminous carbon black (but be careful with this one, don&#x27;t put too many coats or it will look too clumpy).</li>
            <li> I am usually happy with any mascara I try, but I did not like this mascara.  I felt like it did nothing to my lashes and looked like I didn&#x27;t put any mascara on at all.  I didn&#x27;t notice and lengthing  Another problem was that this product seems to have less mascara compared to other brands.  It was easier to wash off compared to other brands.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my mom, and it&#x27;s the second time she&#x27;s asked for this mascara so you know she loves it! She&#x27;s in her 60&#x27;s, her lashes are short and sparse, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d recommend this for. She thinks the color (black) is great and that it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Works well and lasts for hours. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I have long, thinner lashes, but a lot of them, esp. on my lower lash line. This mascara really brings my lower lashes out so that I don&#x27;t have to wear eyeliner. The formula isn&#x27;t thick at all, so if you&#x27;re going for a fresh and natural look, it&#x27;s perfect for your top lashes as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to MAC!</li>
            <li> Came quickly!! I haven&#x27;t opened it yet. Package looks very old. Hopefully product is better.</li>
            <li> It tends to lower the already curled lashes with the hours. But it separates them quite well and it is very black.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself was fine, I just did not like how it looked on my eye lashes. It works, its just not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I had high hope for this product-- love the commercials!  Yes, it does make your lashes longer, but I felt like the lashes themselves were thinner and a little more brittle after I used this product.  I ended up not using the whole tube of it-- I went back to my old standard, Lash Out.</li>
            <li> Its a great applicator with a great color. Doesn&#x27;t last through the day though. And it caused my eye some irritation which I have never had a mascara do.</li>
            <li> Works great under 3D fiber lashes which is why I purchased it... If anybody else uses fiber lashes the best mascara to wear under it is a lengthing non volumizing mascara that Darkens your lash roots without extra clumps this is a great base as it darkens and slightly lengthens your lashes while the brush separates them as well. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this mascara alone as it doesn&#x27;t add any volume but it works great for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> does not leave clumps like it ok</li>
            <li> Great application brush lashes look great. They are separated and well defined. Nice deep black color. No need to spend all kinds of crazy money on those expensive mascaras when this does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara, and I have certainly tried a ton of them - everything from drugstore brands to expensive brands.  This is my favorite because it doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on easily, and does not leave those annoying black smears under your eyelid at the end of the day.  Also, it is easy to wash off with regular face soap.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and it doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes hours later like some of the more expensive brands do.</li>
            <li> I am normally a clinique fanatic, but recently I found that they changed their formula and it was like wearing waterproof mascara every day, which was too hard to remove. I was always skeptical of the &amp;#34;cheap drugstore&amp;#34; products, but this one really came through! I bought this as a filler until I found one I liked and I fell in love with this one. I&#x27;m into the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; so to speak, look and this is fantastic. It&#x27;s very light, goes on very smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump at all! I&#x27;ve had it on for 12 hours now today and it&#x27;s holding strong. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on this, so I figured I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;m not one for makeup, and my eyelashes have always been long/dark enough, but since I started wearing BB cream I like to put something on my eyes to make them pop a bit more. This mascara is very natural looking and never gets cake or clumpy.</li>
            <li> It clumps &amp; the brush is nothing special at all making it hard to wear ...&lt;br /&gt;The result is not as I expected</li>
            <li> I swear by this mascara, it really makes your lashes longer. No clumps!!</li>
            <li> Like this mascara very much.  Adds length to short eyelashes, but very natural feeling.</li>
            <li> This is honestly my favorite mascara ever. I&#x27;ve tried multiple mascaras (some good, some bad), but this one is clump free, flake free, and well defines your lashes. The waterproof bit isn&#x27;t so bad either (as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes while they&#x27;re wet, you won&#x27;t get bad streaking. Maybe a bit of flakage and that&#x27;s it). My lashes are pretty long and dark as is, so I can&#x27;t speak too well to the lengthening claim, but it gives mine slightly more volume to them without going overboard and looks very natural. It&#x27;s my go-to every day.</li>
            <li> My mascara that I received was pretty dried up and only lasted for about a week. I don&#x27;t know if I was sent an old product or what.</li>
            <li> Brush very very small</li>
            <li> Wife likes it and it looks great on her, happy wife keeps me out of the doghouse and off the couch.</li>
            <li> it seemed like it wasent that new but it was okay.</li>
            <li> This is literally the only mascara I will use on my eyelashes. The brush is small and seperates each lash. I constantly get complimented on my &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is ok I guess, when I first seen it in the stores I said to myself I have to have this. I have the original CoverGirl lashblast and its one of my favorite mascara&#x27;s i fell in love with,so I figured I would fall in love with this one as well. One of my biggest aspects on a mascara is that it has to have length because I have short brittle lashes,so anyway I tryed it and I liked it but it had no volume like the original LashBlast to me. So basically great with length but I have lenght+volume with my original CoverGirl lashblast. I will stick with it as well  but nice try. Thanks anyway CoverGirl!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin lashes and this product is great for me. No clumping just length!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. Applies the perfect amount every time without clumping. The consistancy and color are perfect and one tube lasted me about 6 months. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Does not clump</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara now. It lengthens as much as an other mascara, but it applies extremely well compared to others. I never have clumps or sticking lashes. I love it!</li>
            <li> The lashblastlength mascara I purchased is dry and clumpy, and difficult to apply. I like the fine bristles but the brush itself is weak and too bendable, and a bit too long. I might have gotten a tube that sat around for too long, but I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am tired of working so hard on the delicate area around my eyes to wash mascara off.  This washes of easily &amp; I don&#x27;t have black around my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> This mascara smells odd, and the scent is strong. When I apply it, my eyelashes look like they have oil on them. While it&#x27;s not flakey like some mascaras, it&#x27;s really greasy looking. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for the ideal mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried a ton.  My eyelashes are fairly short and my eyes are somewhat deep set, so curlers never seem to work well.  I bought this one hoping for some serious lengthening.  It&#x27;s pretty good.  But I find it takes several coats.  Not really mega-lengthening or anything, but it definitely lengthens.  I didn&#x27;t get much smudging or flaking, so that was good.  I think I&#x27;ll continue my quest though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. As other reviewers have stated, the product is very light, but does a wonderful job making lashes look longer. If you are looking for a mascara to add volume or to be obvious, then this is not for you. The wand is very thin and does not hold much product, so the application is very subtle. I am a brunette with green eyes, so I appreciate a product that adds length (and a bit of color) without overwhelming my shadow or eyeliner. If (like me) you prefer a more natural look to your make-up then give this product a try! I am so happy to finally have found a mascara that is not clumpy, too dark, too impossible to remove, or too expensive! No more spider lashes! Woo-Hoo :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara, mostly because of the brush, which does an excellent job combing my lashes and does not clump. I wear this every day and each tube lasts a very long time. When I got my 2nd tube, I used the original brush and saved the new clean brush for a lash comb.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used. No clumps, no flakes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for volume this is not for you however if you just want length, this is it! This mascara is very easy to use and makes my lashes look nice and long. It never clumps at all and you can apply several coats to get the look you want. This mascara is great for an everyday or &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; make up look and is very gentle and easy to remove on my lashes. My only complaint is that sometimes you do need to build it up a little with 2 or 3 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you want dramatic, thick lashes you might need to try another mascara but for a natural look it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount for a review and I absolutely love it my lashes look so long and full when I wear this mascara</li>
            <li> This would not go onto my lashes.  I got more of it on my eyelids than my lashes.  It just refused to stick or apply to lashes.  I could not even see that there was any ON my lashes at all.  And because I have to press into my lashes, it got all over my eyelids, but still nothing on my lashes.  Unlike the old version, it does not wipe off easily.  It&#x27;s very gummy and sticky and would just smear across my eyelids.  I had to end up taking it off completely and starting over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And FYI, there is nothing that will make your lashes appear longer, and I didn&#x27;t buy it for this reason at all. I bought it because of the brush.  However, if you did buy it because you want your lashes to appear longer, it&#x27;s not going to work for that.....unless they mean for you to just paint them onto your eyelids with it.  I also purchased the Covergirl thickening mascara in the orange bottle, but the brush is SO fat that it got all over my eyelids even worse than this one.  At least it did stick to my lashes, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am have a thing about mascara.  My eyelashes are very, very long, but they are fine.  I actually have to trim them sometimes to keep them even and they get tangled and &#x27;cross over&#x27; eachother when applying mascara.  I&#x27;m 41 and have been using mascara since high school, so I have some experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find the perfect mascara, but Covergirl&#x27;s old version in the black and gray bottle was the closest I had come and worked well for me.  What I especially liked about the old formula was the brush.  It had these short, pointy little rubber nubs that separated the lashes while you applied, yet it allowed it to go on thick.  I bought this because the brush was the closest to the old brush, but the mascara just sucks.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras.  It always applies cleanly without any clumps and never flakes or smears under my eyes during the day.  This is my go-to mascara for a nice daytime natural lash look.  I think this would be a great mascara for teenage girls just starting to wear makeup, who don&#x27;t want to dramatic of a look.</li>
            <li> This mascara is useless compared to Rimmel&#x27;s Lash Accelerator mascara. It doesn&#x27;t lengthen your lashes or make them appear longer at all. Its only saving grace was that it didn&#x27;t clump. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, save it for a better quality mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Wife uses this all the time</li>
            <li> I love the end result this gives me. Not clumpy not too much just enough to notice and look good not like I&#x27;m goin out clubbing. Def recommend.</li>
            <li> Like an empty tube. I can&#x27;t understand the other glowing reviews. Save your money and don&#x27;t bother writing to the company. They don&#x27;t respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/15 - I received a product rebate in the mail today for full value of the product so I take my comment back about the company not responding. Thank you Proctor and Gamble.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives my eyelashes length and volume. I am very satisfied. It&#x27;s my first time using this brand and i like it.</li>
            <li> Horrible hate it, refund</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I don&#x27;t think it adds an amazing amount of length.</li>
            <li> This is by far an awesome mascara. Gives great length and is super easy to work with!!!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gives length&lt;br /&gt;Soft brush&lt;br /&gt;Lives up to promises&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very dry&lt;br /&gt;Takes a few coats to see the mascara&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great Mascara!</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, looks good on and last all day.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favourite mascara.</li>
            <li> Not as great as their lashblast and the mascara drys up kind of clumpy.</li>
            <li> This mascara was pretty disappointing compared to the original Lash Blast. It doesn&#x27;t really lengthen the way it claims and certainly does nothing for volume. It does darken lashes a bit and separate and define decently. I&#x27;d say this product is best saved for \\&quot;no makeup\\&quot; makeup days (bb cream, this mascara, and lip balm type days). Another use is to save is specifically for bottom lashes. It is actually perfect for bottom lashes since the formula is light and the brush is actually very good for definition. Once your done, I&#x27;d suggest saving the brush to apply your favorite formula to bottom lashes. It still has use but not something I&#x27;d repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the original LashBlast, but this was hugely disappointing. It didn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes - in fact, it barely did anything to them at all. Maybe I somehow got an old tube (a problem in and of itself), but it seemed incredibly dry and didn&#x27;t want to stick to either the wand or my lashes. The best thing about this is the pretty yellow tube, which is almost pleasant enough to make you forget about how much this mascara sucks.</li>
            <li> Great for girls with lots of lashes that are really long. Downside to this is that for me, it is difficult to remove. But the brush is clutch. May keep the brush and use with another formula. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    </ol>
