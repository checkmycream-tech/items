            <li>Best hair styling glue ever!</li>
            <li>I was actually impressed with the Axe Spiking Glue.  </li>
            <li>An excellent hair styling aid.</li>
            <li>this is a perfect product for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>and they both were very happy.</li>
            <li>Very good hold,</li>
            <li>This product works great and does an excellent job</li>
            <li>dont use it to \\&quot;spike\\&quot; my hair though, LOL.</li>
            <li>I was happy to receive this item as I like Axe products</li>
            <li>a lot of products smell great and perform well.</li>
            <li>you want to get a great haircut and then re-create it after you leave the stylist, this is a great tool to help you do so.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget you also get the great Axe scent.  </li>
            <li>It does have the pleasant \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; aroma too.</li>
            <li>I can always trust him to let me know if something is good or not.  </li>
            <li>They look good, I feel good and its all gravy.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for trendy unnatural hair styles.</li>
            <li>For that, I suggest Axe&#x27;s own Gravity Defying Dust.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it works quite well.</li>
            <li>The product also has a nice manly smell, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually nice.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasing and like a good hair styling product should, the scent quickly fades as it dries so it doesn&#x27;t mix or conflict with your cologne.</li>
            <li>Many of the stores have replaced this product with the  Axe spiking gel.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product because I have yet to find something that works better to manage unruly hair.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for my short curley hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is more like a medium-thickness glue.</li>
            <li>is my favorite product made by Axe.</li>
            <li>This is one of my son&#x27;s favorite styling products.  </li>
            <li>As a result, it will hold your hair for 10 hours or more.  </li>
            <li>As a cream, it works actually better than a gel</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>love the effect this product leaves.  </li>
            <li>They look so adorable.  </li>
            <li>This holds a lot better than the inexpensive gels we have been using.</li>
            <li>My kids used this on their hair, and they were generally pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>First off it still has a very mild, pleasant smell, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li>The hold was fine, and it smells great, and so those are two pretty important things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for either gender, for a strong hold that is still manageable, a nice texture, and a clean scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been testing a number of hair products, and this one from Axe is definitely superior in that it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;hard\\&quot; feeling, but it does hold up very well.  </li>
            <li>This hair styling product really has a good hold that doesn&#x27;t turn your hair greasy looking.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to style my hair with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also was easy to apply and he had no difficulty washing it out.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and immediately produced the spiked up</li>
            <li>Good and highly recommended by him.</li>
            <li>The hold is excellent for short to medium length hair, and perfect for thick haired individuals.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this gel with its ability to hold any style together and its soft, non sticky feel!</li>
            <li>Glue is quite an accurate description.  </li>
            <li>But my wife has had to use the GLUE on a few occasions, and she is happy with the result!</li>
            <li>: it made it look smooth.</li>
            <li>all day, strong quick action.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>have some kind of product in your hair, and yet if you use this spiking glue you&#x27;re definitely going to be able to tell it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li>This is a very stiff spiking glue with consistency somewhere between a gell and a putty, probably best described as a paste.  </li>
            <li>He is cool, and a winner.  </li>
            <li>As for the smell, it is pretty strong and perfumed--kind of obnoxious.</li>
            <li>clean fresh scent but not overpowering</li>
            <li>It dries on your hands quickly</li>
            <li>so it can give you a spiked look.&lt;br /&gt;The product smells good and it comes out as a white paste, however unless you have very straight hair</li>
            <li>The hold is perfect for my long female hair, and my guy friend also loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now he is a happy little man.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my husband&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>and a good amount of water, but also an unusual amount of time working it in, to get the white residue to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the SPIKED UP LOOK PUTTY (red container) grooming cream type product is proving a better fit for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ideally I need the AXE NATURAL LOOK product with a bit more hold (MEDIUM) and I would be &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34;.  It would give me that &amp;#34;nice to the touch&amp;#34; look and feel but without having my hair flop into my face within a &amp;#34;city minute&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>That fresh, manly smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the scent of it, especially in its concentrated form (straight out of the tube), but luckily once you spread it thoroughly into your hair, the scent isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>At $8 the price is right.  </li>
            <li>It washes right out with no</li>
            <li>However, if you have long hair, or even medium-length, and are trying to do any kind of spiking with it, this isn&#x27;t what you want to be using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a whole line of products that are specifically designed for different looks.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t achieve a &#x27;natural&#x27; look if it&#x27;s easy to tell you</li>
            <li>But I think it is a fine line in finding a product which exists which has that natural look but also</li>
            <li>I love the styles the young guys (and maybe the older ones, too) are having.  </li>
            <li>If you have thick hair and need to keep it behaving, this product works great.</li>
            <li>First off, I don&#x27;t need spiking glue (at my age).  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say for Axe&#x27;s Spiking Glue, as it&#x27;s just a kind of hair gel.</li>
            <li>This is the first time my family has tried a hair product with the name \\&quot;Glue\\&quot; in it.  </li>
            <li>The glue does not work as well as the gum for his hair style but does maintain a crisp spiked up look when he does his front \\&quot;bangs\\&quot;</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll do it with some cajolling but not really on their own.</li>
            <li>This Axe product is good for creating a fairly stiff spiked look.</li>
            <li>This stuff really holds strong, and it holds strong all day long, even in heat and high humidity.</li>
            <li>Besides all the other things that this does - holds your hair up literally all day until you shower, wind-proof, perspiration-resistant(holds up fine for my soccer games/practices) - the main thing why I love this is the simple fact that it makes my hair look super FULL &amp; THICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Axe Spiking Glue works well on very lightly damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does provide a HIGH SHINE and would be a good product for simply slicking one&#x27;s hair back.  </li>
            <li>This works really well for spiking hair up.  </li>
            <li>It really is sticky.  </li>
            <li>this wont work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Unlike gels, this doesn&#x27;t really have hold.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this glue.</li>
            <li>and it really has the stay power.  </li>
            <li>but it is too much for me.  </li>
            <li>so you have to be ready to apply fast.</li>
            <li>Those were really well designed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really become quite the believer in Axe hair grooming products.</li>
            <li>The glue provides a strong hold and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Spiking glue sounds like it will be a super strong and stiff hold</li>
            <li>so I can manage it better and try to spike it with certain products that are more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li>The hold is strong , but still soft enough to rework a style until you like it.</li>
            <li>While my 12-year old son really liked the Axe gum product (for that messy, styled look), he did not care for this product as much.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, not overwhelmingly mannish but not girly either.</li>
            <li>The tube is much more convenient to use than our previous experiences with the jarred Axe products.</li>
            <li>Holds great all day with thin hair or thick and it&#x27;s easy to style!</li>
            <li>HOLD here is HIGH HOLD leaning toward ULTRA HOLD.  </li>
            <li>The jury is still out though as I need to try a few more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t know if it was meant for such quick action, but it happens, and it works.</li>
            <li>An older teen, he is pretty picky about his products.  </li>
            <li>It has allowed my kids to get more creative with their crazy hair.  </li>
            <li>; on this product because I was seeking something with more hold than the Axe Natural Look grooming cream (green container)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spiking - did a good job, but believe it would hold better with shorter hair and styling annoying areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My problem with this one is that it is very, very sticky on your hands, and it leaves a white residue if you don&#x27;t work it in.</li>
            <li>all, I think this product was good in the sense that it was easy to style my hair and made my hair look smooth, but was bad in the sense that I could not change the style once it dried.</li>
            <li>Remember, it drives the girls wild!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good Axe product, it is a little on the thick side</li>
            <li>At first, this product was cool because of how different this \\&quot;spiking glue\\&quot; was from the typical clear/translucent hair gel.</li>
            <li>the plus side, this product didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking too shiny as though it were plastic, but instead it had the same effect as certain pommades</li>
            <li>biggest drawback to the product is its smell: it&#x27;s similar to other Axe products, though the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong or long-lasting.</li>
            <li>scent is soft and pleasing - sort of tropical, like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old son loves it.</li>
            <li>I have two teenage sons that are very reticent to comb their hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to keep trying this to get just the right amount, but so far I either have too little to hold my hair in place or too much so that it clumps together.</li>
            <li>But I expected it to have a stronger hold than the other products and really be able to create a spike.</li>
            <li>complaint is the oz size for the price is not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;Should be in a bigger bottle, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t ultra powerful (try Got2B extreme hold gel for that), but it does provide a flexible, medium-strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair a little crunchy for my preference, but if you normally use styling glue then it&#x27;ll be right up your alley.  </li>
            <li>This does the job pretty well for what I wanted, though if I wanted hard spikes it would not be the right product.  </li>
            <li>The hair gets spiky-looking and very separated, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, but you can&#x27;t make it do specific things like a Mohawk or larger spikes.</li>
            <li>product is fairly thick, and easy to distribute through one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after it dries, there is no going back unless you completely rinse your hair and start</li>
            <li>I used this product on DAMP (NOT wet)</li>
            <li>(Ill be honest, the AXE name scared me).</li>
            <li>texture is not runny or sloppy like most hair gels, but it is not a viscous putty, either.</li>
            <li>It just felt a little &#x27;crispy&#x27; in the morning when first applied.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so humid outside right now, so it pretty much fell and ended up looking dirty.</li>
            <li>have very short hair, less than an inch, and wanted something that would allow me to smooth my hair forwards into a slightly touseled front spike.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m actually wondering if I got a bad tube on this, because it was such an obvious and apparent problem for me, and yet looking over the many positive reviews of the product, I don&#x27;t see anyone else who had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do use a little too much there might be some whit residue.</li>
            <li>Another con is that I had trouble styling my hair due to the stickiness, holding properties and stiffness that my hair quickly took on.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> You can&#x27;t achieve a &#x27;natural&#x27; look if it&#x27;s easy to tell you</li>
            <li> But I think it is a fine line in finding a product which exists which has that natural look but also</li>
            <li> I love the styles the young guys (and maybe the older ones, too) are having.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and need to keep it behaving, this product works great.</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t need spiking glue (at my age).  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say for Axe&#x27;s Spiking Glue, as it&#x27;s just a kind of hair gel.</li>
            <li> This is the first time my family has tried a hair product with the name \\&quot;Glue\\&quot; in it.  </li>
            <li> The glue does not work as well as the gum for his hair style but does maintain a crisp spiked up look when he does his front \\&quot;bangs\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll do it with some cajolling but not really on their own.</li>
            <li> This Axe product is good for creating a fairly stiff spiked look.</li>
            <li> This stuff really holds strong, and it holds strong all day long, even in heat and high humidity.</li>
            <li> Besides all the other things that this does - holds your hair up literally all day until you shower, wind-proof, perspiration-resistant(holds up fine for my soccer games/practices) - the main thing why I love this is the simple fact that it makes my hair look super FULL &amp; THICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Axe Spiking Glue works well on very lightly damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does provide a HIGH SHINE and would be a good product for simply slicking one&#x27;s hair back.  </li>
            <li> This works really well for spiking hair up.  </li>
            <li> It really is sticky.  </li>
            <li> this wont work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unlike gels, this doesn&#x27;t really have hold.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this glue.</li>
            <li> and it really has the stay power.  </li>
            <li> but it is too much for me.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be ready to apply fast.</li>
            <li> Those were really well designed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really become quite the believer in Axe hair grooming products.</li>
            <li> The glue provides a strong hold and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Spiking glue sounds like it will be a super strong and stiff hold</li>
            <li> so I can manage it better and try to spike it with certain products that are more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li> The hold is strong , but still soft enough to rework a style until you like it.</li>
            <li> While my 12-year old son really liked the Axe gum product (for that messy, styled look), he did not care for this product as much.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice, not overwhelmingly mannish but not girly either.</li>
            <li> The tube is much more convenient to use than our previous experiences with the jarred Axe products.</li>
            <li> Holds great all day with thin hair or thick and it&#x27;s easy to style!</li>
            <li> HOLD here is HIGH HOLD leaning toward ULTRA HOLD.  </li>
            <li> The jury is still out though as I need to try a few more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know if it was meant for such quick action, but it happens, and it works.</li>
            <li> An older teen, he is pretty picky about his products.  </li>
            <li> It has allowed my kids to get more creative with their crazy hair.  </li>
            <li> ; on this product because I was seeking something with more hold than the Axe Natural Look grooming cream (green container)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spiking - did a good job, but believe it would hold better with shorter hair and styling annoying areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My problem with this one is that it is very, very sticky on your hands, and it leaves a white residue if you don&#x27;t work it in.</li>
            <li> all, I think this product was good in the sense that it was easy to style my hair and made my hair look smooth, but was bad in the sense that I could not change the style once it dried.</li>
            <li> Remember, it drives the girls wild!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good Axe product, it is a little on the thick side</li>
            <li> At first, this product was cool because of how different this \\&quot;spiking glue\\&quot; was from the typical clear/translucent hair gel.</li>
            <li> the plus side, this product didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking too shiny as though it were plastic, but instead it had the same effect as certain pommades</li>
            <li> biggest drawback to the product is its smell: it&#x27;s similar to other Axe products, though the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong or long-lasting.</li>
            <li> scent is soft and pleasing - sort of tropical, like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son loves it.</li>
            <li> I have two teenage sons that are very reticent to comb their hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to keep trying this to get just the right amount, but so far I either have too little to hold my hair in place or too much so that it clumps together.</li>
            <li> But I expected it to have a stronger hold than the other products and really be able to create a spike.</li>
            <li> complaint is the oz size for the price is not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;Should be in a bigger bottle, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t ultra powerful (try Got2B extreme hold gel for that), but it does provide a flexible, medium-strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair a little crunchy for my preference, but if you normally use styling glue then it&#x27;ll be right up your alley.  </li>
            <li> This does the job pretty well for what I wanted, though if I wanted hard spikes it would not be the right product.  </li>
            <li> The hair gets spiky-looking and very separated, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, but you can&#x27;t make it do specific things like a Mohawk or larger spikes.</li>
            <li> product is fairly thick, and easy to distribute through one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after it dries, there is no going back unless you completely rinse your hair and start</li>
            <li> I used this product on DAMP (NOT wet)</li>
            <li> (Ill be honest, the AXE name scared me).</li>
            <li> texture is not runny or sloppy like most hair gels, but it is not a viscous putty, either.</li>
            <li> It just felt a little &#x27;crispy&#x27; in the morning when first applied.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so humid outside right now, so it pretty much fell and ended up looking dirty.</li>
            <li> have very short hair, less than an inch, and wanted something that would allow me to smooth my hair forwards into a slightly touseled front spike.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m actually wondering if I got a bad tube on this, because it was such an obvious and apparent problem for me, and yet looking over the many positive reviews of the product, I don&#x27;t see anyone else who had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do use a little too much there might be some whit residue.</li>
            <li> Another con is that I had trouble styling my hair due to the stickiness, holding properties and stiffness that my hair quickly took on.  </li>
            <li> Because the product is white and not clear (like a gel), you have to be careful to work it into your hair completely</li>
            <li> My husband has thick curly hair and this glue locks his hair down to make it look smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It really holds your hair in place with very little of the product.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t see any other similar complaints, I guess it is safe to assume something was wrong with mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After application, wait for your hair to dry, then simply brush.</li>
            <li> the past few years, I have experimented with several different gels to mess with my hair and make it comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works well on my hair (3-4\\&quot; long), giving me the effect I want without adding shine or crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I will say that my hair does look decent and at least it doesn&#x27;t fall into a bowl do.  </li>
            <li> It holds well, doesn&#x27;t have that usual Axe odor to it, and you only have to use a tiny bit to cover your head.</li>
            <li> I can use it on either wet or dry</li>
            <li> You need slightly damp hair that is cut to allow for the spiked look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and it lasts for quite awhile but leaves a lot of product on your hair that needs to be washed out daily.</li>
            <li> enough hold (without being heavy)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much of a wet look as the other gels.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with product.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that a little bit of this goes a long way, and even if you over-apply it, it doesn&#x27;t turn flaky or make your hair look like it&#x27;s clogged with grease.</li>
            <li> It does dry hard, especially if you start with damp hair like the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> However, they got tired of that particular look, and they couldn&#x27;t find any other use for the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using less product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the heavy, cloying scents I previously associated with Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m a little bias though.</li>
            <li> day\\&quot; a few times per year at school - so spiking glue is a necessity in our house.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make hair overly stiff which can often lead to flakes.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with a little water before putting it in.</li>
            <li> Used on thick, dark, medium length men&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is useless and smells bad, and unless you are going for an overall spiky look that you can&#x27;t control, this isn&#x27;t the right product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a firm hold but not too hard and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Regrettably this one was not able to spike my hair.</li>
            <li> It goes on stiff and dries hard.  </li>
            <li> On the other side, this spiking glue would sometimes feel uncomfortable whenever I would rest my hand on my head (as it would morph my hair a little bit in a way that I did not like; and it was not easy to \\&quot;morph\\&quot; back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does make your hair feel VERY stiff, so if you don&#x27;t like that then don&#x27;t get this product, but if you want to spike your hair go ahead and get this stuff.</li>
            <li> Product leaves hair hard and spiked up.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t flake like a lot of products do.</li>
            <li> Thick glue like hair paste.  </li>
            <li> For the record:  My hair is thick, medium-length and has almost no body to it.  </li>
            <li> And I mean work it in a lot.</li>
            <li> I found I had to use a very small amount</li>
            <li> If I use zero hair product I have a serious bowl-do ala 80s&#x27; style.  </li>
            <li> I think the heavy hold also weighed down my hair which is another bad quality for my hair</li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> I can do is review how things worked for me, so I have to rate this poorly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong stuff...meant to get the spiking GEL.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even though they claim &amp;#34;strong hold without all the hard&amp;#34; I find that the majority of your hair will have a crispness or a crunchiness to it.  </li>
            <li> But, my kids have \\&quot;crazy hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a bad rating...</li>
            <li> however I fell slightly disappointed as at the end of the day you want it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the worst I&#x27;ve experience regarding crunchiness</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t leave hair feeling &#x27;disgusting&#x27;.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have thick hair and need to keep it behaving, this product works great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a bad rating...I ordered the wrong stuff...meant to get the spiking GEL. But my wife has had to use the GLUE on a few occasions, and she is happy with the result!</li>
            <li> This is by far my husband&#x27;s favorite hair product. My husband has thick curly hair and this glue locks his hair down to make it look smooth and shiny. Many of the stores have replaced this product with the  Axe spiking gel. There is no comparison. The glue provides a strong hold and lasts all day long. I will continue to buy this product because I have yet to find something that works better to manage unruly hair.</li>
            <li> Thick glue like hair paste.  It holds all day and I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> This works really well for spiking hair up.  Keeps the hold.  It really is sticky.  I usually mix it with a little water before putting it in.</li>
            <li> This is a very stiff spiking glue with consistency somewhere between a gell and a putty, probably best described as a paste.  Glue is quite an accurate description.  It goes on stiff and dries hard.  It is a good product for trendy unnatural hair styles.</li>
            <li> Best hair styling glue ever! I only use this stuff! Holds great all day with thin hair or thick and it&#x27;s easy to style!</li>
            <li> But as a gift for my grandson will update after I speak with him about how he likes it</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my short curley hair.Love it.</li>
            <li> Besides all the other things that this does - holds your hair up literally all day until you shower, wind-proof, perspiration-resistant(holds up fine for my soccer games/practices) - the main thing why I love this is the simple fact that it makes my hair look super FULL &amp; THICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After application, wait for your hair to dry, then simply brush. Poof, your hair is INSTANTLY thicker and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been Godsend - can&#x27;t think what I would do without it!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good Axe product, it is a little on the thick side but it does keep my hair slicked back.&lt;br /&gt;I dont use it to \\&quot;spike\\&quot; my hair though, LOL.</li>
            <li> This product works great and does an excellent job oh holding up spiked hair. Put this on in the morning and it was still working at the end of the day. Product leaves hair hard and spiked up. If you do use a little too much there might be some whit residue. A little bit goes a long way with product. Will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive this item as I like Axe products however I fell slightly disappointed as at the end of the day you want it so it can give you a spiked look.&lt;br /&gt;The product smells good and it comes out as a white paste, however unless you have very straight hair this wont work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly type hair but keep it short so I can manage it better and try to spike it with certain products that are more expensive than this one. Regrettably this one was not able to spike my hair. It is sticky but not enough.&lt;br /&gt;Good try.</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t need spiking glue (at my age).  But, my kids have \\&quot;crazy hair day\\&quot; a few times per year at school - so spiking glue is a necessity in our house.  I was actually impressed with the Axe Spiking Glue.  At $8 the price is right.  It has allowed my kids to get more creative with their crazy hair.  It doesn&#x27;t smell, it washes out easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I would buy it again and 5-stars from me for price/value.</li>
            <li> Unlike gels, this doesn&#x27;t really have hold. The hair gets spiky-looking and very separated, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, but you can&#x27;t make it do specific things like a Mohawk or larger spikes. As for the smell, it is pretty strong and perfumed--kind of obnoxious. This stuff is useless and smells bad, and unless you are going for an overall spiky look that you can&#x27;t control, this isn&#x27;t the right product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say for Axe&#x27;s Spiking Glue, as it&#x27;s just a kind of hair gel. The bottom line is if you have short hair, this will definitely work in spiking your hair up. It holds well, doesn&#x27;t have that usual Axe odor to it, and you only have to use a tiny bit to cover your head. However, if you have long hair, or even medium-length, and are trying to do any kind of spiking with it, this isn&#x27;t what you want to be using. For that, I suggest Axe&#x27;s own Gravity Defying Dust.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this glue. The hold is strong , but still soft enough to rework a style until you like it. It makes a matte, totally non-crunchy appearance and texture in the hair. I can use it on either wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is not runny or sloppy like most hair gels, but it is not a viscous putty, either. It is more like a medium-thickness glue. It washes right out with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft and pleasing - sort of tropical, like sunscreen. It&#x27;s nothing like the heavy, cloying scents I previously associated with Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite product made by Axe. The hold is perfect for my long female hair, and my guy friend also loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for either gender, for a strong hold that is still manageable, a nice texture, and a clean scent. An excellent hair styling aid.</li>
            <li> This is white goo that you squirt onto your hands and spread through your hair to help spike it up. Honestly, it works quite well. I don&#x27;t love the scent of it, especially in its concentrated form (straight out of the tube), but luckily once you spread it thoroughly into your hair, the scent isn&#x27;t as strong. Because the product is white and not clear (like a gel), you have to be careful to work it into your hair completely so you don&#x27;t have embarrassing globs of white goo in your hair. Not attractive. But yes, this product does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for hair glue so you can have the spiked up look this is a perfect product for you.  It leaves your hair a little crunchy for my preference, but if you normally use styling glue then it&#x27;ll be right up your alley.  The product also has a nice manly smell, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> The spiking glue is a lot like its name suggests: glue. It really holds your hair in place with very little of the product. It does make your hair feel VERY stiff, so if you don&#x27;t like that then don&#x27;t get this product, but if you want to spike your hair go ahead and get this stuff. It does what it says.</li>
            <li> The hold was fine, and it smells great, and so those are two pretty important things. So why just two stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well a lot of products smell great and perform well. My problem with this one is that it is very, very sticky on your hands, and it leaves a white residue if you don&#x27;t work it in. And I mean work it in a lot. I found I had to use a very small amount (no problem there!) and a good amount of water, but also an unusual amount of time working it in, to get the white residue to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually wondering if I got a bad tube on this, because it was such an obvious and apparent problem for me, and yet looking over the many positive reviews of the product, I don&#x27;t see anyone else who had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can do is review how things worked for me, so I have to rate this poorly. But if you don&#x27;t see any other similar complaints, I guess it is safe to assume something was wrong with mine.</li>
            <li> My son volunteered to try out a variety of bath products.  An older teen, he is pretty picky about his products.  His review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few years, I have experimented with several different gels to mess with my hair and make it comfortable. At first, this product was cool because of how different this \\&quot;spiking glue\\&quot; was from the typical clear/translucent hair gel. It felt a lot like a glue-y lotion and it was easy to style my hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after it dries, there is no going back unless you completely rinse your hair and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this product didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking too shiny as though it were plastic, but instead it had the same effect as certain pommades: it made it look smooth. On the other side, this spiking glue would sometimes feel uncomfortable whenever I would rest my hand on my head (as it would morph my hair a little bit in a way that I did not like; and it was not easy to \\&quot;morph\\&quot; back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I think this product was good in the sense that it was easy to style my hair and made my hair look smooth, but was bad in the sense that I could not change the style once it dried.</li>
            <li> My son didn&#x27;t want the froo-froo looking spiking gel that his sister used, so we tried this. Now he is a happy little man.  It does have the pleasant \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; aroma too.</li>
            <li> My son has used every product Axe makes and is looking forward to making this a part of his grooming routine.</li>
            <li> Axe Spiking Glue works well on very lightly damp or dry hair. It works well on my hair (3-4\\&quot; long), giving me the effect I want without adding shine or crunchiness. It holds all day, and can be helped along by the addition of a spritz or two of hairspray. This isn&#x27;t ultra powerful (try Got2B extreme hold gel for that), but it does provide a flexible, medium-strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is fairly thick, and easy to distribute through one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback to the product is its smell: it&#x27;s similar to other Axe products, though the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong or long-lasting.</li>
            <li> This is one of my son&#x27;s favorite styling products.  His hair stays put when he uses this!  He has fairly short hair and it really has the stay power.  Good and highly recommended by him.</li>
            <li> For the record:  My hair is thick, medium-length and has almost no body to it.  If I use zero hair product I have a serious bowl-do ala 80s&#x27; style.  I used this product on DAMP (NOT wet) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &amp;#34;rolled the dice&amp;#34; on this product because I was seeking something with more hold than the Axe Natural Look grooming cream (green container) and I thought this might &amp;#34;cut the mustard&amp;#34;.  Unfortunately, even though they claim &amp;#34;strong hold without all the hard&amp;#34; I find that the majority of your hair will have a crispness or a crunchiness to it.  Mind you it&#x27;s not the worst I&#x27;ve experience regarding crunchiness but it is too much for me.  I&#x27;ve tried using less product but then you seem to get incomplete hair coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HOLD here is HIGH HOLD leaning toward ULTRA HOLD.  As a result, it will hold your hair for 10 hours or more.  It dispenses from the tube like a firmer or stickier liquid glue.  Another con is that I had trouble styling my hair due to the stickiness, holding properties and stiffness that my hair quickly took on.  I think the heavy hold also weighed down my hair which is another bad quality for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does provide a HIGH SHINE and would be a good product for simply slicking one&#x27;s hair back.  I will say that my hair does look decent and at least it doesn&#x27;t fall into a bowl do.  However, the SPIKED UP LOOK PUTTY (red container) grooming cream type product is proving a better fit for me.  The jury is still out though as I need to try a few more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally I need the AXE NATURAL LOOK product with a bit more hold (MEDIUM) and I would be &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34;.  It would give me that &amp;#34;nice to the touch&amp;#34; look and feel but without having my hair flop into my face within a &amp;#34;city minute&amp;#34;.  But I think it is a fine line in finding a product which exists which has that natural look but also enough hold (without being heavy) so I don&#x27;t end up with &amp;#34;Bowl Do City USA&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing a number of hair products, and this one from Axe is definitely superior in that it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;hard\\&quot; feeling, but it does hold up very well.  As a cream, it works actually better than a gel and I definitely recommend it as a product that should do what you want it to.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to keep trying this to get just the right amount, but so far I either have too little to hold my hair in place or too much so that it clumps together. It reminds me of a cross between Elmer&#x27;s glue and sticky white paste. Either way there&#x27;s no spiking happening here. Just pasty clumping, even when I work at pulling the strands apart, twisting, and pulling. At least it doesn&#x27;t flake like a lot of products do. It does dry hard, especially if you start with damp hair like the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> This Axe product is good for creating a fairly stiff spiked look. It dries on your hands quickly so you have to be ready to apply fast. You need slightly damp hair that is cut to allow for the spiked look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and it lasts for quite awhile but leaves a lot of product on your hair that needs to be washed out daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a whole line of products that are specifically designed for different looks.  You can&#x27;t achieve a &#x27;natural&#x27; look if it&#x27;s easy to tell you have some kind of product in your hair, and yet if you use this spiking glue you&#x27;re definitely going to be able to tell it&#x27;s there but that&#x27;s acceptable for the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very short hair, less than an inch, and wanted something that would allow me to smooth my hair forwards into a slightly touseled front spike.  This does the job pretty well for what I wanted, though if I wanted hard spikes it would not be the right product.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and I don&#x27;t have problems washing the product out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get a great haircut and then re-create it after you leave the stylist, this is a great tool to help you do so.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  That fresh, manly smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the effect this product leaves.  I love the styles the young guys (and maybe the older ones, too) are having.  They look so adorable.  So innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son is a big Axe user.  He uses probably all of their products.  I can always trust him to let me know if something is good or not.  He is cool, and a winner.  He uses these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Spiking glue sounds like it will be a super strong and stiff hold but it&#x27;s actually nice. It doesn&#x27;t make hair overly stiff which can often lead to flakes. It&#x27;s definitely a firm hold but not too hard and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Nice clean fresh scent but not overpowering (Ill be honest, the AXE name scared me).</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this gel with its ability to hold any style together and its soft, non sticky feel! Excellent!</li>
            <li> While my 12-year old son really liked the Axe gum product (for that messy, styled look), he did not care for this product as much. First off it still has a very mild, pleasant smell, so that is a plus. It also was easy to apply and he had no difficulty washing it out. But I expected it to have a stronger hold than the other products and really be able to create a spike. That wasn&#x27;t the case for him. Once he applied it then the \\&quot;spike\\&quot; lasted maybe an hour or two. But it&#x27;s so humid outside right now, so it pretty much fell and ended up looking dirty. If going for a spiky style, then this product probably won&#x27;t do it for you. It is not something we would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time my family has tried a hair product with the name \\&quot;Glue\\&quot; in it.  This holds a lot better than the inexpensive gels we have been using.</li>
            <li> Used on thick, dark, medium length men&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spiking - did a good job, but believe it would hold better with shorter hair and styling annoying areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t leave hair feeling &#x27;disgusting&#x27;. It just felt a little &#x27;crispy&#x27; in the morning when first applied.</li>
            <li> The tube is much more convenient to use than our previous experiences with the jarred Axe products. The fragrance is nice, not overwhelmingly mannish but not girly either. My 11 year old son loves it. The glue does not work as well as the gum for his hair style but does maintain a crisp spiked up look when he does his front \\&quot;bangs\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have two teenage sons that are very reticent to comb their hair. They&#x27;ll do it with some cajolling but not really on their own. I showed them the Axe spiking glue and they both were very happy. No fussing with dad, wake up, spike it up - go. Now I don&#x27;t know if it was meant for such quick action, but it happens, and it works. They look good, I feel good and its all gravy. I have to say I&#x27;m a little bias though. I like Axe products and have been a fan since they debuted, this is just another solid addition to the axe line. What I do miss is their Axe scrubbers though. Those were really well designed. Go Axe!</li>
            <li> Very good hold, all day, strong quick action.&lt;br /&gt;Good smell, a bit aqua smell.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the oz size for the price is not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;Should be in a bigger bottle, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> My kids used this on their hair, and they were generally pleased with the results. It was easy to use and immediately produced the spiked up look they wanted. However, they got tired of that particular look, and they couldn&#x27;t find any other use for the product.</li>
            <li> This works well without the glossy shine. It&#x27;s not so much of a wet look as the other gels. If you are into the spiked look, give this one a try.  Don&#x27;t forget you also get the great Axe scent.  Remember, it drives the girls wild!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really become quite the believer in Axe hair grooming products. Axe Spiking Glue Spiked Up Look is no exception. This hair styling product really has a good hold that doesn&#x27;t turn your hair greasy looking. I like the fact that a little bit of this goes a long way, and even if you over-apply it, it doesn&#x27;t turn flaky or make your hair look like it&#x27;s clogged with grease. The hold is excellent for short to medium length hair, and perfect for thick haired individuals. This stuff really holds strong, and it holds strong all day long, even in heat and high humidity. The scent is pleasing and like a good hair styling product should, the scent quickly fades as it dries so it doesn&#x27;t mix or conflict with your cologne.</li>
