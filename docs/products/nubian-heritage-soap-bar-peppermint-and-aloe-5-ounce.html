            <li>One of the best soaps I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is a great soap!  </li>
            <li>it has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Not too great for hair but awesome for skin!</li>
            <li>This soap smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li>he like the way the almonds felt on his skin, he said it gave a great scrub, smells really good too</li>
            <li>The almonds do a good job of making your skin feel good though.</li>
            <li>it smells good</li>
            <li>and tingling,,,When I have a headache,,, this soap is good for me.</li>
            <li>I admit i liked the feel of this one most of all, as the almonds provide a very nice exfoliant and a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this soap very refreshing</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It foams up really nice too.</li>
            <li>While this is still superior to most soaps on the market, I prefer the Nubian Heritage Mango Butter Soap or Shea Butter Soap.</li>
            <li>I would have liked this more if the scent were a bit stronger, but it is a very lovely scent.</li>
            <li>This soap is very nice and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>So far, this soap is excellent.  </li>
            <li>great right...</li>
            <li>I love all Nubian Heritage products.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is not my favorite Nubian Heritage soap.</li>
            <li>OK, not as scented as I would like.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS collaboration..</li>
            <li>I purchased 1 bar just to make sure that I would like it</li>
            <li>We love all of Nubia&#x27;s soaps.  </li>
            <li>I really love the Nubian Heritage products.</li>
            <li>Nubian Heritage soaps are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Great soap, reasonably priced, delivered in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels clean and refreshed and the smell is amazing...</li>
            <li>It smells great, not heavy or cloying ... and the scent is very light when you&#x27;re done bathing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product and quick ship!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, price was good.</li>
            <li>Kind of warm yet still rather lively...</li>
            <li>So why not buy a natural cleanser with something that smells soooo good</li>
            <li>So Fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li>It is different in a good way.</li>
            <li>Good soap but ladies, keep it away from your private area.</li>
            <li>It does not have a real peppermint smell to it, but I love it&#x27;s exfoliating almond feel.  </li>
            <li>very &amp;#34;Christmas-y&amp;#34; I&#x27;d say.  </li>
            <li>A very soothing smell...and leaves your skill felling like silk.</li>
            <li>, you smelled it outside shower door, and scent stayed on him for a while, left skin soft and very clean!</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this soap as long as the price doesn&#x27;t rise too high!!!!</li>
            <li>This soap makes your skin feel extra clean and keeps it soft!</li>
            <li>They are creamy and last a long time with nice scents and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I would take this soap over most other natural soaps and WAY over any mass produced chemical concoction.</li>
            <li>The crushed almonds do a fine job of scrubbing and cleaning without being too scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so since I was a little girl, my grandmother used baking soda for everything...</li>
            <li>However, if a rich, creamy lather is what you seek, try the other NH soaps.</li>
            <li>We had heard that peppermint soap was good for dry skin, so we ordered a few different bars to try.</li>
            <li>She told me that it was a natural deodorizer and cleanser...</li>
            <li>I have to purchase at least 10 more...</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a real blast to the face of peppermint &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34;, go get a bar of the C.O. Bigelow Mentha body bar soap, from the men&#x27;s section of your local Bath &amp; Body Works</li>
            <li>They leave my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if you have a really good sense of smell you won&#x27;t have a problem with this soap.</li>
            <li>The almonds are pretty rough.</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell it&#x27;s there, but after the first use, only barely.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint smell is not very noticeable -- I only caught a whiff of it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought it to wash my dreads with but this left an almost tacky feel behind on my hair.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed it and may get an occasional bar for the winter to help keep from itching so much due to our hard water.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it leaves heavier residue in the bathroom post-shower than an ordinary soap, but I think it is worth it.</li>

            <li> This soap makes your skin feel extra clean and keeps it soft! The peppermint scented one doesn&#x27;t smell like peppermint at all, but I still like it. It foams up really nice too. I mostly bought it to wash my dreads with but this left an almost tacky feel behind on my hair. Not too great for hair but awesome for skin! Shipping was fast, price was good. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love all Nubian Heritage products. I would take this soap over most other natural soaps and WAY over any mass produced chemical concoction. That being said, this is not my favorite Nubian Heritage soap. The peppermint smell is not very noticeable -- I only caught a whiff of it the first time I used it. The almonds are pretty rough. While this is still superior to most soaps on the market, I prefer the Nubian Heritage Mango Butter Soap or Shea Butter Soap. If you are looking for a rougher soap, then this is the soap for you. However, if a rich, creamy lather is what you seek, try the other NH soaps. I will save this one for scrubbing stains off my hands after I henna my hair and stick to the others for showering.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this soap very refreshing it smells like peppermint gum it has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> We had heard that peppermint soap was good for dry skin, so we ordered a few different bars to try. I admit i liked the feel of this one most of all, as the almonds provide a very nice exfoliant and a pleasant aroma. However there needs to be a stronger peppermint scent to them. We ended up going with the  soap that had the heaviest peppermint scent as that helps us wake up and get the blood flowing. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if you have a really good sense of smell you won&#x27;t have a problem with this soap. I really enjoyed it and may get an occasional bar for the winter to help keep from itching so much due to our hard water.</li>
            <li> OK, not as scented as I would like.  The almonds do a good job of making your skin feel good though.</li>
            <li> Ok, so since I was a little girl, my grandmother used baking soda for everything...She told me that it was a natural deodorizer and cleanser...and of course peppermint smells great right...So why not buy a natural cleanser with something that smells soooo good...peppermint.. and the exfoliating properties of crushed Almonds...you just can&#x27;t go wrong,.I LOVE THIS collaboration..I purchased 1 bar just to make sure that I would like it and oh boy..I have to purchase at least 10 more...Your skin feels clean and refreshed and the smell is amazing...Everyone should try this product, trust me you will not be disappointed..</li>

Bigelow Mentha body bar soap, from the men&#x27;s section of your local Bath &amp; Body Works (yes, there&#x27;s a men&#x27;s section). That stuff will knock you back a step! But it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> So Fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li> We love all of Nubia&#x27;s soaps.  They are creamy and last a long time with nice scents and natural ingredients.  I always keep a stock of them in various scents.</li>
            <li> I really love the Nubian Heritage products. This soap is very nice and leaves my skin feeling clean. It smells great, not heavy or cloying ... and the scent is very light when you&#x27;re done bathing.</li>
            <li> he like the way the almonds felt on his skin, he said it gave a great scrub, smells really good too, you smelled it outside shower door, and scent stayed on him for a while, left skin soft and very clean!</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps I have ever used.  Exfoliates as it cleans. Just enough peppermint essential oil. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like a soaft soap,,,, this one,,,,not only its soft,,,,but it smells good and tingling,,,When I have a headache,,, this soap is good for me.</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage soaps are my favorite. They leave my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> So far, this soap is excellent.  It is different in a good way.</li>
            <li> I have semi-sensitive skin and have gotten into Nubian heritage soaps. This soap smells great and feels great. The only problem is that it leaves heavier residue in the bathroom post-shower than an ordinary soap, but I think it is worth it. My skin is a lot softer now that I use this soap.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product and quick ship!</li>
            <li> Good soap but ladies, keep it away from your private area.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap!  It does not have a real peppermint smell to it, but I love it&#x27;s exfoliating almond feel.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> A very soothing smell...and leaves your skill felling like silk.</li>
            <li> Great soap, reasonably priced, delivered in a timely manner.  I will continue to buy this soap as long as the price doesn&#x27;t rise too high!!!!</li>
