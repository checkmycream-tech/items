            <li>The compact and brush are perfect for size and application.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>GREAT ...!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!!  </li>
            <li>Blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as happy with it as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>and I am happy that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>This product works great for covering your roots.</li>
            <li>Great product for when you just don&#x27;t have time to have your hair done</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it does do the job</li>
            <li>Good coverage, great price, and easily travels.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product for filling in sparse areas on my scalp!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Glad I found this!</li>
            <li>ALL THE TIME, IM  PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The powder colors your scalp (temporarily, until you shampoo it out), so it blends in with your hair and looks like you have more hair.</li>
            <li>However, I would use it in a pinch if I didn&#x27;t have anything better.</li>
            <li>so better to buy Joan rivers coverage than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for in between hair coloring</li>
            <li>but I wish there were more choices for shades.  </li>
            <li>Compact comes with two shades of brown, a lighter one &amp; a darker one, so one can blend to achieve a better match to one&#x27;s hair color.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I have to apply it many times in order to get coverage, and it doesn&#x27;t stick to the scalp at all like the fill-in powder does.  </li>
            <li>Tried to save money, and the price is good, but if you want quick and easy coverage, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li>Great natural looking coverage!  </li>
            <li>Have used this a couple of times, and it is easy to apply and has stayed in pretty good.</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>VERY FAST SHIPPING ...!!  </li>
            <li>would recommend this for anyone who needs a quick fix.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for a quick fix solution in between salon visits.</li>
            <li>I feel it does a pretty good job of covering it naturally, especially in photos.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderful in covering thin spots.  </li>
            <li>I think it is worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, not messy, provides good and natural coverage on bare areas of scalp.  </li>
            <li>If you compare this product to the Joan Rivers brand, this product is equally as good for so much less money.</li>
            <li>its magic for thin hair you can make it and fake it and feels to good to look so wonderful...</li>
            <li>the palett has never come broken and the coverate is very good.  </li>
            <li>The fill-in powder does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>This fill-in powder performs exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li>Did better on the grey.</li>
            <li>but it really seems to go along way</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t blend well with the existing color</li>
            <li>I really like it, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>The product came fast and looked like the picture.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover much of the gray hair.</li>
            <li>I would not buy it again, it does not cover gray very well.  </li>
            <li>I part my hair on the right and apply the powder down the length of the part and instantly it looks like I have more hair.</li>
            <li>The minute you touch those fibers with a small brush to spread them out more evenly on your scalp, the fibers no longer cover your scalp--as if you just swept them away.</li>
            <li>I WILL WRITE BACK IF ANY THING CHANGES. ; )</li>
            <li>It is cheaper, but does not cover naturally like the Joan Rivers product.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t happen with this fill-in powder; I apply the powder in the same manner as putting on eye shadow and I can use the  brush or a cosmetic sponge to even out any places where I possibly applied too much.</li>
            <li>Previously, I tried the kind of fill-in product where you apply what looks like small fibers to your scalp that you shake out of a can as if you&#x27;re putting salt on your hair.</li>
            <li>so I only use it to cover gray, but I&#x27;m 46 and started getting gray hairs in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>And my hair dresser uses the more expensive kind, Joan Rivers, but to me this works just as well for half or less!!</li>

            <li> Hard to put on to cover balding area right.</li>
            <li> I have one that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It covers grey hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, people can&#x27;t tell you have powder on your scalp, either (as long as you don&#x27;t over do it).</li>

            <li> I  would have given 5 stars but due to the bush I only gave 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Just makes it slightly darker but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about this .</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews about</li>
            <li> the product is too loose, too powdery, and messy.</li>
            <li> That being said, it can be difficult to wash off unless you really get in there on the scalp.</li>
            <li> One was black and one dark brown.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product less expensive than Joan Rivers root cover up.</li>
            <li> AND  COVERS THE GRAY &amp; LITTLE HAIRLESS SPOTS</li>
            <li> when I got it the pallet powder the lighter shade all broken and not solid.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the longevity of it is.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product because Joan Rivers product is hard to find now.  </li>
            <li> I have used Joan Rivers&#x27; Fill-In powder in the past, and this is not nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick, brunette hair</li>
            <li> Mine are not that bad</li>
            <li> The brush is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as promised and hides gray hair until you can color it.</li>
            <li> I had never even heard of hair powder until I saw my hair stylist using some on her hair, and I gotta say, I wish I knew it existed years ago. I have really thick, brunette hair so I only use it to cover gray, but I&#x27;m 46 and started getting gray hairs in my early 20&#x27;s. I will so buy this again when needed but it really seems to go along way so it will probably last a while. And my hair dresser uses the more expensive kind, Joan Rivers, but to me this works just as well for half or less!!</li>
            <li> Was looking for something that would cover the gray between coloring. It does an ok job. It really doesn&#x27;t blend well with the existing color but the gray doesn&#x27;t show through.</li>
            <li> Just received this product and tried it.  It worked wonderful in covering thin spots.  Mine are not that bad but it did work.  Not sure what the longevity of it is.  Hopefully it lasts until shampoo.</li>
            <li> its magic for thin hair you can make it and fake it and feels to good to look so wonderful...Thank you</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  I have one that lasts for a long time. It is easy to apply and looks very natural. It does not damage the pillow case or hats, etc..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. The compact and brush are perfect for size and application.&lt;br /&gt;Best emergency treatment for outgrowth I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this for anyone who needs a quick fix. Blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> It covers grey hair.  Sometimes it lasts into the next day.  It also can allow you to skip washing your hair.  I really like it, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! If you compare this product to the Joan Rivers brand, this product is equally as good for so much less money. I will continue to purchase this brand going forward. The fill-in powder does exactly what it says it does. I part my hair on the right and apply the powder down the length of the part and instantly it looks like I have more hair. Also, people can&#x27;t tell you have powder on your scalp, either (as long as you don&#x27;t over do it). The powder colors your scalp (temporarily, until you shampoo it out), so it blends in with your hair and looks like you have more hair. Previously, I tried the kind of fill-in product where you apply what looks like small fibers to your scalp that you shake out of a can as if you&#x27;re putting salt on your hair. The minute you touch those fibers with a small brush to spread them out more evenly on your scalp, the fibers no longer cover your scalp--as if you just swept them away. This doesn&#x27;t happen with this fill-in powder; I apply the powder in the same manner as putting on eye shadow and I can use the  brush or a cosmetic sponge to even out any places where I possibly applied too much. Hands down, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product for filling in sparse areas on my scalp!</li>
            <li> The product came fast and looked like the picture. I wasn&#x27;t as happy with it as I thought I would be. Hard to put on to cover balding area right. Did better on the grey. Would not buy this product again but would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because Joan Rivers product is hard to find now.  It is cheaper, but does not cover naturally like the Joan Rivers product.  However, I would use it in a pinch if I didn&#x27;t have anything better.</li>
            <li> This fill-in powder performs exactly as represented.  Covers my scalp where hair thinning.  Makes hair look fuller, thicker, and scalp not showing through.  It&#x27;s great!  I would recommend it to anyone with noticeably thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Sally&#x27;s and it came in two different shades. One was black and one dark brown. I would recommend this for a quick fix solution in between salon visits. I agree with some of the other reviews about the brush bristles coming out. I think it is worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected. Doesn&#x27;t cover much of the gray hair. Just makes it slightly darker but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Bought this for &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; hair salon appts.  Surprisingly it does do the job and I am happy that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> when I got it the pallet powder the lighter shade all broken and not solid.  does not work and will be returning.  Joan rivers coverage I have used for 2 years not.  It is more expensive. the palett has never come broken and the coverate is very good.  you dont need to reaply once on unless you shampoo your hear. so better to buy Joan rivers coverage than this.</li>
            <li> the product is too loose, too powdery, and messy. However, it does what it says - covers grey and fills in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for in between hair coloring but I wish there were more choices for shades.  I like this product.</li>
            <li> Good coverage, great price, and easily travels.  I like the combination of the two browns in one container.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product works great for covering your roots. The brush is terrible. There is no point on the end of the brush to part your hair. I would highly recommend this product less expensive than Joan Rivers root cover up. I  would have given 5 stars but due to the bush I only gave 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for a long time and didn&#x27;t expect to see it on Amazon.  Great product for when you just don&#x27;t have time to have your hair done but you&#x27;ve got to be somewhere.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, not messy, provides good and natural coverage on bare areas of scalp.  Compact comes with two shades of brown, a lighter one &amp; a darker one, so one can blend to achieve a better match to one&#x27;s hair color.</li>
            <li> Have used this a couple of times, and it is easy to apply and has stayed in pretty good. Glad I purchased this product. Will help between colors.</li>
            <li> I do not use this product to cover gray; I use it to cover thinning areas or parts. I feel it does a pretty good job of covering it naturally, especially in photos. It doesn&#x27;t shake off during the day; once it&#x27;s set, it&#x27;s set. That being said, it can be difficult to wash off unless you really get in there on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I would not buy it again, it does not cover gray very well.  Not much else to say about this .</li>
            <li> I have used Joan Rivers&#x27; Fill-In powder in the past, and this is not nearly as good.

Tried to save money, and the price is good, but if you want quick and easy coverage, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST SHIPPING ...!!  THIS  STUFF  WORKS  GREAT ...!!AND  COVERS THE GRAY &amp; LITTLE HAIRLESS SPOTS, I USE IT ALL THE TIME, IM  PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT. I WILL WRITE BACK IF ANY THING CHANGES. ; )</li>
            <li> Great natural looking coverage!  Glad I found this!</li>
