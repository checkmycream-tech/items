            <li>The best face cream ever!</li>
            <li>but it also is not as moisturizing aside from that it is a very good cream.</li>

            <li>Wonderful for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I found Essence Certified Organic Olive Essence Gold Antioxidant Dmae &amp; was pretty happy with it until I ordered it again &amp;</li>
            <li>Very light and nourishing.</li>
            <li>Love this - use as my night cream.</li>
            <li>I will warn you that it does not have SPF so make sure to wear your sunblock.</li>
            <li>Most lotions and cleansers</li>
            <li>My skin is now softer &amp; more supple.</li>
            <li>it was way more than i needed.</li>
            <li>It feels a lot more watery than almost any face cream I have tried but it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>The tube is easy to use and I like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and then it sets.</li>

            <li>She has this sensitive skin and it turns out this product is good in this way,</li>
            <li>and I feel good about the natural ingredients list.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin looks very fresh.</li>
            <li>I say try it consistently for awhile and get used to it to know for sure</li>
            <li>This face cream is very hydrating and great for my sensitive yet combination skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of thicker face cream, but this one is superior to the others I&#x27;ve tried, not to mention cheaper.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take me a full pump to cover all the way.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s natural and chemical free too.</li>

            <li> I am now a fan for life! This stuff is amazing. It feels great on my skin, it makes my face very smooth. I love how it&#x27;s natural and chemical free too.</li>
            <li> If you want to have glorious skin...order this now.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft. I prefer applying it after a shower, and it&#x27;s very thick if I use it on unwashed skin. I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of thicker face cream, but this one is superior to the others I&#x27;ve tried, not to mention cheaper. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This lotion was a big surprise!! I was afraid it would not moisturize enough.  It&#x27;s not greasy but gives me a nice healthy glow even after I apply my mineral powder makeup. Which is nice now that I&#x27;m over 50. I also use the eye cream and love it too!!</li>
            <li> Love this - use as my night cream.</li>
            <li> Well let me begin by saying that I buy all my nourish products directly from Nourish. I cannot say enough about this product. The face cream has a nice thickness to it. You do not need a lot for your face.  It makes your skin feel silky smooth. I have noticed that my skin looks very fresh. It also has a great smell. Other face creams I have tried have in the past have ingredients that really irritate my skin. I will warn you that it does not have SPF so make sure to wear your sunblock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit dry. I bought this for my niece, who is 16. She has this sensitive skin and it turns out this product is good in this way, no reaction at all.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not that hydrating as advertised. She feels it dry and hard to put it on. I tried it out as well, and I agree.</li>
            <li> I put this on after I wash my face. Although at first it seems oily, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t stay oily. I have sensitive skin. Most lotions and cleansers I have to try for a few weeks to see if they help and this one was no exceptions. After my skin got used to this lotion, I see a difference in my complexion. I say try it consistently for awhile and get used to it to know for sure if it&#x27;s for you before you give up. And a little goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t take me a full pump to cover all the way. 😊</li>
            <li> Love it!  It holds in moisture and plumps up skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this face cream! The main thing that drew me to this product was the fact that it&#x27;s USDA certified organic.  No harsh chemicals or ingredients, just pure natural, and organic!  I&#x27;m starting to notice an improvement in the texture of my skin and a little goes a long way, so it lasts a long time.  I will definitely be buying this for my face moisturizer from now on!</li>
            <li> While using Nourish my skin became flaky &amp; very dry. Nourish goes on very wet &amp; dries tight. It is a horrible feeling. I have tried the Nourish line of body wash &amp; body cream &amp; cannot recommend the Nourish brand as I have had a bad experience with all of their products, this is unfortunate because I was thrilled to find a certified organic line of beauty products.  After only using it for about a week &amp; a half my skin looked aged &amp; dull.  My skin was also starting to peel from being dried out - it wasn&#x27;t like this prior to using Nourish.  I switched to [[ASIN:B004I14JCC Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Repair Moisturizer]] When I first applied Juice Beauty my skin burned. I believe this was due to how extremely dry my skin had become the short time I was using the Nourish cream. By the second day or 3rd application of Juice Beauty my skin stopped burning &amp; was already healing. My skin is now softer &amp; more supple. It no longer feels tight nor does it hurt/burn/itch or feel greasy like it does with some of my second favorite beauty brand Weleda.  The problem with the Juice Beauty is it is crazy expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin:  I run an organic family farm so my skin is exposed to the outdoor elements year round, from the harsh sun to the icy dry winds in winter. On top of that we only heat our home with a wood stove. Needless to say, my mature skin needs serious TLC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many natural organic brands over the years &amp; the only brand that has been decent for my aging skin until discovering Juice Beauty has been the Weleda line. The problem with Weleda is that some of their products tend to be greasy, but they are very moisturizing &amp; very affordable (the cold cream is great for the winter). For a while MyChelle Deep Repair Cream seemed to be doing a decent job but I believe they changed their formula which led me to once again be on the search for a good cream. I found Essence Certified Organic Olive Essence Gold Antioxidant Dmae &amp; was pretty happy with it until I ordered it again &amp; a nasty smelling sticky mess arrived that I had to return. 100% Pure Organic Acai Berry Facial Cream left my skin both greasy &amp; dry; it is not a brand I&#x27;d recommend. My third favorite brand right now is Acure Night Cream. Acure is not as greasy as Weleda which is a plus but it also is not as moisturizing aside from that it is a very good cream. John Masters Organics Day Cream is a very nice moisturizer for that can be reapplied often without it getting nasty but it is not moisturizing enough for my skin during the winter months. A great all purpose treatment is Organic Argan Oil. I use it to remove my eye makeup, as an eye treatment &amp; use it under creams that are not moisturizing enough or alone in the hot &amp; humid summer months. Argan oil is an excellent intimate lubricant as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many more than the few brands I&#x27;ve taken the time out to list here in this review.

It is my hope that you find my review helpful in finding the right cream for your skin. Good luck!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve baked with xanthan gum then you know the slimy consistency it has when wetted. Nourish Organic&#x27;s Ultra Hydrating Face Lotion feels a bit slimy like that. It seems like the only reason it&#x27;s at all thick is because of the XG.  It&#x27;s not a plant oil that&#x27;s moisturizing; it&#x27;s just a water-based application that doesn&#x27;t feel like it does much for the skin. If they just called the product lotion they could get away with it, but since it&#x27;s supposedly \\&quot;ultra hydrating,\\&quot; I give two stars.</li>
            <li> Silky on your skin. A single push on the pump dispenses enough for my face and neck. No greasy or oily feeling. The best face cream ever! Tiny wrinkles are disappearing too.</li>
            <li> im not sure if its because of my oily skin or that i may be allergic to an ingredient in the cream, but it causes me to break out a bit on my face. The first time i applied it, i used a whole pump of the bottle. it was way more than i needed. you only need half a pump for your face and neck. I apply the cream before bedtime and its thick&amp;heavy and makes my pores feel clogged. It was like i lathered petroleum jelly all over my face. When I wake up in the morning, i usually have a few new pimples around my face. This has never happened to me with any other face creams I use at night. I was bummed out that an ORGANIC cream caused me to break out. As for the hydration claim, the only super dry spot on my face is my chin, and this product doesn&#x27;t make me feel moisturized. I didnt see any improvement on the dryness.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product I&#x27;ve been using for a while.  Wonderful for sensitive skin.  Nice feel to it on the face</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and then it sets. Feels thin at first, but after a few seconds it really feels creamy. Light scent and I feel good about the natural ingredients list. No more Olay for me!</li>
            <li> the cream is very smooth and feels nice on my skin. The tube is easy to use and I like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Very light and nourishing. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This face cream is very hydrating and great for my sensitive yet combination skin. It can be used alone or with the Nourish Organic Argan oil face serum. If you use the face serum, you won&#x27;t need to use this cream in the summer months. I have both, so I&#x27;ll only use this during the dry winter months because that&#x27;s when my skin will need extra moisture and protection</li>
            <li> Smell is very subtle - not extremely pleasant, but not too bad. It feels a lot more watery than almost any face cream I have tried but it absorbs very quickly. I mix it with my foundation sometimes.</li>
