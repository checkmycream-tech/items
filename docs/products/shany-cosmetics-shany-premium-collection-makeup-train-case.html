            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>

            <li>I do see the issue some have said that it can tip if too much is in the top but not enough weight in the bottom</li>
            <li>Bigger than i expected.. i love it!!</li>
            <li>I love the SHANY Cosmetics SHANY Premium Collection Makeup Train Case, Hot Pink Diamond ,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what I would call &amp;#34;Hot Pink&amp;#34;, but more of a pretty, feminine pink.  </li>
            <li>This is a very durable case.  </li>
            <li>It holds so much makeup.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but really it&#x27;s a lunchbox.</li>
            <li>Came fast and with issues.</li>
            <li>Not  to much of a make up</li>
            <li>Wish it came with customizable dividers to keep things straight in each tray.</li>
            <li>She loves it so much.  </li>
            <li>They really need to make a medium size.  </li>
            <li>It really needs to have duel shelves to balance out this problem.  </li>
            <li>I love the pink color too.  </li>
            <li>The product looks great but has poor</li>
            <li>shany label was at wrong size of the case,  but it is ok,  nice case.</li>
            <li>The telescoping trays are a clever idea, and add to the functionality.</li>
            <li>Purchased this case mainly for travel purposes to transport my cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The only major issue is that when the inner section is opened fully, it tips the whole case over (when full with make-up&amp;#34;  This is mainly because there is only one shelving area.</li>
            <li>I use mine as an adult &amp;#34;toybox &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A train that holds nearly every piece of make up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and should last a life-time...</li>
            <li>Got this as a Birthday gift for my friend for her Birthday and needless to say, she loved it........</li>
            <li>Sturdy and a pretty pink.</li>
            <li>colour is not hot pink more a normal pink shade.</li>
            <li>We bought this for Christmas for our daughter that is a vocal major in grad school.  </li>
            <li>I am not a professional by any means, I recently started dabbling in this arena, and even though I tend to overbuy, I know I cannot possibly have more than the average makeup aficionado.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it because it&#x27;s pink and looks like it has diamonds (yes, she is a very girly girl,</li>
            <li>It barely fits anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely well made and very sturdy.  </li>

            <li> It barely fits anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely well made and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> but it is a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> Looked a long  time before selecting this case..</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected,</li>
            <li> I brought this in a week, and it shipped earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> It could be a little bit bigger but bigger</li>
            <li> The various levels allow you to organize and store your makeup and it is plenty big for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This one is a little too big.</li>
            <li> I have to carefully balance the shelves at a 90 degree angle or it tips.  </li>
            <li> I did like the pink color.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and holds ALL of your make-up needs not to mention false eye lashes, hair spray, make-up brushes etc.  </li>
            <li> If you have a Dr. Pepper chapstick and keep having to spend $50 at MAC to get your makeup done, because you are lazy to learn like me - get the bigger size.</li>
            <li> If I had purchased this for myself, I would have returned it due to this issue, but the girls don&#x27;t seem to care that it&#x27;s lopsided.</li>
            <li> One other knock is the weight...</li>
            <li> Its very heavy even empty.</li>
            <li> That said, it is incredibly heavy.  </li>
            <li> This case is heavy.  </li>
            <li> it is on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this one because the small one is too small.  </li>
            <li> I did keep the item however, because I was tired of having five thousand makeup bags everywhere.</li>
            <li> The worse part about this case is that it tips over.  </li>
            <li> but the function is useless.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed by this product.</li>

            <li> My wife loves this.  I do see the issue some have said that it can tip if too much is in the top but not enough weight in the bottom but it is a minor issue.  The case is very well made and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!  It could be a little bit bigger but bigger cases cost much more. Better case than others that I have seen/reviewed. Looked a long  time before selecting this case.. Well worth cost is very well made and sturdy and pretty as well.</li>
            <li> Bigger than i expected.. i love it!!</li>
            <li> Got for my daughter who dances. It is simply great. The pink is striking and it holds a lot of makeup easily. I am jealous and plan to purchase one for myself now. The Seller sent it quickly and safely, also.</li>
            <li> Quite happy with the quality and storage of this case.  I had been looking for awhile and this was a lucky buy.</li>
            <li> Lovely color, sturdy, and holds a ton of stuff. The telescoping trays are a clever idea, and add to the functionality. My daughter loves it because it&#x27;s pink and looks like it has diamonds (yes, she is a very girly girl, and she&#x27;s 7 and she&#x27;s reading this as I type).  The locks close smoothly, and the keys work well. Now if only I can keep my daughter out of it!</li>
            <li> This is a very durable case.  It holds so much makeup.  I am very pleased with the size and storage inside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, it&#x27;s big but it fit all of my makeup. I didn&#x27;t rate it five stars because the straps it came with weren&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> This case is set up perfectly!  It has expandable drawers that lift out so you can access the items below easily.  The mirror is a great feature and when lifted up with the tray is the perfect height when on a table.  The case itself is super cute and we&#x27;ve received many compliments already.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed by this product. It&#x27; supposedly for makeup, but really it&#x27;s a lunchbox. I thought this would be big enough to store all my makeup, and that I would have space forever after, in the event that I wanted to add to the hoard of makeup that exists in my life already. It barely fits anything. I am not a professional by any means, I recently started dabbling in this arena, and even though I tend to overbuy, I know I cannot possibly have more than the average makeup aficionado. I did keep the item however, because I was tired of having five thousand makeup bags everywhere. I do plan on purchasing a bigger case because I know my collection will grow as I become sucked into contouring and primer. If you have 2 mascaras, a compact, and lipgloss great.  If you have a Dr. Pepper chapstick and keep having to spend $50 at MAC to get your makeup done, because you are lazy to learn like me - get the bigger size. Is there a bigger size? Size definitely matters ladies.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Birthday gift for my friend for her Birthday and needless to say, she loved it........it&#x27;s the perfect start up makeup case for a Make Up Artist............GET IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for a friend who has been shopping around for ages for one.  She said this is the best one she&#x27;s ever seen.  The quality on the case is great.  The construction seems top notch.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Thos cosmetic case is beautiful. Didnt think it was worth 60 bux but seeing the reviews and loving the image online I wanted to see for myself and it was no dissapointment. Made durably and it was actually bigger than I thought.  Came fast and with issues. Also brings 2 sets of keys to lock your belonggings. The color is beautiful. Prettier than pic. Im happy. Not  to much of a make up gurl soines fit great. Still wisjlh ot would have been cheaper but Im in love now so who cares.</li>
            <li> Love this case. Very cute. Color is beautiful and locks so you can keep your goodies safe. I use mine as an adult &amp;#34;toybox &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> great product and super fast shipping!! love it!!</li>
            <li> shany label was at wrong size of the case,  but it is ok,  nice case.</li>
            <li> A train that holds nearly every piece of make up. It does tip over if not loaded on bottom tray with heavier items. Wish it came with customizable dividers to keep things straight in each tray. Sturdy and a pretty pink.</li>
            <li> This makeup case is so roomy, beautiful, and just as described.  In fact, I like it even more in person than in the pictures!  It holds all of my makeup easily, with room for more.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and very stylish and feminine.  I would recommend this case to anyone.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt this is a beautiful case from the outside.  Very sturdy and holds ALL of your make-up needs not to mention false eye lashes, hair spray, make-up brushes etc.  It is a very big case.  That said, it is incredibly heavy.  Putting it over your shoulder using the strap that is included will blow out your back.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  This case is heavy.  The worse part about this case is that it tips over.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but that is a deal breaker for me.  You can&#x27;t use this case with it fully extended.  I have to carefully balance the shelves at a 90 degree angle or it tips.  BTW, it doesn&#x27;t stay at a 90 degree angle because the shelves aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; enough to stay put.  Buy the case with the shelves that open in opposite directions.  You&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> We bought this for Christmas for our daughter that is a vocal major in grad school.  She loves it so much.  It&#x27;s made so well and is so perfect for all her make-up and her needs.  I do believe it&#x27;ll last a life time!!  It&#x27;s the perfect gift for any daughter of any age!!</li>
            <li> High quality and beautiful. I love it! My sister in law saw mine and wants one too! It will be a perfect Christmas gift for her.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my make up artist friend. Its very heavy even empty. When we were putting things in it wpuld fall to the side. My friend loved it thou!!!</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this one because the small one is too small.  This one is a little too big. They really need to make a medium size.  I did like the deeper bottom but it will tip over easily.  I did like the pink color.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these for my teenage daughters. The cases are sturdy and cute. They come with straps which make it easy to carry and travel with. The only major issue is that when the inner section is opened fully, it tips the whole case over (when full with make-up&amp;#34;  This is mainly because there is only one shelving area. It really needs to have duel shelves to balance out this problem.  If I had purchased this for myself, I would have returned it due to this issue, but the girls don&#x27;t seem to care that it&#x27;s lopsided.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my tween daughter and she absolutely loved it!  It&#x27;s very well made and should last a life-time...</li>
            <li> I love the SHANY Cosmetics SHANY Premium Collection Makeup Train Case, Hot Pink Diamond , Thank you, it was just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> This cosmetic train case is AWESOME!  I bought it just for myself to organize all of my makeup.  It&#x27;s extremely well made and very sturdy.  It&#x27;s also a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s a good thing.  I&#x27;m able to fit TONS of makeup in this.  I love the pink color too.  It&#x27;s not what I would call &amp;#34;Hot Pink&amp;#34;, but more of a pretty, feminine pink.  I recommend putting heavier items on the bottom shelves, and lighter items on the upper shelves to help prevent it from tipping over when fully opened.  This would make a fantastic gift for anyone who has a lot of cosmetics to store and organize.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> purchased this for my daughter for christmas.  i was very happy when it arrived and she was very excited when she received it.  all her make-up and brushes fit, she can attach the strap on it when she takes it when she is working on set.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected, but that&#x27;s probably because I didn&#x27;t read the measurements correctly.  Fits so much stuff &amp; has an easy to carry shoulder strap.</li>
            <li> I brought this in a week, and it shipped earlier than I expected. I just got it today. It is so nicely made, and it is surely a product that you would love. I think it is slightly bigger than I thought. But since my make up is for personal use, and also for my dance team. It is a good choice to make yourself more organized. The color is perfect pink, and the mirror is just so perfect for your own use. I highly recommend it, and surely would be something worth consideration.</li>
            <li> This case was just what it show to be. The construction was good and really large enough to hold everything you need. Great value for what you get.  My granddaughter loves it. I would definitely order another one if needed.</li>
            <li> The product looks great but has poor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box falls over when opened and filled with product. The design does not take into account the weight distribution of the box when filled with product.  It make you think that they never placed any make up in it when designing this box.  Great looking box but the function is useless. Would be great it the problem would be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this and have returned it since.</li>
            <li> Purchased this case mainly for travel purposes to transport my cosmetics.Couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.....colour is not hot pink more a normal pink shade. Case seems quite sturdy and secure. (came with two keys for the lock , which i am still trying to locate)I think it is a tad too big but it will be able to hold both my makeup and toiletries which is a plus in my book so can&#x27;t really complain. One other knock is the weight...it is on the heavy side. Overall, I am quite pleased with my case . Perfect for the girl who loves cute things and wants to be more organized.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup case. The various levels allow you to organize and store your makeup and it is plenty big for everyday use.</li>
