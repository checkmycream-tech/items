    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks now, and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Way to ruin what used to be a really great product!!!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried it, you&#x27;ll be impressed.</li>
            <li>So the search continues for that perfect shampoo.</li>
            <li>But it suds up beautifully.</li>
            <li>Reduces curls and friz, leaves my hair looking great all day.</li>
            <li>The smell of the Pantene Curly Hair Series shampoo is just great.  </li>
            <li>This has been a great shampoo for me</li>
            <li>I could wash my hair on Monday, and on Friday, it still looked good to go.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and its accompanying conditioner (which I purchased separately), I&#x27;m delighted with the change.  </li>
            <li>(she still must use a frizz serum or spray), but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>For my hair, these were both very good and curl defining, and kept my hair in good shape despite its being fine and permed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The old formula put a great bounce into the curl, had great frizz control, and smelled really great!!!    </li>
            <li>Like this product, very pleased</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>If you have the kind of curly hair that does not require a perm to look good, you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li>Then I kind of panicked.</li>
            <li>I have to be completely honest.  </li>
            <li>You may have bought (and liked, as I did)</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft, manageable and, yes, smell delightful.  </li>
            <li>if you buy it buy it because it has a good lather and gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li>&quot;    It cleans hair just fine and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Tried this shampoo, and it is very moisturizing and great for all hair.  </li>
            <li>that Pantene says it can be safely used on color-treated</li>
            <li>I love my patene</li>
            <li>am used to more of the floral or fruit scents and to me this is more like a lotion</li>
            <li>to get a build up and will be ok to use it again after i stop for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It works as well as the salon products shampoos and conditioners we&#x27;ve tried, at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a magic bullet</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a lot more selective in that area,</li>
            <li>My hair is not curly, so perhaps it has some sort of magical power over curly hair.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say about it.  </li>
            <li>A call to Pantene today confirmed my perception of this change... and their rep didn&#x27;t even try to recommend something more suitable, or offer a coupon or anything in the way of an apology.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this product the first couple weeks I used.</li>
            <li>The OLD formula worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>My very curly shoulder-length hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you have really thick--frizzy--curly hair, this would be a good product for you--</li>
            <li>5 stars, easily.</li>
            <li>The smell, although nice at first, become overpowering after two uses.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to be able to try a new bottle via Amazon Vine</li>
            <li>shampoo cleans very thoroughly, has a nice, light scent, and rinses out easily and well.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be more effective than the previous generation Pantene Pro-V series products, and when used with the matching conditioner, it creates excellent natural curls, without any hassle.     </li>
            <li>No frizz, and tangle free.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is nice, but wish I could find one that really would eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tend to care much about the kind of shampoo or conditioner or use.</li>
            <li>you enjoy the feeling of trying to wash out dreadlocks every day or ever couple</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product from the very beginning.  </li>
            <li>I loved the old formula.</li>
            <li>That wax coating over your hair strands will make your hair appear clean by not letting your body&#x27;s oils coat your hair, but your hair needs those oils for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair feels clean.  </li>
            <li>my hair is soft, light, and has nice defined curls.</li>
            <li>So this Pantene gets my hair clean, smells reasonably good, and is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Except, is that such a good thing?</li>
            <li>maybe I don&#x27;t love this product so much.</li>
            <li>If you liked the old version, I recommend sticking with it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that it performed on my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>If you like that super frizzed out, teased,</li>
            <li>b&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always enjoy using Pantene products, as most of the time they leave my hair feeling silky soft.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it&#x27;s rinsing and cleaning every strand of hair, all with a crisp and clean fragrance that you just gotta inhale.  </li>
            <li>I used to love the old formula.  </li>
            <li>I did appreciate the scent more than my old shampoo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only catching the formula change now, as I tend to stock up on shampoo and conditioner on sale</li>
            <li>and I sure do miss the old stuff.  </li>
            <li>In addition the smell of the shampoo while nice at first becomes less appealing after using the shampoo for awhile.</li>
            <li>Cheap shampoo that gets your hair clean and smells at least reasonably good.  </li>
            <li>a product just isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>The fragrance is clean, pleasant and mildly reminiscent of berries, without being heavy or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>So it may be me, it may be my hair but the new version of Curly isn&#x27;t as amazing as the old formula on my hair.</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;m fine with using this shampoo on a daily basis, I can&#x27;t say it was a miracle solution for moisturized smooth hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>first thing I love about it is the instant blast of bubbles</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s priced competitively and in many ways goes above and beyond the competition.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a longtime user of Pro-V Curly Hair shampoo (and conditioner) and was glad I&#x27;d gotten a bottle before I saw the shelves cleared at my local retailer.</li>
            <li>However, I recently go this and noticed my hair had a bit more body and was easier to control.</li>
            <li>pretty cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was willing to give it a try and used it four times.  </li>
            <li>My tween daughter has long hair that is ringlet-curly, and very fine.   </li>
            <li>One positive</li>
            <li>That said, it does do exactly what it says and it does it very well.     </li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it really brought out my curls</li>
            <li>but for someone who only has some natural waves, it just doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling light and free.</li>
            <li>Once dry, your hair springs up and does not require much more attention.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but it&#x27;s just slightly feminine for my taste.  </li>
            <li>hoping for better results based on product description but for me just did not live up to the expectations.</li>
            <li>It smelled good, but because it&#x27;s meant for curly hair that you want to style straight, it just weights the hair down to loosen the natural curls.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for three weeks now and the results have been just ok.&lt;br /&gt;Today i tried it in very high humidity</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say, this shampoo really helps.  </li>
            <li>it is humid, my curly hair seems to go anywhere that it wants to go.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really fault the Pantene.  </li>
            <li>You really screwed the pooch on this one</li>
            <li>My curls are bouncy and shiny with great definition and body and no longer look tired and worn out.  </li>
            <li>Since using this my curls have really tightened up.</li>
            <li>My husband has curly hair and after using this shampoo, it really calms those frizzies of his.</li>
            <li>scent is light enough not to give a head ache like say with Suave for Curls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers up really well.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product works for really frizzy curly hair, but it did not work for mine.  </li>
            <li>The extra cost isn&#x27;t justified by the scent alone.</li>
            <li>So It really didn&#x27;t do the job it claims to do</li>
            <li>A product that keeps your hair nice and dried out all week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my stylist about this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy duty, stands on the bottom or cap, plus the cap has a very positive lock - I&#x27;d feel safe traveling with this bottle.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted my hair to be softer than it naturally is, but have never hit on the right products to help me achieve this goal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found even one that didn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair, which should be the entire point.  </li>
            <li>When I saw my old red-accented bottles for both shampoo and conditioner, though there seemed to be a name change, it was easy to assume it was the same product</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo daily for about 2 1/2 weeks and it has been gentle enough to not cause issues with fly-away hair and more breakage.</li>
            <li>sure the price is really worth it though since i get similar results from other shampoos i have used.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>The larger bottles are a better buy per ounce than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, it lathers REALLY well with lots of thick suds which I like, and it seems to rinse out</li>
            <li>Why fix it when the older Hydrating Curls worked so well.</li>
            <li>It is of the high quality I expect from Pantene.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is soft to the touch and much, mucuh easier to comb and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the Shampoo and Conditioner for a few days and it has made my hair a lot better from what I was using before.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair with my normal brand, I could still smell the Pantene.  </li>
            <li>but I normally use the type with conditioner built in.  </li>
            <li>The new Pantine curly hair conditioner and shampoo has tamed my hair in high humidity.  </li>
            <li>The old formula always left my hair feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>and I had a new bottle of the conditioner.     </li>
            <li>The new version, for me, is a four star (although for my daughter&#x27;s hair, it remains a five).</li>
            <li>(I suppose she thought its worth this many stars because she&#x27;s used worse).  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference between one shampoo and the next.  </li>
            <li>This new formula My hair feels really rough and dry, even when washing it, my hair is a frizzy mess by the end of the day, and does not smell as good as the old stuff!!!    </li>
            <li>I have very long, thick hair, with a fair amount of natural wave.  </li>
            <li>They have flat caps on top, so you can keep them upside down.  </li>
            <li>A little perfumey but light.</li>
            <li>As a guy with short, straight hair I might not be the target user for this shampoo, but nonetheless I&#x27;m going to rave about it because frankly it feels</li>
            <li>My hair is really soft after using it.</li>
            <li>But your hair produces oil naturally.</li>
            <li>The old version was five stars clear and away.</li>
            <li>On really humid days he still needs to use an additional product, but overall this shampoo works.</li>
            <li>and it did not hold up nearly as well as my Herbal</li>
            <li>/&gt;Did leave my curls soft and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old guy with a buzz cut, so this product was not designed for me.  </li>
            <li>(Ok, that one was just for me as I am a sucker for curly</li>
            <li>She felt like the shampoo was stripping out all the natural oils from her hair.  </li>
            <li>then I dug out one of the old \\&quot;Hydrating</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an ethnic (CaribAfroLatina mix) and used the Hydrating Curls series to maintain my natural and sometimes texturized hair.</li>
            <li>and my wife has leaving this bottle about half full</li>
            <li>If Pantene doesn&#x27;t bring back the old formula I am switching to a new brand.   </li>
            <li>For example, we normally get about 50 inches of precipitation but in the last 12 months, we have had 62 inches.  </li>
            <li>Hoped the new stuff was a name-change only...</li>
            <li>like any shampoo I have to change after a few weeks since my hair is super fine&lt;</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll go back to the old stuff with conditioner built in.  </li>
            <li>her natural, though moderate, curls</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pantene... you need to bring back your old formula.</li>
            <li>This product is thick, the scent is light and not overbearing, but is feminine.  </li>
            <li>I received full sized bottles of the entire \\&quot;Curly\\&quot; line in the mail a few days ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, but terribly tangly and will frizz without the right combination of hair products.   </li>
            <li>I examined my dry ends after using it and they were a little better but still dry.     </li>
            <li>My Hair: Long (just past shoulders), very curly and extremely frizzy, brown, thick    Pantene Curly Hair smells good.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo for about 2 weeks and while I saw a slight difference in my hair texture, it was not dramatic.</li>
            <li>Pantene shampoo was a big disappointment -- it left my hair feeling less clean, and more coated.  </li>
            <li>the old \\&quot;Dry to Moisturized\\&quot; or \\&quot;Hydrating Curls\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I had to double condition my hair and try to work the mess out with my fingers in the shower, before I could even get a super wide tooth comb through to work out the rest of the knots.</li>

            <li> If you liked the old version, I recommend sticking with it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that it performed on my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> If you like that super frizzed out, teased,</li>
            <li> b&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always enjoy using Pantene products, as most of the time they leave my hair feeling silky soft.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s rinsing and cleaning every strand of hair, all with a crisp and clean fragrance that you just gotta inhale.  </li>
            <li> I used to love the old formula.  </li>
            <li> I did appreciate the scent more than my old shampoo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only catching the formula change now, as I tend to stock up on shampoo and conditioner on sale</li>
            <li> and I sure do miss the old stuff.  </li>
            <li> In addition the smell of the shampoo while nice at first becomes less appealing after using the shampoo for awhile.</li>
            <li> Cheap shampoo that gets your hair clean and smells at least reasonably good.  </li>
            <li> a product just isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> The fragrance is clean, pleasant and mildly reminiscent of berries, without being heavy or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> So it may be me, it may be my hair but the new version of Curly isn&#x27;t as amazing as the old formula on my hair.</li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;m fine with using this shampoo on a daily basis, I can&#x27;t say it was a miracle solution for moisturized smooth hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> first thing I love about it is the instant blast of bubbles</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s priced competitively and in many ways goes above and beyond the competition.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of Pro-V Curly Hair shampoo (and conditioner) and was glad I&#x27;d gotten a bottle before I saw the shelves cleared at my local retailer.</li>
            <li> However, I recently go this and noticed my hair had a bit more body and was easier to control.</li>
            <li> pretty cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was willing to give it a try and used it four times.  </li>
            <li> My tween daughter has long hair that is ringlet-curly, and very fine.   </li>
            <li> One positive</li>
            <li> That said, it does do exactly what it says and it does it very well.     </li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it really brought out my curls</li>
            <li> but for someone who only has some natural waves, it just doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling light and free.</li>
            <li> Once dry, your hair springs up and does not require much more attention.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but it&#x27;s just slightly feminine for my taste.  </li>
            <li> hoping for better results based on product description but for me just did not live up to the expectations.</li>
            <li> It smelled good, but because it&#x27;s meant for curly hair that you want to style straight, it just weights the hair down to loosen the natural curls.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for three weeks now and the results have been just ok.&lt;br /&gt;Today i tried it in very high humidity</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say, this shampoo really helps.  </li>
            <li> it is humid, my curly hair seems to go anywhere that it wants to go.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really fault the Pantene.  </li>
            <li> You really screwed the pooch on this one</li>
            <li> My curls are bouncy and shiny with great definition and body and no longer look tired and worn out.  </li>
            <li> Since using this my curls have really tightened up.</li>
            <li> My husband has curly hair and after using this shampoo, it really calms those frizzies of his.</li>
            <li> scent is light enough not to give a head ache like say with Suave for Curls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product works for really frizzy curly hair, but it did not work for mine.  </li>
            <li> The extra cost isn&#x27;t justified by the scent alone.</li>
            <li> So It really didn&#x27;t do the job it claims to do</li>
            <li> A product that keeps your hair nice and dried out all week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my stylist about this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty, stands on the bottom or cap, plus the cap has a very positive lock - I&#x27;d feel safe traveling with this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted my hair to be softer than it naturally is, but have never hit on the right products to help me achieve this goal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found even one that didn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair, which should be the entire point.  </li>
            <li> When I saw my old red-accented bottles for both shampoo and conditioner, though there seemed to be a name change, it was easy to assume it was the same product</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo daily for about 2 1/2 weeks and it has been gentle enough to not cause issues with fly-away hair and more breakage.</li>
            <li> sure the price is really worth it though since i get similar results from other shampoos i have used.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> The larger bottles are a better buy per ounce than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, it lathers REALLY well with lots of thick suds which I like, and it seems to rinse out</li>
            <li> Why fix it when the older Hydrating Curls worked so well.</li>
            <li> It is of the high quality I expect from Pantene.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is soft to the touch and much, mucuh easier to comb and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the Shampoo and Conditioner for a few days and it has made my hair a lot better from what I was using before.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair with my normal brand, I could still smell the Pantene.  </li>
            <li> but I normally use the type with conditioner built in.  </li>
            <li> The new Pantine curly hair conditioner and shampoo has tamed my hair in high humidity.  </li>
            <li> The old formula always left my hair feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> and I had a new bottle of the conditioner.     </li>
            <li> The new version, for me, is a four star (although for my daughter&#x27;s hair, it remains a five).</li>
            <li> (I suppose she thought its worth this many stars because she&#x27;s used worse).  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference between one shampoo and the next.  </li>
            <li> This new formula My hair feels really rough and dry, even when washing it, my hair is a frizzy mess by the end of the day, and does not smell as good as the old stuff!!!    </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair, with a fair amount of natural wave.  </li>
            <li> They have flat caps on top, so you can keep them upside down.  </li>
            <li> A little perfumey but light.</li>
            <li> As a guy with short, straight hair I might not be the target user for this shampoo, but nonetheless I&#x27;m going to rave about it because frankly it feels</li>
            <li> My hair is really soft after using it.</li>
            <li> But your hair produces oil naturally.</li>
            <li> The old version was five stars clear and away.</li>
            <li> On really humid days he still needs to use an additional product, but overall this shampoo works.</li>
            <li> and it did not hold up nearly as well as my Herbal</li>
            <li> /&gt;Did leave my curls soft and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old guy with a buzz cut, so this product was not designed for me.  </li>
            <li> (Ok, that one was just for me as I am a sucker for curly</li>
            <li> She felt like the shampoo was stripping out all the natural oils from her hair.  </li>
            <li> then I dug out one of the old \\&quot;Hydrating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ethnic (CaribAfroLatina mix) and used the Hydrating Curls series to maintain my natural and sometimes texturized hair.</li>
            <li> and my wife has leaving this bottle about half full</li>
            <li> If Pantene doesn&#x27;t bring back the old formula I am switching to a new brand.   </li>
            <li> For example, we normally get about 50 inches of precipitation but in the last 12 months, we have had 62 inches.  </li>
            <li> Hoped the new stuff was a name-change only...</li>
            <li> like any shampoo I have to change after a few weeks since my hair is super fine&lt;</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ll go back to the old stuff with conditioner built in.  </li>
            <li> her natural, though moderate, curls</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pantene... you need to bring back your old formula.</li>
            <li> This product is thick, the scent is light and not overbearing, but is feminine.  </li>
            <li> I received full sized bottles of the entire \\&quot;Curly\\&quot; line in the mail a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, but terribly tangly and will frizz without the right combination of hair products.   </li>
            <li> I examined my dry ends after using it and they were a little better but still dry.     </li>
            <li> My Hair: Long (just past shoulders), very curly and extremely frizzy, brown, thick    Pantene Curly Hair smells good.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for about 2 weeks and while I saw a slight difference in my hair texture, it was not dramatic.</li>
            <li> Pantene shampoo was a big disappointment -- it left my hair feeling less clean, and more coated.  </li>
            <li> the old \\&quot;Dry to Moisturized\\&quot; or \\&quot;Hydrating Curls\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I had to double condition my hair and try to work the mess out with my fingers in the shower, before I could even get a super wide tooth comb through to work out the rest of the knots.</li>
            <li> In fact opposite to the opinion of another reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;*very fragrant - extremely pungent, the shampoo reminded me of the old Helene Curtis Salon Selectives line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People may not associate humidity with New York, but it has become extra rainy in the last few years.  </li>
            <li> It also made my scalp and the skin on the back of my neck dry.</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s Pro-v Curly Hair Series Dry to Moisturized Shampoo has finally given me hair with the texture I have been seeking.  </li>
            <li> Having thick red hair causes all my curls to get pulled straight.</li>
            <li> Overall I didn&#x27;t notice any curl improvement with this product and my hair felt less soft due to it lacking a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time</li>
            <li> and I plan to continue to buy it as long as Pantene makes it.</li>
            <li> the frizzy-ness that is rampant due to the humid southern air.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my curls, not my different than any other shampoo I use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that does get dry and frizzy when it dries.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry hair, and this shampoo lives up to \\&quot;Dry to Moisturized\\&quot; claim.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has dry, unmanageable, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzier, and so dry it almost feels \\&quot;crunchy.\\</li>
            <li> This Pantene Pro-v curly series Dry to moisturized Shampoo claims to \\&quot;Moisturizes, controls frizz and defines curls\\</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, dark (colored) hair that is coarse.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to have the opposite effect for me instead of moisturizing it has dried my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair simply felt heavy, and unclean.  </li>
            <li> I mean, there&#x27;s a definite difference between the various styling products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly on the hunt for any product that helps me tame that mop.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair with just enough curl to be annoying and look ratty sometimes, but not after using this shampoo - it makes my hair look smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Might be the way the line is though I am not very familiar with the Pantene line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat expensive but it really does make a difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or give it an oily look at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is not super unruly or curly but it can get frizzy and I have noticed the frizz is well controlled with this product.</li>
            <li> However, this product left my hair feeling heavy and thick.  </li>
            <li> As for moisturizing - it does the job half way.    </li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair a matted stringy looking mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been one crazy, hot and humid summer, and this shampoo has kept my daughters from looking like abused troll</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels a little drying but the conditioner moisturizes well.     </li>
            <li> Combined with a little gel</li>
            <li> For me, This works just like any other ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling dry and weird, not to mention tangled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using the rest of this shampoo as I don&#x27;t like to waste</li>
            <li> Still fluffy and...dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few uses, I&#x27;m sold on this shampoo and would suggest that anyone who has curly hair should give it a try.</li>
            <li> When I received the item it was licking and it was not secure well.</li>
            <li> However, I am also the father of three girls, so this product is heavily used in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get when you put just a small drop onto your hair.  </li>
            <li> A lot of sudsy, bubbly shampoos and super-drying and make your hair feel positively dead if you don&#x27;t add a thick conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So I have a problem with frizzy hair that has gotten worse as I&#x27;ve aged and the % of gray has increased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s often plagued by dryness and frizziness, and can feel quite coarse with the wrong weather or product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair so badly that it actually began to break off after just four uses.</li>
            <li> Visited Panetene&#x27;s site as well, only to find others posting there as unhappy as me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that \\&quot;red\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean what you&#x27;re used to.  </li>
            <li> For a long time, I&#x27;ve considered cutting it short because I was so sick of the way it just hung there, limp and blah.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it, unless perhaps your hair needs some serious weighing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually developed an annoying habit of shaking my head just to feel my curls move</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy to curly, and very thick.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s an annoying slime left on the tub, so</li>
            <li> Not in a slippery way, either -- but in a coated, heavy, unpleasant way.  </li>
            <li> : it stripped my hair so terribly that it removed build up from the normal styling products I use.</li>
            <li> This new, \\&quot;curly hair series\\&quot; formula is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> but with shampoo, as long as the scent isn&#x27;t crazy bad, color me</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see my normally thick wavy hair become fizzy and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible product that will dry out your curls and increase the frizz!  </li>
            <li> I was thinking I&#x27;d just gotten a bad perm...</li>
            <li> I often turn to Pantene products when I&#x27;m tired of spending outrageous amounts on salon products, or when I can&#x27;t afford them anymore.  </li>
            <li> matching conditioner wasn&#x27;t *quite* as disappointing, so I&#x27;ll use it with another shampoo when I&#x27;m out of everything else I have!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There will be no &amp;#34;defined curls&amp;#34; with this crap.. your hair will look like a bad &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; from the 80&#x27;s... not just an 80&#x27;s &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;--</li>
            <li> Annoyingly curly.</li>
            <li> but a bad one even by 80&#x27;s standards!</li>
            <li> This is the WORST &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very curly hair. Annoyingly curly. On humid days it looks like I have a perm. I&#x27;m constantly on the hunt for any product that helps me tame that mop.  I&#x27;ve got to say, this shampoo really helps.  Reduces curls and friz, leaves my hair looking great all day. I don&#x27;t find the scent feminine - it&#x27;s pretty neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle must have been designed by a structural engineer. It&#x27;s heavy duty, stands on the bottom or cap, plus the cap has a very positive lock - I&#x27;d feel safe traveling with this bottle.</li>
            <li> If you have the kind of curly hair that does not require a perm to look good, you&#x27;ll love this product. It seems to be more effective than the previous generation Pantene Pro-V series products, and when used with the matching conditioner, it creates excellent natural curls, without any hassle.     Once dry, your hair springs up and does not require much more attention. No frizz, and tangle free. I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks now, and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> As a guy with short, straight hair I might not be the target user for this shampoo, but nonetheless I&#x27;m going to rave about it because frankly it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I love about it is the instant blast of bubbles you get when you put just a small drop onto your hair.  It feels like it&#x27;s rinsing and cleaning every strand of hair, all with a crisp and clean fragrance that you just gotta inhale.  Then there&#x27;s the moisture part.  A lot of sudsy, bubbly shampoos and super-drying and make your hair feel positively dead if you don&#x27;t add a thick conditioner.  I tried this Pantene product both with and without my regular condition and in both cases my hair still felt well hydrated and alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s priced competitively and in many ways goes above and beyond the competition.  5 stars, easily.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it&#x27;s always on the dry side. This shampoo seems to have the opposite effect for me instead of moisturizing it has dried my hair and scalp. In addition the smell of the shampoo while nice at first becomes less appealing after using the shampoo for awhile. I&#x27;ll be using the rest of this shampoo as I don&#x27;t like to waste but once it&#x27;s gone I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> People may not associate humidity with New York, but it has become extra rainy in the last few years.  For example, we normally get about 50 inches of precipitation but in the last 12 months, we have had 62 inches.  It feels like it rains all the time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it is humid, my curly hair seems to go anywhere that it wants to go.  The new Pantine curly hair conditioner and shampoo has tamed my hair in high humidity.  It stays where it should without sticking out in all directions.  The hair has also become softer.  I do not know how they do it, but this product does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic bottles are neatly designed.  They have flat caps on top, so you can keep them upside down.  This will be a convenient feature to use when they are getting to be near empty.  The shampoo comes in [[ASIN:B003JA3KQE 12.6 ounce]] and [[ASIN:B003EH2OY6 25.4 ounce]] bottles.  The conditioner also comes in [[ASIN:B003JA3KDW 12.6 ounce]] and [[ASIN:B003EH2HKM 25.4 ounce]] bottles.  The larger bottles are a better buy per ounce than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> My Hair: Long (just past shoulders), very curly and extremely frizzy, brown, thick    Pantene Curly Hair smells good. A little perfumey but light. My hair is really soft after using it. I tried it alone and with several different conditioners. No matter what conditioner I used, my hair was still frizzy. I examined my dry ends after using it and they were a little better but still dry.     This shampoo is nice, but wish I could find one that really would eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that does get dry and frizzy when it dries. I used this shampoo for about 2 weeks and while I saw a slight difference in my hair texture, it was not dramatic. So while I&#x27;m fine with using this shampoo on a daily basis, I can&#x27;t say it was a miracle solution for moisturized smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product the first couple weeks I used. I could wash my hair on Monday, and on Friday, it still looked good to go. Never got greasy.  Still fluffy and...dry.  Except, is that such a good thing? A product that keeps your hair nice and dried out all week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my stylist about this product.  She reminded me that any hair product that has a lot of wax in it coats the strands of your hair.  So your hair will appear \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, not oily. But your hair produces oil naturally. That wax coating over your hair strands will make your hair appear clean by not letting your body&#x27;s oils coat your hair, but your hair needs those oils for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe I don&#x27;t love this product so much. But it suds up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, dark (colored) hair that is coarse. So I have a problem with frizzy hair that has gotten worse as I&#x27;ve aged and the % of gray has increased. I have used this shampoo daily for about 2 1/2 weeks and it has been gentle enough to not cause issues with fly-away hair and more breakage. It also doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or give it an oily look at all. It says it is moisturizing, but a conditioner is still needed for my hair.   This product is thick, the scent is light and not overbearing, but is feminine.  It is of the high quality I expect from Pantene. I like the product.</li>
            <li> I used to love the old formula.  The old formula always left my hair feeling soft and clean.  The old formula put a great bounce into the curl, had great frizz control, and smelled really great!!!    This new formula My hair feels really rough and dry, even when washing it, my hair is a frizzy mess by the end of the day, and does not smell as good as the old stuff!!!    Way to ruin what used to be a really great product!!!  I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of Pro-V Curly Hair shampoo (and conditioner) and was glad I&#x27;d gotten a bottle before I saw the shelves cleared at my local retailer. Then I kind of panicked. What would I do without my go-to shampoo for my wash it &amp; forget it days? I was thrilled to be able to try a new bottle via Amazon Vine and I had a new bottle of the conditioner.     I&#x27;ve tried both of the revamped Curly shampoo and the Curly conditioner and I can say that the conditioner still exceeds expectations. The shampoo does give me curlier hair but in my experience it&#x27;s not as curly as before. I also tried the shampoo on my daughter, whose hair is longer but finer and not chemically treated. Her hair sprung up into ringlets using just the shampoo with her regular children&#x27;s conditioner. So it may be me, it may be my hair but the new version of Curly isn&#x27;t as amazing as the old formula on my hair. That said, it does do exactly what it says and it does it very well.     The old version was five stars clear and away. The new version, for me, is a four star (although for my daughter&#x27;s hair, it remains a five). If you liked the old version, I recommend sticking with it. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, you&#x27;ll be impressed. I also like the Expressions series, if you&#x27;re iffy on the Curly.</li>
            <li> I often turn to Pantene products when I&#x27;m tired of spending outrageous amounts on salon products, or when I can&#x27;t afford them anymore.  My hair is wavy to curly, and very thick.  It&#x27;s often plagued by dryness and frizziness, and can feel quite coarse with the wrong weather or product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pantene shampoo was a big disappointment -- it left my hair feeling less clean, and more coated.  I tried it several times, hoping it was just a matter of whatever product I&#x27;d used the day before, but no dice.  Every time, I felt like I had to wash my hair again with a different shampoo.  My hair simply felt heavy, and unclean.  Not in a slippery way, either -- but in a coated, heavy, unpleasant way.  I don&#x27;t recommend it, unless perhaps your hair needs some serious weighing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matching conditioner wasn&#x27;t *quite* as disappointing, so I&#x27;ll use it with another shampoo when I&#x27;m out of everything else I have!</li>
            <li> The smell of the Pantene Curly Hair Series shampoo is just great.  I am pleased that it performed on my hair very well.  I have always had dry hair, and this shampoo lives up to \\&quot;Dry to Moisturized\\&quot; claim.  It made my hair feel soft, manageable and, yes, smell delightful.  I recommend this product to anyone who has dry, unmanageable, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo, and it is very moisturizing and great for all hair.  It worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to care much about the kind of shampoo or conditioner or use. However, I recently go this and noticed my hair had a bit more body and was easier to control. It stays the way I want it when I comb it - even without mousse. When this bottle runs out, I&#x27;ll probably get this brand again.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this shampoo.  It has a nice smell, it lathers REALLY well with lots of thick suds which I like, and it seems to rinse out pretty cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels clean.  But I don&#x27;t feel like there is a noticeable difference in the frizzy-ness of my hair when all is said and done.  No shampoo has ever seemed to make a difference so I can&#x27;t really fault the Pantene.  If you are one who has frizz problems no shampoo or conditioner is going to make a difference, it&#x27;s going to be a matter of how you style your hair and the products you use post-shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you buy it buy it because it has a good lather and gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li> I loved the old formula. This new, \\&quot;curly hair series\\&quot; formula is AWFUL. If Pantene doesn&#x27;t bring back the old formula I am switching to a new brand.   After using Pantene for 10 years now I have to find something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Shampoo and Conditioner for a few days and it has made my hair a lot better from what I was using before. My hair is not super unruly or curly but it can get frizzy and I have noticed the frizz is well controlled with this product. The shampoo feels a little drying but the conditioner moisturizes well.     Combined with a little gel my hair is soft, light, and has nice defined curls.</li>
            <li> If I could leave zero stars I would! This is the WORST &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; shampoo ever. You really screwed the pooch on this one Pantene!&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy the feeling of trying to wash out dreadlocks every day or ever couple days-- then this may be the shampoo for you!&lt;br /&gt;There will be no &amp;#34;defined curls&amp;#34; with this crap.. your hair will look like a bad &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; from the 80&#x27;s... not just an 80&#x27;s &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;-- but a bad one even by 80&#x27;s standards! If you like that super frizzed out, teased, hair band, Ratt look- without having to use your grandma&#x27;s Aquanet-- then this MIGHT be the shampoo for you!  This stuff made my hair a matted stringy looking mess.  I had to double condition my hair and try to work the mess out with my fingers in the shower, before I could even get a super wide tooth comb through to work out the rest of the knots. Horrible.</li>
            <li> My very curly shoulder-length hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.  For a long time, I&#x27;ve considered cutting it short because I was so sick of the way it just hung there, limp and blah.  After using this shampoo and its accompanying conditioner (which I purchased separately), I&#x27;m delighted with the change.  My curls are bouncy and shiny with great definition and body and no longer look tired and worn out.  I&#x27;ve actually developed an annoying habit of shaking my head just to feel my curls move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product from the very beginning.  The fragrance is clean, pleasant and mildly reminiscent of berries, without being heavy or overwhelming.  Of course, it&#x27;s a big plus that Pantene says it can be safely used on color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses, I&#x27;m sold on this shampoo and would suggest that anyone who has curly hair should give it a try.</li>
            <li> When I received the item it was licking and it was not secure well. I love my patene but maybe next time try to tape the cap just so it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> Having thick red hair causes all my curls to get pulled straight. Since using this my curls have really tightened up. No product or scrunching for me!</li>
            <li> My husband has curly hair and after using this shampoo, it really calms those frizzies of his. On really humid days he still needs to use an additional product, but overall this shampoo works.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for three weeks now and the results have been just ok.&lt;br /&gt;Today i tried it in very high humidity and it did not hold up nearly as well as my Herbal Essence.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light enough not to give a head ache like say with Suave for Curls.&lt;br /&gt;I am used to more of the floral or fruit scents and to me this is more like a lotion scent.&lt;br /&gt;Might be the way the line is though I am not very familiar with the Pantene line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up really well. The first couple times I used it really brought out my curls&lt;br /&gt;Then like any shampoo I have to change after a few weeks since my hair is super fine&lt;br /&gt;tends to get a build up and will be ok to use it again after i stop for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did leave my curls soft and not overly frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure the price is really worth it though since i get similar results from other shampoos i have used.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for better results based on product description but for me just did not live up to the expectations.</li>
            <li> I received full sized bottles of the entire \\&quot;Curly\\&quot; line in the mail a few days ago. I was chosen to review the product through Cosmo mag.  I was willing to give it a try and used it four times.  I was shocked to see my normally thick wavy hair become fizzy and unmanageable.  This product dried my hair so badly that it actually began to break off after just four uses. It also made my scalp and the skin on the back of my neck dry. The smell, although nice at first, become overpowering after two uses. After washing my hair with my normal brand, I could still smell the Pantene.  Maybe this product works for really frizzy curly hair, but it did not work for mine.  One positive: it stripped my hair so terribly that it removed build up from the normal styling products I use. I may hang onto it and use it once a month just as a clarifying product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair with just enough curl to be annoying and look ratty sometimes, but not after using this shampoo - it makes my hair look smooth and shiny. I don&#x27;t think anyone would need a conditioner after shampooing with this stuff.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old guy with a buzz cut, so this product was not designed for me.  However, I am also the father of three girls, so this product is heavily used in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been one crazy, hot and humid summer, and this shampoo has kept my daughters from looking like abused troll dolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought 2 economy size versions of this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Pantene user but I normally use the type with conditioner built in.  Overall I didn&#x27;t notice any curl improvement with this product and my hair felt less soft due to it lacking a conditioner.  I did appreciate the scent more than my old shampoo but I think I&#x27;ll go back to the old stuff with conditioner built in.  The extra cost isn&#x27;t justified by the scent alone.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair, with a fair amount of natural wave.  I have always wanted my hair to be softer than it naturally is, but have never hit on the right products to help me achieve this goal.  Pantene&#x27;s Pro-v Curly Hair Series Dry to Moisturized Shampoo has finally given me hair with the texture I have been seeking.  Now my hair is soft to the touch and much, mucuh easier to comb and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo cleans very thoroughly, has a nice, light scent, and rinses out easily and well.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, and noticed the difference in my hair&#x27;s managability within just a couple of uses. This has been a great shampoo for me and I plan to continue to buy it as long as Pantene makes it.</li>
            <li> GUEST REVIEWER - !MRS. KNOW IT ALL ;&gt;b&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always enjoy using Pantene products, as most of the time they leave my hair feeling silky soft.  However, this product left my hair feeling heavy and thick.  It smelled good, but because it&#x27;s meant for curly hair that you want to style straight, it just weights the hair down to loosen the natural curls.  I guess if you have really thick--frizzy--curly hair, this would be a good product for you--but for someone who only has some natural waves, it just doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling light and free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat expensive but it really does make a difference on my hair. I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it. My hair is frizzier, and so dry it almost feels \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot; When I use this shampoo my hair is smoother, it looks and feels healthier. It&#x27;s definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My wife was using this shampoo in the hope that it would help in a couple areas. Those would be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tame the frizzy-ness that is rampant due to the humid southern air.&lt;br /&gt;*Maintain her natural, though moderate, curls (Ok, that one was just for me as I am a sucker for curly hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end these are her comments:&lt;br /&gt;*dry hair  - She felt like the shampoo was stripping out all the natural oils from her hair.  In fact opposite to the opinion of another reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;*very fragrant - extremely pungent, the shampoo reminded me of the old Helene Curtis Salon Selectives line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a product just isn&#x27;t right it&#x27;s time to move on and my wife has leaving this bottle about half full (I suppose she thought its worth this many stars because she&#x27;s used worse).  So the search continues for that perfect shampoo.</li>
            <li> My tween daughter has long hair that is ringlet-curly, and very fine.   It&#x27;s beautiful, but terribly tangly and will frizz without the right combination of hair products.   She has been using the Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair shampoo and conditioner for the last two months, and it working well for her.  It works as well as the salon products shampoos and conditioners we&#x27;ve tried, at a much better price.  It isn&#x27;t a magic bullet (she still must use a frizz serum or spray), but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This Pantene Pro-v curly series Dry to moisturized Shampoo claims to \\&quot;Moisturizes, controls frizz and defines curls\\&quot;    It cleans hair just fine and smells nice. my curls, not my different than any other shampoo I use. As for moisturizing - it does the job half way.    As for frizz control - MY hair&#x27;s Still Frizzy, MY hair&#x27;s Still Frizzy, I can&#x27;t get with this    For me, This works just like any other ordinary shampoo. So It really didn&#x27;t do the job it claims to do and It&#x27;s not something I can see myself purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have to be completely honest.  I really don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference between one shampoo and the next.  I&#x27;ve never found even one that didn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair, which should be the entire point.  I mean, there&#x27;s a definite difference between the various styling products and I&#x27;m a lot more selective in that area, but with shampoo, as long as the scent isn&#x27;t crazy bad, color me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How&#x27;s that for being a discriminating user?  So this Pantene gets my hair clean, smells reasonably good, and is relatively inexpensive.  The scent is nice, but it&#x27;s just slightly feminine for my taste.  Not so foo foo that I wouldn&#x27;t use it, but it&#x27;s not an especially manly scent either.  Still, no one will question your masculinity if you have this in your shower, so don&#x27;t let my comment keep you from trying this product.  My hair is not curly, so perhaps it has some sort of magical power over curly hair.  I just don&#x27;t know, because again, my hair is straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap: Cheap shampoo that gets your hair clean and smells at least reasonably good.  I suppose that warrants 4 stars, don&#x27;t you think?</li>
            <li> I used this product and I feel like it protected my damaged hair so it did what it said would.  What more can I say about it.  Did what it said it would.</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s products tend to be color-coded, and red is for curly hair.  When I saw my old red-accented bottles for both shampoo and conditioner, though there seemed to be a name change, it was easy to assume it was the same product renamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.  Sometime around 2011 Pantene did a formula change.  You may have bought (and liked, as I did) the old \\&quot;Dry to Moisturized\\&quot; or \\&quot;Hydrating Curls\\&quot;.  For my hair, these were both very good and curl defining, and kept my hair in good shape despite its being fine and permed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came \\&quot;Moisture Renewal\\&quot;.  For me, the shine is gone, the curls are gone, no definition... and there&#x27;s an annoying slime left on the tub, so I can only imagine what it&#x27;s doing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only catching the formula change now, as I tend to stock up on shampoo and conditioner on sale and I sure do miss the old stuff.  A call to Pantene today confirmed my perception of this change... and their rep didn&#x27;t even try to recommend something more suitable, or offer a coupon or anything in the way of an apology.  Visited Panetene&#x27;s site as well, only to find others posting there as unhappy as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, just a heads up that \\&quot;red\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean what you&#x27;re used to.  I was thinking I&#x27;d just gotten a bad perm... then I dug out one of the old \\&quot;Hydrating Curls\\&quot; bottles I had, and in 2 days I knew what the issue was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene... you need to bring back your old formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ethnic (CaribAfroLatina mix) and used the Hydrating Curls series to maintain my natural and sometimes texturized hair. The OLD formula worked beautifully. Hoped the new stuff was a name-change only...NOPE! This left my hair feeling dry and weird, not to mention tangled. Tossed it out after washing it out of my distressed hair. Pantene? Why fix it when the older Hydrating Curls worked so well. You lost a faithful customer.</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible product that will dry out your curls and increase the frizz!  DO NOT use this.  Look at Kinky Curly products, or DevaCare products, or JessiCurl.</li>
            <li> Like this product, very pleased</li>
