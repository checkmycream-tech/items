            <li>Another good product from proactiv</li>
            <li>Good size.</li>
            <li>really good.</li>
            <li>good luck everyone.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>bought some Ambi instead, and am using it with good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It is a good product.  </li>
            <li>The result is good per my wife who uses the product.</li>
            <li>This cream is really good</li>
            <li>but you do get excellent results and quickly.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I decided to try just one more.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I do love proactive products however!</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of using it, most of my spots are gone!</li>
            <li>product is OK!</li>
            <li>This product was amazing.</li>
            <li>use lemon juice and a Qtip instead-much cheaper and just as effective</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s so effective..</li>
            <li>I did not apply this again as I got kind of scared that I had ruined my skin.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll regret i, honestly you will.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it,</li>
            <li>Anyway, for my own experience.</li>
            <li>Kind of like with the proactiv three step system</li>
            <li>but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I am going to start over again and take my own advice :)</li>
            <li>sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker cream, whereas the Proactive is a more liquidy lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more cost-effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Today, I&#x27;m not so sure.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was great and it was shipped rather fast</li>
            <li>My skin never looked better, and I wont stop using this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, is</li>
            <li>I use to suffer from acne for so many years.</li>
            <li>Love this product but you need to use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>So beware ladies and gents before making a purchase and make sure you know the ingredients before you try any beauty product.</li>
            <li>Its ok, it did remove the spots</li>
            <li>love this cream.</li>
            <li>... more cleaner and clearer.</li>
            <li>This product works ok.  </li>
            <li>Better than all I have tried, believe me I have tried a lot.</li>
            <li>well I&#x27;m still waiting for better results -</li>
            <li>It has faded most of the brown spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>luck :)</li>
            <li>Ok my rating is mostly based on the price.</li>
            <li>&quot; I hope this helps someone since you can get 2ounces for 1/6 of the price and because of the thicker consistencey it more than doubles the product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it again, Leary of more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use through the bottle to see for greater results.</li>
            <li>So I am giving it more time hoping it will fade just like</li>
            <li>I used it on my chin after getting burned from electrolysis and it made my skin look much better.</li>
            <li>i have to get me some more blackheads seem to come :)</li>
            <li>I will try one more bottle</li>
            <li>We have used it for more than a month</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I didnt listen to others reviews.</li>
            <li>and I have tried most products,</li>
            <li>I use an aveeno product now and this cream hydrates and evens tone way better than this and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>but I think I was expecting more drastic results.  </li>
            <li>Of these Proactiv is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>This does work but be sure to wash you face well to get any oils off.</li>
            <li>and omg I Love</li>
            <li>Product works great but the price is too high.  </li>
            <li>This works great on new acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my acne scars began fading fast, but one thing I&#x27;m really impressed about is how this product smoothes the pores, giving skin a very refined, polished feel and look.</li>
            <li>make sure you never stop having it available...</li>
            <li>it worth the money and also the smell is good not bad at all</li>
            <li>BUT IF IT&#x27;S EFFECTIVE IT WILL BE WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>and I always got excellent quick results when I used it even when I would only apply it for one application as suppose to the 2 they always recommended.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and I do not see any results.</li>
            <li>Best dark spot corrector yet</li>
            <li>the best part is, it comes in a 2oz tube at 10x less the price of Proactive&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix it with a skin smoother/replinisher and it wears fine under makeup.</li>
            <li>Otherwise works fine</li>
            <li>I had always wanted to use proactive products to see if all the hype was accurate.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for 4 weeks and have seen a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to leave an important note on this ingredient, hydroquinone.</li>
            <li>I have no interest in this company, just enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>I have used this on recent acne scars and they have faded a -great- deal within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the good results and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>So far its doing good</li>
            <li>Us women do a lot to be perceived as beautiful, but we should also be careful.</li>
            <li>After five months, I still cannot see any significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Some people told me that it didn&#x27;t work for them, so I guess it is up to each individual whether it is successful or not.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use more consistently.</li>
            <li>Works fairly quick and smells fine.</li>
            <li>I would not deny the company that assertion, however the product advertising implies the enhancements are seen quickly becauser at no time does it offer the viewer a hint that time is an important part of the products use.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy when I got the dark spot corrector as a free gift.</li>
            <li>Didt really work it clogged my pours and made my skin break out more and</li>
            <li>I love this product, helps me so much...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine this is as good as it can get next to having some type of laser surgery.</li>
            <li>my face is starting to look good</li>
            <li>This product was a blessing for me,a true blessing.</li>
            <li>(But here go those rules again that require near bloviation instead of honest fact.</li>
            <li>and I got my order super fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product that would work quickly</li>
            <li>It worked so quickly</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly though.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>Overall I was satisfied!</li>
            <li>I am 17 years old and have combination to oily skin with many acne scars.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh expiration date on it as well.</li>
            <li>naturally I thought this would help and well; more acne I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>But I have sensitive skin and allergic to many things.</li>
            <li>It is diffently worth trying.</li>
            <li>For me, it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>Honestly the only way to find out if a product is going to work for you is try it yourself!</li>
            <li>it would also be useful if proactive would be more clear in how and when to use the product.  </li>
            <li>I got to learn how to use it right</li>
            <li>Love love this product it lighted up all my dark spots on my face that were caused from acne scars</li>
            <li>and my complexion has gone from blotchy with dark acne marks and slightly red in places to nearly flawless</li>
            <li>Since I can manage my discoloration spots by occasionally using Proactiv &amp; it works more quickly for me, that&#x27;s my product of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is good but the dark spots did not go away.</li>
            <li>With Ambi it takes 3-4x as long to be effective on my face &amp; I need to use it continually.</li>
            <li>I paid good money for these products,and was alway let down by the outcome.</li>
            <li>This works pretty FAST AND EFFECTIVELY if used regularly.</li>
            <li>thank you very much for this item...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it is exactly as described in the ad.</li>
            <li>well!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li>Love that I don&#x27;t have to time this as you do with some spot correctors, Can be left on overnight.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in the spots on my face the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>Absulotely love it third refill</li>
            <li>finally do not apply more than once per day because this product if over used can damage your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I stared to see results after 3 first days</li>
            <li>There this is my first time writing a review abt.</li>
            <li>I have tried several others and Proactiv works better than the expense ones</li>
            <li>it -does- reduce their darkness over time and with consistent use.  </li>
            <li>There are much better spot correctors out there...especially in asian markets!</li>
            <li>however if you use this in the fall and spring to fade dark spots...be ready to use a really good sunblock in the spring and summer...</li>
            <li>I have been using this since September 2012 and have found positive results.  </li>
            <li>My husband works in the sun and has lots of dark spots this took them all away, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Proactiv ;)</li>
            <li>, I still cannot believe how fast this product has change my skin, it&#x27;s my first time using PROACTIVE products</li>
            <li>The gold standard of this primary ingredient is a concentration of 2%, anything higher I believe has to be prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this product primarily because my prescription cream for bleaching dark spots was no longer available through my insurance plans.  </li>
            <li>Feels refreshing and doesn&#x27;t get oily or dry out skin.</li>
            <li>so I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I do, however, mix it with Aveda&#x27;s Balancing Infusion Oil for dry skin when I apply it, and it works its magic without getting clumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not think I would find anything strong enough to help me  used it for a week</li>
            <li>I believe this works for certain people and doesn&#x27;t for others.</li>
            <li>I believe it was much cheaper at the mall, I knew that when I bought this product</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t swear by it alone, but along with proper cleansing and maybe a light cream under your makeup or ant night, it works well</li>
            <li>It works really</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>This product has helped so much with my acne scars that I have had for years.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>so this is very helpful to me</li>
            <li>It works but if used too much, may make your skin burn or break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>and it really bothered me.  </li>
            <li>but it smells really wierd,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it maybe as often as I should, but that&#x27;s because I have not noticed much of a change.  </li>
            <li>It works fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I would order this again and I have seen real results and fading of brown spots</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for a coule of weeks now, and it is working very well.</li>
            <li>This product Really does work.  </li>
            <li>However, it will make the skin whiter since it is a bleaching agent and this is why I mix it with skin care cream so that I can do my whole face.</li>
            <li>So its like for the price of one tube of proactive you get 12x as much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of difference.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I have not had much luck with this product...</li>
            <li>I really would give it no star.  </li>
            <li>fast 5-7 days soon as it came i hurry up and put it on my face so within</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product would work...</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>We aren&#x27;t really that upset since it was quite inexpensive to begin with.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WORKS, FAST DELEIVERY.</li>
            <li>THIS FAST.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am white, with light olive toned skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed that overtime it would develop a horrendous smell that would not go away, as much as I tried.</li>
            <li>This really works well</li>
            <li>It has not done too much yet.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly under my Bare Minerals foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Beware to NOT mix this product with another moisturizer: you will see small white dots all over your fingers and face.</li>
            <li>It could VERY well just be my skin</li>
            <li>but overall: the stuff is magic and clear any issue you is having on you&#x60;re face</li>
            <li>I prefer the thicker Equate cream actually, because the Proactiv product is easy to waste when too much comes out of the tube with a very light squeeze.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and had a very large age spot underneath my eye.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that easily gets red.  </li>
            <li>Not only that my skin has returned to its original tone with a smoother look and softer feel.</li>
            <li>IM EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THE NEXT 3 WEEKS LOOK LIKE.</li>
            <li>&quot; It definitely does not feel normal and now I am worried about regaining feeling in my face!!!!</li>
            <li>i use the neutrogena dark spot reducer it works better for me</li>
            <li>works ok on dark spots.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;m surprised by the price of this product on Amazon; on the Proactive site it&#x27;s around</li>
            <li>Dark spots disappeared almost like magic.  </li>
            <li>I love this dark spot corrector and it works for me</li>
            <li>this works really well on the new scars.  </li>
            <li>so I really didnt want to overwhelmed my skin wit a new product</li>
            <li>I love this product I saw a difference in my face in less then a month.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>It has worked better than more expensive products I have used for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am older and my skin has been aging,</li>
            <li>But so far it doesn&#x27;t look promising.</li>
            <li>Now my face is clear and the marks are so much lighter.</li>
            <li>Ambi Fade Cream, Normal Skin, 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li>([[ASIN:B005CRJUEI Ambi Skincare Fade Cream, Normal Skin, 2-Ounce Tubes</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have pimples and am in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love this product it removes dark spots and promotes clear appearance.</li>
            <li>I notice when I had a bit of the older left my skin spots were clearing fine, but as soon as I starting using the new version nothing.</li>
            <li>Along with some cream beneath my makeup it cleared most major dark spots within a month or so.</li>
            <li>It probably isn&#x27;t long enough to tell yet , but I believe the large age spots on my face have faded significantly .  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products that claim to fade dark spots and I have not had any success.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work, not sure if I buy any more.</li>
            <li>I am hoping for a dark spot free face in another</li>
            <li>If you are considering purchasing this product and you have sensitive skin give it a shot!</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I thought it would work a little quicker on my dark spots</li>
            <li>I love this product, i literally got proactive three days ago and the dark spots are already starting to disappear.</li>
            <li>I have a skin condition called Melasma and I have been using the dark spot corrector for about 4 weeks now and my spots are significantly lighter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using both Ambi and Proactiv&#x27;s spot correctors, I experienced a bad allergic reaction on my face, so I wasn&#x27;t able to use either long enough to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this cream once and broke out with lots of large red pimple like bumps in the areas I applied it.</li>
            <li>I am 40 yrs old,and have been dealing with these dark spots for a long time,now I&#x27;ve finally found this product,and it is AMAZING...</li>
            <li>They should make that clear before or after demonstrating results on a user</li>
            <li>It seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 yrs old, I used this when it came with the Proactive I bought for my 14 yr old adoptive son.</li>
            <li>like maybe it&#x27;s old or something..</li>
            <li>It seems to work for age spots so far.</li>
            <li>problem now is the money back guarantee, which is really a joke.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now started using product and so far has not irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the old version off and on for over a period of years</li>
            <li>Seems to be working well so far</li>
            <li>SO TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE OR RATE</li>
            <li>The effectiveness of fade creams depend on one&#x27;s natural skin tone -</li>
            <li>Dont get me wrong sometimes its good to read reviews but based on someone</li>
            <li>The right side not much change.</li>
            <li>I am extremely disciplined, so I rarely missed applying the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products for my dark spots ,over the last seven years,and nothing worked..</li>
            <li>I have been lucky to have decent skin my entire life but after years in the sun I have received about 4 dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>and I usually use it twice a day, and make sure to use sunscreen if going outside.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what is expected.</li>
            <li>You must use this consistently to get results and be careful not to get it on your clothing.  </li>
            <li>The product was just okay, similar items can be purchased that provide the same results for less money and larger quantity.</li>
            <li>It is an inexpensive item that saves the trouble of most customers wasting their money and it came on time just as expected.</li>
            <li>The first week I had some dryness and tiny tiny white bumps that went away after about a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t read all the negatives reviews in here before buying the product, people needs to understand we are all different, if it didn&#x27;t work for someone, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not gonna work for you</li>
            <li>NO OTHER PRODUCT WORKS</li>
            <li>The ugly brown spots have faded significantly and I feel much better about myself when I look in the mirror</li>
            <li>The older scars take a long time to fade but</li>
            <li>This is a complete waste of money, I used one full tube and my dark spots are exactly the same as they were when I started !</li>
            <li>I used this product in high hopes seeing reviews about how this product, too, working on African American skin.</li>
            <li>Its pretty hard to tell if the product is really working on darker skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I am adult female that has struggled for years with ongoing acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell; hopfully we can find a larger container one day.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve been dealing with dark spots along time,then please try this product,because it does exactly what it say&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not finished with it yet, but I use it twice daily, and so far, I see no difference.</li>
            <li>I can barely see any results from this product.  </li>
            <li>Both Ambi and Proactiv&#x27;s fade creams have the active ingredient hydroquinone, but Ambi has added suncreen protection and is dirt cheap as the other reviewer said.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty surprised at the price for such a little bottle</li>
            <li>correcter\\&quot; at walmart for about $4.00 the active ingredient in it is 2% hyroquinone (exactly the same as the $20-$28 proactive.</li>
            <li>It really work on face and hands and also work on other discolor mark on the face.  </li>
            <li>The reason I did not give this product a 5 star is because I dont know if the spots will stay away after not using it, and the dryness and little white bumps werent so fun, but once that went away, the product became a &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>see no change in my skins appearance or dark spots are exactly the same color</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned and it has made it more obvious, and I believe the sunlight exposure makes it worse.  </li>
            <li>I must say, I have been a fan of the old \\&quot;skin lightening lotion\\&quot; from ProActiv before they changed it and made it the new and improved \\&quot;Dark Spot</li>
            <li>I would say this product has really done nothing for my dark spots,</li>
            <li>It really helps fade the dark spots on my face and its not greasy.</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks, I began to notice numbness in the whole area that I used the Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my acne dark spots very well.</li>
            <li>The dark spots did not fade by much and thats why I gave it one star.</li>
            <li>that time the spots haven&#x27;t gone away completely and the sun damage spots do tend to get dry time to time.  </li>
            <li>I am white with light skin and only a few dark spots around my eyes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is a good product.  </li>
            <li> The result is good per my wife who uses the product.</li>

            <li> but you do get excellent results and quickly.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I decided to try just one more.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I do love proactive products however!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using it, most of my spots are gone!</li>
            <li> product is OK!</li>
            <li> This product was amazing.</li>
            <li> use lemon juice and a Qtip instead-much cheaper and just as effective</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s so effective..</li>
            <li> I did not apply this again as I got kind of scared that I had ruined my skin.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll regret i, honestly you will.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it,</li>
            <li> Anyway, for my own experience.</li>
            <li> Kind of like with the proactiv three step system</li>
            <li> but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I am going to start over again and take my own advice :)</li>
            <li> sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker cream, whereas the Proactive is a more liquidy lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more cost-effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Today, I&#x27;m not so sure.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was great and it was shipped rather fast</li>
            <li> My skin never looked better, and I wont stop using this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, is</li>
            <li> I use to suffer from acne for so many years.</li>
            <li> Love this product but you need to use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> So beware ladies and gents before making a purchase and make sure you know the ingredients before you try any beauty product.</li>
            <li> Its ok, it did remove the spots</li>
            <li> love this cream.</li>
            <li> ... more cleaner and clearer.</li>
            <li> This product works ok.  </li>
            <li> Better than all I have tried, believe me I have tried a lot.</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m still waiting for better results -</li>
            <li> It has faded most of the brown spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> luck :)</li>
            <li> Ok my rating is mostly based on the price.</li>
            <li> &quot; I hope this helps someone since you can get 2ounces for 1/6 of the price and because of the thicker consistencey it more than doubles the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it again, Leary of more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use through the bottle to see for greater results.</li>
            <li> So I am giving it more time hoping it will fade just like</li>
            <li> I used it on my chin after getting burned from electrolysis and it made my skin look much better.</li>
            <li> i have to get me some more blackheads seem to come :)</li>
            <li> I will try one more bottle</li>
            <li> We have used it for more than a month</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I didnt listen to others reviews.</li>
            <li> and I have tried most products,</li>
            <li> I use an aveeno product now and this cream hydrates and evens tone way better than this and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> but I think I was expecting more drastic results.  </li>
            <li> Of these Proactiv is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> This does work but be sure to wash you face well to get any oils off.</li>
            <li> and omg I Love</li>
            <li> Product works great but the price is too high.  </li>
            <li> This works great on new acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my acne scars began fading fast, but one thing I&#x27;m really impressed about is how this product smoothes the pores, giving skin a very refined, polished feel and look.</li>
            <li> make sure you never stop having it available...</li>
            <li> it worth the money and also the smell is good not bad at all</li>
            <li> BUT IF IT&#x27;S EFFECTIVE IT WILL BE WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> and I always got excellent quick results when I used it even when I would only apply it for one application as suppose to the 2 they always recommended.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and I do not see any results.</li>
            <li> Best dark spot corrector yet</li>
            <li> the best part is, it comes in a 2oz tube at 10x less the price of Proactive&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it with a skin smoother/replinisher and it wears fine under makeup.</li>
            <li> Otherwise works fine</li>
            <li> I had always wanted to use proactive products to see if all the hype was accurate.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for 4 weeks and have seen a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to leave an important note on this ingredient, hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> I have no interest in this company, just enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this on recent acne scars and they have faded a -great- deal within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the good results and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far its doing good</li>
            <li> Us women do a lot to be perceived as beautiful, but we should also be careful.</li>
            <li> After five months, I still cannot see any significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Some people told me that it didn&#x27;t work for them, so I guess it is up to each individual whether it is successful or not.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use more consistently.</li>
            <li> Works fairly quick and smells fine.</li>
            <li> I would not deny the company that assertion, however the product advertising implies the enhancements are seen quickly becauser at no time does it offer the viewer a hint that time is an important part of the products use.  </li>
            <li> and I was happy when I got the dark spot corrector as a free gift.</li>
            <li> Didt really work it clogged my pours and made my skin break out more and</li>
            <li> I love this product, helps me so much...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine this is as good as it can get next to having some type of laser surgery.</li>
            <li> my face is starting to look good</li>
            <li> This product was a blessing for me,a true blessing.</li>
            <li> (But here go those rules again that require near bloviation instead of honest fact.</li>
            <li> and I got my order super fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that would work quickly</li>
            <li> It worked so quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly though.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> Overall I was satisfied!</li>
            <li> I am 17 years old and have combination to oily skin with many acne scars.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh expiration date on it as well.</li>
            <li> naturally I thought this would help and well; more acne I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> But I have sensitive skin and allergic to many things.</li>
            <li> It is diffently worth trying.</li>
            <li> For me, it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> Honestly the only way to find out if a product is going to work for you is try it yourself!</li>
            <li> it would also be useful if proactive would be more clear in how and when to use the product.  </li>
            <li> I got to learn how to use it right</li>
            <li> Love love this product it lighted up all my dark spots on my face that were caused from acne scars</li>
            <li> and my complexion has gone from blotchy with dark acne marks and slightly red in places to nearly flawless</li>
            <li> Since I can manage my discoloration spots by occasionally using Proactiv &amp; it works more quickly for me, that&#x27;s my product of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price is good but the dark spots did not go away.</li>
            <li> With Ambi it takes 3-4x as long to be effective on my face &amp; I need to use it continually.</li>
            <li> I paid good money for these products,and was alway let down by the outcome.</li>
            <li> This works pretty FAST AND EFFECTIVELY if used regularly.</li>
            <li> thank you very much for this item...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it is exactly as described in the ad.</li>
            <li> well!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t have to time this as you do with some spot correctors, Can be left on overnight.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in the spots on my face the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> Absulotely love it third refill</li>
            <li> finally do not apply more than once per day because this product if over used can damage your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I stared to see results after 3 first days</li>
            <li> There this is my first time writing a review abt.</li>
            <li> I have tried several others and Proactiv works better than the expense ones</li>
            <li> it -does- reduce their darkness over time and with consistent use.  </li>
            <li> There are much better spot correctors out there...especially in asian markets!</li>
            <li> however if you use this in the fall and spring to fade dark spots...be ready to use a really good sunblock in the spring and summer...</li>
            <li> I have been using this since September 2012 and have found positive results.  </li>
            <li> My husband works in the sun and has lots of dark spots this took them all away, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Proactiv ;)</li>
            <li> , I still cannot believe how fast this product has change my skin, it&#x27;s my first time using PROACTIVE products</li>
            <li> The gold standard of this primary ingredient is a concentration of 2%, anything higher I believe has to be prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this product primarily because my prescription cream for bleaching dark spots was no longer available through my insurance plans.  </li>
            <li> Feels refreshing and doesn&#x27;t get oily or dry out skin.</li>
            <li> so I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I do, however, mix it with Aveda&#x27;s Balancing Infusion Oil for dry skin when I apply it, and it works its magic without getting clumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not think I would find anything strong enough to help me  used it for a week</li>
            <li> I believe this works for certain people and doesn&#x27;t for others.</li>
            <li> I believe it was much cheaper at the mall, I knew that when I bought this product</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t swear by it alone, but along with proper cleansing and maybe a light cream under your makeup or ant night, it works well</li>
            <li> It works really</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> This product has helped so much with my acne scars that I have had for years.</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> so this is very helpful to me</li>
            <li> It works but if used too much, may make your skin burn or break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> and it really bothered me.  </li>
            <li> but it smells really wierd,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it maybe as often as I should, but that&#x27;s because I have not noticed much of a change.  </li>
            <li> It works fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I would order this again and I have seen real results and fading of brown spots</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a coule of weeks now, and it is working very well.</li>
            <li> This product Really does work.  </li>
            <li> However, it will make the skin whiter since it is a bleaching agent and this is why I mix it with skin care cream so that I can do my whole face.</li>
            <li> So its like for the price of one tube of proactive you get 12x as much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of difference.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I have not had much luck with this product...</li>
            <li> I really would give it no star.  </li>
            <li> fast 5-7 days soon as it came i hurry up and put it on my face so within</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would work...</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> We aren&#x27;t really that upset since it was quite inexpensive to begin with.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WORKS, FAST DELEIVERY.</li>
            <li> THIS FAST.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am white, with light olive toned skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed that overtime it would develop a horrendous smell that would not go away, as much as I tried.</li>
            <li> This really works well</li>
            <li> It has not done too much yet.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly under my Bare Minerals foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Beware to NOT mix this product with another moisturizer: you will see small white dots all over your fingers and face.</li>
            <li> It could VERY well just be my skin</li>
            <li> but overall: the stuff is magic and clear any issue you is having on you&#x60;re face</li>
            <li> I prefer the thicker Equate cream actually, because the Proactiv product is easy to waste when too much comes out of the tube with a very light squeeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and had a very large age spot underneath my eye.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that easily gets red.  </li>
            <li> Not only that my skin has returned to its original tone with a smoother look and softer feel.</li>
            <li> IM EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THE NEXT 3 WEEKS LOOK LIKE.</li>
            <li> &quot; It definitely does not feel normal and now I am worried about regaining feeling in my face!!!!</li>
            <li> i use the neutrogena dark spot reducer it works better for me</li>
            <li> works ok on dark spots.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;m surprised by the price of this product on Amazon; on the Proactive site it&#x27;s around</li>
            <li> Dark spots disappeared almost like magic.  </li>
            <li> I love this dark spot corrector and it works for me</li>
            <li> this works really well on the new scars.  </li>
            <li> so I really didnt want to overwhelmed my skin wit a new product</li>
            <li> I love this product I saw a difference in my face in less then a month.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> It has worked better than more expensive products I have used for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am older and my skin has been aging,</li>
            <li> But so far it doesn&#x27;t look promising.</li>
            <li> Now my face is clear and the marks are so much lighter.</li>
            <li> Ambi Fade Cream, Normal Skin, 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li> ([[ASIN:B005CRJUEI Ambi Skincare Fade Cream, Normal Skin, 2-Ounce Tubes</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have pimples and am in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this product it removes dark spots and promotes clear appearance.</li>
            <li> I notice when I had a bit of the older left my skin spots were clearing fine, but as soon as I starting using the new version nothing.</li>
            <li> Along with some cream beneath my makeup it cleared most major dark spots within a month or so.</li>
            <li> It probably isn&#x27;t long enough to tell yet , but I believe the large age spots on my face have faded significantly .  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products that claim to fade dark spots and I have not had any success.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work, not sure if I buy any more.</li>
            <li> I am hoping for a dark spot free face in another</li>
            <li> If you are considering purchasing this product and you have sensitive skin give it a shot!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I thought it would work a little quicker on my dark spots</li>
            <li> I love this product, i literally got proactive three days ago and the dark spots are already starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called Melasma and I have been using the dark spot corrector for about 4 weeks now and my spots are significantly lighter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using both Ambi and Proactiv&#x27;s spot correctors, I experienced a bad allergic reaction on my face, so I wasn&#x27;t able to use either long enough to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this cream once and broke out with lots of large red pimple like bumps in the areas I applied it.</li>
            <li> I am 40 yrs old,and have been dealing with these dark spots for a long time,now I&#x27;ve finally found this product,and it is AMAZING...</li>
            <li> They should make that clear before or after demonstrating results on a user</li>
            <li> It seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 yrs old, I used this when it came with the Proactive I bought for my 14 yr old adoptive son.</li>
            <li> like maybe it&#x27;s old or something..</li>
            <li> It seems to work for age spots so far.</li>
            <li> problem now is the money back guarantee, which is really a joke.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now started using product and so far has not irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the old version off and on for over a period of years</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well so far</li>
            <li> SO TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE OR RATE</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of fade creams depend on one&#x27;s natural skin tone -</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong sometimes its good to read reviews but based on someone</li>
            <li> The right side not much change.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disciplined, so I rarely missed applying the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products for my dark spots ,over the last seven years,and nothing worked..</li>
            <li> I have been lucky to have decent skin my entire life but after years in the sun I have received about 4 dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> and I usually use it twice a day, and make sure to use sunscreen if going outside.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what is expected.</li>
            <li> You must use this consistently to get results and be careful not to get it on your clothing.  </li>
            <li> The product was just okay, similar items can be purchased that provide the same results for less money and larger quantity.</li>
            <li> It is an inexpensive item that saves the trouble of most customers wasting their money and it came on time just as expected.</li>
            <li> The first week I had some dryness and tiny tiny white bumps that went away after about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t read all the negatives reviews in here before buying the product, people needs to understand we are all different, if it didn&#x27;t work for someone, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not gonna work for you</li>
            <li> NO OTHER PRODUCT WORKS</li>
            <li> The ugly brown spots have faded significantly and I feel much better about myself when I look in the mirror</li>
            <li> The older scars take a long time to fade but</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money, I used one full tube and my dark spots are exactly the same as they were when I started !</li>
            <li> I used this product in high hopes seeing reviews about how this product, too, working on African American skin.</li>
            <li> Its pretty hard to tell if the product is really working on darker skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I am adult female that has struggled for years with ongoing acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell; hopfully we can find a larger container one day.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve been dealing with dark spots along time,then please try this product,because it does exactly what it say&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not finished with it yet, but I use it twice daily, and so far, I see no difference.</li>
            <li> I can barely see any results from this product.  </li>
            <li> Both Ambi and Proactiv&#x27;s fade creams have the active ingredient hydroquinone, but Ambi has added suncreen protection and is dirt cheap as the other reviewer said.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty surprised at the price for such a little bottle</li>
            <li> correcter\\&quot; at walmart for about $4.00 the active ingredient in it is 2% hyroquinone (exactly the same as the $20-$28 proactive.</li>
            <li> It really work on face and hands and also work on other discolor mark on the face.  </li>
            <li> The reason I did not give this product a 5 star is because I dont know if the spots will stay away after not using it, and the dryness and little white bumps werent so fun, but once that went away, the product became a &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> see no change in my skins appearance or dark spots are exactly the same color</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and it has made it more obvious, and I believe the sunlight exposure makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> I must say, I have been a fan of the old \\&quot;skin lightening lotion\\&quot; from ProActiv before they changed it and made it the new and improved \\&quot;Dark Spot</li>
            <li> I would say this product has really done nothing for my dark spots,</li>
            <li> It really helps fade the dark spots on my face and its not greasy.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, I began to notice numbness in the whole area that I used the Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my acne dark spots very well.</li>
            <li> The dark spots did not fade by much and thats why I gave it one star.</li>
            <li> that time the spots haven&#x27;t gone away completely and the sun damage spots do tend to get dry time to time.  </li>
            <li> I am white with light skin and only a few dark spots around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Im new to the dark spot corrector</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I don&#x27;t have a single dark spot on my face anymore.</li>
            <li> Stinks and does not seem to do much so far, but I have not used it for very long so maybe it will get better.</li>
            <li> I only use a tiny amount on each scar so each bottle last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because i wanted to clear the dark spots left by my acne</li>
            <li> So far the left cheek/jaw area is faded by one half.</li>
            <li> it would help clear some dark spots in my face and did not observe any change.</li>
            <li> Used it long enough to see that it did not do as the name states.</li>
            <li> This product may work, but I could not use it long enough to see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now use alot less foundation because the spots have blended in with my natural complexion.</li>
            <li> The dark spots I have on my cheek &amp; forhead are so much lighter that before I used the dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> I feel like they keep the same expensive price but made a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong</li>
            <li> I will certainly be checking out the complaint and suggestion line with ProActiv.</li>
            <li> Hard noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> (they offer an option for oily skin too) for the past month and it has nearly all the same ingredients with an included sunscreen</li>
            <li> I use corrector with a Q-Tip on individual dark spots only on face, forearms &amp; the backs of my hands on dark/brown/hyperpigmentation/melanin</li>
            <li> This is my second tube and not much result.</li>
            <li> had this problem for so long</li>
            <li> but if its taking too long just use a concealer over it until you get the results you want.</li>
            <li> but it takes a long time.</li>
            <li> I found the same price for alot less at a local store.</li>
            <li> It may take a little time to see results, but as long as you use a little every day, it really works.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it 5 stars is if it would get rid of the spots regardless of the BC or any other causing-factors.</li>
            <li> only issue with the Neutrogena product is that anything with sunscreen in it tends to make my face break out in the summer time (due to the excess sweat and oil combined with a sunscreen)</li>
            <li> Very small , but price was sorta kinda reasonable.</li>
            <li> The same active ingredient (2% hydroquinon) can be found in the Equate brand product for $5-6 (1 oz as well).  </li>
            <li> The only reason this product may work is because its active ingredient is hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> After I got rid of all my acne, all that was left were my dark spots.</li>
            <li> So, on goes my quest for a dark spot lightener that actually works.</li>
            <li> My next try will be Philosophy&#x27;s Dark Spot Lightener after I continue with the 3 month recommended period for the Proactive.....</li>
            <li> and I get dark spots under my eyes, around my cheek bones, and even on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Because the skin around the dark spot gets white as it does (for me) with proactive also.</li>
            <li> ONLY thing that will reduce dark spots is GLYCOLIC ACID.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months and have seen a slight improvement in several dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different dark spot correctors and by far Proactiv Dark Spot Corrector takes the lead.  </li>
            <li> but I highly recommend it if you have small dark spots on your face.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for persons who are dealing with facial blemishes due to acne and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Maybe it doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin, when i use it more acne appears on the area, my general face is dark spots due to bad hormonal acne, so</li>
            <li> Within the 2nd bottle, applying every evening, the skin around my nose down to the side of my mouth became so rough</li>
            <li> I have tried other products to remove dark spots that only lighten and damage my skin.</li>
            <li> The other dark spot correctors I tried caused my skin to burn and turn red.  </li>
            <li> Finally I see some lightening in my dark spots due to acne.</li>
            <li> a total scam; does NOTHING TO REMOVE DARK SPOTS!  </li>
            <li> would not buy this product because it is ridiculous to waste almost $40 (since this review was first posted) on 1oz of cream.</li>
            <li> So after using a whole bottle and seeing no results I figured that I must have some tough scars</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to treat some dark spots left behind by cystic acne on my cheeks, and also tried it on some sunspots I have on my forehead.</li>
            <li> How long does it take for the dark spots to reduce and disappear?  </li>
            <li> this is getting to be a bit expensive, but if I stretch it out and eventually find something that works it will be worth my time &amp; effort.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long you have to use it before the dark spots are supposed to disappear or even if they are supposed to disappear.  </li>
            <li> The results are not as noticeable as I expected.  </li>
            <li> As expected will order again</li>
            <li> Her dark spots are not completely gone but they have lighten up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Only recommend once a day, I tried twice and it dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> And there are several glycolic acid night creams that you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time with this trash.</li>
            <li> With Proactiv I see results within a few days on my face; it takes longer on similar spots on my (darker) hands &amp; forearms.</li>
            <li> I feel like my face is actually getting worse as far as complexion.</li>
            <li> and my acne scars have been darkened due to not being educated on sunscreen.</li>
            <li> like there other stuff just not this one.</li>
            <li> PLEASE SEND INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping that it will help with the other spots.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST BLUSH, IT SEEMS A BIT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> (Japanese Shiseido is stronger but usually unavailable in North America).</li>
            <li> when I found out it had a skin cancer product in this dark spot corrector, I threw it out - other countries have banned it but allowed in usa because it works -</li>
            <li> But it just isn&#x27;t enough in that little small bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth, but still looked bad.</li>
            <li> The only issue i have (why i gave it four stars) is it smells seriously bad, like worse then most acne products to</li>
            <li> I am dark skin and this product has removed dark spots caused by acne scars without the damaging effects.</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone is a melanin inhibitor that allows dark marks to fade gradually over time and give you an even skin tone.</li>
            <li> i had a some dark spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li> the dark marks are still on my skin ......</li>
            <li> I do like this product, it has reduced my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a month now and don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference in any of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> This does nothing to remove stubborn dark spots on your face, it just leaves a smell&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Been using for a month but see NO difference in dark spots.</li>
            <li> the affected dark spot.&lt;br /&gt;*DO</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that this would be the product that would fade away the dark sun spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I just started using it for about a week but can already see changes with my dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I see a difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have looked at reviews before purchasing the proactive dark spot corrector</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get rid of the dark spots at all.</li>
            <li> This product helped her with those dark spots within days.</li>
            <li> Works well fading the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> so i order me some dark spot corrector it ship</li>
            <li> Got this for my fianc&amp;eacute; who has a dark spot by his eye.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t remove the dark spots on my neck, but did reduce them and made them lighter.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it takes to start to fade.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to get rid of my dark mark.  </li>
            <li> I have had age and dark spot for years</li>
            <li> While it is not a miracle product in getting rid of the dark spots instantaneously or over night (what does?)</li>
            <li> B0075QVOFW PROACTIV DARK SPOT CORRECTOR,1 OZ</li>
            <li> the quicker the fade becomes noticeable, just as the quicker a dark spot becomes noticeable.</li>
            <li> The Shiseido &amp; Lancôme products are overpriced, overhyped &amp; not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I narrowed down the reasoning to being because of my birth control.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that it has completely cleared a very small spot on my nose, but hasn&#x27;t helped me with the small ones around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight decrease in spots.  </li>
            <li> I have used over half the tube...</li>
            <li> would recommend this product if my pointers are goin to be used and followed if u dont have the time or patience to place a little drop on each an every dark spot then this is not for u.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, if I had large areas of discoloration to manage on a daily basis I would use Ambi as it is both less caustic &amp; less expensive.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female and had bad acne growing up.</li>
            <li> I sometimes forget to use it everyday but you only need to apply a very small amount</li>
            <li> You apply it twice a day and you&#x27;ll start to notice results in as little as 1-2 weeks just as you would with this one and</li>
            <li> NOT apply all over the skin, apply a little dot of the product on onli</li>
            <li> correct DARK SPOTS!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about 20$, so it is a little pricey, but here on Amazon you can find it for about 10$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goodluck dark spots/acne marks suck!</li>
            <li> I have used it sparingly due to small size and must say it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months and nothing has happened guys don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> how ever I tried it a few times b4</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;ve tried a few dark-spot correctors including Clinique&#x27;s, Ambi&#x27;s, and now this.</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything for me,,,, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of purchasing this product by Proactiv but based on all the reviews I think it might be a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually find this product in the \\&quot;dark skin care</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now with no results of</li>
            <li> and I put it on everyday.</li>
            <li> I think it might take a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money using this cream.</li>
            <li> Worked within days on some spots, but after a few weeks I am still waiting for others to fade in a noticable way</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale (lightest ivory cosmetics sold) and my hands/forearms are a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was product or dark spots are just hard to remove</li>
            <li> but I was feeling lazy.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> Had some &amp;#34;permanant&amp;#34; redness from past blemishes and they faded within a couple of days&#x27; application.</li>
            <li> Just started using so not sure of it&#x27;s value yet.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try for couple of months religiously together with my sunscreen but your product still fails to accomplish the result I want to achieve.</li>
            <li> It made my skin breakout, not sure why.</li>
            <li> the bottle is small</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have no more</li>
            <li> I immediately was praising \\&quot;Money well spent!\\&quot;, but after this last week I have been at sort of a stale mate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it burns occasionally</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t even have serious brown spot problems but just a few of them.</li>
            <li> plus for a little tube its 28.00 not a good value.</li>
            <li> The spots are lighter and sometimes hardly noticeable, but because I have to keep taking BC</li>
            <li> (I hardly wear make-up anymore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry I spent money on this.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you should try a different route that isn&#x27;t potentially dangerous.</li>
            <li> The area has been numb for a solid week now, and I stopped using the cream as soon as I noticed the numbness.</li>
            <li> The bumps are still there after 4 days but are slowly diminishing, which I am ever so grateful for.</li>
            <li> Just because it doesnt work for someone else doesnt mean it wont work for you.</li>
            <li> BUT OMGGGGG my face was sooooooo bad with acne, it cleared my acne like no other product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Proactiv dark spot corrector is also fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> weeks later it show that it was working and help fade my blackheads too bad</li>
            <li> Also, I bought this corrector along with the PROACTIV package, which includes the 3-step system (acne wash, toner, and treatment), and it did nothing for my skin except it dried it a lot, making it uncomfortable to put make up on.</li>
            <li> This product was worthless and pretty expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Weak-</li>
            <li> I mean NOTHING!</li>
            <li> I was using it for about 2 weeks under my nose and a little off to the left side of my nose, because that is where my acne is worst.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this with any product before.  </li>
            <li> just kept them getting worse.</li>
            <li> but it did not work for me, rather it made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve exhausted my supply, I will consider biting the bullet and pay the cost of my presciption medicine.</li>
            <li> I tired all kinds of things</li>
            <li> And it made my skin worse than help it.  </li>
            <li> , I dont care if its not a great value which is not</li>
            <li> EVERY night for at least 3 weeks, and has not done a dang thing!!</li>
            <li> Bad purchase, turns out I&#x27;m allergic to this product and found out the hard way.  </li>
            <li> However, it is way too expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> To expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys.</li>
            <li> My hope is that this product will help me get rid of this silly relic of my rebellious youth.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Get this stuff, seriously!!</li>
            <li> It is not \\&quot;fully\\&quot; numb...</li>
            <li> Waste of money broke out worst than before .</li>
            <li> fake!</li>
            <li> , in the past I didnt want to get it because of the awful reviews on it</li>
            <li> STINKS really bad</li>
            <li> And after about two weeks it started to stink really bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed by these products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO TO ALOT OF TROUBLE FOR A REFUND!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed by this</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not notice any difference. Sorry I spent money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for about 2 weeks now and have not seen any difference. Maybe it&#x27;ll take longer for my skin;not sure. I&#x27;ll keep using this tube until it&#x27;s gone and then decide if there is another purchase. But so far it doesn&#x27;t look promising.</li>
            <li> It seems to work, not sure if I buy any more. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it is exactly as described in the ad. I&#x27;ve used this product before, purchasing it from a proactive vending machine at the mall (so, I know it works). I believe it was much cheaper at the mall, I knew that when I bought this product but I was feeling lazy.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for 2 months and it has not worked at all. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Within the 2nd bottle, applying every evening, the skin around my nose down to the side of my mouth became so rough I didn&#x27;t know if I was having an allergic reaction to food or just this product.  I have never experienced this with any product before.  I started using Obaji for 2 nights and my skin is already feeling smoother.  I would say this product has really done nothing for my dark spots, just kept them getting worse.</li>
            <li> works wonders on sun spots!</li>
            <li> Best dark spot corrector yet</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  However, it is way too expensive for what it is.  The same active ingredient (2% hydroquinon) can be found in the Equate brand product for $5-6 (1 oz as well).  However, please understand that the Equate brand is a different consistency.  It&#x27;s a thicker cream, whereas the Proactive is a more liquidy lotion.  I prefer the thicker Equate cream actually, because the Proactiv product is easy to waste when too much comes out of the tube with a very light squeeze.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products to remove dark spots that only lighten and damage my skin. I am dark skin and this product has removed dark spots caused by acne scars without the damaging effects. Not only that my skin has returned to its original tone with a smoother look and softer feel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference but I also think I discontinued using earlier than I should have.</li>
            <li> this product didnt work that good on me i use the neutrogena dark spot reducer it works better for me</li>
            <li> Love this product. It works.</li>
            <li> use lemon juice and a Qtip instead-much cheaper and just as effective</li>
            <li> I dunno.  How long does it take for the dark spots to reduce and disappear?  This is my second tube and not much result.</li>
            <li> Just to forewarn everyone, I have NOT purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s out the way, I&#x27;d like to let everyone know the reason why I haven&#x27;t. The only reason this product may work is because its active ingredient is hydroquinone. Hydroquinone is a melanin inhibitor that allows dark marks to fade gradually over time and give you an even skin tone. The gold standard of this primary ingredient is a concentration of 2%, anything higher I believe has to be prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product because it is ridiculous to waste almost $40 (since this review was first posted) on 1oz of cream. Especially because it&#x27;s named Proactive. I have been using [[ASIN:B000GO41X2 Ambi Fade Cream, Normal Skin, 2 oz.]] (they offer an option for oily skin too) for the past month and it has nearly all the same ingredients with an included sunscreen and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. You apply it twice a day and you&#x27;ll start to notice results in as little as 1-2 weeks just as you would with this one and the best part is, it comes in a 2oz tube at 10x less the price of Proactive&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is if you&#x27;re the consumer who&#x27;s looking for this same product but don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg, do some research on products with hydroquinone in it and make an educated decision or just go for the fade cream I mentioned earlier. If you&#x27;re a Prime Member, I&#x27;d suggest the 2-pack ([[ASIN:B005CRJUEI Ambi Skincare Fade Cream, Normal Skin, 2-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]]). It&#x27;s much more cost-effective.</li>
            <li> Stinks and does not seem to do much so far, but I have not used it for very long so maybe it will get better.</li>
            <li> works ok on dark spots. but not that great. cant wear it under makeup or it flakes off. wont buy it again. plus for a little tube its 28.00 not a good value. iv been using this every day for 3wks.</li>
            <li> It works. i had a some dark spots and blemishes. Along with some cream beneath my makeup it cleared most major dark spots within a month or so. It&#x27;s ok i guess. I wouldn&#x27;t swear by it alone, but along with proper cleansing and maybe a light cream under your makeup or ant night, it works well</li>
            <li> I am still using this product and I&#x27;ve noticed some improvements in dark/age spots on the face.I do plan to continue usage throughout the Summer months</li>
            <li> It really helps fade the dark spots on my face and its not greasy. It works really well!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li> Love love this product it lighted up all my dark spots on my face that were caused from acne scars I seen I Hugh difference in a couple weeks I give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s so effective..</li>
            <li> Works for me. Love that I don&#x27;t have to time this as you do with some spot correctors, Can be left on overnight.</li>
            <li> Didt really work it clogged my pours and made my skin break out more and the dark marks are still on my skin ......</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because i wanted to clear the dark spots left by my acne but it did not work for me, rather it made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, it has reduced my dark spots. But it just isn&#x27;t enough in that little small bottle.</li>
            <li> I am adult female that has struggled for years with ongoing acne breakouts.  I tried this product primarily because my prescription cream for bleaching dark spots was no longer available through my insurance plans.  Initially, I saw results that seem to indicate that this would work just as well as my prescription medicine.  Today, I&#x27;m not so sure.  I&#x27;ll continue using it since I purchase 3 tubes of it.  After I&#x27;ve exhausted my supply, I will consider biting the bullet and pay the cost of my presciption medicine.</li>
            <li> This product is a good one. It showed almost immediate results. Using it twice a day helps. Just remember not to go out in the sun with it. Another good product from proactiv</li>
            <li> After I got rid of all my acne, all that was left were my dark spots. My skin felt smooth, but still looked bad. That&#x27;s why I absolutely LOVE this product! Even though it took a couple months my skin looked great and my family started to notice too! I would recommend to everyone like me!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see any changes what so ever. Not sure if it was product or dark spots are just hard to remove</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works and I got my order super fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have not found anything else that works as well&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> great result  will continue to use  had this problem for so long did not think I would find anything strong enough to help me  used it for a week</li>
            <li> I am 17 years old and have combination to oily skin with many acne scars. I used this product in high hopes seeing reviews about how this product, too, working on African American skin. So after using a whole bottle and seeing no results I figured that I must have some tough scars so I bought another bottle and when it was done with no results I gave up. Such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a month now and don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference in any of my dark spots. In fact, as another reviewer noted, some of my spots even appear to be darker. So, on goes my quest for a dark spot lightener that actually works. My next try will be Philosophy&#x27;s Dark Spot Lightener after I continue with the 3 month recommended period for the Proactive.....this is getting to be a bit expensive, but if I stretch it out and eventually find something that works it will be worth my time &amp; effort.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream once and broke out with lots of large red pimple like bumps in the areas I applied it. I normally don&#x27;t have pimples and am in my 30&#x27;s. I did not apply this again as I got kind of scared that I had ruined my skin. The bumps are still there after 4 days but are slowly diminishing, which I am ever so grateful for. I have never had this happen with similar products like the Ambi fade cream, which didn&#x27;t work for me, that is why I wanted to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv dark spot corrector is also fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months and nothing has happened guys don&#x27;t waste your money on this you&#x27;ll regret i, honestly you will. Those commercials are lying to you.</li>
            <li> This does nothing to remove stubborn dark spots on your face, it just leaves a smell&lt;br /&gt;Just another marketing scheme to fool off people, you use it often&lt;br /&gt;waiting in aspiration to see results, and witness a difference, but to no avail&lt;br /&gt;your proclivity to achieve a disparity is disheartened by distorted hoopla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Best spot remover ever...I love this product, helps me so much...thank you very much for this item...make sure you never stop having it available...</li>
            <li> Used it long enough to see that it did not do as the name states. Will not buy or recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this nightly. It seems to be working so far. It has a fresh expiration date on it as well. Packaging was great and it was shipped rather fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanx,&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and she now will use nothing else. This really works. She is very happy with results.</li>
            <li> Decent product. Proactive works for me on and off. Easy to use. Good size. Feels refreshing and doesn&#x27;t get oily or dry out skin.</li>
            <li> OH my goodness. This works wonders. I definitely recommend it! My skin never looked better, and I wont stop using this product.</li>
            <li> This product has helped so much with my acne scars that I have had for years. I woud definitely recommend this product to anyone with acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 yrs old, I used this when it came with the Proactive I bought for my 14 yr old adoptive son. The only way one can get it , is with the package deal from Proactive. I was so happy to find just this one item. It really works</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I am an African American female and had bad acne growing up. When I got to college I was always in the sun, I am now 30 and my acne scars have been darkened due to not being educated on sunscreen. Ive tried &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34;. I saw a difference in the spots on my face the first week of using it. The first week I had some dryness and tiny tiny white bumps that went away after about a week. I used shea butter for the dryness. The dryness disappeared after about a week as well. I now use alot less foundation because the spots have blended in with my natural complexion. Im only about 3 weeks into my tube and still have ALOT LEFT. IM EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THE NEXT 3 WEEKS LOOK LIKE. The reason I did not give this product a 5 star is because I dont know if the spots will stay away after not using it, and the dryness and little white bumps werent so fun, but once that went away, the product became a &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No pamphlet came with the product so I don&#x27;t know how long you have to use it before the dark spots are supposed to disappear or even if they are supposed to disappear.  They have lightened, however, in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I love it, is my nr 1 cream.@ night . really good.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I don&#x27;t have a single dark spot on my face anymore. This works pretty FAST AND EFFECTIVELY if used regularly.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and don&#x27;t want it sent to me on an autodelivery to use it so this is very helpful to me</li>
            <li> I use to suffer from acne for so many years. Now my face is clear and the marks are so much lighter.</li>
            <li> Using it continually gives me the best results. I can say it does work for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe it doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin, when i use it more acne appears on the area, my general face is dark spots due to bad hormonal acne, so naturally I thought this would help and well; more acne I don&#x27;t need. I&#x27;m already traumatized by what I already have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product it&#x27;s working for my skin. I tired all kinds of things but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Love this product but you need to use it sparingly.  It works but if used too much, may make your skin burn or break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and I do not see any results. I had always wanted to use proactive products to see if all the hype was accurate.</li>
            <li> Absulotely love it third refill</li>
            <li> Been using for a month but see NO difference in dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine this is as good as it can get next to having some type of laser surgery. I&#x27;m 29 and I get dark spots under my eyes, around my cheek bones, and even on my upper lip.  I started seeing it years ago in photos and it really bothered me.  I narrowed down the reasoning to being because of my birth control.  I never had this issue before.  I am fair-skinned and it has made it more obvious, and I believe the sunlight exposure makes it worse.  I decided to switch BC and start using sunscreen regularly and that didn&#x27;t change anything.  I looked into this and decided to give it a try as I have my wedding coming up.  I bought this about 6 months before my wedding day (which is this weekend) and I usually use it twice a day, and make sure to use sunscreen if going outside.  I can actually see a difference.  The spots are lighter and sometimes hardly noticeable, but because I have to keep taking BC my ultimate problem persists.  I imagine if I quit the BC this might get rid of my issue all together.  The only thing that would make it 5 stars is if it would get rid of the spots regardless of the BC or any other causing-factors.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but it smells really wierd, like maybe it&#x27;s old or something.. Not working, makes me wonder if it&#x27;s not the same thing!</li>
            <li> Very good product! It seems to work for age spots so far.I am really enjoying the good results and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hopping it would help clear some dark spots in my face and did not observe any change. To expensive.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it. love it</li>
            <li> Ugh! Bad purchase, turns out I&#x27;m allergic to this product and found out the hard way.  And it made my skin worse than help it.  So beware ladies and gents before making a purchase and make sure you know the ingredients before you try any beauty product.</li>
            <li> saw almost immediate results, not even kidding. Had some &amp;#34;permanant&amp;#34; redness from past blemishes and they faded within a couple of days&#x27; application. Impressed!</li>
            <li> Its ok, it did remove the spots</li>
            <li> love this cream. my face is starting to look good... more cleaner and clearer.</li>
            <li> This product works ok.  I don&#x27;t use it maybe as often as I should, but that&#x27;s because I have not noticed much of a change.  I do love proactive products however!</li>
            <li> Too early to tell; hopfully we can find a larger container one day.</li>
            <li> Product does not work</li>
            <li> This works great on new acne scars.  The older scars take a long time to fade but this works really well on the new scars.  I actually use this on the actual pimples.  I only use a tiny amount on each scar so each bottle last a very long time.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Let me start off by saying this product works &amp; I have seen reviews bashing the product, but ppl u have to remember everyone skin is different regaurdless if a product says all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I have super sensitive skin so I really didnt want to overwhelmed my skin wit a new product how ever I tried it a few times b4 I got to learn how to use it right, these are some pointers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DO NOT apply all over the skin, apply a little dot of the product on onli the affected dark spot.&lt;br /&gt;*DO NOT apply and go in the sun regardless what the pakage say, I suggest u use this product @ night.&lt;br /&gt;*Clean face properply b4 applying.&lt;br /&gt;*And finally do not apply more than once per day because this product if over used can damage your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if my pointers are goin to be used and followed if u dont have the time or patience to place a little drop on each an every dark spot then this is not for u.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I gave this a requested gift to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;m surprised by the price of this product on Amazon; on the Proactive site it&#x27;s around $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;ve tried a few dark-spot correctors including Clinique&#x27;s, Ambi&#x27;s, and now this. Both Ambi and Proactiv&#x27;s fade creams have the active ingredient hydroquinone, but Ambi has added suncreen protection and is dirt cheap as the other reviewer said. I&#x27;d like to leave an important note on this ingredient, hydroquinone. A while back, it was banned in Europe, and in the USA the FDA proposed a ban of its use in OTC cosmetics because it is believed to be a carcinogen (cancer causing agent). Us women do a lot to be perceived as beautiful, but we should also be careful. Perhaps you should try a different route that isn&#x27;t potentially dangerous. Be advised and try to search up on this yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using both Ambi and Proactiv&#x27;s spot correctors, I experienced a bad allergic reaction on my face, so I wasn&#x27;t able to use either long enough to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you all..</li>
            <li> Better than all I have tried, believe me I have tried a lot.</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m still waiting for better results - but if it does work I will order it again</li>
            <li> This product works and in a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Just started using so not sure of it&#x27;s value yet.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that this would be the product that would fade away the dark sun spots on my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it every night for 2 - 3 weeks and cannot tell one difference.</li>
            <li> I used this product until there was nothing left in the bottle. I applied it every night for about five months. I bought it mainly to treat some dark spots left behind by cystic acne on my cheeks, and also tried it on some sunspots I have on my forehead. After five months, I still cannot see any significant improvement. I am extremely disciplined, so I rarely missed applying the product. Overall, I would NOT recommend it as I did not see any improvement on my skin. Also, I bought this corrector along with the PROACTIV package, which includes the 3-step system (acne wash, toner, and treatment), and it did nothing for my skin except it dried it a lot, making it uncomfortable to put make up on. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed by these products.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products for my dark spots ,over the last seven years,and nothing worked..I mean NOTHING! I paid good money for these products,and was alway let down by the outcome. I am 40 yrs old,and have been dealing with these dark spots for a long time,now I&#x27;ve finally found this product,and it is AMAZING...SIMPLY AMAZING! It works fast. It&#x27;s not drying. It&#x27;s perfect;and I should know...trust me on this. This product was a blessing for me,a true blessing. if you&#x27;ve been dealing with dark spots along time,then please try this product,because it does exactly what it say&#x27;s...correct DARK SPOTS! Thanks Proactiv ;)</li>
            <li> The dark spots I have on my cheek &amp; forhead are so much lighter that before I used the dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> Still working to remove the spots but it is working</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly what is expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now.  It has faded most of the brown spots on my face.  I have tried several products including laser.  This works the best!!  I am hoping for a dark spot free face in another month.&lt;br /&gt;I have already ordered my second tube.  Wnderful product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t read all the negatives reviews in here before buying the product, people needs to understand we are all different, if it didn&#x27;t work for someone, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not gonna work for you, I bought it a week ago and I stared to see results after 3 first days, I still cannot believe how fast this product has change my skin, it&#x27;s my first time using PROACTIVE products and I&#x27;m loving it, good luck everyone.</li>
            <li> I do not start to use it&lt;br /&gt;but is look same with pic and I got it on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything for me,,,, waste of money. I think using lemon juice on your face works better than this expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;I like there other stuff just not this one.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner. The only problem was it broke my face out. But I have sensitive skin and allergic to many things. I was not the products fault.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Arrived as described. Good deal. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It is an inexpensive item that saves the trouble of most customers wasting their money and it came on time just as expected.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing!  I just started using it for about a week but can already see changes with my dark spots.</li>
            <li> This product may work, but I could not use it long enough to see results.&lt;br /&gt;The product will not absorb into my skin enough for me to use moisturizer. It all flakes off.&lt;br /&gt;I bought some Ambi instead, and am using it with good results.&lt;br /&gt;My problem now is the money back guarantee, which is really a joke.&lt;br /&gt;I had to leave several voicemails for them, then they took a week to give me a method to return the product. Then they took another couple of weeks say they got the product back, but could I please call them back with my credit card info, which is totally bogus, since they already have my info. I cannot reach anybody, so had to leave another voicemail, and am still waiting to get my refund.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO TO ALOT OF TROUBLE FOR A REFUND!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You must use this consistently to get results and be careful not to get it on your clothing.  I would order this again and I have seen real results and fading of brown spots</li>
            <li> I personally use proactive and the 3-step system works! Im new to the dark spot corrector and i was wondering does it work. So far its doing good but if its taking too long just use a concealer over it until you get the results you want.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a coule of weeks now, and it is working very well. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i literally got proactive three days ago and the dark spots are already starting to disappear.The only issue i have (why i gave it four stars) is it smells seriously bad, like worse then most acne products to and it is still smellable hours after application.</li>
            <li> The product was just okay, similar items can be purchased that provide the same results for less money and larger quantity. I was very disappointed in the results. The seller provided excellent delivery service and no complaints with them. Just the product itself.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have used it for a couple of months now and I see a difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t re-order this product. Price is good but the dark spots did not go away. Though I may recomend to others who may asked.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, threw it out.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.  PLEASE SEND INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER PRODUCT.  HAVE A GREAT DAY.</li>
            <li> It may take a little time to see results, but as long as you use a little every day, it really works. I&#x27;ve noticed the big blotches on my upper lip diminish within a couple of weeks of use. I sometimes forget to use it everyday but you only need to apply a very small amount so but it&#x27;s lasted me for several months now and still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months and have seen a slight improvement in several dark spots on my face.  The lighter spots dissapeared in about six weeks, so I am hoping with continued use, the darker spots will eventually fade.  They have already lightened.</li>
            <li> Does not work.....This product does not work for me. I have used it for over a month now it does not work....</li>
            <li> Hii! I was thinking of purchasing this product by Proactiv but based on all the reviews I think it might be a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, try&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002BWOY20 Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Moisture, SPF 30, 1 Ounce]].  This product Really does work.  I have been using it and my complexion has gone from blotchy with dark acne marks and slightly red in places to nearly flawless (I hardly wear make-up anymore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the Neutrogena product is that anything with sunscreen in it tends to make my face break out in the summer time (due to the excess sweat and oil combined with a sunscreen) so I was looking for a tone corrector without sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In stores it&#x27;s about 20$, so it is a little pricey, but here on Amazon you can find it for about 10$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck :)</li>
            <li> Hi! There this is my first time writing a review abt. a product.I would say Infomercials are so deceiving....fake! Why can they not get a client who has an actual problem then use their product. Show the results after that. Anyway, for my own experience. I gave it a try for couple of months religiously together with my sunscreen but your product still fails to accomplish the result I want to achieve. Hope you got the msg.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money, I used one full tube and my dark spots are exactly the same as they were when I started ! I wish I would have looked at reviews before purchasing the proactive dark spot corrector</li>
            <li> Ok my rating is mostly based on the price. You can get \\&quot;DR. Fred Summit- skin brightener/ tone correcter\\&quot; at walmart for about $4.00 the active ingredient in it is 2% hyroquinone (exactly the same as the $20-$28 proactive. Also there is no shipping time. It is in a jar not tube and the consistencey is thicker than proactive. I mix it with a skin smoother/replinisher and it wears fine under makeup. However, it will make the skin whiter since it is a bleaching agent and this is why I mix it with skin care cream so that I can do my whole face. Because the skin around the dark spot gets white as it does (for me) with proactive also. I usually find this product in the \\&quot;dark skin care section.\\&quot; I hope this helps someone since you can get 2ounces for 1/6 of the price and because of the thicker consistencey it more than doubles the product. So its like for the price of one tube of proactive you get 12x as much. For $4 what you got to lose. I have no interest in this company, just enjoy the product. Goodluck dark spots/acne marks suck!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of difference. I used it daily for eight weeks and still can see  acne spots. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product was worthless and pretty expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t work. I saw no results after a month of use. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It made my skin breakout, not sure why. I haven&#x27;t tried it again, Leary of more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get rid of the dark spots at all. I had some acne scars that I was trying to get rid of. Save your money</li>
            <li> Works really well. STINKS really bad but you do get excellent results and quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not finished with it yet, but I use it twice daily, and so far, I see no difference.</li>
            <li> I have not had much luck with this product...But&lt;br /&gt;will give it longer to see what happens. We will see.</li>
            <li> Use this product I like it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hyperpigmentation.  This product helped her with those dark spots within days.</li>
            <li> Now started using product and so far has not irritated my skin.  The package says needs to use for 3 months so will be continuing usage for results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile not and im very happy about this product. I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Product works great but the price is too high.  I found the same price for alot less at a local store.</li>
            <li> The results are not as noticeable as I expected.  Will continue to use through the bottle to see for greater results.</li>
            <li> I have been using it religiously 2x a day. My spots are not spots but areas on my face increased by sun over time. So far the left cheek/jaw area is faded by one half. The right side not much change. &amp;#34;Freckles&amp;#34; on cheeks under eyes are the same, So I am giving it more time hoping it will fade just like the left has.</li>
            <li> It really works!! I used it on my chin after getting burned from electrolysis and it made my skin look much better.</li>
            <li> It probably isn&#x27;t long enough to tell yet , but I believe the large age spots on my face have faded significantly .  I don&#x27;t wear makeup and have felt self-conscience about them .</li>
            <li> still have spots and three days still there maybe it will take longer I will keep trying not working yet three days and no sign of change may take longer but three days</li>
            <li> Works well fading the dark spots.  Will continue to use it.  Some people told me that it didn&#x27;t work for them, so I guess it is up to each individual whether it is successful or not.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I didn&#x27;t notice any diterence with this product and I followed the instructions to a tee..</li>
            <li> it did not agree with my skin caused irritation</li>
            <li> a total scam; does NOTHING TO REMOVE DARK SPOTS!  Avoid.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now with no results of anykind&lt;br /&gt;I see no change in my skins appearance or dark spots are exactly the same color</li>
            <li> As expected will order again</li>
            <li> when I found out it had a skin cancer product in this dark spot corrector, I threw it out - other countries have banned it but allowed in usa because it works - but at what price</li>
            <li> I really would give it no star.  It pills off after sunscreen or moisturizer is applied. Their Tea Moisturizer is very good.</li>
            <li> I must say, I have been a fan of the old \\&quot;skin lightening lotion\\&quot; from ProActiv before they changed it and made it the new and improved \\&quot;Dark Spot Correcter\\&quot;. I had been using the old version off and on for over a period of years and I always got excellent quick results when I used it even when I would only apply it for one application as suppose to the 2 they always recommended. I notice when I had a bit of the older left my skin spots were clearing fine, but as soon as I starting using the new version nothing. I feel like my face is actually getting worse as far as complexion. I&#x27;m very disappointed by this and I feel like it&#x27;s a completely different product. I will certainly be checking out the complaint and suggestion line with ProActiv. I feel like they keep the same expensive price but made a cheaply made product. I may have to try something else at one point PA was the only lightner that worked on my skin.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my face i just could not take my blackheads anymore so i order me some dark spot corrector it ship fast 5-7 days soon as it came i hurry up and put it on my face so within weeks later it show that it was working and help fade my blackheads too bad the bottle is small you have to use a alittle and i don&#x27;t have no more but overall: the stuff is magic and clear any issue you is having on you&#x60;re face i have to get me some more blackheads seem to come :) it worth the money and also the smell is good not bad at all</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  Works really well.  I have tried several others and Proactiv works better than the expense ones</li>
            <li> Got this for my fianc&amp;eacute; who has a dark spot by his eye. Since he stared to use the corrector the spot had lightened.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would work... But it didn&#x27;t do anything it claims to do... I would not buy it again...</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called Melasma and I have been using the dark spot corrector for about 4 weeks now and my spots are significantly lighter.  I have been looking for a product that would work quickly and I have found it. I have tried many other products that claim to fade dark spots and I have not had any success.  I am so happy that I decided to try just one more.</li>
            <li> this product works, I&#x27;ve used it for several months and I put it on everyday. it took maybe 6 weeks to see any difference, but it does work. I am white with light skin and only a few dark spots around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was using it for about 2 weeks under my nose and a little off to the left side of my nose, because that is where my acne is worst. I followed the instructions and used it as described. After about 2 weeks, I began to notice numbness in the whole area that I used the Dark Spot Corrector. The area has been numb for a solid week now, and I stopped using the cream as soon as I noticed the numbness. It is not \\&quot;fully\\&quot; numb...another way to describe it is \\&quot;desensitized.\\&quot; It definitely does not feel normal and now I am worried about regaining feeling in my face!!!! I would NOT recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. did what it claim to do. didn&#x27;t remove the dark spots on my neck, but did reduce them and made them lighter. brought another tube and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different dark spot correctors and by far Proactiv Dark Spot Corrector takes the lead.  I have very sensitive skin that easily gets red.  This product did not flare up my skin in any way.  The other dark spot correctors I tried caused my skin to burn and turn red.  It is diffently worth trying. I have been using the product for 4 weeks and have seen a huge difference.  If you are considering purchasing this product and you have sensitive skin give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I can barely see any results from this product.  I realize this is a 2% strength and the same prescription would be for 4%.&lt;br /&gt;I just did not want to go to the expense of an office visit and cost of the 4% medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not publish my name or e-mail address.</li>
            <li> It really work on face and hands and also work on other discolor mark on the face.  I recommend this product to my friends and family</li>
            <li> Cleared up my acne dark spots very well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Tried it faithful and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  And after about two weeks it started to stink really bad</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it takes to start to fade.  I think it might take a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I bought the bottle out of the vending machine at my local mall for about $28. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks. I&#x27;m 27 years old and had a very large age spot underneath my eye. I have been using the tiniest amount on a Q-tip and almost instantly the spot visibly reduced. I immediately was praising \\&quot;Money well spent!\\&quot;, but after this last week I have been at sort of a stale mate. I have to say that it has completely cleared a very small spot on my nose, but hasn&#x27;t helped me with the small ones around my mouth. For me, it was worth the try. Here&#x27;s hoping that it will help with the other spots.</li>
            <li> I believe this works for certain people and doesn&#x27;t for others. I tried it, and my blemishes have not disappeared as I have hoped they would with this product.</li>
            <li> I have seen no change. I suspect the company would stand by its product and insist that its effectiveness varies from individual to individual and that that would include the length of time the product is used.  I would not deny the company that assertion, however the product advertising implies the enhancements are seen quickly becauser at no time does it offer the viewer a hint that time is an important part of the products use.  They should make that clear before or after demonstrating results on a user</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to a month.  I have noticed a slight decrease in spots.  It has worked better than more expensive products I have used for a longer period of time.  Will continue to use more consistently.</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;s working .... I will try one more bottle</li>
            <li> I love this product I saw a difference in my face in less then a month. But I&#x27;m pretty surprised at the price for such a little bottle</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick.  Sorry guys.</li>
            <li> Another great proactive product.  Dark spots disappeared almost like magic.  Will continue to use this product indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to get rid of my dark mark.  No matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried, I still have this silly tattoo.  My hope is that this product will help me get rid of this silly relic of my rebellious youth.  Unfortunately, it burns occasionally which indicates that He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named may be attempting to make another return.  I hope proactiv can help me get rid of it before He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named returns.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife after she saw a commerical on it and it seems to be working well for her. Her dark spots are not completely gone but they have lighten up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it was an AWESOME PRODUCT, will purchase it again and will recommend it to others</li>
            <li> &#x27;nuff said.  (But here go those rules again that require near bloviation instead of honest fact. Why have a word minimum??)</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Only recommend once a day, I tried twice and it dried my skin out. Takles about 3-4 weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money using this cream. It will not work at all. I did not notice any differences at all</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this for sometime now to treat our liver spots, age spots, or brown spots as some call them. We don&#x27;t even have serious brown spot problems but just a few of them. We have used it for more than a month but there is no difference whatsoever. We aren&#x27;t really that upset since it was quite inexpensive to begin with.</li>
            <li> Honestly the only way to find out if a product is going to work for you is try it yourself! Just because it doesnt work for someone else doesnt mean it wont work for you. Kind of like with the proactiv three step system, in the past I didnt want to get it because of the awful reviews on it but I bit the bullet gave it a try and I am so glad I didnt listen to others reviews. Dont get me wrong sometimes its good to read reviews but based on someone elses review you shouldnt not try a product just because it didnt work for them, everyone is different! I love this dark spot corrector and it works for me but I took off one star because it is stinky!</li>
            <li> This product was amazing. It worked so quickly I was amazed. But follow the directions you can develop a rash if you go in the sun while wearing it but I highly recommend it if you have small dark spots on your face. It cleared mine up in four days.</li>
            <li> Waste of money broke out worst than before .</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well so far</li>
            <li> I have been lucky to have decent skin my entire life but after years in the sun I have received about 4 dark spots on my face. I just saw that Proacive had this spot corrector and decided to give it a try. I have used it sparingly due to small size and must say it works. The ugly brown spots have faded significantly and I feel much better about myself when I look in the mirror....I would buy this again..</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WORKS, FAST DELEIVERY. ORDER SUNDAY RECEIVE MONDAY. CAN NOT BEAT IT . NO OTHER PRODUCT WORKS THIS FAST. BUY</li>
            <li> I have had age and dark spot for years and I have tried most products, this one like all hte rest I have tried didnt work at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now with no results.  it would also be useful if proactive would be more clear in how and when to use the product.  i want my money back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since September 2012 and have found positive results.  While it is not a miracle product in getting rid of the dark spots instantaneously or over night (what does?), it -does- reduce their darkness over time and with consistent use.  I am in my 30s and was always in the sun as a child.  Now that I am older and my skin has been aging, damage from that time have begun showing up and this product has helped to reduce the darkness of these spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that time the spots haven&#x27;t gone away completely and the sun damage spots do tend to get dry time to time.  I have used this on recent acne scars and they have faded a -great- deal within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am white, with light olive toned skin.</li>
            <li> I used to order Proactiv and I was happy when I got the dark spot corrector as a free gift. When I started using it I noticed that overtime it would develop a horrendous smell that would not go away, as much as I tried. The dark spots did not fade by much and thats why I gave it one star. I use an aveeno product now and this cream hydrates and evens tone way better than this and is cheaper. Like other commentors before me said, check out other alternatives first.</li>
            <li> This really works well but it takes a long time. I have been you using this for about three months now and Im just not seeing results.</li>
            <li> I have used over half the tube...EVERY night for at least 3 weeks, and has not done a dang thing!! Arrived quickly though. Smells like old-lady perm! Sorry. There are much better spot correctors out there...especially in asian markets!</li>
            <li> I JUST RECEIVED THIS ITEM SO TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE OR RATE IT&#x27;S EFFECTIVENESS. AT FIRST BLUSH, IT SEEMS A BIT EXPENSIVE THE THE 1 OZ SIZE BUT IF IT&#x27;S EFFECTIVE IT WILL BE WORTH IT.  TAKES APPROX 3 MOS OF USE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION.</li>
            <li> It has not done too much yet.But I will keep using it to see what happens. It can&#x27;t hurt to keeping using the product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I thought it would work a little quicker on my dark spots then it does.  Still happy with it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0075QVOFW PROACTIV DARK SPOT CORRECTOR,1 OZ SIZE]]Hydroquinone is not something you use for hyperpigmentation that already exists on your skin, rather it prevents future spots from coming into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing that will reduce dark spots is GLYCOLIC ACID. And there are several glycolic acid night creams that you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time with this trash.</li>
            <li> This definitely worked for me, I used it twice- however if you use this in the fall and spring to fade dark spots...be ready to use a really good sunblock in the spring and summer...I didn&#x27;t and the spots are back...I am going to start over again and take my own advice :)</li>
            <li> This product brightened my face after 7-8 days of use. I noticed that my acne scars began fading fast, but one thing I&#x27;m really impressed about is how this product smoothes the pores, giving skin a very refined, polished feel and look. It works perfectly under my Bare Minerals foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Beware to NOT mix this product with another moisturizer: you will see small white dots all over your fingers and face. I do, however, mix it with Aveda&#x27;s Balancing Infusion Oil for dry skin when I apply it, and it works its magic without getting clumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;D.D.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong I dont know. I only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My husband works in the sun and has lots of dark spots this took them all away, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for big results</li>
            <li> Its pretty hard to tell if the product is really working on darker skin tones.  I&#x27;m not going to say it doesn&#x27;t but I think I was expecting more drastic results.  Maybe a longer period of use is needed...?</li>
            <li> It could VERY well just be my skin BUT..I&#x27;ve used this for 4 months and Nothing!!! I&#x27;ve just come to the conclusion its not for me...but I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of fade creams depend on one&#x27;s natural skin tone - the fairer your skin the quicker the fade becomes noticeable, just as the quicker a dark spot becomes noticeable. I am extremely pale (lightest ivory cosmetics sold) and my hands/forearms are a few shades darker. I use corrector with a Q-Tip on individual dark spots only on face, forearms &amp; the backs of my hands on dark/brown/hyperpigmentation/melanin spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Ambi, Proactiv, Lancôme &amp; the US-version of Shideido (Japanese Shiseido is stronger but usually unavailable in North America). Of these Proactiv is definitely the best. With Proactiv I see results within a few days on my face; it takes longer on similar spots on my (darker) hands &amp; forearms. With Ambi it takes 3-4x as long to be effective on my face &amp; I need to use it continually. The Shiseido &amp; Lancôme products are overpriced, overhyped &amp; not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, if I had large areas of discoloration to manage on a daily basis I would use Ambi as it is both less caustic &amp; less expensive. Since I can manage my discoloration spots by occasionally using Proactiv &amp; it works more quickly for me, that&#x27;s my product of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Weak- Hard noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> This does work but be sure to wash you face well to get any oils off.</li>
            <li> The result is good per my wife who uses the product.</li>
            <li> Worked within days on some spots, but after a few weeks I am still waiting for others to fade in a noticable way</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my acne scars....BUT OMGGGGG my face was sooooooo bad with acne, it cleared my acne like no other product ever did that fact and permanent except for acutane.  It didn&#x27;t work in the begining then it kicked in and omg I Love, I dont care if its not a great value which is not but it worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> This cream is really good and I Love IT !!!  Within two weeks I saw my spots starting to disappear and I think within another month they will be gone</li>
            <li> This stuff totally works. After 3 weeks of using it, most of my spots are gone! Get this stuff, seriously!!</li>
            <li> Finally I see some lightening in my dark spots due to acne. Works fairly quick and smells fine. Thing is it gives me blackheads wherever I put it. Otherwise works fine</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is OK! Very small , but price was sorta kinda reasonable. Overall I was satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this product it removes dark spots and promotes clear appearance. I would definitely recommend this product for persons who are dealing with facial blemishes due to acne and uneven skin tone.</li>
