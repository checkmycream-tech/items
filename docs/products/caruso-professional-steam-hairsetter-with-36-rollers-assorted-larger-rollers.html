            <li>Awesome hairsetter.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to express how happy my daughter and I are at finding the updated Caruso Hair setter.</li>
            <li>She comes out looking great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a year and it still works great.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find them on Amazon and even happier when I got them.</li>
            <li>I love this hairsetter it heats up in no time and gives a great curl.</li>
            <li>Most of the time the clip like shields hold tight...but not always!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my curler set!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, works great.</li>
            <li>Storage bag is nice too.  </li>
            <li>I get nice curls</li>
            <li>The rollers stay in your hair unlike the clip kind which I dislike because they always fall out of your hair.</li>
            <li>We are so happy to see that you are still producing a wonderful product that will keep my waist length hair soft, smooth and curly.</li>
            <li>The rollers are still good quality plastic and foam, and the \\&quot;clips\\&quot; or covers fit nicely even with a lot of hair on a roller.  </li>
            <li>My hair is usually perfect for styling - healthy and shiny, and I usually have excellent results with all kinds of curlers.</li>
            <li>and so many of my friends now own one.  </li>
            <li>Heating one roller at a time is so easy!</li>
            <li>This is the first curling system I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I&#x27;m REALLY happy I went with this.  </li>
            <li>different colored rollers/covers would be great!  </li>
            <li>I love my Caruso Steam Rollers System.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this product as a more healthy alternative but did not  reach the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am glad i found this set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She needed more of the jumbo rollers, so we ordered those separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this appliance more to all of you who have hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Getting the entire set was a great deal!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>They worked perfectly and the curl even lasted to the next day which is unheard of for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned three of these over many years and really love it.</li>
            <li>I wonder how many of these sets end up at garage sales.</li>
            <li>15-20 years on, I STILL have that old workhorse, and it STILL curls my  hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for fine hair that doesn&#x27;t curl with regular curling irons.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my older hair and/or defective memory? :P)    </li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li>and they really did a good job then.</li>
            <li>I have beautiful lasting curls</li>
            <li>I have fine wavey hair.  </li>
            <li>Got it in super mailing time!</li>
            <li>I like the curlers they give a great curl, but it does not last 2 days as promoted.</li>
            <li>I went to a meeting after I used the Caruso for the first time and received many compliments about my hair.  </li>
            <li>I still have the original one I purchased ~15 years ago, and it still works.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s just like my original one, but without salt to add.  </li>
            <li>Had one of these a long time ago and remembered how great the curl was.  </li>
            <li>The curlers gave me a full, soft, and gentle curl - looks great, and held for day two.  </li>
            <li>They really do leave your hair soft and in good condition and they are super easy to use.</li>
            <li>the more modern sleek look I was going for.</li>
            <li>It really does work :-)</li>
            <li>This one, while producing nice curl &amp; body, doesn&#x27;t seem to produce as defined nor long-lasting a curl as the old one.</li>
            <li>The steam unit heats up quickly--20 seconds and it&#x27;s pumping out steam for over 30 minutes on a full tank.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually review products for women, but my wife doesn&#x27;t have her own account and this one deserves a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t get over how quickly she could set her hair and how convenient this product is.</li>
            <li>It was super soft and natural looking, and I was actually happy with my hair for the first time in forever!  </li>
            <li>I have used a Caruso Professional Steam Hairsetter for many years, I still have my original one, the one where you had to add salt, &amp; it still works.   </li>
            <li>I love my new hairsetter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think curling my hair around my finger might actually work better!</li>
            <li>skip spray and see if curls are as nice and last as long&lt;</li>
            <li>would have given a 5 rating, but the covers need something to make them more identifiable by size--</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a good product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about my Caruso curlers.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re SO much better for your hair (steam &amp; foam vs. direct heat &amp; metal, plus no chance of burning your fingers, scalp, face, arm, etc.).</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to shave off several minutes by skipping the hair-spray step and learning how to section hair more quickly.  </li>
            <li>With as much hair as I have, I&#x27;ll end up purchasing  supplemental sets of jumbo and large rollers, which are available separately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT, the rollers worked great on short hair too (so, yes, I did end up using the smaller rollers afterall).  </li>
            <li>Even on my granddaughter&#x27;s fine, long hair, the curl tends to brush out  easily.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific machine, just make sure you order the right size rollers when ordering.</li>
            <li>Nice quantity of  large rollers for people like me with long hair.  </li>
            <li>My natural wave just frizzes and puffs up giving me huge hair.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be an ideal product for achieving natural looking curls without causing much damage, if you don&#x27;t mind it looking a bit messy.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know why people were commenting on my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packed away somewhere due to the fact that I have been relocating more than I planned, so I asked for one for Christmas!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend them however it takes longer to roll up your hair with these than hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I had only 45 minutes to try them out, so I quickly unpacked and separated the rollers &amp; covers by size, filled the machine with tap water and plugged it in.</li>
            <li>For me, it takes about the same amount of time to curl my hair with a large curling iron, but I know these rollers would be faster if I practiced more</li>
            <li>The sponge part seems like it will last for some time, its easy to operate and use.</li>
            <li>I would rather have straight hair, than use curling irons, etc, that just burn and break my hair.</li>
            <li>After watching \\&quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic\\&quot; and adoring Isla Fisher&#x27;s hair, I found an online video of her set hairdresser demonstrating how to achieve the \\&quot;look\\&quot; with Caruso rollers.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I experimented with it, the result was a bit messier than desired.</li>
            <li>wife absolutely loves this thing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>the steam really holds the curl.</li>
            <li>Also, this set has some of every size, but I&#x27;d personally prefer more jumbo and large rollers--i&#x27;ll probably never use the tiny ones.  </li>
            <li>wanted the big bouncy curls and thought I&#x27;d try this...it really curls quickly.  </li>
            <li>I needed new rollers for my caruso from many,many,many years ago!</li>
            <li>They curl quick, and I suppose if I did it correctly would last all day..</li>
            <li>My hair is NOT slick or straight, and it still worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I bought them without high hopes.  </li>
            <li>Our old one is still working after over 15 years of use but the curlers have been used so much that they are falling apart.</li>
            <li>in a desperate attempt to have pretty curls like eveyone else had, lol.</li>
            <li>i really only needed large rollers, and medium rollers if i wanted my hair really curly.</li>
            <li>I thought it was time to upgrade to a new one</li>
            <li>You will never get the same results with those pokey hot rollers with the wires to hold them on.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but the curls last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Different sets are available, but since I impulsively bought the one and only box that was at the local beauty supply store, I didn&#x27;t have much choice.  </li>
            <li>I use the new rollers with my old caruso.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and either I am not using it right or steam is just not a good way to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>After using the Caruso Professional Steam Hairsetter with the larger rollers, my hair was soft and gently waved.  </li>
            <li>It says a lot for the Caruso Professional Steam Hairsetter, when you can still purchase another one even after 10+yrs.    </li>
            <li>Maybe if I had thick luscious hair it would be better</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, grey hair, but I know, from past uses of the old set, that your updated version will keep working as well as the old, especially after reading these reviews.</li>
            <li>Because of your former product, we will be purchasing your new one.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d buy some extra big curlers, when really I wanted the MEDIUM ones...</li>
            <li>So far, soaking them in several soapy solutions hasn&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li>They work, but I would suggest that they be used for young girls (tweens/teens) as they don&#x27;t keep a lasting curl.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if your hair is BABY fine, then it might do SOMETHING, but basically it&#x27;s a completely useless product, and a huge waste of time because it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>this is a really good idea, I think, as it would help with those little uneven bits that tend to plink out all over the place while you are trying to roll--especially if you have uneven layers</li>
            <li>When I needed to curl my long, thick, coarse hair for a special event I went looking for these again.</li>

            <li> Different sets are available, but since I impulsively bought the one and only box that was at the local beauty supply store, I didn&#x27;t have much choice.  </li>
            <li> I use the new rollers with my old caruso.  </li>

            <li> I thought I&#x27;d buy some extra big curlers, when really I wanted the MEDIUM ones...</li>
            <li> So far, soaking them in several soapy solutions hasn&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li> They work, but I would suggest that they be used for young girls (tweens/teens) as they don&#x27;t keep a lasting curl.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if your hair is BABY fine, then it might do SOMETHING, but basically it&#x27;s a completely useless product, and a huge waste of time because it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> this is a really good idea, I think, as it would help with those little uneven bits that tend to plink out all over the place while you are trying to roll--especially if you have uneven layers</li>

            <li> I like that you can put your hair on these and then do other things (like apply makeup) while your curls set.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, for someone with long and thick hair like mine, even the jumbo sized rollers are not large enough but shrink if you wrap it tightly in an attempt to get cleaner curls.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just wanted to express how happy my daughter and I are at finding the updated Caruso Hair setter. Our old one is still working after over 15 years of use but the curlers have been used so much that they are falling apart. The machine probably still works because we have well water and not city water. I&#x27;ve searched the stores and was unable to find another one until my daughter did a search online and found this new updated hair setter. We are so happy to see that you are still producing a wonderful product that will keep my waist length hair soft, smooth and curly. I have very fine, straight, grey hair, but I know, from past uses of the old set, that your updated version will keep working as well as the old, especially after reading these reviews. Because of your former product, we will be purchasing your new one. I would rather have straight hair, than use curling irons, etc, that just burn and break my hair. With wet, humid weather, the curls stay in!!! Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> After five years of growing out my hair, I was ready to chop it off because a ponytail is SO boring, and I can&#x27;t get any style out of my hair, no matter how I have it cut-- and nothing works on it.  My natural wave just frizzes and puffs up giving me huge hair.  I&#x27;ve tried large and small barrel curling irons, which take forever with all this hair, then after all that work, it just goes flat.  My only *other* hairstyle was accomplished if I spent at least an hour with a flat-iron, and that was a pain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Salon Pro.  After watching \\&quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic\\&quot; and adoring Isla Fisher&#x27;s hair, I found an online video of her set hairdresser demonstrating how to achieve the \\&quot;look\\&quot; with Caruso rollers.  I had never heard of them, but thought, \\&quot;What the heck?  If this doesn&#x27;t work, nothing will and the hair goes!\\&quot;  So off to the beauty supply store I went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got them I had only 45 minutes to try them out, so I quickly unpacked and separated the rollers &amp; covers by size, filled the machine with tap water and plugged it in. It heated immediately.  (I figured if my hair didn&#x27;t turn out, I could always fall back on the ol&#x27; ponytail.)  Working with completely dry hair, sectioning it and hair-spraying each section, and rolling from the bottom up (rather than twisting hair around the roller), I had my entire head rolled in about 25 minutes I think.  While letting the rollers set for 10 minutes, I did my makeup.  Then I blasted the rollers with the cool setting on my dryer and took them out, brushed through and was out the door. And no ponytail!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw!  These weren&#x27;t the cheezy curls I had as a kid when Grandma would use those pink foam rollers that you had to sleep in all night and gave you sausage bangs and Cindy Brady pigtails!!!  It was super soft and natural looking, and I was actually happy with my hair for the first time in forever!  I&#x27;m hoping to shave off several minutes by skipping the hair-spray step and learning how to section hair more quickly.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be keeping the hair for now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;d do differently with next use:&lt;br /&gt;1) skip spray and see if curls are as nice and last as long&lt;br /&gt;2) finger comb rather than brush through hair to keep curls defined&lt;br /&gt;3) start with the bottom layers and work upwards (I did it backwards!)&lt;br /&gt;4) use filtered tap water rather than regular tap water (to keep gunk out and hopefully prolong machine&#x27;s life)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: one African-American gal online has a video using the rollers, and she uses papers on the ends of her hair to keep them from frizzing...this is a really good idea, I think, as it would help with those little uneven bits that tend to plink out all over the place while you are trying to roll--especially if you have uneven layers like I do (google these videos--they&#x27;re quite helpful).  In both videos mentioned, the women had completely slick straight hair to start.  My hair is NOT slick or straight, and it still worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given a 5 rating, but the covers need something to make them more identifiable by size--different colored rollers/covers would be great!  Also, this set has some of every size, but I&#x27;d personally prefer more jumbo and large rollers--i&#x27;ll probably never use the tiny ones.  Different sets are available, but since I impulsively bought the one and only box that was at the local beauty supply store, I didn&#x27;t have much choice.  I started with jumbo and as i ran out went progressively down in size, until the last curls were in the smalls.  With as much hair as I have, I&#x27;ll end up purchasing  supplemental sets of jumbo and large rollers, which are available separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: June 2011&lt;br /&gt;I did end up impulsively chopping it all off (what a mistake!) BUT, the rollers worked great on short hair too (so, yes, I did end up using the smaller rollers afterall).  I would DEFINITELY recommend these rollers!!!!!  You will never get the same results with those pokey hot rollers with the wires to hold them on.</li>
            <li> I love my Caruso Steam Rollers System.  It has transformed my hair into something wonderful!</li>
            <li> Takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually perfect for styling - healthy and shiny, and I usually have excellent results with all kinds of curlers. I wanted to try this product as a more healthy alternative but did not  reach the results I was looking for. I was getting the old fashioned fluffy big hair Farrah Fawcett look instead of the more modern sleek look I was going for. No matter how much I experimented with it, the result was a bit messier than desired. I believe it is the result of the moisture, as well as the softness of the foam rollers. Additionally, for someone with long and thick hair like mine, even the jumbo sized rollers are not large enough but shrink if you wrap it tightly in an attempt to get cleaner curls. It seems to be an ideal product for achieving natural looking curls without causing much damage, if you don&#x27;t mind it looking a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed from constantly frizzy hair results. I have used this product several time with different stuff added to my hair to increase chance of firm curls, but no luck. The worst was when I wanted to use it once again after 2 weeks and the steaming jar didnt work properly. Almost not at all. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love my new hairsetter. after months of thinking about buying one i finally did. I am glad i found this set. with my hair being longer than my sholders i really only needed large rollers, and medium rollers if i wanted my hair really curly. this was perfect. now i dont have a bunch of small rollers that i wont use!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products for women, but my wife doesn&#x27;t have her own account and this one deserves a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife absolutely loves this thing. Easy to use, works great. She styles her hair with big, loose curls. She comes out looking great every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She needed more of the jumbo rollers, so we ordered those separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions. If you don&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t work. The manual is very short, so read it.</li>
            <li> This is the first curling system I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I&#x27;m REALLY happy I went with this.  I have really fine, very curly hair; I blow dry it straight twice a week, but hate when it lies really flat.  The curlers gave me a full, soft, and gentle curl - looks great, and held for day two.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> wanted the big bouncy curls and thought I&#x27;d try this...it really curls quickly.  However I have lots of difficulty with the entire length of the hair getting wrapped around the sponges.  Most of the time the clip like shields hold tight...but not always! ( I had one unroll and fall into the potty! )  The sponge part seems like it will last for some time, its easy to operate and use. Storage bag is nice too.  I thought I&#x27;d buy some extra big curlers, when really I wanted the MEDIUM ones... They curl quick, and I suppose if I did it correctly would last all day..but mine just disappear before the end of the work day.</li>
            <li> As I have reached fifty my hair was not holding a curl anymore and several sets just would not give me curl.  I was thinking I probably need to get a shorter haircut to have some style.    I saw this roller set and read reviews on several sites.  Then I bought them without high hopes.  They work! I have beautiful lasting curls and I have been getting plenty of compliments.  Heating one roller at a time is so easy! I curl my hair in no time.  Also, my ends are softer than they were with irons or other roller sets.  I guess it is the steam.  I AM SO HAPPY!</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the rollers (that were in several different baggies) all had a moldy musty smell to them.  So far, soaking them in several soapy solutions hasn&#x27;t helped.  They work, but I would suggest that they be used for young girls (tweens/teens) as they don&#x27;t keep a lasting curl.  My thick hair would not hold the curl they produced. Even on my granddaughter&#x27;s fine, long hair, the curl tends to brush out  easily.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine, poker-straight hair. I got the Caruso Steam Hairsetter on QVC back in the 1980&#x27;s (?) in a desperate attempt to have pretty curls like eveyone else had, lol. Well, it worked. 15-20 years on, I STILL have that old workhorse, and it STILL curls my  hair beautifully. It is the ONLY method that works on my hair. I get nice curls and/or waves that STAY IN. With no frizzies, either. My steamer is getting a little beat around the edges, so I am purchasing a back-up. I cannot recommend this appliance more to all of you who have hair like mine. It really does work :-)</li>
            <li> I have fine wavey hair.  When I blew dry my hair with a blow dryer, it always looked dry and frizzed.  It was very frustrating because it took a long time to do.    After using the Caruso Professional Steam Hairsetter with the larger rollers, my hair was soft and gently waved.  I went to a meeting after I used the Caruso for the first time and received many compliments about my hair.  At first I didn&#x27;t know why people were commenting on my hair but then I remembered I had used my steam setter.      I would have given this product a 5 star rating but my hair does come out a little damp.  That is my only complaint as I cannot brush it until it is completely dry or it becomes frizzy.  Overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my curler set!  I still have the original one I purchased ~15 years ago, and it still works.  It&#x27;s packed away somewhere due to the fact that I have been relocating more than I planned, so I asked for one for Christmas!  I always get lots of compliments whenever I use it!  I have fine hair, but the curls last a long time.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by this steam roller system.  Lots of rollers. Nice quantity of  large rollers for people like me with long hair.  It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> if you want curls that will last for days (seriously) try caruso. Me, my mom and sister have been using caruso for over 15 years (im 24). the steam really holds the curl. i have gone through 5 caruso&#x27;s over the years- here is the trick. only put in purified water. tap water kills the machine.</li>
            <li> I have used a Caruso Professional Steam Hairsetter for many years, I still have my original one, the one where you had to add salt, &amp; it still works.   I thought it was time to upgrade to a new one &amp; it&#x27;s just like my original one, but without salt to add.  I love it and so many of my friends now own one.  It says a lot for the Caruso Professional Steam Hairsetter, when you can still purchase another one even after 10+yrs.    Thanks for making such a good product.</li>
            <li> I needed new rollers for my caruso from many,many,many years ago! Getting the entire set was a great deal!  I use the new rollers with my old caruso.  Got it in super mailing time!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 18 y/o niece, who called to thank me and to rave about this product. She couldn&#x27;t get over how quickly she could set her hair and how convenient this product is. I give it 5 stars and will buy it again as gifts for my other teen nieces and teen granddaughters.</li>
            <li> I like the curlers they give a great curl, but it does not last 2 days as promoted. I would recommend them however it takes longer to roll up your hair with these than hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used them once a long time ago when I was in theater and they really did a good job then. When I needed to curl my long, thick, coarse hair for a special event I went looking for these again. I was delighted to find them on Amazon and even happier when I got them. They worked perfectly and the curl even lasted to the next day which is unheard of for my hair. They really do leave your hair soft and in good condition and they are super easy to use. I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about my Caruso curlers.</li>
            <li> Awesome hairsetter. I&#x27;ve owned three of these over many years and really love it. The rollers stay in your hair unlike the clip kind which I dislike because they always fall out of your hair. I received this for a gift and will continue to be a dedicated Caruso customer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t curl my hair like shown</li>
            <li> This is a terrific machine, just make sure you order the right size rollers when ordering.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this type of steam setting system if you have thin hair. You will just end up with lifeless semi-damp curls that will last all of 30 seconds and then frizz.    I wonder how many of these sets end up at garage sales. You can have mine for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;the order was coming two weeks ago by boader control. They said, that the product is not conform to the EU - Legislation obout the electicity conection. I have no chance to get this product, so the boader control send it back and i wrot an mail to clarify the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now, i didn´t recived any news or money. If you can follow this storry, it will be realy helpful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards&lt;br /&gt;Peter Merkt</li>
            <li> Completely useless! My husband bought this for me as a birthday gift, and I never sent it back because we were in the process of moving to another state and my husband packed it in a box, (an unlabled box) and the time for returns passed before I found it again. Basically, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I suppose if your hair is BABY fine, then it might do SOMETHING, but basically it&#x27;s a completely useless product, and a huge waste of time because it doesn&#x27;t do anything. If I could give it negative stars I would just because it wasted my time. I think curling my hair around my finger might actually work better!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and either I am not using it right or steam is just not a good way to curl my hair. Maybe if I had thick luscious hair it would be better</li>
            <li> Had one of these a long time ago and remembered how great the curl was.  This one, while producing nice curl &amp; body, doesn&#x27;t seem to produce as defined nor long-lasting a curl as the old one. (Maybe it was the salt you used to put in the water?  Maybe it&#x27;s my older hair and/or defective memory? :P)    Either way, this product performs as stated and I always get compliments on my hair when I use this system. The steam unit heats up quickly--20 seconds and it&#x27;s pumping out steam for over 30 minutes on a full tank.  The rollers are still good quality plastic and foam, and the \\&quot;clips\\&quot; or covers fit nicely even with a lot of hair on a roller.  It takes a little practice to get layered hair on these without kinks or tangles, but I&#x27;ve found just a little twist at the end does the job.    I like that you can put your hair on these and then do other things (like apply makeup) while your curls set.  For me, it takes about the same amount of time to curl my hair with a large curling iron, but I know these rollers would be faster if I practiced more and they&#x27;re SO much better for your hair (steam &amp; foam vs. direct heat &amp; metal, plus no chance of burning your fingers, scalp, face, arm, etc.).</li>
            <li> These are perfect for fine hair that doesn&#x27;t curl with regular curling irons. These hold all day long after having them in for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this hairsetter it heats up in no time and gives a great curl. I&#x27;ve had this for a year and it still works great. To hold the curl longer you need to use hairspray.</li>
