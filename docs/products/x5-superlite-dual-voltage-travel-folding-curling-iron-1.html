    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I used it throughout England and Scotland and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I just returned from a trip to Europe and this curling iron was awesome!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m especially impressed with the quality of the cord - it doesn&#x27;t twist.  </li>
            <li>It worked absolutely perfectly.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly there and is now my go to curling iron even here in the states.</li>
            <li>PERFECT SIZE FOR WHAT I WANTED.</li>
            <li>just used the product every day for 2 weeks and was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;The quality and compact size made this a  purchase that I would recommend to any traveler.</li>
            <li>Very good curling power.</li>
            <li>It was especially easy to use in a variety of countries and because it&#x27;s 120 AND 220</li>
            <li>I bought it for the dual voltage, which worked great while traveling in Spain.</li>
            <li>This worked great in Norway.  </li>
            <li>Having dual voltage means you don&#x27;t need a converter which is great.</li>
            <li>This was one of my most valued possessions!!</li>
            <li>It was really nice not having to use the converter!  </li>
            <li>What wasn&#x27;t good was that it doesn&#x27;t have an on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be keeping it but for those who are looking for a good travel curling iron I would recommend finding one with an on/off switch.</li>
            <li>and it worked exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>I would greatly appreciate anyone&#x27;s recommendation for a better tool.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The iron works best if I use a product in my hair first (gel, spray, etc.)</li>
            <li>So glad I had this one!</li>
            <li>This is a great light weight curling iron for traveling.</li>
            <li>It is amazing for travel.</li>
            <li>So, I would bring your own plug adapter.  </li>
            <li>The folding handle is handy too.</li>
            <li>quality and it folds up nicely to conserve space.  </li>
            <li>I have longer hair and the 1\\&quot; barrel makes for a tighter curl than I&#x27;d normally want, but for travel it worked just great!</li>
            <li>I have my own adapter which I found more functional than the plug provided</li>
            <li>I travel a great deal and was looking for a dual voltage tool to curl my very straight hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe for very fine hair it would work better.</li>
            <li>Very light and convenient size for travel</li>
            <li>Heats quickly &amp; temp is good.  </li>
            <li>it was perfect but it must be for international.</li>
            <li>Have used it on a number of trips and love it.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now shopping for another curling iron (on Amazon.com of course:-)</li>
            <li>and I can blown up more curling irons than I can count.  </li>
            <li>This one worked great this year and I really appreciate the fact that there is a case with it.  </li>
            <li>It also magically does the 110/220 conversion all by itself</li>
            <li>A little pricey but what a great product for anyone that travels - worked great in Italy with adapter.....</li>
            <li>This was the most recommended dual voltage curling iron  found by web search.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had the best price with a quick order response.&lt;br /&gt;There was no similar product to purchase locally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But heats up fast and works good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Anything that falls apart this easily should not have the word &#x27;travel&#x27; in it.</li>
            <li>Heats very quickly and takes up practically no space when it&#x27;s folded up.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also for its size it curls my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to carry too.</li>
            <li>The X5 is relatively light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need two irons or a huge converter.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and folded up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous travel curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The X5 Superlite Dual Voltage Travel Folding Curling Iron was just what I wanted for light packing and no need for a converter.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a trip to France last year and worked great.</li>
            <li>This is light, compact, safe, and not expensive.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>I originally wanted this curler, but decided to purchase a cheaper straightener/curler combo instead.</li>
            <li>It is light and heated up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It IS super light weight and compact.</li>
            <li>I have extremely straight hair and most times will not hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>Love the ceramic barrel, it is gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and curls well.  </li>
            <li>and it heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>It lasted the entire trip and heated up nicely.</li>
            <li>The iron heated quickly and never got excessively hot.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work if you plug it into the &#x27;shaver only&#x27; outlets overseas (not enough power from them,) but it does work awesome in &#x27;normal&#x27; outlet.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great purchase that I will use again in the future for traveling in the UK and mainland Europe.</li>
            <li>It had an American plug, and I used it with European converters - still heated up great.</li>
            <li>It is also super slippery and my hair slides out easily, especially with my layers, but it heats ups well and put a good enough curl in for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this curling iron for my recent trip to France.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s first trip.</li>
            <li>Although I have not taken this iron on vacation yet, I tried it at home first.  </li>
            <li>In my research since purchasing this product I have discovered that many of the Conair curling irons are dual voltage so can be used internationally.  </li>
            <li>This is smaller and lighter than most irons.  </li>
            <li>I tried it out before I left to make sure it worked.  </li>
            <li>and I was so pleased to get a plug for European outlets.  </li>
            <li>I have medium-weight wavy curly hair that is super-manageable and easy to style, but this didn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was dual voltage &amp; saved space by folding in half.  </li>
            <li>Folds easily, locks open.  </li>
            <li>I used it daily in France for a month with no damage to my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>The folding design was very practical.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is very convenient.</li>
            <li>The curling iron folded up becomes really compact for packing whether in suitcase or carry on.  </li>
            <li>Took this overseas and it really heats up fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it heats up as much as my other curling iron, but that is no doubt better for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li>For short hair, a small better would have worked better for me.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough for my long hair, but good enough to fix the bangs.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, was compact, held a curl, and was very simple to use.</li>
            <li>Love the simple simple design.  </li>
            <li>A normal US curling iron even with adapter will burn up within 5 minutes (been there done that).  </li>
            <li>This folding curling iron really does not take up less space than my regular one, however it heats great and has a tip on barrel that is big enough not to burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I live on the road about 10 months out of the year for work.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for travel and love the small size after folding it.  </li>
            <li>Would DEFINITELY recommend it to others, and will DEFINITELY be using it to go with me wherever I travel to in the future :)</li>
            <li>It did not get hot enough to curl my hair</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and not worth the money.</li>
            <li>large like this one, and a smaller one as well.  </li>
            <li>I get at least 10 hours of curls with this, and more hours of waves.    </li>
            <li>I travel frequently and it was well packed.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s idiot proof (perfect for me when travelling.)</li>
            <li>However it never heats up high enough to curl my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>The only advantage may be that it folds and is a bit lighter than normal irons.  </li>
            <li>For the price I expected a little better.</li>
            <li>And the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; heat setting was only moderately hot -- enough to smooth out my hair and slightly turn the ends, but not hot enough to really fix a curl with my hair type.</li>
            <li>I was happy overall, but a little disappointed because my hair is short and it does not hold my hair tightly making it more difficult to get a good curl.</li>
            <li>It is a full size curling iron, but folds enough to take up very little space in a backpack.</li>
            <li>I found it to be hot enough and it also held my hair firmly.  </li>
            <li>The iron does not get hot enough, and the clamp is not strong enough.  </li>

            <li> I am even more disappointed now that I see how much I paid for</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like mine, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this curling iron for my recent trip to France.  The folding design was very practical.  I also didn&#x27;t have any problem with its clip &amp;#34;strength&amp;#34; -- it held small sections of hair firmly, without slipping (a common problem I&#x27;ve had with other irons).  I have pretty thick, course hair, and have always had a problem with &amp;#34;fly-away&#x27;s&amp;#34;, even with anti-frizz products.  But this iron produced the smoothest finish I&#x27;ve ever had!  My only complaint is that it does not have a variable temperature setting -- it&#x27;s either on or off.  And the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; heat setting was only moderately hot -- enough to smooth out my hair and slightly turn the ends, but not hot enough to really fix a curl with my hair type.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and curls well.  I probably should have bought the larger barrel but oh well.  Very lightweight and folded up nicely.  I used it throughout England and Scotland and it worked great!  I have my own adapter which I found more functional than the plug provided (it kept falling off - it was loose).  So, I would bring your own plug adapter.  Overall, a great purchase that I will use again in the future for traveling in the UK and mainland Europe.</li>
            <li> Great product! I used it when we went on a river boat cruise on the Rhine to the Christmas Markets.  I bought another earlier (smaller) to use in Europe; they have 210 vs 110 so with an adapter it was perfect but it must be for international. A normal US curling iron even with adapter will burn up within 5 minutes (been there done that).  diamondgirl</li>
            <li> This is a great light weight curling iron for traveling. The folding handle is handy too. I bought it for the dual voltage, which worked great while traveling in Spain. The rod is a bit too narrow for my longer hair; I&#x27;d like to have had it in a 1.5 inch. It is also super slippery and my hair slides out easily, especially with my layers, but it heats ups well and put a good enough curl in for travel. I will use it for traveling out of the country, but prefer my ceramic one for home use or local travels.</li>
            <li> I just returned from a trip to Europe and this curling iron was awesome!  Easy to use and it heats up quickly.  There&#x27;s no fussing with dials for 110 or 220 currents--just plug it in (with enclosed adapter plug).  It&#x27;s big enough for good-sized curls, but packs up compactly.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I travel a great deal and was looking for a dual voltage tool to curl my very straight hair. Currenly I use an intensely hot curling iron that does the trick but am tired of the extra weight and space of my voltage converter in my carryon bag. The X5 is relatively light and easy to use. However it never heats up high enough to curl my shoulder length hair. In addition the clamp that is to hold down hair as you roll it lifts up at the tip end causing hair to fall away and not curl at all. This makes it a very long process before all my hair is curled. I would return the X5 but can not find another dual voltage curling iron that is hotter. I would greatly appreciate anyone&#x27;s recommendation for a better tool.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t survive it&#x27;s first trip. The part that holds the &#x27;hair-holding&#x27; arm to the barrel fell off and disappeared somewhere between Chicago and Manchester. When I pulled it out of my well-padded suitcase the piece was vanished into the oblivion and the iron was useless. I wasn&#x27;t going to be back in time to return it for a refund so I just threw it out. Total waste. I went back to my $25 curling iron from Target that doesn&#x27;t fold, but is dual-voltage and survived dozens of flights worldwide in every imaginable packing nightmare, including being fastened to the outside pocked of a checked hiking backpack with stretchy hairtyes. Anything that falls apart this easily should not have the word &#x27;travel&#x27; in it.</li>
            <li> I hesitated about buying such an expensive curling iron for a long time.  It is definitely worth it!  Heats very quickly and takes up practically no space when it&#x27;s folded up.  I&#x27;m especially impressed with the quality of the cord - it doesn&#x27;t twist.  In fact, I like it so much that I&#x27;ve started using this as my everyday curling iron.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have medium-weight wavy curly hair that is super-manageable and easy to style, but this didn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted this curler, but decided to purchase a cheaper straightener/curler combo instead. That item was terrible. I returned it and decided to pay a premium for this product. It heated up quickly, was compact, held a curl, and was very simple to use. I took it on one business trip to date and it worked exceptionally well. It&#x27;s pricey, but save your time, money and disappointment from buying something cheaper and get this. It&#x27;s a gem!</li>
            <li> I used this recently in Europe.  It was especially easy to use in a variety of countries and because it&#x27;s 120 AND 220 you don&#x27;t need two irons or a huge converter.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well and is easy to use. I&#x27;m not sure that the folding handle makes it easier to pack but I don&#x27;t think it is a disadvantage.  Time will tell if it keeps working with 220 volts.  My others have burned up after a short period of time(not this brand)</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I live on the road about 10 months out of the year for work.  It&#x27;s hard to travel with everything you need.  This product folds down and comes with a carrying case so the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled on everything in the luggage.  Also for its size it curls my hair easily.  I have extremely straight hair and most times will not hold a curl.  I get at least 10 hours of curls with this, and more hours of waves.    The only con I have is that there is no temperature setting.</li>
            <li> Purchased this curling iron for a recent trip to Europe.  I liked the fact that it was dual voltage &amp; saved space by folding in half.  What wasn&#x27;t good was that it doesn&#x27;t have an on/off switch.  It heats up when you plug it in &amp; stays on.  I forgot to unplug it once &amp; burned my hand.  Since I will only be using it for travel I&#x27;ll be keeping it but for those who are looking for a good travel curling iron I would recommend finding one with an on/off switch.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel and love the small size after folding it.  I don&#x27;t think it heats up as much as my other curling iron, but that is no doubt better for my hair anyway. The iron works best if I use a product in my hair first (gel, spray, etc.)</li>
            <li> Fabulous travel curling iron.  Folds with little bag. Takes up very little suitcase space.  Have used it on a number of trips and love it.</li>
            <li> This worked great in Norway.  It was really nice not having to use the converter!  The iron heated quickly and never got excessively hot.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Not as compact as I would like when it is folded in half but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Folds easily, locks open.  Heats quickly &amp; temp is good.  Pouch is too stiff, resists the drawstring.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.  I used it daily in France for a month with no damage to my fine straight hair. Easy to carry too. I recommend getting this one which will last.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a trip to the Tuscan countryside, this was chosen in hope that it might work given the poor electrical current available. It worked absolutely perfectly. I may keep this in my bathroom and not just for travel. Very good curling power. Extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> Although I have not taken this iron on vacation yet, I tried it at home first.  If you have thick hair like mine, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl it.  Also , it has a very slick barrel which doesn&#x27;t hold the hair tightly.  In my research since purchasing this product I have discovered that many of the Conair curling irons are dual voltage so can be used internationally.  The only advantage may be that it folds and is a bit lighter than normal irons.  Investigate before making this purchase!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a backpacking trip to Europe. We were gone for 3 1/2 weeks, of which time we traveled to 10 different countries. This was one of my most valued possessions!! It is a full size curling iron, but folds enough to take up very little space in a backpack. I used it a LOT! It lasted the entire trip and heated up nicely. It had an American plug, and I used it with European converters - still heated up great. Would DEFINITELY recommend it to others, and will DEFINITELY be using it to go with me wherever I travel to in the future :)</li>
            <li> A little pricey but what a great product for anyone that travels - worked great in Italy with adapter.....</li>
            <li> After ruining a curling iron and rollers in Germany I finally decided to order something with dual voltage. It works perfectly there and is now my go to curling iron even here in the states.</li>
            <li> I was happy overall, but a little disappointed because my hair is short and it does not hold my hair tightly making it more difficult to get a good curl. For the price I expected a little better.</li>
            <li> I bought it for use in Ireland, Britain, and Scotland.  Hopefully it will work there.  Can you tell me if it will.</li>
            <li> Love the simple simple design.  This is smaller and lighter than most irons.  Wish there was an automatic switch off when accidentally left on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Despite mixed reviews, I purchased this curling iron for a 10 day trip to Italy.  It was significantly smaller than my usual curing iron.  I found it to be hot enough and it also held my hair firmly.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve bought a wider barrel iron. But heats up fast and works good.  Just the wrong size, need at least a 1 1/2\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last year for use only with traveling.  When I tried to use it on my most recent trip, I found it missing a hinge which renders it totally useless.  I was very disappointed as I remember that it worked very well last year.  I am even more disappointed now that I see how much I paid for it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering another dual voltage curling iron.  It won&#x27;t be this one!</li>
            <li> We travel internationally a few times a year and, after purchasing this unit I packed it for our next trip.  The second time I used it a part snapped off (the part that holds your hair when you roll it).  I finally got it back on and it worked for about 6 weeks and fell off again.  Upon closer examination, there is a crack in the unit.  Unfortunately we no longer have the sales slip and even worse -- we didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.  I&#x27;m now shopping for another curling iron (on Amazon.com of course:-)</li>
            <li> I bought this in December 2014 and have used it about 6 times for traveling.  The plastic piece that holds the gripper on it has already broke so now its useless.   I am getting no response from the seller</li>
            <li> PERFECT SIZE FOR WHAT I WANTED. NOT BEEN TO EUROPE YET TO TRY OUT.</li>
            <li> This is light, compact, safe, and not expensive. It takes a little bit longer to heat up, but not so slow.&lt;br /&gt;Although I hove one for home, these days, I use it at home. It is very convenient.</li>
            <li> This folding curling iron really does not take up less space than my regular one, however it heats great and has a tip on barrel that is big enough not to burn your fingers. Love the ceramic barrel, it is gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> This was the most recommended dual voltage curling iron  found by web search.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had the best price with a quick order response.&lt;br /&gt;There was no similar product to purchase locally.&lt;br /&gt;I just used the product every day for 2 weeks and was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;The quality and compact size made this a  purchase that I would recommend to any traveler.</li>
            <li> The X5 Superlite Dual Voltage Travel Folding Curling Iron was just what I wanted for light packing and no need for a converter.</li>
            <li> Very light and convenient size for travel but it had no heat control. It did not get hot enough to curl my hair so I had to return it. Maybe for very fine hair it would work better.</li>
            <li> We travel internationally every year and I can blown up more curling irons than I can count.  This one worked great this year and I really appreciate the fact that there is a case with it.  I would definitely purchase it again.  My only recommendationn is that it be offered in 2 barrell sizes . . . large like this one, and a smaller one as well.  For short hair, a small better would have worked better for me.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this traveling folding curling iron. It worked well on my recent trip. I only wish I could control the temperature. It does not get hot enough for my long hair, but good enough to fix the bangs.</li>
            <li> The curling iron folded up becomes really compact for packing whether in suitcase or carry on.  It is light and heated up quickly.  Having dual voltage means you don&#x27;t need a converter which is great.</li>
            <li> It IS super light weight and compact. It is amazing for travel. It also magically does the 110/220 conversion all by itself so it&#x27;s idiot proof (perfect for me when travelling.) I just took it on a trip thru Spain, UK and Italy and it worked like a champ in all 3 countries. It won&#x27;t work if you plug it into the &#x27;shaver only&#x27; outlets overseas (not enough power from them,) but it does work awesome in &#x27;normal&#x27; outlet. I only wish they made one in a larger barrel. I have longer hair and the 1\\&quot; barrel makes for a tighter curl than I&#x27;d normally want, but for travel it worked just great!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to the poor reviews of this item.  The iron does not get hot enough, and the clamp is not strong enough.  I have wasted $50, and would return the item if I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the receipt.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as another reviewer. The part that secures the curling bar broke on the second trip. I travel frequently and it was well packed. It is cheaply made and not worth the money. Do not buy this unless assurances are made that the quality has improved.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip to France last year and worked great. Looking forward to taking it to Italy this year. A friend brought a curling iron that was not dual voltage and it caught fire and melted! So glad I had this one!</li>
            <li> I have had this product since Feb 2015. I have used it maybe 5 times. The last time I used it the clip that holds your hair broke off . Horrible  !!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to take to France.  I tried it out before I left to make sure it worked.  Used it all over France and it worked perfectly!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality and it folds up nicely to conserve space.  If you are traveling, this is a must.</li>
            <li> Took this overseas and it really heats up fast and I was so pleased to get a plug for European outlets.  Didn&#x27;t have any issues except I am a real klutz with a curling iron, but hair didn&#x27;t look too bad.</li>
