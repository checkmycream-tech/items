            <li>Although I can&#x27;t really say that my pores look that much smaller</li>

            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my problematic skin smooth and clear and it has a nice clean scent. It is a great product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Works very well! This takes a lot longer than standard retinols to work since it&#x27;s a lower concentration, but in return for your patience you will not have to worry about as much peeling or redness as you would from others. Within a week of use I noticed my sebaceous filaments (the &#x27;blackheads&#x27; on my nose) had lightened and turned white. I had a little peeling and redness on my eyelids, but nothing some lotion couldn&#x27;t fix. I liked this because it combines several products that are often sold separately (lotion, retinol and chemical exfoliant) into one easy to use, hydrating formula. The price is also a LOT cheaper per oz than some of the bigger skin care names! All in all, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.  A little goes a long way.  Would prefer it having sun block in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled to find a nice moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t over-dry or irritate my skin, this works great.  Been using it 4 month and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> I used ur when I was younger and it worked well on my pores I had a severe acne outbreak and my pores opened once again when I moved to a warmer climate after resolving three acne break out I returned to using this poduct and it has been such a help in restoring my complexion closing my pores and giving me a more youthful look couldn&#x27;t be note pleased with the results this time I will continue using it as a staple in my skin care</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I wear it under my makeup. It is really a great product. You only need a pea sized amount for your entire face. This is my favorite moisturizer to wear under makeup, better than any primer or moisturizer I have tried before. I&#x27;m 33 with combination, blemish prone skin, if that helps anyone... I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  Wish they had the one with sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works fantastic. In 3 days my pores were dramatically smaller</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market. Nothing works better for smooth, wrinkle free, flawless skin.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite moisturizer came back to life!!!  This product was discontinued for years and Neutrogena brought it back with a few minor tweeks.  Looks, feels and smells the same as the original.  Best product to even out skin and minimize pores.  Also keeps my skin pimple free!!!  Definitely stock up!</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any improvement.</li>
            <li> I use this after exfoliating and it really works to help diminish pore size. A little is all you need.</li>
            <li> Pros: does the job well,  You will notice that you have smaller and firmer skin&lt;br /&gt;cons: expensive &amp; you need to use sunscree,  as a result you&#x27;re layering things on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the daily moisturizer with spf and that worked just as well but was just a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t really say that my pores look that much smaller, I do like the feel of it and use it like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. Makes matters worse.</li>
            <li> Great does as ad says.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product ! Really reduces pores and improved the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li> A very small tube, 1 oz, a bit pricey for the amount.</li>
