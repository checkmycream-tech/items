            <li>Tressa Watercolors Shampoo - Warm Spice 8.5 oz]]</li>
            <li>I used \\&quot;Warm Spice\\&quot; and all I can say is thank</li>
            <li>and it looked nice</li>
            <li>-- so I stopped using that and revisited my relationship with the Warm Spice.</li>
            <li>This shampoo adds beautiful golden tones to my medium warm blond hair.  </li>
            <li>I use is a salon professional brand and is really excellent and doesn&#x27;t fade or change tone, I still feel compelled to use a colored shampoo just to ensure my color</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If this does not break out my skin, it will be a perfect ten.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair a perfect strawberry blonde color.</li>
            <li>So glad I came across this product.  </li>
            <li>But after one wash most of the strawberry/copper lowlights washed out.</li>
            <li>Love love love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t top the compliments I receive on my hair.</li>
            <li>I never have to dye my hair again :)</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair with a rich, warm color - it enhances my current color beautifully!  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try my luck one more time because Warm Spice seemed to be the one I should have purchased originally anyway..</li>
            <li>I used to always use the Warm Spice for my strawberry blonde hair, which I LOVED!</li>
            <li>is amazing and well worth ever penny</li>
            <li>I  have used Watercolors for years &amp; strongly recommend them to anyone needing a color boost or looking to play with color without a drastic change.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells really good considering it has dyeing agent in it, and it makes my hair feel SO soft!</li>
            <li>it will stain and look pretty goofy.</li>
            <li>So, I wanted to add more light tones of true red and copper, so I purchased Warm Spice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product shipped to me in great condition, and I really like the product in general.</li>
            <li>It has made my color so much more vibrant without darkening it at all and has evened out my pourous ends</li>
            <li>It gives you that nice warm &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; - Color lasts few days though.</li>
            <li>But I now have what I would call a bright golden blonde.</li>
            <li>So lucky artec stopped making their color depositing shampoo</li>
            <li>, rich lather, no need to condition) and thought maybe there was no difference in my hair color with use, only because the color was too close to my own.</li>
            <li>This did from the first use!</li>
            <li>This time for a little more oomph I decided to buy the Liquid Copper along with Warm Spice &amp; mix the 2~</li>
            <li>Both product lines are sulfate free and very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I smooth a good conditioner directly onto my sudsy hair for a few more minutes.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing - it makes my strawberry blond hair coloring last until I need to do my roots.  </li>
            <li>It works as well as Artec, my old favorite line (which has been discontinued and is now cost prohibitive) of colored shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo that would enhance my hair color and had tried Blond Brilliance lathering toner in warm tones but didn&#x27;t get the results I&#x27;d hoped for (actually it had no noticeable effect</li>
            <li>always looks fresh.  </li>
            <li>I actually do a 50/50 mix of this color, Warm Spice and then also the Molten Bronze in this brand for my shampoo</li>
            <li>Have fun with playing around with it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use this one on its own for extra brightening.</li>
            <li>I thought this shampoo might help warm it back up, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I am a bit disapointed that Warm Spice only imparted gold/yellow tones to my hair.</li>
            <li>I stopped going to the salon for highlights a few months ago and using watercolors has been a nice, much more inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li>Product is worth the price and the price does not blow my budget.</li>
            <li>I actually liked the actual shampoo</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and soft and the color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Richly pigmented and really lasts.</li>
            <li>This color is exactly what the package says it is, golden copper.</li>
            <li>shampoo normally with hot water to remove any buildup then smooth in a generous squeeze of this(don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I think the conditioner really seals the color in because after this one shower my hair is noticeably brighter healthier and just glowing with a beautiful auburn tint and my hair looks way better than any expensive trip to the salon.</li>
            <li>I usually work up a good lather and suds it up massaging it into my scalp and hair for 2-3 minutes, then I wring some of the suds out (it bubbles quite a bit for me) and then apply my conditioner directly over the top of the shampoo creating a mask.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t color my hair but this kicks up my natural strawberry blonde to a more copper and looks more realistic than all the &amp;#34;Angela Chase&amp;#34; style temporary reds I see at CVS.</li>
            <li>I also tried Ted Gibson colored conditioner, which did absolutely nothing, nada!</li>
            <li>Now, as she continues to use it, her hair is definitely more strawberry than blonde but she loves the look.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is exactly the color I&#x27;ve been looking</li>
            <li>I bought this to spice up my light gold highlights and natural ash brown hair.</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>The product looked exactly like it would do just that</li>
            <li>so I either mix it with another, more hydrating shampoo or a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>and this shampoo did EXACTLY</li>
            <li>It did however stain my towels and bathroom tile grout pretty well!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So this is what I entered as a review when I first tried this product: &amp;#34;I am a natural strawberry blonde whose hair, now that I am in my 50&#x27;s, has lost some of its warm reddish hue (although not quite gray).</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great subtle change without the salon trip and expense.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week or every third shampoo, which seems to be often enough for good results.  </li>
            <li>I tried that one on its own first, but it was too dark.</li>
            <li>The color is soft, nice and gives me highlights until the next washing.</li>
            <li>My hair was a pale bleach blonde that I had recently dyed over with a light reddish blonde (loreal&#x27;s 8RB to be exact) and it was nearly perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I like to mix this color with Molten Bronze to get a color I really like.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t appear to do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Purchased through Amazon because price is reasonable and couldn&#x27;t find it in the metro Denver</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much....  </li>
            <li>A light strawberry blonde, without any brown or auburn to it.</li>
            <li>, I want light red/copper blonde.</li>
            <li>I am really trying for</li>
            <li>My hair feels very silky and shiny and conditioned...</li>
            <li>Overall Warm spice is very pretty, but not exactly what I was going for.  </li>
            <li>It really does both tone and add a bit of color to keep your hair looking very even between colorings.</li>
            <li>haha)  </li>
            <li>Work into a gentle lather throughout your head but don&#x27;t scrub too much into your scalp</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference if you use it 2 - 3 times a week, every week.  </li>
            <li>So far I love this stuff, I sometimes do second wash with the reds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using L&#x27;Oreal 9GR Light Reddish Blonde but wanted something to extend those applications and keep my color vibrant.  </li>
            <li>While it was a rich color, Im totally over it now.</li>
            <li>I bought the Warm Spice, hoping it would add more of a light copper/red and strawberry tone to my pale slightly strawberry blonde hair color.</li>
            <li>but it looks very natural and left my hair soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who dye their hair red, we know how quickly it fades out.</li>
            <li>And I bought this shade mainly based on that reviewers results.</li>
            <li>And makes my hair look healthy and a little shiny.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted all of my hair to have a little more of an orange/strawberry tint</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used it for a long time (just got busy &amp; forgot to re-order) &amp; my hair got sun bleached a very light blonde from spending so much time in the sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying at all and leaves my hair very shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>But it is a bright gold/saffron toned blonde now, with only the slightest hint of copper left over from the Loreal dye I recently used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead but had a stylist put a little more color in it to brighten it up.</li>
            <li>so they match the color at my new growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead but the older</li>
            <li>Now I look like a very natural red-head.  </li>
            <li>I wash with my regular shampoo first - then again with Tressa - then conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My red hair is hard to take color, so Tressa Watercolors is wonderful to touch up the roots and has me coloring less often!</li>
            <li>It turned it a light copper which is a little darker than my strawberry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am really trying to avoid red hair care products that contain blue-based reds that have that purple/burgundy look that may turn my hair pinkish or purplish.  </li>
            <li>I keep trying the pigmented shampoos thinking maybe they will add back some color subtlely (not yet ready to commit to outright coloring my hair).</li>
            <li>I mix with my favorite thick shampoo or conditioner for a easier application and wash of color.</li>
            <li>Now I can have vibrant red hair between salon visits!!!</li>
            <li>for!&lt;br /&gt;Having colored my hair red for years, and recently lightened it from an 8-7 copper in Schwartzkopf Igora Royal color to 9-7 (extra light copper blonde)</li>
            <li>For the past two it has been a light, vibrant copper red.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it necessary too often because the color deposited really does hold up through multiple washes, dries and styling sessions in my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(To note: I have dirty blonde hair with golden blonde highlights throughout and prefer the natural look the warm spice color leaves me with.)  </li>
            <li>This is my secret weapon and I highly recommend this warm spice shade if you want just a touch of red without the commitment of &amp;#34;real dye&amp;#34; or even just to slowly build towards committing to strawberry blonde, light auburn or anything bordering the reds.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>the natural ginger blonde look these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to maintain their coppery red hair or refresh an auburn without it turning pink, over depositing or becoming dull like some color depositing shampoos can do.</li>
            <li>Colorwise, it gives the most subtle red tones to my strawberry blonde hair.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about this product is that it seems very drying when you first rinse it out, so a moisturizing conditioner is a must.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>hair is 1/2 dyed and 1/2 undyed (growing it out) and I was looking to help bring out my natural red undertones in my strawberry blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to add a reddish tint to my dark blonde hair, and it really works!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a brilliant &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; look, but it&#x27;s definitely a healthy look!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Barely made a difference and what little it did faded fast.</li>
            <li>Especially the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li>Still subtle but definitely gave me my ginger back :) doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as long as I use a lot of conditioner after.</li>

            <li> I usually work up a good lather and suds it up massaging it into my scalp and hair for 2-3 minutes, then I wring some of the suds out (it bubbles quite a bit for me) and then apply my conditioner directly over the top of the shampoo creating a mask.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair but this kicks up my natural strawberry blonde to a more copper and looks more realistic than all the &amp;#34;Angela Chase&amp;#34; style temporary reds I see at CVS.</li>
            <li> I also tried Ted Gibson colored conditioner, which did absolutely nothing, nada!</li>
            <li> Now, as she continues to use it, her hair is definitely more strawberry than blonde but she loves the look.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is exactly the color I&#x27;ve been looking</li>
            <li> I bought this to spice up my light gold highlights and natural ash brown hair.</li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> The product looked exactly like it would do just that</li>
            <li> so I either mix it with another, more hydrating shampoo or a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> and this shampoo did EXACTLY</li>
            <li> It did however stain my towels and bathroom tile grout pretty well!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> So this is what I entered as a review when I first tried this product: &amp;#34;I am a natural strawberry blonde whose hair, now that I am in my 50&#x27;s, has lost some of its warm reddish hue (although not quite gray).</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great subtle change without the salon trip and expense.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week or every third shampoo, which seems to be often enough for good results.  </li>
            <li> I tried that one on its own first, but it was too dark.</li>
            <li> The color is soft, nice and gives me highlights until the next washing.</li>
            <li> My hair was a pale bleach blonde that I had recently dyed over with a light reddish blonde (loreal&#x27;s 8RB to be exact) and it was nearly perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I like to mix this color with Molten Bronze to get a color I really like.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t appear to do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased through Amazon because price is reasonable and couldn&#x27;t find it in the metro Denver</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much....  </li>
            <li> A light strawberry blonde, without any brown or auburn to it.</li>
            <li> , I want light red/copper blonde.</li>
            <li> I am really trying for</li>
            <li> My hair feels very silky and shiny and conditioned...</li>
            <li> Overall Warm spice is very pretty, but not exactly what I was going for.  </li>
            <li> It really does both tone and add a bit of color to keep your hair looking very even between colorings.</li>
            <li> haha)  </li>
            <li> Work into a gentle lather throughout your head but don&#x27;t scrub too much into your scalp</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference if you use it 2 - 3 times a week, every week.  </li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff, I sometimes do second wash with the reds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using L&#x27;Oreal 9GR Light Reddish Blonde but wanted something to extend those applications and keep my color vibrant.  </li>
            <li> While it was a rich color, Im totally over it now.</li>
            <li> I bought the Warm Spice, hoping it would add more of a light copper/red and strawberry tone to my pale slightly strawberry blonde hair color.</li>
            <li> but it looks very natural and left my hair soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who dye their hair red, we know how quickly it fades out.</li>
            <li> And I bought this shade mainly based on that reviewers results.</li>
            <li> And makes my hair look healthy and a little shiny.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted all of my hair to have a little more of an orange/strawberry tint</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used it for a long time (just got busy &amp; forgot to re-order) &amp; my hair got sun bleached a very light blonde from spending so much time in the sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying at all and leaves my hair very shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> But it is a bright gold/saffron toned blonde now, with only the slightest hint of copper left over from the Loreal dye I recently used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead but had a stylist put a little more color in it to brighten it up.</li>
            <li> so they match the color at my new growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead but the older</li>
            <li> Now I look like a very natural red-head.  </li>
            <li> I wash with my regular shampoo first - then again with Tressa - then conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My red hair is hard to take color, so Tressa Watercolors is wonderful to touch up the roots and has me coloring less often!</li>
            <li> It turned it a light copper which is a little darker than my strawberry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am really trying to avoid red hair care products that contain blue-based reds that have that purple/burgundy look that may turn my hair pinkish or purplish.  </li>
            <li> I keep trying the pigmented shampoos thinking maybe they will add back some color subtlely (not yet ready to commit to outright coloring my hair).</li>
            <li> I mix with my favorite thick shampoo or conditioner for a easier application and wash of color.</li>
            <li> Now I can have vibrant red hair between salon visits!!!</li>
            <li> for!&lt;br /&gt;Having colored my hair red for years, and recently lightened it from an 8-7 copper in Schwartzkopf Igora Royal color to 9-7 (extra light copper blonde)</li>
            <li> For the past two it has been a light, vibrant copper red.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it necessary too often because the color deposited really does hold up through multiple washes, dries and styling sessions in my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (To note: I have dirty blonde hair with golden blonde highlights throughout and prefer the natural look the warm spice color leaves me with.)  </li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon and I highly recommend this warm spice shade if you want just a touch of red without the commitment of &amp;#34;real dye&amp;#34; or even just to slowly build towards committing to strawberry blonde, light auburn or anything bordering the reds.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> the natural ginger blonde look these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to maintain their coppery red hair or refresh an auburn without it turning pink, over depositing or becoming dull like some color depositing shampoos can do.</li>
            <li> Colorwise, it gives the most subtle red tones to my strawberry blonde hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it seems very drying when you first rinse it out, so a moisturizing conditioner is a must.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> hair is 1/2 dyed and 1/2 undyed (growing it out) and I was looking to help bring out my natural red undertones in my strawberry blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to add a reddish tint to my dark blonde hair, and it really works!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a brilliant &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; look, but it&#x27;s definitely a healthy look!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Barely made a difference and what little it did faded fast.</li>
            <li> Especially the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> Still subtle but definitely gave me my ginger back :) doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as long as I use a lot of conditioner after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two different Tressa Watercolors now and they really do the trick to brighten up dull colors.</li>
            <li> So I tried another Tressa Watercolors which was called &amp;#34;Liquid Copper&amp;#34;: even though it came out of the bottle traffic cone orange, it actually turned my hair an unnatural pink with regular use!</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair with dirty blonde roots</li>
            <li> Another review of this product said it turned her natural dirty blonde hair a strawberry/orange blonde, which was exactly the effect I was going for.</li>
            <li> I alternate this shampoo with Pureology Hydrating Shampoo every other time</li>
            <li> and I was forced into trying something new by this product</li>
            <li> I had to color every 4 weeks, which gets expensive quickly.</li>
            <li> This can be a little drying especially if I leave it in to get the color</li>
            <li> Been using it for years on my natural hair color to get rid of the dull drab look.</li>
            <li> My color now looks like it did in my late teens, early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> We figured that finding a tinted shampoo with some red in it would counteract the green.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky and soft, the lather was quite luxurious, and I have subtle copper streaks appearing with just two uses.</li>
            <li> results that don&#x27;t come out orangy orange or pink!  </li>
            <li> I wash,(which is about every other day), and I use Pureology Hydrating Conditioner with every wash.</li>
            <li> Every other color depositing shampoo I tried either did nothing, made my hair an unnatural color, or I couldn&#x27;t find one to match my shade.</li>
            <li> I have natural strawberry-blonde hair that was looking a little dull.</li>
            <li> It almost looked PINK when I dabbed a little of it on my skin, so there was no way I was going to put that on my head and run the risk of having pink hair.</li>
            <li> and although the color lasts like crazy and stays vibrant, adding a colored shampoo to my routine actually enhances the shade.  </li>
            <li> Red is so hard to maintain, but the Watercolors Shampoo makes it 10x easier.</li>
            <li> however (small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> It is very very subtle, but if you shampoo twice in one shower it still gives a very natural, noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo daily for a month, I thought I may have detected a subtle improvement in the color, but I think I was deluding myself as</li>
            <li> a little trick I&#x27;ve learned if your cuticles and the skin under your nails is stained at all from any dyes,</li>
            <li> I have worn that dark purple-red hair color in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll leave it on for just a few minutes at the time and adjust my times and how often I use it as needed.  </li>
            <li> I do suggest leaving the shampoo in a few minutes longer than the bottle suggests, however.</li>
            <li> When looking for such a product, I&#x27;m always afraid of getting the fake looking cool red shades, and unfortunately, that&#x27;s what I got with the Tressa &amp;</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past two months and it still looks like I just got it colored.</li>
            <li> scrubbing a little baking soda with a nailbrush/toothbrush helps a lot a lot without drying it out the way nail polish remover or bleach will!!</li>
            <li> I rinsed it, dried it and was shocked to see that it had stripped my color and was VERY blonde.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first color depositing shampoo I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it adds subtle color without dying it.</li>
            <li> Subtle and blends well.</li>
            <li> You WONT get dramatic change to your hair - I can almost guarantee that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, so long as you purchase the product with the correct exectations you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Whoever made the comment that color depositing shampoos do not work on virgin/un-dyed hair is just silly.</li>
            <li> All the dyes and toners that Ive used before this have come out so wrong</li>
            <li> Will stain hands, tub, shower curtain, so do mist Lysol or cleanser containing a bleaching agent after use to prevent awful orange stains in your shower and shower curtain liner!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo adds beautiful golden tones to my medium warm blond hair.  I leave it on for about 10-15 minutes while I finish my shower and it adds the perfect amount of color.  It works as well as Artec, my old favorite line (which has been discontinued and is now cost prohibitive) of colored shampoos.  I color my hair myself using Wella Koleston Perfect and although the color lasts like crazy and stays vibrant, adding a colored shampoo to my routine actually enhances the shade.  I was looking for a shampoo that would enhance my hair color and had tried Blond Brilliance lathering toner in warm tones but didn&#x27;t get the results I&#x27;d hoped for (actually it had no noticeable effect but it smells divine!). I also tried Ted Gibson colored conditioner, which did absolutely nothing, nada! Continuing my search led me to Tressa.  I read the excellent reviews and decided to try it and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s not drying at all and leaves my hair very shiny and soft.  I use it about once a week or every third shampoo, which seems to be often enough for good results.  Although the hair color I use is a salon professional brand and is really excellent and doesn&#x27;t fade or change tone, I still feel compelled to use a colored shampoo just to ensure my color always looks fresh.  This shampoo is definitely a hit for me.  I heartily recommend it.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a product to mask the effects of chlorine on my daughter&#x27;s blonde hair. We figured that finding a tinted shampoo with some red in it would counteract the green. This did from the first use! Now, as she continues to use it, her hair is definitely more strawberry than blonde but she loves the look.</li>
            <li> Richly pigmented and really lasts. I mix with my favorite thick shampoo or conditioner for a easier application and wash of color. Only drawback is product can stain hands and shower/tub if residue not washed off immediately. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Whoever made the comment that color depositing shampoos do not work on virgin/un-dyed hair is just silly. Do you think that the color pigments can seek out color treated hair and cling to them? No, it&#x27;s going to deposit pigments either way. The key is to use the product correctly. Read the label - do as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is 1/2 dyed and 1/2 undyed (growing it out) and I was looking to help bring out my natural red undertones in my strawberry blonde hair. I use this shampoo 2x per week as instructed and it&#x27;s definitely done that! I think it&#x27;s a great subtle change without the salon trip and expense. You WONT get dramatic change to your hair - I can almost guarantee that. This isn&#x27;t a hair dye - it&#x27;s just a pigmented shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, so long as you purchase the product with the correct exectations you wont be disappointed! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is exactly the color I&#x27;ve been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;Having colored my hair red for years, and recently lightened it from an 8-7 copper in Schwartzkopf Igora Royal color to 9-7 (extra light copper blonde) I&#x27;ve been desperately trying to find some kind of color-depositing shampoo/conditioning treatment/anything to help maintain my color between salon visits since Schwartzkopf discontinued the color mousse I&#x27;d been relying on several months ago.&lt;br /&gt;  When looking for such a product, I&#x27;m always afraid of getting the fake looking cool red shades, and unfortunately, that&#x27;s what I got with the Tressa &amp;#34;Liquid Copper&amp;#34; shampoo. It almost looked PINK when I dabbed a little of it on my skin, so there was no way I was going to put that on my head and run the risk of having pink hair. After perusing the Tressa Watercolors website, I found a chart with all of the shampoos and the recommended shades for each hair color. I thought I&#x27;d try my luck one more time because Warm Spice seemed to be the one I should have purchased originally anyway.. And I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;  This color is exactly what the package says it is, golden copper. It has made my color so much more vibrant without darkening it at all and has evened out my pourous ends so they match the color at my new growth. My only complaint about this product is that it seems very drying when you first rinse it out, so a moisturizing conditioner is a must.&lt;br /&gt;  Otherwise, I am soooo please with this shampoo and will be using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Love it. Been using it for years on my natural hair color to get rid of the dull drab look. It was recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I have copper/deep strawberry blonde dyed hair and this shampoo as been a godsend for perserving the brightness of my color. It adds just enough color to refresh and not over saturate my hair. I actually do a 50/50 mix of this color, Warm Spice and then also the Molten Bronze in this brand for my shampoo and I&#x27;m getting PERFECT  results that don&#x27;t come out orangy orange or pink!  I alternate this shampoo with Pureology Hydrating Shampoo every other time I wash,(which is about every other day), and I use Pureology Hydrating Conditioner with every wash. Both product lines are sulfate free and very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to maintain their coppery red hair or refresh an auburn without it turning pink, over depositing or becoming dull like some color depositing shampoos can do.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it adds subtle color without dying it. I like to mix this color with Molten Bronze to get a color I really like. Have fun with playing around with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to spice up my light gold highlights and natural ash brown hair. In the shower I did two shampooing sessions, each for about 5 minutes. My hair feels silky and soft, the lather was quite luxurious, and I have subtle copper streaks appearing with just two uses. If this does not break out my skin, it will be a perfect ten. Here&#x27;s hoping. What a great product!</li>
            <li> Barely made a difference and what little it did faded fast.</li>
            <li> I used to always use the Warm Spice for my strawberry blonde hair, which I LOVED! It is very very subtle, but if you shampoo twice in one shower it still gives a very natural, noticeable difference. I hadn&#x27;t used it for a long time (just got busy &amp; forgot to re-order) &amp; my hair got sun bleached a very light blonde from spending so much time in the sun. This time for a little more oomph I decided to buy the Liquid Copper along with Warm Spice &amp; mix the 2~ I used it 3 times in one shower for an immediate color pay off. Still subtle but definitely gave me my ginger back :) doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as long as I use a lot of conditioner after. I  have used Watercolors for years &amp; strongly recommend them to anyone needing a color boost or looking to play with color without a drastic change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead but had a stylist put a little more color in it to brighten it up. I have been using this shampoo for the past two months and it still looks like I just got it colored. This keeps my hair a perfect strawberry blonde color. It&#x27;s shiny, soft and manageable. I usually work up a good lather and suds it up massaging it into my scalp and hair for 2-3 minutes, then I wring some of the suds out (it bubbles quite a bit for me) and then apply my conditioner directly over the top of the shampoo creating a mask. It rinses clean and soft and the color is fantastic. I will definitely continue using.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo because my highlights were a bit pale.&lt;br /&gt;It really works! It gives you that nice warm &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; - Color lasts few days though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair some shade of red for 4 years. For the past two it has been a light, vibrant copper red. For those of us who dye their hair red, we know how quickly it fades out. I had to color every 4 weeks, which gets expensive quickly. Every other color depositing shampoo I tried either did nothing, made my hair an unnatural color, or I couldn&#x27;t find one to match my shade. I mix this color with some of the Liquid Copper shade, and it&#x27;s perfect! I tried that one on its own first, but it was too dark. Now I use 3/4 this one and 1/4 liquid copper for the perfect shade. Sometimes I use this one on its own for extra brightening. I rinse my hair, lather up, and put a shower cap on it for longer than they suggest - about 8-10 minutes. It&#x27;s perfect! Now I color every 5-6 weeks and this keeps it looking great in between appointments.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t appear to do much for my hair. I have natural strawberry-blonde hair that was looking a little dull. I thought this shampoo might help warm it back up, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> So glad I came across this product.  I had no idea it existed until a couple of months ago.  Purchased through Amazon because price is reasonable and couldn&#x27;t find it in the metro Denver area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This suds up a LOT.  You don&#x27;t need much....  I leave it in for about 7 or 8 minutes, then rinse and condition.  Leaves my hair with a rich, warm color - it enhances my current color beautifully!  And makes my hair look healthy and a little shiny.  It&#x27;s not a brilliant &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; look, but it&#x27;s definitely a healthy look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT for touch-ups about once a week.  Also purchased the Liquid Copper and mix it with this Warm Spice.  Another Amazon reviewer had said she uses these 2 colors together and I&#x27;m glad she mentioned that because it really is a beautiful mix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!  (And it doesn&#x27;t leave any stains in my tub or on my clothes.)</li>
            <li> I bought the Warm Spice, hoping it would add more of a light copper/red and strawberry tone to my pale slightly strawberry blonde hair color. The product looked exactly like it would do just that when I squeezed a tiny bit out on a q-tip. It looked red/orange. But, when I used it in in the shower on my hair, it lathered and rinsed out a deep yellow saffron color, without even the slightest hint of copper or red to it at all. My hair was a pale bleach blonde that I had recently dyed over with a light reddish blonde (loreal&#x27;s 8RB to be exact) and it was nearly perfect for what I wanted. A light strawberry blonde, without any brown or auburn to it. But after one wash most of the strawberry/copper lowlights washed out. So, I wanted to add more light tones of true red and copper, so I purchased Warm Spice. I am a bit disapointed that Warm Spice only imparted gold/yellow tones to my hair. I may re-order Tressa in a different color, I want light red/copper blonde. I am really trying to avoid red hair care products that contain blue-based reds that have that purple/burgundy look that may turn my hair pinkish or purplish.  I have worn that dark purple-red hair color in the past. While it was a rich color, Im totally over it now. I am really trying for the natural ginger blonde look these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product shipped to me in great condition, and I really like the product in general. My hair feels very silky and shiny and conditioned... But it is a bright gold/saffron toned blonde now, with only the slightest hint of copper left over from the Loreal dye I recently used. Another review of this product said it turned her natural dirty blonde hair a strawberry/orange blonde, which was exactly the effect I was going for. And I bought this shade mainly based on that reviewers results. But I now have what I would call a bright golden blonde. Overall Warm spice is very pretty, but not exactly what I was going for.  Does anyone have a suggestion of which color I should try to re-order?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Review of: [[ASIN:B004LH13QI Tressa Watercolors Shampoo - Warm Spice 8.5 oz]]ld try to re-order?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Review of: [[ASIN:B004LH13QI Tressa Watercolors Shampoo - Warm Spice 8.5 oz]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead but the older I get the blonder my hair gets.  I&#x27;ve started using L&#x27;Oreal 9GR Light Reddish Blonde but wanted something to extend those applications and keep my color vibrant.  I used \\&quot;Warm Spice\\&quot; and all I can say is thank goodness I tested this out on a sample of hair that isn&#x27;t seen unless I pile my hair up on my head. I applied it as directed, left it on for approx. 10 mins (others had recommended 15 mins and the bottle says 2-3).  I rinsed it, dried it and was shocked to see that it had stripped my color and was VERY blonde.  No trace of red was left at all.  I&#x27;m returning it and may try a different shade, if so I&#x27;ll update this post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/15/14 Update!  I purchase Liquid Copper, did a test strand and it looked nice so I went ahead and applied to my hair, lathered well and left on for 10 mins.  It&#x27;s BEAUTIFUL!!!  It turned it a light copper which is a little darker than my strawberry blonde but it looks very natural and left my hair soft and healthy.  My color now looks like it did in my late teens, early 20&#x27;s and I LOVE it!  Going forward I&#x27;ll leave it on for just a few minutes at the time and adjust my times and how often I use it as needed.  I changed my rating from a 1 to a 4.  The only reason I&#x27;m not going with a 5 is because the colors are not what they say in the description.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this color!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good considering it has dyeing agent in it, and it makes my hair feel SO soft! Colorwise, it gives the most subtle red tones to my strawberry blonde hair. Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two different Tressa Watercolors now and they really do the trick to brighten up dull colors. I stopped going to the salon for highlights a few months ago and using watercolors has been a nice, much more inexpensive alternative. I do suggest leaving the shampoo in a few minutes longer than the bottle suggests, however. Especially the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> Now I can have vibrant red hair between salon visits!!! YAY! This stuff is great. It really does both tone and add a bit of color to keep your hair looking very even between colorings. Red is so hard to maintain, but the Watercolors Shampoo makes it 10x easier. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love love love this shampoo. Will stain hands, tub, shower curtain, so do mist Lysol or cleanser containing a bleaching agent after use to prevent awful orange stains in your shower and shower curtain liner!! As for the product, have been using it 2 or 3 times a month the last two years and I adore it. So lucky artec stopped making their color depositing shampoo and I was forced into trying something new by this product is amazing and well worth ever penny and then some. One bottle will last you 3-6 months depending on hair length/ frequency. I don&#x27;t find it necessary too often because the color deposited really does hold up through multiple washes, dries and styling sessions in my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo normally with hot water to remove any buildup then smooth in a generous squeeze of this(don&#x27;t overdo it or you will risk orange hair haha)  from just before my roots to he ends. Work into a gentle lather throughout your head but don&#x27;t scrub too much into your scalp bc it will stain and look pretty goofy. (To note: I have dirty blonde hair with golden blonde highlights throughout and prefer the natural look the warm spice color leaves me with.)  Let the sudsy lather sit 5 minutes then I smooth a good conditioner directly onto my sudsy hair for a few more minutes. Rinse with the coolest water you can tolerate. I think the conditioner really seals the color in because after this one shower my hair is noticeably brighter healthier and just glowing with a beautiful auburn tint and my hair looks way better than any expensive trip to the salon. Can&#x27;t top the compliments I receive on my hair. This is my secret weapon and I highly recommend this warm spice shade if you want just a touch of red without the commitment of &amp;#34;real dye&amp;#34; or even just to slowly build towards committing to strawberry blonde, light auburn or anything bordering the reds.&lt;br /&gt;Also a little trick I&#x27;ve learned if your cuticles and the skin under your nails is stained at all from any dyes, scrubbing a little baking soda with a nailbrush/toothbrush helps a lot a lot without drying it out the way nail polish remover or bleach will!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Hope it never  gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to add a reddish tint to my dark blonde hair, and it really works!  Now I look like a very natural red-head.  I have gotten a lot of complements!</li>
            <li> This can be a little drying especially if I leave it in to get the color so I either mix it with another, more hydrating shampoo or a deep conditioner. I don&#x27;t color my hair but this kicks up my natural strawberry blonde to a more copper and looks more realistic than all the &amp;#34;Angela Chase&amp;#34; style temporary reds I see at CVS. (that&#x27;s burgundy for those of you who weren&#x27;t My So-Called Life fans)</li>
            <li> Subtle and blends well.</li>
            <li> I wash with my regular shampoo first - then again with Tressa - then conditioner.  The color is soft, nice and gives me highlights until the next washing.</li>
            <li> Definitey gives my hair color some umpf without drying it out. Product is worth the price and the price does not blow my budget.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - it makes my strawberry blond hair coloring last until I need to do my roots.  Friends have noticed how bright the color remains, even weeks after I dyed it.  I recommended the brand to a friend who colors with a brighter, darker red and she loves it to.  It really makes a difference if you use it 2 - 3 times a week, every week.  I also don&#x27;t shampoo every shower - sometimes I just condition.</li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff, I sometimes do second wash with the reds. It&#x27;s the first color depositing shampoo I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I use it once or twice a week. Use it two days in a row and gives the best color.</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair with dirty blonde roots and I wanted all of my hair to have a little more of an orange/strawberry tint and this shampoo did EXACTLY what I wanted it too! All the dyes and toners that Ive used before this have come out so wrong and this shampoo is just PERFECT. I never have to dye my hair again :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent to use in between coloring.  My red hair is hard to take color, so Tressa Watercolors is wonderful to touch up the roots and has me coloring less often!</li>
            <li> So this is what I entered as a review when I first tried this product: &amp;#34;I am a natural strawberry blonde whose hair, now that I am in my 50&#x27;s, has lost some of its warm reddish hue (although not quite gray). I keep trying the pigmented shampoos thinking maybe they will add back some color subtlely (not yet ready to commit to outright coloring my hair). After using this shampoo daily for a month, I thought I may have detected a subtle improvement in the color, but I think I was deluding myself as even my hair stylist didn&#x27;t think there was a difference. It did however stain my towels and bathroom tile grout pretty well!&amp;#34;  This was the &amp;#34;Warm Spice&amp;#34; hue. I actually liked the actual shampoo however (small amount goes a long way, rich lather, no need to condition) and thought maybe there was no difference in my hair color with use, only because the color was too close to my own. So I tried another Tressa Watercolors which was called &amp;#34;Liquid Copper&amp;#34;: even though it came out of the bottle traffic cone orange, it actually turned my hair an unnatural pink with regular use! -- so I stopped using that and revisited my relationship with the Warm Spice. Someone wrote in a review that you can&#x27;t expect a pigmented shampoo to make any difference on untreated hair, but I beg to differ. I am sticking with the Warm Spice!</li>
            <li> great for in between color jobs as hair begins to fade a bit</li>
