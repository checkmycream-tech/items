            <li>I can say without a doubt that my search for the best safety razor blade is over.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;Switching</li>
            <li>I have had great experience with these Bic blades.</li>
            <li>These are great razor blades.  </li>

            <li>great</li>
            <li>These seem to be good blades.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>The Bic comes in good plastic packages&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think these are as good as any of those.</li>
            <li>Good quality and a steal of a price.</li>
            <li>They work fine, but need to adjust to the sharpness of the blade through time, they do work great for many shaves, great for though beards</li>
            <li>I use Proraso shaving soap and the glide is nice.</li>
            <li>though, the BICs are the best razors that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>They were ok but just not for me.</li>
            <li>these work great with my Merkur 38d and Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving</li>
            <li>I can attest to these blades being plenty sharp, yet perfect for the novice D.E. user that I am.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades seem fine, they&#x27;re just not for me.</li>
            <li>I end up with a remarkably smooth, comfortable shave.    </li>
            <li>Fantastic blades for the money.</li>
            <li>Gives me a close and comfortable shave without nicks for five days.  </li>
            <li>but if you haven&#x27;t found a kind of blade you really like yet maybe give these a try.</li>

            <li>The bic cuts cleanly, but doesn&#x27;t scrape my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but WOW, these are nice.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but after using Feather blades, there&#x27;s no comparison.  </li>
            <li>Great product..very sharp.</li>
            <li>Just&lt;br /&gt;be aware that it requires precise technique with your razor.  </li>

            <li> I read all the positive reviews for a good, sharp blade and was very disappointed when I received a poor shave from these blades.</li>
            <li> and i have a heavy beard (and was also careful to dry, then towel-strop the blade before putting away)...</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other razor blades</li>
            <li> I order online (Personna) do not seem nearly as sharp as these.  </li>
            <li> All the other brands I tried gave me razor bumps and rash.</li>

            <li> I nearly cried out in pain with the first swipe because it pulled and tugged so hard without cutting any hairs.</li>
            <li> They are sharp but dont cut up your face, and they also arent dull enough to tug on your hairs.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re consistently sharp, and very sharp at that.</li>
            <li> These are supposedly ranked below the super sharp Feather blades which rank the best/highest amongst double edge blade users.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades but don&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> That is not true for Feather or Astra blades which are&lt;</li>
            <li> I shave with a Parker 99R long handle and these seriously caused tears to come to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was using feather and cutting myself way to much.  </li>
            <li> go crazy and buy tons of these until you really see if you like them, though.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few blades in my Merkur 34c</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used probably two-dozen different brands of DE blades in the last few years, and these are the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried -- by far.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I manage to shave with no nicks, but usually I end up with a few small cuts.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I ordered these I instead received a 20-blade sampler pack, five each of four different brands.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy Brutus type beard.</li>
            <li> No more cartridges!</li>
            <li> Maybe I received some duds, but they all appear to be of the same bad quality.</li>
            <li> No good for me.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful all around</li>
            <li> These pulled horribly in my razor.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Some that were included in this case were duds. All they did was pull the hair instead of shaving it. Other than that though, the BICs are the best razors that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I have had great experience with these Bic blades. After sampling a half dozen major brands these are the ones I settled on. Very sharp, very smooth. The only blades I know of that are any sharper are Feathers, which can give me just the very slightest degree of razor burn. So Bic wins! Unfortunately when I ordered these I instead received a 20-blade sampler pack, five each of four different brands. Not even close. There&#x27;s no way of knowing if this listing is faulty somehow, or if the problem was with the person or process that fulfilled the order. And then when I attempted a return, the process kicked me out saying this was a special case and I needed to contact (Amazon) customer service. ? Mistakes happen. All that remains is to see how well this situation is resolved.  I will revisit this review shortly with an update.</li>
            <li> These are great razor blades.  I have not been able to find any platinum double edge razor blades locally recently.  The other razor blades I order online (Personna) do not seem nearly as sharp as these.  I use them for cutting my and my husband&#x27;s hair, and these are much better at cutting easily without pulling.</li>
            <li> I just switched to a safety razor a couple years ago after the cost of disposable cartridges became onerous.  After buying two of the blade samplers and spending a lot of time bleeding, these blades consistently came back up to the top of the heap.  I end up with a remarkably smooth, comfortable shave.    (Fearing that some of my trouble with other blades was technique I did go back and re-try everything and reconfirmed my findings.)    This may be something that&#x27;s person particular so I&#x27;d recommend picking up one or two of those sampler packs of different blades if you&#x27;re starting out.  But frankly, I&#x27;d be surprised if you don&#x27;t end up using these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for over a year now.  Lots of learning and trying different products along the way. These blades were part of a 10 different brand \\&quot;starter\\&quot; pack and I ended up sold on them. They&#x27;re consistently sharp, and very sharp at that. I don&#x27;t see myself trying anything else in the future and have now gone through 3 more boxes without a single issue or regret. Highly recommend the bic blades.</li>
            <li> Purchased these blades based upon several online reviews.  Husband is a &#x27;beginner&#x27; DE razor shaver. His first shave can attest to the sharpness of these blades. ;) He tried other blades since then and has come back to and now prefers these.  Great product..very sharp.</li>
            <li> They work fine, but need to adjust to the sharpness of the blade through time, they do work great for many shaves, great for though beards</li>
            <li> These blades are far sharper than the Astra blades that I was previously using. Be careful. These have sliced through the wax paper as I was pulling them out. Fantastic blades for the money.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and arrived on time.  Price is excellent.  In my opinion the blades could be sharper.  I have returned to a Mach3 shaving system.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of different blades since I just went back to using double edged blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I understand it, different blades for different folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem fine, they&#x27;re just not for me.</li>
            <li> Im still not sure if I love these or not.  I was using feather and cutting myself way to much.  I get a little too much tug on the big but I think that&#x27;s my fault</li>
            <li> These seem to be good blades. I get about three or four shaves from one blade before I feel the need to change. I have very heavy Brutus type beard. I use Proraso shaving soap and the glide is nice. These are slightly less aggressive than the Feather razors I have used but sharper and more comfortable than the other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> New to using a safety razor. Got one for my birthday in March and didn&#x27;t care much for the Merkur blades that came with my Merkur razor. These BIC razors are much sharper but don&#x27;t cause irritation. Great blades!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and bought these blades for comparison.  Not bad, but after using Feather blades, there&#x27;s no comparison.  All the other brands I tried gave me razor bumps and rash.</li>
            <li> If you can get them like myself here in Cambodia for around 30 US cents (for one pack of five), these Greek made blades might be an option. However if you expecting a quality like Feather, Lord or Merkur go shop somewhere else. You will be disappointed. I would NEVER buy them at the price they are listed here.</li>
            <li> Gives me a close and comfortable shave without nicks for five days.  But with all products like this, YMMV.  I use this with Proraso and a Gillette Adjustable</li>
            <li> I tried probably 15 or 20 different types of blades before I settled on this one as my go-to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go crazy and buy tons of these until you really see if you like them, though.  I recommend a sampler pack that has a bunch of blades to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me these work great with my Merkur 38d and Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a coarse beard with about medium density/thickness.  This blade is a nice sweet spot between too sharp and too dull.  I find that blades like Feathers are TOO sharp for me and leave me with razor burn.  Gillette blades seem to tug and pull on the hairs.  The bic cuts cleanly, but doesn&#x27;t scrape my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this will all vary for you depending on a lot of factors.  Skin type, beard type, shaving technique, razor selection, soap/cream selection, etc...  It all takes a lot of tinkering to get just right.</li>
            <li> I tried a few blades in my Merkur 34c but WOW, these are nice. You could use a new one everyday at this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used probably two-dozen different brands of DE blades in the last few years, and these are the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried -- by far. I nearly cried out in pain with the first swipe because it pulled and tugged so hard without cutting any hairs. Thinking it was just a manufacturing flaw, I tried two other blades in the same pack, but they were all the same. I even tried switching razors, using with my Gillette NEW, my Gillette Tech, and my Merkur 34C. Awful all around; I never made it through one pass on one cheek. I&#x27;m not kidding, I actually retrieved from the trash a Gillette Silver Blue blade which I&#x27;d used for four previous shaves and used it instead of these. Then I disposed of the whole pack of Bic Chrome Platinums.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades but don&#x27;t irritate. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brand of safety razor over the years and had been using the Merkur blades before trying these. I can say without a doubt that my search for the best safety razor blade is over. They are sharp but dont cut up your face, and they also arent dull enough to tug on your hairs. Between this and Welda shaving balm, I have finally stopped getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> No good for me. The blades don&#x27;t pair well with my murkur barber pole causing a ton of pulling due due the large gap between blade and razor.</li>
            <li> The Bic razor certainly has to be the sharpest razor next to the Feather.  It cuts well, but somehow,&lt;br /&gt;I manage to nick my face every time I use it.  That is not true for Feather or Astra blades which are&lt;br /&gt;likewise sharp.  So I am assuming that something is amiss with the blade itself.  I have been shaving&lt;br /&gt;several months now, so I don&#x27;t think it is my technique. If you can handle the Bic, go for it.  Just&lt;br /&gt;be aware that it requires precise technique with your razor.  The Bic comes in good plastic packages&lt;br /&gt;and is wrapped simply and well.  Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> These pulled horribly in my razor.  Purchased in a multi pack and I tossed them away.  It was like shaving with a rake.  I shave with a Parker 99R long handle and these seriously caused tears to come to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Wilkinson, Merkur, Feather, Derby, and now these blades. I think these are as good as any of those. They&#x27;re pretty sharp, not quite as sharp as Feathers, but pretty sharp. And they hold an edge decently. I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are not the typical blades that are recommended by sampler packs across the double edge blade selection. I do not understand why as these are terrific. These are supposedly ranked below the super sharp Feather blades which rank the best/highest amongst double edge blade users. I can attest to these blades being plenty sharp, yet perfect for the novice D.E. user that I am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different kinds of DE blades, and everyone likes something different, but these blades are currently the best I have tried. Maybe I&#x27;ll find something I like more at some point down the road but if you haven&#x27;t found a kind of blade you really like yet maybe give these a try.</li>
            <li> a bit over priced and over hyped IMHO... i got about 4 shaves out of blade and i have a heavy beard (and was also careful to dry, then towel-strop the blade before putting away)... i won&#x27;t order these again but will instead go with made-in-the-USA Personna blades (much better quality, especially the Personna surgical prep double-edge blades from Robbins Instruments - cheaper too!)</li>
            <li> Good quality and a steal of a price. No more cartridges!</li>
            <li> Double edge razor blades are a very personal item.  A blade that works well for one person may not work at all for someone else.  Having said that, these blades work great for me.  They are very sharp.  They don&#x27;t pull my hair.  Sometimes I manage to shave with no nicks, but usually I end up with a few small cuts.  I work around that by shaving before I go to bed at night.  That way the nicks can heal before I go to work.  I get a close enough shave with these blades that my face stays smooth until the following evening.</li>
            <li> I tired one of the samples sets with many different blades and there where several I liked a lot, among them where these Bic Chrome blades which for my skin type work great - I&#x27;m very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;Switching to a double edge razor has saved much money - the price of those other blades is crazy, so going back to basics can be a good thing.</li>
            <li> I am only giving these blades two stars for the fact that they are very forgiving for those with poor technique. I read all the positive reviews for a good, sharp blade and was very disappointed when I received a poor shave from these blades. They tugged at my facial hair and would not deliver a close shave. Maybe I received some duds, but they all appear to be of the same bad quality.</li>
            <li> They were ok but just not for me. I prefer feather blades because they are sharper.</li>
