            <li> I just received them, these rods feel kind of flimsy but once again I have not used them yet, so I cannot testify on its quality and performance just yet. I will re-write a review once I use them. Just wanted to let everyone know that the feel to it, may be a concern, but let me test them out and I will let you ladies know.</li>
