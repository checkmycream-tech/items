            <li>Makes him feel sexy.</li>
            <li>the scent just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>this is the favorite men fragrance, for years now.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this product its his favorite.</li>
            <li>A gift for my dad and he love it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and it is a great price for both items.</li>
            <li>Joop is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne and is quickly becoming mine as well.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the aftershave that I was familiar with is no longer made!</li>
            <li>It was a good deal and fast also.</li>
            <li>The smell is very sweet and strong</li>
            <li>When you spray it on you,the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the smell is strong and peculiar, but i have been told i wear it</li>
            <li>(this one has a strong presence, not a scent that goes</li>
            <li>never found the price this cheap.</li>
            <li>I wondered why he would want something so cheap, now I know.</li>
            <li>Was excited for the price.</li>
            <li>It is the only cologne he uses and with the after shave he loved it</li>
            <li>i placed a very large order and this was the first item i received!!</li>
            <li>I suggest you go out to the mall and try different brands and see which one works the best with your body&#x27;s chemistry, then come back to Amazon</li>
            <li>set includes a bottle with a regular screw off cap for &amp;#34;splashing&amp;#34; and one with a spray top, which I prefer as it release a more evened amount of liquid.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is manly and exciting and always elicits compliments wherever I go.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and smells exactly like I remembered it.</li>
            <li>people would notice right away.</li>
            <li>It has just the right combination of fragrance and musk.</li>
            <li>I previously brought it for them before, and they loved it.</li>
            <li>I have read many places online that one is enough).  </li>
            <li>First use broke my neck out severely within minutes.  </li>
            <li>This item was delivered on time and it was exactly what it said it would be.</li>
            <li>so i got on here, ordered this for only $40 for more than double the amount plus free after shave.</li>
            <li>Not as fresh as when bought new in stores.</li>
            <li>i like to have a large selection of cologne to choose from, and this is always a favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The after shave and cologne set made it all the better as I also purchased some DE wet shaving equipment for him to try as well.  </li>
            <li>Really fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much of a smell to it.  </li>
            <li>As this is one of his top two favorite colognes, I almost couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Joop brand previously, mainly the aftershave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>So I normally wear somewhat of a cheaper scent.</li>
            <li>It was new.</li>
            <li>so while at the store me and my girl looked for something new.</li>
            <li>I live in the UK and this was a gift for my son-in-law who lives in the US.  </li>
            <li>and I know that the one I got from Amazon does not smell as strong and last as long - although this perfume is rated extremely high on longevity and sillage.</li>
            <li>, almost candy-like, which can be too much for those who prefer more delicate smells</li>
            <li>He was so surprised at the price, given what the department store wanted.</li>
            <li>I remember my old bottle of hoop where it&#x27;d stay on me all day and</li>
            <li>Old spice/</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sure to be different for everyone, but I usually need two sprays to smell it(though</li>
            <li>I took some meds for swelling, and about two days later was normal again.  </li>
            <li>This is completely a question of taste, as it&#x27;s clearly not for everyone.</li>

            <li> This is completely a question of taste, as it&#x27;s clearly not for everyone.</li>
            <li> the first time I wore Joop was back in the late nineties.</li>
            <li> But for some reason it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> been using this stuff for a long time havn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> like any cologne/perfume, it will smell different on each person who tries it.</li>
            <li> I just learned to use it mildly, otherwise I can accidentally choke poor people who share closed spaces with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this solely due to pricing compared to local sources.</li>
            <li> I wish I could just open the spray when done, fill it with the liquid in the other bottle and use it again.</li>
            <li> Its a shame, I like something that&#x27;ll last not only for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I was only asked for one of the items, but when I saw that I could have 2 in a gift box for very little extra, I chose the gift box.  </li>
            <li> one little spray on my clothes is still stuck from last night.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> The product I was sent was nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> now my wife doesnt like other girls turn around when i pass</li>
            <li> and when he opened the box there was only the small bottle of Joop.</li>
            <li> I paid for a gift set &amp; got a single small bottle.</li>
            <li> all much less topped off with the cologne.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t exactly describe the scent, but I can say it drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> that time, I have tried a few other &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; colognes, but nothing has gotten a response, from both women &amp; men, like Joop!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying this for my little brother and for my brother in law.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little musty.</li>
            <li> for Men for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> There is very little difference between what they call the aftershave and the Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li> What I got was the small bottle of Joop.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the spray cap is not removable and is sealed tight to the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s joop, but not really a great deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just me or if this bottle is a fake.</li>
            <li> to go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I did not get what I ordered!!</li>

            <li> I used to pay up to $60 in a perfume shop for this combination of Joop. The fragrance is manly and exciting and always elicits compliments wherever I go. This is a great deal on a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Best Cologne i&#x27;ve ever used. i use this since 1994 same effect on Women. now my wife doesnt like other girls turn around when i pass</li>
            <li> smells great she realy loves it thank you</li>
            <li> I ordered this set as a gift. What I got was the small bottle of Joop. If I had enough time I would have sent it back. I paid for a gift set &amp; got a single small bottle. This supplier seems to have a history of doing this. As I just read a review that said the same thing to that person. Why is this supplier still allowed to sell on Amazon?</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my kids as a fathers day present and when he opened the box there was only the small bottle of Joop. I am very disappointed that I did not get what I ordered!!</li>
            <li> I received the product as shown in the picture. Everything was excellent.   It was new. I got it just in time.  I&#x60;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love when my husband wears to this is a great source since it is rarely found in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift but the box a was damaged</li>
            <li> I bought the joop as a present for my partner and he loves it. Thank you !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satistfied and so is he so we are appreciate your delivery</li>
            <li> }I like a good product I do not like this written about it while I taste my god both muy bueno tya no quiero escrivir mas</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s joop, but not really a great deal. I can just purchase at local store for same price</li>
            <li> I love this set. My wife and daughter gave me Joop! for my birthday several years ago, and I&#x27;m hooked on this. My favorite after shave and cologne. Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this solely due to pricing compared to local sources. This is a great buy for anyone that likes this product and I will reorder as needed</li>
            <li> THIS WAS THE BEST I LOVEED IT  YOU  LOOKED OUT ............ THINK YOU SO MUSH  YOU WAS MY BEST FRIEND LIKE IT</li>
            <li> because the price is right and this is very good stuff. been using this stuff for a long time havn&#x27;t never found the price this cheap.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s fav and the prices was the best around.  He was so surprised at the price, given what the department store wanted.</li>
            <li> I got conned into ordering this for a friend that was supposed to pay me back.  The fact that he did not is indicative of his character and the quality of this cologne.  I wondered why he would want something so cheap, now I know. It smells like an air wick coupled with mid-life despair.</li>
            <li> i placed a very large order and this was the first item i received!! i love it and he will love it when he opens it for christmas! i will go to purchase more items through this seller.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my purchase. I will be more than happy to do business again !!!</li>
            <li> I must say that I love this cologne. But for some reason it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. When you spray it on you,the smell is strong. But after 30 minutes you can&#x27;t smell it anymore. I remember my old bottle of hoop where it&#x27;d stay on me all day and people would notice right away. I don&#x27;t know if its just me or if this bottle is a fake. Its a shame, I like something that&#x27;ll last not only for a few minutes</li>
            <li> It was a good deal and fast also.</li>
            <li> One does not write to tell about Joop. Instead, one wears it and let&#x27;s others whom they encounter talk about Joop.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> My favorite scent on my husband. And what a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent price, I can say more, since I know I can not help but have a bottle and now after shave</li>
            <li> After wearing &amp;#34;Polo&amp;#34; by Ralph Lauren for 10 years, I decided it was time for a change.. that&#x27;s when I found Joop!..&lt;br /&gt;That was over 10 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;In that time, I have tried a few other &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; colognes, but nothing has gotten a response, from both women &amp; men, like Joop! has.&lt;br /&gt;Women cuddle up close when we meet just to get a sniff of my neck (the girlfriend hates that, but insists I still stick with Joop!) and men constantly ask me what I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joop! is a blend of cinnamon, jasmine, honey, tobacco, and vetiver (a perennial grass) scents, a refined &amp; woody smell considered &amp;#34;oriental&amp;#34; in classification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like any cologne/perfume, it will smell different on each person who tries it. I suggest you go out to the mall and try different brands and see which one works the best with your body&#x27;s chemistry, then come back to Amazon once you know what works best to get the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This same set cost almost double at my local department store!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;The price and product&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift for my dad&lt;br /&gt;He was so happy once he opened his gift ...</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores. Not as fresh as when bought new in stores. But, my husband likes it.</li>
            <li> Got this set yesterday and it&#x27;s perfect and definitely genuine and not a fake. one little spray on my clothes is still stuck from last night. I highly recommend this set. the first time I wore Joop was back in the late nineties.</li>
            <li> A great price &amp; product!</li>
            <li> This gift was for my son in law and he loves it, good price.</li>
            <li> Cologne:3 stars&lt;br /&gt;It is sure to be different for everyone, but I usually need two sprays to smell it(though I have read many places online that one is enough).  It lasts about 4 hours before fading, and by 6 hours it is gone.  I get the same results regardless of spraying it on my neck, chest, or wrists.  The smell is nice.  A bottle this size if used every day will last you about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aftershave:1 star&lt;br /&gt;Just not something I&#x27;ll be using again.  First use broke my neck out severely within minutes.  I took some meds for swelling, and about two days later was normal again.  There wasn&#x27;t much of a smell to it.  I gave it to my father, and he has had a better experience with it than me.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Joop! for Men for a few years now.  My wife loves it, and the scent gets a lot of compliments from others as well.  A quality product and at a great value found here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Did not get what I ordered. I sent back the 1oz. that I received and they refunded the money. It was supposed to be a gift. Was excited for the price. But did not turn out. Just a hassle for nothing.</li>
            <li> great deal for the price.loved it..</li>
            <li> was a gift to my nephew!!! his neice saw the package and love the scent and wanted one for her dad.  will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> So I normally wear somewhat of a cheaper scent. Old spice/ stetson.&lt;br /&gt;But I was out and so while at the store me and my girl looked for something new. came across this and she fell in love with it, but it was like $50 for a 2oz bottle. yeah screw that. so i got on here, ordered this for only $40 for more than double the amount plus free after shave. no brainer right?&lt;br /&gt;my gal seems to want to cuddle more. so five stars in my book.</li>
            <li> Joop is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne and is quickly becoming mine as well. I can&#x27;t exactly describe the scent, but I can say it drives me crazy. It has just the right combination of fragrance and musk. I love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is one of my go-to colognes.  i like to have a large selection of cologne to choose from, and this is always a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell is strong and peculiar, but i have been told i wear it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no issues with packaging or billing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hard to go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> No tengo comentario porque fue excelente el producto Felicitaciones era lo que estaba esperando y el envió también saludos Venezuela</li>
            <li> I have used the Joop brand previously, mainly the aftershave. Perhaps the aftershave that I was familiar with is no longer made! The product I was sent was nothing like I expected. There is very little difference between what they call the aftershave and the Eau de Toilette. A huge disappointment. If Joop no longer makes the type of aftershave I am used to, then I am done with Joop.</li>
            <li> This item was delivered on time and it was exactly what it said it would be. I brought this item as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loved it! I highly recommend it and it is a great price for both items.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE.......and what a deal........last set I bought was from Neiman Marcus......pricey...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses it all the time. It is the only cologne he uses and with the after shave he loved it</li>
            <li> Good price for a set. I bought this as a gift for my friend who is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased another of this perfume as a gift to my cousin and I know that the one I got from Amazon does not smell as strong and last as long - although this perfume is rated extremely high on longevity and sillage.</li>
            <li> My husband smells so great when he wears this.  He has gotten lots of compliments when he wears it out in public.  Makes him feel sexy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying this for my little brother and for my brother in law. I previously brought it for them before, and they loved it. It smells really good, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it okay, the product is nice... the scent just isn&#x27;t my favorite. It&#x27;s a little musty. Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> No recibi el producto que compre.. Claramente hice la comprea de un Joop! Set y me enviaron un perfume Joop! De 1.0 ounce, espero repongan el producto.. Califico totalmente negativo el servicio..</li>
            <li> This is completely a question of taste, as it&#x27;s clearly not for everyone. The smell is very sweet and strong, almost candy-like, which can be too much for those who prefer more delicate smells (this one has a strong presence, not a scent that goes unnoticed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for me this is the favorite men fragrance, for years now. I just learned to use it mildly, otherwise I can accidentally choke poor people who share closed spaces with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes a bottle with a regular screw off cap for &amp;#34;splashing&amp;#34; and one with a spray top, which I prefer as it release a more evened amount of liquid. Unfortunately, the spray cap is not removable and is sealed tight to the bottle. I wish I could just open the spray when done, fill it with the liquid in the other bottle and use it again. But I guess that&#x27;s not allowed. Still, great aftershave / cologne with a distinctive smell.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my item and came just un time</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product its his favorite.</li>
            <li> I live in the UK and this was a gift for my son-in-law who lives in the US.  I was only asked for one of the items, but when I saw that I could have 2 in a gift box for very little extra, I chose the gift box.  Being able to buy fom the security of Amazon means I can buy gifts which had they been sent from the UK  customs in the US would probably not have let through!!!!</li>
            <li> A gift for my dad and he love it</li>
