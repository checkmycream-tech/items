            <li>but this one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Vera Wang is the best!</li>
            <li>I switched from Chanel Allure, another wonderful perfume that lasts for days and days after just one spray.  </li>
            <li>SO SO happy to find this perfume!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for Spring or Summer.</li>

            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, perfect for day or night &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I can no longer find it retail and am so happy there are still sellers of this product online.</li>
            <li>Great Product , Great Price</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice scent.</li>
            <li>Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom&#x27;s no longer carry this perfume in the stores, so I was very happy to be able to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Have always loved this sent</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this fragrance for years and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is light with a beautiful floral influence.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s been discontinued, I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Nice and light--not overpowering, but it stays with you.</li>
            <li>I think she liked it.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very fast and in very good conditions.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried this particular scent and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Super product &amp; super great packaging!</li>
            <li>To top it off, this item is not returnable because it is considered a flammable or hazardous item.</li>
            <li>that I know of, and have received many complements that it is a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t upset their stomach.</li>
            <li>My mom used to use this perfume but hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find this one for awhile, so</li>
            <li>If you buy this perfume, be prepared to carry the bottle around with you all day if you&#x27;re out of your home for more than 5 hours.      </li>
            <li>We have purchased this Vera Wang on many occasions, I have been wearing this for years</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like the original!</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, light and airy.  </li>
            <li>I work in medicine and wearing perfume can be a problem as patients are recovering from surgery and they can have their stomachs upset at a strong scents.  </li>
            <li>this was filled with something else to dilute the perfume.</li>
            <li>It is a light floral with hints of lemon.  </li>
            <li>Light, airy and flowery.</li>
            <li>Ok, that was good, but will it last?</li>
            <li>I love the light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I can not wear many perfumes because I am very sensitive to fragrances and they often are too strong and give me a headache</li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to find this because I think the major department stores no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>A very pretty, sweet fragrance, unparalleled by any this designer has created.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the original Vera Wang since I first found it at Harrod&#x27;s in London back in 2003.  </li>
            <li>However, now that I have worn it awhile I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t linger all day like my other favorite (Jadore).  </li>
            <li>The product&lt;br /&gt;Ct arrived timely and in new condition, but the liquid leaks out of the atomizer at the top with each spray.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as before!</li>
            <li>Just right</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Although I absolutely adore this scent, I do not think this perfume is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Thought I would never find another scent that I would like, but I found the Sheer Veil and love it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is exactly as I remember.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s certainly the real thing</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my most favorite fragrances and it is sometimes hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this scent.</li>
            <li>2 Stars for the price, if you consider how much and often you have to spray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very upset with this purchase and feel like we have been sold a bill of goods.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Is very dificult to find this in stores, so</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, much quicker than anticipated.</li>
            <li>I have worn this for years and used to pay twice as much at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It was really inexpensive and the other reviews were strong and positive, so I took the plunge.  </li>
            <li>Much more subtle than Vera Wang&#x27;s original, signature scent.  </li>
            <li>My faith in Amazon&#x27;s service is fully restored, but I would still warn others that are considering this purchase that I don&#x27;t know if the quality of the product will improve (or if mine just happened to be one bad product of many good ones).</li>
            <li>Also the cologne leaks around the cap when you spray it(it&#x27;s obviously a defective cap and more than likely the reason the perfume was 1/2 the price of dept store).</li>
            <li>I find that you have to use more of it to get it to last or carry it with you and respray later in the day.  </li>
            <li>so I bought it again recently, but was surprised at how cheap it was.</li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>It is a very light scent, with a hint of floral but no overwhelmingly floral.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is nice but does not last but a few hours.</li>
            <li>Also, while at smell similar to the REAL Vera Wang Sheer Veil, it is no means the right</li>
            <li>I normally just need to spray maybe 2 spritz and that will last ALL day.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about ordering it online, as I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be the real thing, but I got it</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is why I am noticing such a marked difference between the two.      </li>
            <li>My closet smell heavenly and I must be careful not to put too much on as not to offend anyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s arrived on time and that was positive, but when I opened the box, the liquid was green not lavender as I remember.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and the fragrance does not last as long as it should which tells me</li>
            <li> Not too harsh and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the scent just fades away in a few hours and does not smell horrible the next morning the way so many perfumes I have tried do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like smelling the same as other girls.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed immediately and considered sending it back, but it only cost $38.00, which is a only a third of what I paid that last time I purchased it from a department store years ago.</li>
            <li> That sweet pea from bath and body works and dream angels &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34; by victoria secret is everywhere!</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday and when the bottle gets low</li>
            <li> I wish the scent was a little stronger and would last a little longer.</li>
            <li> The smell is close but not right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m spraying watered down perfume.</li>
            <li> By half way through the day it is gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted customer service about this product and in less than a few hours I received a thorough response and explanation advising me that I will be reimbursed fully for my purchase and that I could dispose of the item, but not to return it for safety reasons.</li>
            <li> I do wish it lasted a little longer,though.</li>
            <li> The liquid in the bottle is green (not purple at all).</li>
            <li> When I buy an expensive perfume, I expect it to last all day if you spray some in the morning.   </li>
            <li> The nozzle came broken because it dribbles out instead of spraying out which makes a mess in your hand and also ruined the paint on my jewelry box where I place my fragrances.</li>
            <li> at least I can find it here</li>
            <li> I guess I got a bad one this time.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this Amazon purchase and my lack of options in obtaining refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not receive the product as advertised.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is nice but does not last but a few hours. Also the cologne leaks around the cap when you spray it(it&#x27;s obviously a defective cap and more than likely the reason the perfume was 1/2 the price of dept store). I would not repurchase the perfume or use the same store.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent. Since I had my son, I no longer like the Ralph Lauren perfumes I used to wear. I wish the scent was a little stronger and would last a little longer. By half way through the day it is gone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this scent. However, now that I have worn it awhile I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t linger all day like my other favorite (Jadore).  I find that you have to use more of it to get it to last or carry it with you and respray later in the day.  I would still purchase it again - and, as a matter of fact, I did.  It is a very light scent, with a hint of floral but no overwhelmingly floral.  It is not at all musky.  Nor is it cloying.  Just right</li>
            <li> Have always loved this sent</li>
            <li> The product&lt;br /&gt;Ct arrived timely and in new condition, but the liquid leaks out of the atomizer at the top with each spray. It leaves perfume on your hand and bottle. Amazon promptly refundedmy money but if anyone else has a problem with their bottle let them know.</li>
            <li> I like all of Vera Wang&#x27;s products. I hadn&#x27;t tried this particular scent and it is wonderful. Nice and light--not overpowering, but it stays with you.</li>
            <li> My mom used to use this perfume but hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores. When she saw it online she had to have it! She loves it and uses it every day</li>
            <li> It does not smell like the original!</li>
            <li> A very pretty, sweet fragrance, unparalleled by any this designer has created. I can no longer find it retail and am so happy there are still sellers of this product online. The price is awesome too!</li>
            <li> I bought this same perfume through Amazon before and did not have a problem so I bought it again recently, but was surprised at how cheap it was. Well now I know why. The liquid in the bottle is green (not purple at all). The smell is close but not right and the fragrance does not last as long as it should which tells me this was filled with something else to dilute the perfume. The nozzle came broken because it dribbles out instead of spraying out which makes a mess in your hand and also ruined the paint on my jewelry box where I place my fragrances. To top it off, this item is not returnable because it is considered a flammable or hazardous item. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this Amazon purchase and my lack of options in obtaining refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted customer service about this product and in less than a few hours I received a thorough response and explanation advising me that I will be reimbursed fully for my purchase and that I could dispose of the item, but not to return it for safety reasons. They advised they would have someone look into my complaints about this product as well. My faith in Amazon&#x27;s service is fully restored, but I would still warn others that are considering this purchase that I don&#x27;t know if the quality of the product will improve (or if mine just happened to be one bad product of many good ones).</li>
            <li> Much more subtle than Vera Wang&#x27;s original, signature scent.  Haven&#x27;t been able to find this one for awhile, so I took advantage of the find!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years and LOVE IT!  This fragrance is light with a beautiful floral influence.  I can not wear many perfumes because I am very sensitive to fragrances and they often are too strong and give me a headache but this one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the scent! It&#x27;s on you minimum 12 hours! I bought it as a present for my mom, and then I came back the next day and bought one for me as well! Vera Wang is the best!</li>
            <li> When I buy an expensive perfume, I expect it to last all day if you spray some in the morning.   Although I absolutely adore this scent, I do not think this perfume is worth the price.  I switched from Chanel Allure, another wonderful perfume that lasts for days and days after just one spray.  Perhaps this is why I am noticing such a marked difference between the two.      If you buy this perfume, be prepared to carry the bottle around with you all day if you&#x27;re out of your home for more than 5 hours.      5 stars for the scent  5 stars for the packaging  2 stars for longevity of the scent.  2 Stars for the price, if you consider how much and often you have to spray.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for me  as a Christmas present. For starters we were told that we would have this by Christmas--wrong. We got it a day later. We have purchased this Vera Wang on many occasions, I have been wearing this for years and I know how it should look and smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box the color was off. The liquid is green--not purple as it should be. Also, while at smell similar to the REAL Vera Wang Sheer Veil, it is no means the right formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very upset with this purchase and feel like we have been sold a bill of goods. We tried to return the item and this is not allowed to be return. Merry Christmas to me.......</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, perfect for day or night &#x3D;)  thanks</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent. I do wish it lasted a little longer,though. Fortunately the scent just fades away in a few hours and does not smell horrible the next morning the way so many perfumes I have tried do. Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom&#x27;s no longer carry this perfume in the stores, so I was very happy to be able to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as before! Loved it!</li>
            <li> SO SO happy to find this perfume!!</li>
            <li> Great Product , Great Price</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to find this because I think the major department stores no longer carry it.  It is a light floral with hints of lemon.  Item arrived wellpackaged, on time, and the spray works well.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Even though it&#x27;s been discontinued, I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The product arrived very fast and in very good conditions. Is very dificult to find this in stores, so I like that at least I can find it here</li>
            <li> I have always loved the original Vera Wang since I first found it at Harrod&#x27;s in London back in 2003.  Thought I would never find another scent that I would like, but I found the Sheer Veil and love it.  It&#x27;s like a wisp of fragrance and that&#x27;s all  I need!</li>
            <li> Super product &amp; super great packaging!</li>
            <li> Just received this and omg. It smells heavenly. Light, airy and flowery. Perfect for Spring or Summer. I&#x27;m in love♡</li>
            <li> I searched the entire city of Pittsburgh for this! I wear this everyday and when the bottle gets low I&#x27;ll be looking for another.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this product, because it&#x27;s online and because I thought it might not be authentic. It was really inexpensive and the other reviews were strong and positive, so I took the plunge.  It&#x27;s arrived on time and that was positive, but when I opened the box, the liquid was green not lavender as I remember. I was annoyed immediately and considered sending it back, but it only cost $38.00, which is a only a third of what I paid that last time I purchased it from a department store years ago. The next morning I put it on an it smelled the same. Ok, that was good, but will it last? Yes, it lasted the entire day and every day that I have worn it since. My closet smell heavenly and I must be careful not to put too much on as not to offend anyone. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. Not too harsh and not too soft. Just right. And I&#x27;m just about the only one around that has it. I don&#x27;t like smelling the same as other girls. That sweet pea from bath and body works and dream angels &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34; by victoria secret is everywhere!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, light and airy.  Prompt delivery, much quicker than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and used to pay twice as much at Macy&#x27;s.  The scent is exactly as I remember.</li>
            <li> When I placed my order, I received it within just a couple of days. This is by far one of my most favorite fragrances and it is sometimes hard to find in stores. I was skeptical about ordering it online, as I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be the real thing, but I got it and it&#x27;s certainly the real thing and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this parfume from 2007.  I love the light fresh scent.  I can wear it to work and not offend anyone.  I work in medicine and wearing perfume can be a problem as patients are recovering from surgery and they can have their stomachs upset at a strong scents.  I have not offended anyone yet, that I know of, and have received many complements that it is a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t upset their stomach.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift to my mother on Mothers Day. When I called her to check to see if she received she package and all she could say was &amp;#34;Ohhh wow!! this perfume is amazing!!&amp;#34;. I think she liked it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this item before from Amazon...several times! Then I got this one. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m spraying watered down perfume. I normally just need to spray maybe 2 spritz and that will last ALL day. This one I feel like I have to do maybe 5 or 6 spritzes. I guess I got a bad one this time. So disappointed!</li>
