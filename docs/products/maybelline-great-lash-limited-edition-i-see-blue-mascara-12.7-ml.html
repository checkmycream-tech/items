            <li>I will definitely order more!!!!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i have bought this product before and love it comes in a sealed container doesn&#x27;t clump and lasts all day</li>
            <li>The color is amazing and its maybelline tried and true though out the years.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to be a very bright blue.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and the quality is good as well.</li>
            <li>It does wash off easily.</li>
            <li>It is too light for me.</li>
            <li>So happy with my blue mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and the delivery was super quick</li>
            <li>Was expecting more intense colors and texture.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product at all.</li>
            <li>looks pretty dark under shade, but under light, color appears super vibrant and I love it!</li>
            <li>Glad to have different colors</li>
            <li>I get many compliments when I wear this blue!</li>
            <li>Thanks Maybelline</li>
            <li>Did not like much of a color.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my Girl who is very picky about mascara.</li>
            <li>thanks seller.</li>
            <li>I love the colors for this product, but I need a more dramatic extension.</li>
            <li>Pops particularly well if you line the lower lashes with a bronze or peachy toned liner/ shadow.</li>
            <li>so I really appreciate a mascara that offers lengthening.</li>
            <li>,I do recommend if you want to try something new</li>
            <li>So much brighter than the standard Navy Blue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually noticeably colored, it&#x27;s just disappointing because blue is not the most complimentary color for my eyes.</li>

            <li> It applies smoothly, but I don&#x27;t wear false lashes</li>
            <li> if it starts to dry out,I simply add a drop of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks pretty if you want to be subtle though.</li>
            <li> +:&lt;br /&gt;noticeably blue even on my dark eyelashes.</li>

            <li> It takes a few coats to look really blue</li>
            <li> but you have to apply coat after coat to make it thick enough.</li>

            <li> I will never use black again.  </li>
            <li> It was completely dried up.</li>
            <li> This color is really hard to find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it by itself, the formula is too thin and the mascara does not lengthen or add volume.</li>
            <li> My lashes are wimpy, this does nothing :(</li>
            <li> Real disappointed Maybelline.</li>
