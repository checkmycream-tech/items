            <li>This is a great product when my eczema acts up.</li>
            <li>this cream feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for your skin!  </li>
            <li>so I see how it would feel good to people having laser work on their face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works well and keeps skin moisturized and looking good.  </li>
            <li>another great night cream that i love.  </li>
            <li>I still like La Prairie best, but it&#x27;s  very much out of my reach.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin nice and moist</li>
            <li>So based on the fact that this cream works so great on my skin and TNS is the 5th ingredient, I say it&#x27;s worth the money if you get it on sale.</li>
            <li>And in work in fine lines!</li>
            <li>I love skin medica.</li>
            <li>And I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and moisturizers very effectively, the skin absorbs it very well.</li>
            <li>The dermatologist&#x27;s office wanted over $70 for this tube, so I was very excited to find it for $35 on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and nourishing.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy :)</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the appearance of fine line.  </li>
            <li>I might keep it as a backup while I continue to look for a product that will help with the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK moisturizer but not rally worth the money.</li>
            <li>light weight moisturizing cream that is not greasy and hydrates skin</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer and goes a long way if used in the correct amount.</li>
            <li>Works great as expected, after all it&#x27;s for post procedure.</li>
            <li>will not purchase again, but it&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only wish they made this product in a gallon size because it is so good, I need it for my whole body.</li>
            <li>Additionally i derma roll at home with a 0.5 mm roller for anti wrinkle/ collegen induction and used this cream right after.</li>
            <li>Used twice daily and your skin will be feeling better.</li>
            <li>i love the feel and smoothness of the cream and the way my facial pores absorb the cream immediately.</li>
            <li>Also the smell is ok, pleasant, but my concern now is that I want to buy the TNS complex or the essential serum</li>
            <li>Good facial product to use daily.</li>
            <li>At night, I will use just this product and it softens and hydrates your skin really, really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this treatment cream works.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper on line as opposed to the MD&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>so I guess I really like.</li>
            <li>I high recommended!  </li>
            <li>I am not used to spending this much on a skin creme though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick texture, creamy and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Please note that I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my Medi Spa after having received Laser Genesis and I was told that the TNS and peptides help with repair of skin which just underwent a professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and rosacea under treatment, this does NOT give me acne or clog my pores.</li>
            <li>My skin was very dry still weeks after my first chemical peel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to certain fragrance, this is unscented with just a little scent of the product itself which is non-offensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months.  It has a nice thick texture, creamy and not greasy.  I have been using it morning and night but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the appearance of fine line.  I pay $70 at the dermatologists - for $45 I might keep it as a backup while I continue to look for a product that will help with the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> This face lotion works for me. It seems to lesson the wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for your skin!  The dermatologist&#x27;s office wanted over $70 for this tube, so I was very excited to find it for $35 on Amazon.com.  A little goes a long way.  In the morning, I just add a small dollop to my Oil of Olay daily facial moisturizer.  At night, I will use just this product and it softens and hydrates your skin really, really well.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores or leave a greasy feeling. It&#x27;s very rich and nourishing. I have combination skin, so I use this in fall, winter, maybe spring. In the summer I use a lighter moisturizer. One tube lasts me ~3 months or so. I use it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this treatment cream works.  No scent and it feels great on my skin.  I have dry skin and this gives out the moisture it needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK moisturizer but not rally worth the money. It&#x27;s soothing &amp; thick so I see how it would feel good to people having laser work on their face.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again, but it&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try Clinique next. I still like La Prairie best, but it&#x27;s  very much out of my reach.</li>
            <li> This is a great product when my eczema acts up. Much cheaper on line as opposed to the MD&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I love skin medica. And I love this product. It gives you the heaviness of a cream, yet lightness of TNS. I have been using this for several months and it is a must have.</li>
            <li> cream is recommended by my physician.  It works well and keeps skin moisturized and looking good.  Used twice daily and your skin will be feeling better.</li>
            <li> I only wish they made this product in a gallon size because it is so good, I need it for my whole body. I would buy this again and again from this person because there were no problems getting this in a timely manor. Easy peasy :)</li>
            <li> I use this after treatment for tattoo removal.  It does wonders in healing the skin and relieving itching during healing.</li>
            <li> I started using this after getting a SkinMedica facial peel.  It is a great moisturizer and goes a long way if used in the correct amount.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin nice and moist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much this product helps my skin but I do think I&#x27;ve noticed a very small improvement, it goes on well I like the way it feels I ordered a second tube so I guess I really like.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from eBay for $35 just so I can try out one of skinmedica&#x27;s products with TNS before I shell out the big bucks for the essential serum. I must say that I am impressed. I am 30 years with combination skin and this cream feels great on my skin. It&#x27;s not greasy and moisturizers very effectively, the skin absorbs it very well. I even use it on my eye area with no problems. Please note that I do not have sensitive skin. Additionally i derma roll at home with a 0.5 mm roller for anti wrinkle/ collegen induction and used this cream right after. Works great as expected, after all it&#x27;s for post procedure. So based on the fact that this cream works so great on my skin and TNS is the 5th ingredient, I say it&#x27;s worth the money if you get it on sale. So I give it 5 stars. Also the smell is ok, pleasant, but my concern now is that I want to buy the TNS complex or the essential serum but I have a fear that it will smell bad as stated in some reviews. If you hav tried the TNS complex or serum can you comment and advice me of your opinion of the smell. Thank you 😊</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this is the best!  Price is comparable to some products but cheaper than the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Good facial product to use daily.</li>
            <li> another great night cream that i love.  i alternate with other night cream to get maximum effect.  i love the feel and smoothness of the cream and the way my facial pores absorb the cream immediately.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry still weeks after my first chemical peel. This helped the dryness and itchiness instantly. I use this product every morning and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> light weight moisturizing cream that is not greasy and hydrates skin</li>
            <li> Is one of the best, you can find! I high recommended!  The skin feels so hydrated. And in work in fine lines!</li>
            <li> This is what my dermatologist recommended after I had treatments to remove cancer and pre-cancer spots.  I like it - a little goes a long way and I can get all of it out of the tube unlike other containers.</li>
            <li> The box was so crushed  won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> Ok. But not great.  Not as moisturising as I need.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream in the cooler months of the year. It was recommended to me by my Medi Spa after having received Laser Genesis and I was told that the TNS and peptides help with repair of skin which just underwent a professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this as a facial cream at night, it&#x27;s thick and a little goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and rosacea under treatment, this does NOT give me acne or clog my pores. I am not used to spending this much on a skin creme though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to certain fragrance, this is unscented with just a little scent of the product itself which is non-offensive.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this 5 stars &#x3D; I Like It.</li>
