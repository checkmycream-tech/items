            <li>Perfect for my thin frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely great for thick, course hair</li>
            <li>My hair loves protein and I noticed immediate improvements with my first use.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and I will keep buying it unless I find something better.</li>
            <li>i like the entire line of products and many salons</li>
            <li>In the first month I had seen a miraculous change in how my hair responded.</li>
            <li>This way I know where I put it and exactly how much.</li>
            <li>ta get it my hair is super soft and shiny and still is</li>
            <li>it really shines a lot.</li>
            <li>I have very bleached hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was really shot from sun, and coloring.  </li>
            <li>It has really worked.</li>
            <li>and my hair thanks you</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its real used twice and throwing away.</li>
            <li>this reconstructs hair fast; is a leave-in product.</li>
            <li>i really dont notice a differance when i use this product</li>
            <li>it is a real hair saver.</li>
            <li>n&#x27;t that&#x27;s too much oil to wash out of it</li>
            <li>Very nice for thin hair</li>
            <li>full of bounce, shiny, silky, and the results will last all week.</li>
            <li>Safe enough to use daily and it works!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally leave a review but this leave in conditioner in combincation with the joico revitaluxe treatment</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but not a great product.</li>
            <li>So I went to a new stylist to repair the damage.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally shiny, fine with a slight &amp;#34;kink&amp;#34; in it.</li>
            <li>I tried this at first and the spray left my hair feeling gunky and tangled.  </li>
            <li>After the first use of this product I could see the difference in the quality of my hair - it actually builds onto the hair shaft to moisten and make it look healthier.</li>
            <li>protect my actual hair shaft first.</li>
            <li>I used natural products like Shea moisture and oranix on</li>
            <li>My hair had reached the dry, brittle stage after too much blow drying and hot ironing and not enough protection.</li>
            <li>Overall this spray is subtle, but effective.</li>
            <li>The scent of the product is light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Now I could easily say that was from a new color but over the month it stayed feeling like that as the color grew out and needed to be not only retouched because with the nightmare I created, it took her a few tries to get it corrected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is what I like about Joico products in general.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and barely put a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li>but apparently I needed this as well to protein</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I spray it into my hands, then work it into the ends of my hair, I don&#x27;t get too much and weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after trying its a 10 and several other products that are highly recommended.</li>

            <li> this product leaves your hair feeling very silky, but at the same time your hair feels very heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair and as with all women I blow-dry, flat iron all those things that cause damage.  </li>
            <li> This instantly detangles my hair and leaves it soft and manageable whether I&#x27;m wearing it twisted or straight.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it has a different effect when used on wet hair.</li>
            <li> It acts somewhat like a styling product giving hold or control as you blow dry.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry/almost dry hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use that I only have 3 hairs on my head it will weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from looking so dry!</li>
            <li> I went from soft, well conditioned, and pliable hair to hard, dry, and inelastic hair.</li>
            <li> Between that and blow drying a flat ironing my hair was just a mess.</li>
            <li> If I use the Mythic oil without the K-Pak spray there is not nearly as much shine.</li>
            <li> It somewhat helped but not as expected.</li>
            <li> It brings some moisture to hair but is not very silky.</li>
            <li> Recently my hair was dried and limp after spending a week in Europe without proper hair products.</li>
            <li> I returned to the US, washed my hair with a moisturizing shampoo and then applied this product alone on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Made immediate improvements in my fragile thin stranded natural hair.</li>
            <li> It is actually sort-of stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Black woman with natural hair that is very long and thick.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The Joico K-Pak Liquid Reconstructor  does not work well in combination with other shampoos and conditioners and some styling products.</li>
            <li> but every other day works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She called me the other day and said, \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am not seeing those little half inch pieces in the sink every time I use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves it silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like pineapple.   </li>
            <li> maybe i should start using this just a little.</li>
            <li> I spray it on after showering and washing and a few times during the day.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply it everyday because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> Whatever I am doing is working, there is no more breakage.</li>
            <li> my hair was hard n</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so addicted in it.</li>
            <li> is expensive.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the Joico products.</li>
            <li> This dried my hair out soooooooooo badly!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This spray works well at removing tangles and smooths out irregularities in the hair texture. It works great as a blow dry treatment. It conditions the hair and leaves a smooth texture. It acts somewhat like a styling product giving hold or control as you blow dry. I find that my hair is more straight when I use this product. I have read reviews that this spray makes their hair look shiny. I did not notice this effect when I used the product by itself. However, when I add some oil to my hair (Mythic Oil) it really shines a lot. If I use the Mythic oil without the K-Pak spray there is not nearly as much shine. This combines well with leave-in oils.   The Joico K-Pak Liquid Reconstructor  does not work well in combination with other shampoos and conditioners and some styling products. I tried this at first and the spray left my hair feeling gunky and tangled.  It really works best when used on hair that has been washed and conditioned with something from the K-Pak line of products.  The scent of the product is light and not overwhelming. It smells a little like pineapple.   Overall this spray is subtle, but effective. You can&#x27;t feel it in the hair - no residue. It definitely will improve the appearance and texture of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very bleached hair. This product has rescued it. I spray it on after showering and washing and a few times during the day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, the spray Reconstructor, because I have fine hair. It&#x27;s perfect. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve found that if I spray it into my hands, then work it into the ends of my hair, I don&#x27;t get too much and weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair had reached the dry, brittle stage after too much blow drying and hot ironing and not enough protection. My hair is normally shiny, fine with a slight &amp;#34;kink&amp;#34; in it. With all the heat it got to the stage where kinky turned to wiry.After the first use of this product I could see the difference in the quality of my hair - it actually builds onto the hair shaft to moisten and make it look healthier. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> My hair was really shot from sun, and coloring.  I changed to Joico K-pak shampoo, conditioner, and this leave in reconstructor.  It has really worked.</li>
            <li> Product isn&#x27;t the original. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It somewhat helped but not as expected. I prefer Tec Italy recontruct treatment</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally leave a review but this leave in conditioner in combincation with the joico revitaluxe treatment has left my hair feeling amazing! Definitely great for thick, course hair</li>
            <li> my hair really loved this stuff. I did eventually decide to chop off the problematic inches, but this reconstructor really did make it look better in the interim.</li>
            <li> Gf loves this joico k-pak line and spritzes this in her hair after her shower as her leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used this produce for years and with all the coloring, washing, blow drying and curling iron I do to my hair, it has kept it in great condition (or so my hairdresser tells me).</li>
            <li> Very nice hair product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to give you hair an added boost of hydration - yes I would recommend it-</li>
            <li> Made immediate improvements in my fragile thin stranded natural hair. My hair loves protein and I noticed immediate improvements with my first use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Can never find it locally so thank goodness I can find it online and my hair thanks you</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I will keep buying it unless I find something better. My hair is bleached and this not only adds strength but also detangles your hair. Bottle last a while and I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Good hold, if hold is what you&#x27;re looking for. It provides good definition to curls.It does not have a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its real used twice and throwing away.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Black woman with natural hair that is very long and thick.  This instantly detangles my hair and leaves it soft and manageable whether I&#x27;m wearing it twisted or straight.  I love the entire line of K-Pak products and think they are good for every hair type.  Joico has been making quality products for many years now, and I hope they continue to do so.</li>
            <li> this product leaves your hair feeling very silky, but at the same time your hair feels very heavy.  maybe it b/c i use this all over the hair.  maybe i should start using this just a little.</li>
            <li> ladies, this works great if you fried your hair with curling iron, blow dryer, color over processing. i like the entire line of products and many salons don&#x27;t carry. this reconstructs hair fast; is a leave-in product. is expensive.</li>
            <li> It was very reasonably for cost and came very quickly.  It works wonderfully in my hair and makes it shiny and soft I use it inbetween my shampoos and helps to detangle and leave it healthy.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. Safe enough to use daily and it works! It has a really good smell too! I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and barely put a dent in the bottle. Really great!</li>
            <li> Item as promised, Thank you</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but not a great product. It brings some moisture to hair but is not very silky. It is actually sort-of stiff. Perhaps it has a different effect when used on wet hair. I use it on dry/almost dry hair.</li>
            <li> i really dont notice a differance when i use this product</li>
            <li> Order came quick, pleased with everything I ordered, cd was gift, recipient was pleased, the book was interesting, have used the&lt;br /&gt;joico liquid reconstructor before, that is good, the cd was given as a gift and the recipient was pleased with it</li>
            <li> There are so many things to love about this product. it is a real hair saver. Recently my hair was dried and limp after spending a week in Europe without proper hair products. I returned to the US, washed my hair with a moisturizing shampoo and then applied this product alone on wet hair. After blow drying and flatironing, my hair was BACK. full of bounce, shiny, silky, and the results will last all week. I have fine textured relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying its a 10 and several other products that are highly recommended. This one works by far the best it helped my hair the first day and I can already tell a difference!</li>
            <li> excellent delivery. amazing product, for my blond and dry hair is perfect!!! I&#x27;m so addicted in it. is the best of all. Brazilian consumer :)</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and this spray works great as both a leave-in conditioner and de-tangler. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves it silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> This dried my hair out soooooooooo badly!  I was doing my normal wash day routine and my hair felt amazing until I sprayed it with this product.  I went from soft, well conditioned, and pliable hair to hard, dry, and inelastic hair.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another leave in again I&#x27;m sold n I love this product n it smells good... my hair was hard n at the ends and didn&#x27;t feel good at all I used natural products like Shea moisture and oranix on it didn&#x27;t do anything for me this product is the bomb</li>
            <li> I had bleached my hair to lift a burgundy color out and then go to a nice neutral brown. It damaged it to the point of breaking off. Between that and blow drying a flat ironing my hair was just a mess. So I went to a new stylist to repair the damage. Of course the color issue was a nightmare but this product was a miracle. In the first month I had seen a miraculous change in how my hair responded. If felt like silk in days. Now I could easily say that was from a new color but over the month it stayed feeling like that as the color grew out and needed to be not only retouched because with the nightmare I created, it took her a few tries to get it corrected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am at 3 months of using this product and all the breakage has healed. I am not seeing those little half inch pieces in the sink every time I use the flat iron. Now you might be asking \\&quot; didn&#x27;t you use heat protectant? yes I did but apparently I needed this as well to protein protect my actual hair shaft first. I will tell you I don&#x27;t apply it like my stylist says. I do spray it into my hands and rub them together and onto my hair. I section my hair and do it a section at a time. I know she would prefer me to do it her way but you know what, she can walk around my head and be sure she&#x27;s getting it all I can&#x27;t. This way I know where I put it and exactly how much. Whatever I am doing is working, there is no more breakage. I don&#x27;t apply it everyday because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day. I can&#x27;t that&#x27;s too much oil to wash out of it but every other day works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned my best friend on to it and she has to be super careful of what she puts in her hair... she always says... I can&#x27;t use that I only have 3 hairs on my head it will weigh it down. She called me the other day and said, \\&quot; I love that stuff text me the name I gotta get it my hair is super soft and shiny and still is and it&#x27;s 6 o&#x27;clock.\\&quot;  I told her I told it was your old infusium on steriods LOL.</li>
            <li> Very nice for thin hair</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing! The customer service is excellent as well.</li>
            <li> Came quick and does wonderful things for my hair ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Love this. Been using for years</li>
            <li> Love it!  Keeps my hair from looking so dry!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Joico K-pak Liquid Reconstructor.  I am a big fan of all Joico products.  I have highlighted hair and as with all women I blow-dry, flat iron all those things that cause damage.  This is the best....I love, love, love it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the Joico products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review a lot of my purchases but I really liked this product. The smell is amazing and it makes your hair very soft but not greasy. That is what I like about Joico products in general. 5 stars.</li>
