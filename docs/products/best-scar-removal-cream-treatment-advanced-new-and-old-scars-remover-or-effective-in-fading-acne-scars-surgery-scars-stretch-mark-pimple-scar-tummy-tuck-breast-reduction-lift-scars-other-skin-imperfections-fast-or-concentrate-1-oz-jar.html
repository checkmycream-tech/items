            <li>I will update again after more time has passed</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>

            <li>and I would say it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>AN EXCHANGE FOR A TRUTHFUL AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li>This cream is so phenomenal</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this scar gel&#x27;s ingredient list and</li>
            <li>A scar gel can even skin tone and make more even the height difference between healthy skin and some raised scars.</li>
            <li>Being able to dip my fingers in the gel, rather than using a syringe or spray bottle, gives me greater control over the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope you found this description to be detailed and honest.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 weeks and already most of my acne scars have lighten up or disappered altogether.</li>
            <li>In my experience application of the cream is easy, there is a grit in it; that massages the spot being rubbed into, which is soothing.</li>
            <li>I believe strongly in honesty and helping others.</li>
            <li>I have a burn mark from a hot iron that is unsightly to put it nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is light brown in color.</li>
            <li>The best things seem to come in small packages.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!  </li>
            <li>It has a smell to it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to place my finger on exactly what the smell is</li>
            <li>Now the scars aren&#x27;t more than a month old but it seems to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>Either way they say If your skin doesn&#x27;t look twice as nice after regular use of Evanesce for 4-7 weeks, then you can contact them for a full refund - No Questions Asked!  </li>
            <li>For stretch marks the result are not as quick as it showed for the pimples and blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue or greasy effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have to order more and more of this stuff for it to finally work---</li>
            <li>was lucky enough to try this scar removal cream on a promotional discounted rate and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product so far.</li>
            <li>I would consider this to be more of a gel than a cream with a light oil consistency that leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized and the jar has a wide opening that easily allows me to use my fingers to get the product then apply accordingly.</li>
            <li>I suspect that with time I will see a more noticeable change, as I&#x27;ve mentioned above to already notice change in my scar.</li>
            <li>It has almost a non-existent scent and sinks into your skin almost immediately which I really liked.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed really fast</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to come back and give more results when I am using it for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a little over a week now after receiving it at an amazing discount, and have noticed some difference in my scar.</li>
            <li>This product really gets the job done</li>
            <li>so much  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I expect it will take a while for significant change to be obvious.</li>
            <li>I was excited to be given the opportunity to try and test this product as a consumer simply for my opinion on the product.</li>
            <li>and it smells decent.</li>
            <li>I love the results I&#x27;ve seen at 3 weeks and am looking forward to seeing what the next month or so brings, I would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend &amp;#34;received</li>
            <li>however it does have a  gritty texture kind of like a sugar scrub but not as harsh, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or scrap your skin.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the look of it,  it is okay.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m liking it so far.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and there is no one miracle cream that will completely remove it permanently.  </li>
            <li>I have notice some reduction in the color of the scars but it hasn&#x27;t worked on the age spots so far.</li>
            <li>Now I know it takes time, but as far as of now, it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>I have always scared dark and quick.</li>
            <li>The gel is definitely an oil, but it is light and leaves little odor on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to know if it really works.  </li>
            <li>Not happy with this cream haven&#x27;t seen any result probably  have to use like 10 bottles to see results can&#x27;t afford to buy that many</li>
            <li>My scars from cutting out or freezing skin cancer bumps are healing much faster and more cleanly, possibly because they are still fresh (less than two weeks old).</li>
            <li>The user must accept that the body&#x27;s healing process made the scars, and a gel is not more powerful than the human biology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> I have 2 scars that have left me feeling self conscious for years, one is on my forehead that I got in a roll over auto accident over 25 years ago and the other is a 1 1/2&amp;#34; scar beside my left eye that I got about 10 years ago from a household accident.</li>
            <li> packaging for this gel is a small plastic jar, much like a babyfood jar.</li>
            <li> only negative thing I could say at this point would be that the smell is pretty strange.</li>
            <li> So far, my stretch marks feel less riged and are not as tender to the touch.</li>
            <li> After only having this product a few days and applying it 3 times a day I can see a little lightening/healing all ready.</li>
            <li> have stretched marks on arms, thighs and tummy</li>
            <li> Minor scars are disappearing and blending in with the skin tone.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t a strong smell, very faint actually but</li>
            <li> I have scars on my legs from my 6 dogs (playing around nothing serious) and before I started using this product they were pretty dark scars,</li>
            <li> I was glad that the product itself was ugly, just like my scar</li>
            <li> It had a waxy consistency that never really went away</li>
            <li> I said---I&#x27;m going to use it everyday and see where I am when I finish the tiny bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: kelp extract, olive leave extract, white curcumin, aloe vera extract, green tea, chamomile extract, Vitamin B3, coconut&lt;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by its size because a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One of my boys said the product looks like applesauce and the other said baby food.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cruelty free and vegan and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> After a week I can actually see results, both scars are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this is a thick tan/brown colored liquid with small lumps instead of a cream.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get it because I have scar marks that I want to get rid of sooo bad.  </li>
            <li> I knew that would not be a miracle but gave it a try, the color is dark and not very attractive but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all, I&#x27;ve been using for a little over 3 weeks and again, although the scar didn&#x27;t disappear it is less raised and less red.</li>
            <li> Previously, I tried one that was like chap stick.</li>
            <li> my less noticable scars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, this is a product which refines what is there; it is not a quick eraser.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you are like me and have a scar that needs a little help.  </li>
            <li> after 2 days of using they seem to be lightening a little bit.</li>
            <li> They are almost faded away and very less noticeable without any concealer or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This cream takes a little time to work, but it has done miracles for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it would have worked from where I started</li>
            <li> The jar arrives in a small box.</li>
            <li> A little smell isn&#x27;t too bad though and is definitely manageable.</li>
            <li> The post-surgery scar is slowly whitening and itching has reduced.</li>
            <li> I have seen a very small difference.</li>
            <li> It is working ever so slowly but is working !</li>
            <li> My scar went from ugly and something I tried desperately to cover up, to a shade that is BARELY noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have blemishes and pimple scar on my face which looks really really bad.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, but it made me break out:(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed either way!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have heard a lot about Evanesce scar removal cream. I have blemishes and pimple scar on my face which looks really really bad. I have to cover up with concealer whenever I go out. I started using this scar removal cream and within 10 days I have noticed big difference in my blemishes and pimple scars. They are almost faded away and very less noticeable without any concealer or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I have stretched marks on arms, thighs and tummy and I am using this cream regularly on them. For stretch marks the result are not as quick as it showed for the pimples and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;The great things about this cream is it is risk free. I do not feel any irritation on my skin when I apply it. It is very light and has no smell. It is light brown in color. It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue or greasy effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with this scar removal cream and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to try this scar removal cream on a promotional discounted rate and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product because my son and I both have a scar we would like to see in our rear view mirror.  Natura Science Labs created Evanesce to help fade scars and they have a lot of great ingredients in there to help.  The jar fits into the palm of your hand.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by its size because a little bit goes a long way. One of my boys said the product looks like applesauce and the other said baby food.

            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now after receiving it at an amazing discount, and have noticed some difference in my scar. It is getting lighter and seems to be getting tighter. I am using it on my C-Section scar so I expect it will take a while for significant change to be obvious. In my experience application of the cream is easy, there is a grit in it; that massages the spot being rubbed into, which is soothing. I like the way it feels, with it&#x27;s cooling effect on the skin when applied. I suspect that with time I will see a more noticeable change, as I&#x27;ve mentioned above to already notice change in my scar.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this cream haven&#x27;t seen any result probably  have to use like 10 bottles to see results can&#x27;t afford to buy that many</li>
            <li> This product came well-packaged. I have been using it and notice a definite improvement in some of the scars that I had. This product does seem to work better then bio-oil. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my face next to my nose that I got from a car accident years ago that I should have gotten stitches for but didn&#x27;t. I was excited to be given the opportunity to try and test this product as a consumer simply for my opinion on the product. I was glad that the product itself was ugly, just like my scar but the list of skin rejuvenating ingredients are substantial. Somehow, that gave me hope. It&#x27;s puke brown. I began applying it day and night not only to my scar but to my blemishes as well. It has almost a non-existent scent and sinks into your skin almost immediately which I really liked. Previously, I tried one that was like chap stick. It had a waxy consistency that never really went away but it did work to an extent but took months and months of twice a day application. It was minimized to a degree but this product appears to be finishing up the job. I&#x27;m not sure how well it would have worked from where I started but I do know it&#x27;s regenerated the skin and now a touch of makeup makes it virtually disappear. I&#x27;m chalking it up to this product.</li>
            <li> Just got it today! Texture is kind of like jello and it smells decent. It gets absorbed really fast and I&#x27;m liking it so far. Will continue to use and see if there is any improvements</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s cruelty free and vegan and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. This product really gets the job done and I have sensitive skin so I always worry but this didn&#x27;t burn or cause redness one bit. Highly recommend &amp;#34;received this item for testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As we all know - a scar is a scar and there is no one miracle cream that will completely remove it permanently.  There IS, however, this fantastic cream that sure comes close! I have a burn mark from a hot iron that is unsightly to put it nicely.  I received this to try so I could review it and provide my feedback and let me tell you how impressed I was! My scar went from ugly and something I tried desperately to cover up, to a shade that is BARELY noticeable.  You would only know it was there if I told you.  The formula is creamy and non-greasy and rubs in well.  I would recommend this if you are like me and have a scar that needs a little help.  I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 2 days so my rating can only be a 4 until I&#x27;ve used the product for the suggested time frame. I&#x27;m also giving it a 4 because in the 2 days I have been using it I have seen a very small difference. I have scars on my legs from my 6 dogs (playing around nothing serious) and before I started using this product they were pretty dark scars, after 2 days of using they seem to be lightening a little bit. So I think and am hoping that this product will work like it says it will with the continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I could say at this point would be that the smell is pretty strange. It&#x27;s not horrible but it is there. A little smell isn&#x27;t too bad though and is definitely manageable. So at this point and time I would recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I have 2 scars that have left me feeling self conscious for years, one is on my forehead that I got in a roll over auto accident over 25 years ago and the other is a 1 1/2&amp;#34; scar beside my left eye that I got about 10 years ago from a household accident. I&#x27;ve tried several products that claim to remove or reduce scars but I never got the results they promised but when I had the opportunity try this product I figured I had nothing to lose. After a week I can actually see results, both scars are slowly fading. I would consider this to be more of a gel than a cream with a light oil consistency that leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized and the jar has a wide opening that easily allows me to use my fingers to get the product then apply accordingly. I love the results I&#x27;ve seen at 3 weeks and am looking forward to seeing what the next month or so brings, I would definitely recommend.  I will update again after more time has passed and I see different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product.</li>
            <li> Works like magic. The scar is softer and flatter, so im able to conceal it with my makeup.</li>
            <li> This cream takes quite a bit of time to work. Don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight. Had some scars on my hands from burns and some age spots and thought I would give it a try. I have notice some reduction in the color of the scars but it hasn&#x27;t worked on the age spots so far. I have used it two times a day since I got it and I would say it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GOOD I HAVE USED IT A COUPLE OF DAYS AND IS STARTING TO WORK. I RECEIVED THIS SCAR CREAM AT NO COST AN EXCHANGE FOR A TRUTHFUL AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, but it made me break out:(</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the reviews that I read. I was excited to get it because I have scar marks that I want to get rid of sooo bad.  When I rec&#x27;d it I was in shock to see how tiny it was, but I said---I&#x27;m going to use it everyday and see where I am when I finish the tiny bottle.  Well, my scars are still there.  I don&#x27;t know if I have to order more and more of this stuff for it to finally work---but at almost $24 a bottle that will not be happening.  I guess what I am trying to say is---this product, to me, did not work.  I am 100% UN-satisfied.  I don&#x27;t even know if I can get my money back.  I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to know if it really works.  I was surprised to find this is a thick tan/brown colored liquid with small lumps instead of a cream.</li>
            <li> The best things seem to come in small packages.  I received this cream to try and give an honest and unbiased opinion.  This is it... I have been applying this cream for the last week to the scar from my C-section and it is fading and after 10 years I was wondering if it was just gonna stay noticeable forever.  This cream is so phenomenal I cant begin to say enough thank yous!!!  I will definitely be giving this as gifts to the girlfriends!  Thank you !</li>
            <li> I am taking the cream since couple weeks and I already feel the difference. Minor scars are disappearing and blending in with the skin tone. The post-surgery scar is slowly whitening and itching has reduced. I would totally recommend this cream to anyone with similar matters.</li>
            <li> Nice item, helping with my scars, would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my skin! Ive been battling acne for about 5 years now, so I have some deep scars. This cream takes a little time to work, but it has done miracles for me!</li>
            <li> When I was offered this treatment for the purpose of inspection and review I took it thinking , nothing to lose. When it arrived I read all the ingredients and sounded good to me, I ordered because I have a scar from my herpes break out that bothers me even though you cannot see it unless I am address on my buttocks. I knew that would not be a miracle but gave it a try, the color is dark and not very attractive but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all, I&#x27;ve been using for a little over 3 weeks and again, although the scar didn&#x27;t disappear it is less raised and less red. I am looking forward to come back and give more results when I am using it for about 2 months. For now I am liking it and do recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is working ever so slowly but is working ! Once you get past the look of it,  it is okay.</li>
            <li> I  like  so much  i ll buy it again</li>
            <li> Beauty aids with all kinds of plant ingredients are popular. Some of them work well, and some do not. I am pleased with this scar gel&#x27;s ingredient list and my less noticable scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is not to expect miracles. A scar gel can even skin tone and make more even the height difference between healthy skin and some raised scars. But, this is a product which refines what is there; it is not a quick eraser. The user must accept that the body&#x27;s healing process made the scars, and a gel is not more powerful than the human biology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: kelp extract, olive leave extract, white curcumin, aloe vera extract, green tea, chamomile extract, Vitamin B3, coconut&lt;br /&gt;endosperm, collagen, Vitamin C, epidermal growth factor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am continuing to apply this product to my stretch marks and scars from having skin cancers cut out. So far, my stretch marks feel less riged and are not as tender to the touch. My scars from cutting out or freezing skin cancer bumps are healing much faster and more cleanly, possibly because they are still fresh (less than two weeks old). The gel is definitely an oil, but it is light and leaves little odor on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging for this gel is a small plastic jar, much like a babyfood jar. The jar arrives in a small box. Its only seal is its lid, but I have had no liquid spill out. Being able to dip my fingers in the gel, rather than using a syringe or spray bottle, gives me greater control over the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was a gift. My words are my own. I hope you found this description to be detailed and honest. I believe strongly in honesty and helping others.</li>
            <li> I have always scared dark and quick. I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of different products in an effort to lighten them if not get rid of the scars. After only having this product a few days and applying it 3 times a day I can see a little lightening/healing all ready. Now the scars aren&#x27;t more than a month old but it seems to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> Super duper product!!  Worth the money!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product so far. I have been using it for 2 weeks and already most of my acne scars have lighten up or disappered altogether. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you</li>
            <li> I do like this scar removal.  I have plenty of scars and since I have been using this I have noticed some of them fading.  Now I know it takes time, but as far as of now, it seems to be working.  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily feeling however it does have a  gritty texture kind of like a sugar scrub but not as harsh, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or scrap your skin. I love that it has all natural products that are known to be very good for your skin and the company say 100% Satisfaction Guarantee which is also awesome.  It has a smell to it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to place my finger on exactly what the smell is, it isn&#x27;t a strong smell, very faint actually but its there it reminds me of my childhood.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  I do recommend it!</li>
