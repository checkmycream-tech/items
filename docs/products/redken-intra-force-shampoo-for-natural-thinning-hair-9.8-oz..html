    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent Hair Care product for the purpose listed on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product line</li>
            <li>but it is a great shampoo</li>
            <li>Excellent shampoo and better than Nioxin.</li>
            <li>I bought redkin cuz its a known brand with good products unline others that i never heard of.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic Value for this Great Shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended this for my boyfriend who is thinning on top.  </li>
            <li>Love the products.  </li>
            <li>Thinning on top of head is gone.  </li>
            <li>Until then, I am satisfied with how the product makes my hair appear.</li>
            <li>This could be because I was never losing hair, it&#x27;s just getting a bit fine on the top.</li>
            <li>Amazon is a great place to purchase this because of the pricing, hair salons overcharge for the same thing..</li>
            <li>I took that plunge happily and it worked great until i saw some alarming side effects that urged me to stop taking it, which brought me back to square one with no solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i have to say this is the most promising product i have used to date, even when i compare it with the effects of Finpecia.</li>
            <li>This product really seems to work and despite the high price is proving to be most definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li>At this point it thus looks like the product is not only helping me keep what i have, but also to win back where it has recently receded, which i have to admit is much more than i bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item arrived as promised and packaged very well!</li>
            <li>Having tried so many of these &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; solutions to male pattern baldness, i was really skeptic about yet another &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Within a matter of days, I did notice more volume, but I also started losing an alarming amount of hair.</li>
            <li>this works really well.  </li>
            <li>i was really seeing a lot of hair in the sink when i styled my hair.</li>
            <li>Certainty no worse off than before</li>
            <li>The product makes my hair lay better, but again, I am still searching for a few new follicles before I say this product is worth it.</li>
            <li>These products (Redken Intra Force Shampoo, Toner and Scalp Treatment) were recommended to me by a salon in order to provide more volume for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Ok but not great for really fine hair.</li>
            <li>As someone who relies heavily on customer reviews before buying a product I thought it was only fair that I share my experience with this product.</li>
            <li>This with conditioner and mousse gives me three times my normal hair volume.</li>
            <li>Even growing new hair at temples.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Redken products in the past and had been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended the Intraforce and said it wouldn&#x27;t fade my color, but that wasn&#x27;t my experience, so I&#x27;ve gone back to my previous shampoo that protects the color better.</li>
            <li>IDK if it grows hair back, i cant really notice -</li>
            <li>I will update in the early part of 2014.</li>
            <li>My scalp is pretty sensitive and prone to minor break outs, I believe, because of the mousse/paste/hairspray.</li>
            <li>The amount of hair in the sink is less now than when i was using Finpecia, and i can see a lot of fine hair starting to grow longer and thicker in areas where my hairline has receded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 35 year old male.  </li>
            <li>I am a male in his early 30s who has noticeably thinning hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner is really the only stuff I&#x27;ve ever used that helps keep my scalp and hair feeling extremely</li>

            <li> I typically use Regenepure for thinning hair, but wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> After using these products for a few weeks (shampoo, conditioner and spray), my hair was left too soft and the color had faded noticeably within only week of being colored.</li>
            <li> .Almost lost all my hair last year due to a medical condition.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normally fine and very thin.</li>
            <li> Used this product along with other Intra Force products and now my hair is almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leah</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> im not really THAT bald.  </li>
            <li> From roughly the age of 25</li>
            <li> Used Nioxin in the past with zero results, same with rogaine foam.  </li>

            <li> I am a 30 year old male who suffers from Alopecia (male pattern baldness).</li>

            <li> People actually think I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> However, this product dried my hair out and also made my scalp itchy.  </li>

            <li> hair is thick and the helpless feeling of all the hair in the sink every day is gone.</li>
            <li> I tried everything on the market, desperate for something to at least stop the alarming rate at which my hair was receding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Hope this works for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Left a horrible, and I do mean HORRIBLE rash on my head!</li>
            <li> my desperate state i turned to a product called Finpecia which is a drug that stops the effects of Alopecia, but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this item, thank you.</li>
            <li> this was suppose to be for tinted/colored hair &amp; it isn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li> Just what my hairdresser prescribed delivered to my door just as promised and wrapped to perfection.</li>
            <li> These products (Redken Intra Force Shampoo, Toner and Scalp Treatment) were recommended to me by a salon in order to provide more volume for my fine, thin hair. Within a matter of days, I did notice more volume, but I also started losing an alarming amount of hair. I do not plan to finish my 30 day trial as I cannot imagine what the extent of the hair loss might be at that point</li>
            <li> Does not do what it claims. Hair did look healthier but it is no miracle worker or anything.</li>
            <li> this works really well.  IDK if it grows hair back, i cant really notice - im not really THAT bald.  I bought redkin cuz its a known brand with good products unline others that i never heard of.  It def makes your hair feel A LOT smoother and fuller looking / healthier.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this for my boyfriend who is thinning on top.  With regular use we both started to notice a difference. He uses it all the time now.</li>
            <li> It works as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried for thin hair.  I use the shampoo along with the Intra Force Toner.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for thin hair. It doubles my hair volume when I use this with the conditioner and mousse.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Value for this Great Shampoo</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo, conditioner, spray, micro boost and mousse for 4 months.  Saw difference in 4 weeks.  Love the products.  I&#x27;m a 35 year old male.  Thinning on top of head is gone.  Even growing new hair at temples.  Used Nioxin in the past with zero results, same with rogaine foam.  These products work.  I get a lot of comments on my hair now.  Definitely recommend. Unlike the other reviewer, I did not notice any hair loss once I began use.</li>
            <li> I typically use Regenepure for thinning hair, but wanted to try something new.  I&#x27;ve used Redken products in the past and had been completely satisfied.  However, this product dried my hair out and also made my scalp itchy.  That was after about three uses.  Would not suggest this product.</li>
            <li> As someone who relies heavily on customer reviews before buying a product I thought it was only fair that I share my experience with this product. I am a 30 year old male who suffers from Alopecia (male pattern baldness). From roughly the age of 25 I noticed my hair was thinning and by about the age of 28 i was really seeing a lot of hair in the sink when i styled my hair. I tried everything on the market, desperate for something to at least stop the alarming rate at which my hair was receding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my desperate state i turned to a product called Finpecia which is a drug that stops the effects of Alopecia, but it comes with the risk of impotence. I took that plunge happily and it worked great until i saw some alarming side effects that urged me to stop taking it, which brought me back to square one with no solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point my hair dresser suggested i try Redken Intra Force. Having tried so many of these &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; solutions to male pattern baldness, i was really skeptic about yet another &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;. I made a deal with my hair dresser that i would try one bottle of the shampoo together with the Micro Boost spray too see what happens since i had nothing to lose and the product claims that you can see results in 30 days. I also cut my hair very short (about 1 cm length all over) to properly monitor the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its now 45 days later and i have to say this is the most promising product i have used to date, even when i compare it with the effects of Finpecia. The amount of hair in the sink is less now than when i was using Finpecia, and i can see a lot of fine hair starting to grow longer and thicker in areas where my hairline has receded. At this point it thus looks like the product is not only helping me keep what i have, but also to win back where it has recently receded, which i have to admit is much more than i bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and the helpless feeling of all the hair in the sink every day is gone. This product really seems to work and despite the high price is proving to be most definitely worth it for me. It gets 5 stars from me, as i am now free of that dreadful feeling every morning when i get ready for the day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product line and I have used it for a number of years.. Amazon is a great place to purchase this because of the pricing, hair salons overcharge for the same thing.. I would not say that it is for thinning hair.. but it is a great shampoo</li>
            <li> Hope this works for thin hair.  Will review after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Maye it was just my imagination but after just a few applications it seemed to be working. Certainty no worse off than before</li>
            <li> Left a horrible, and I do mean HORRIBLE rash on my head!</li>
            <li> Item arrived as promised and packaged very well!</li>
            <li> After using these products for a few weeks (shampoo, conditioner and spray), my hair was left too soft and the color had faded noticeably within only week of being colored. My hairdresser recommended the Intraforce and said it wouldn&#x27;t fade my color, but that wasn&#x27;t my experience, so I&#x27;ve gone back to my previous shampoo that protects the color better. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in thickness either while using the Intraforce.</li>
            <li> Excellent Hair Care product for the purpose listed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken is a name that you can trust always.</li>
            <li> Requested by my son and given as stocking stuffer.  He has used in the past and feels it works well.</li>
            <li> This product does not seem the same as when I bought it a couple years ago. It seems to really be different. It makes my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I have naturaly thining hair and it seems to thicken my hair as it stimulates my scalp..Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo and better than Nioxin. Have been using this product for awhile now. I recommend it over the rest of these type of shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have a short haircut and use a lot of product every day. My scalp is pretty sensitive and prone to minor break outs, I believe, because of the mousse/paste/hairspray. This shampoo/conditioner is really the only stuff I&#x27;ve ever used that helps keep my scalp and hair feeling extremely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have not noticed a difference when it comes to hair thickness. This could be because I was never losing hair, it&#x27;s just getting a bit fine on the top. I could see how it could help stimulate growth if your hair was breaking or falling out, but mine never did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m committed to trying this shampoo/conditioner/scalp treatment system for 1 year since I have a lot of lost time to make up for - so to speak. I am a male in his early 30s who has noticeably thinning hair. The product does make your hair appear fuller, however, I am still waiting on seeing if any dormant hair follicles start popping up once again. The product makes my hair lay better, but again, I am still searching for a few new follicles before I say this product is worth it. I will update in the early part of 2014. Until then, I am satisfied with how the product makes my hair appear.</li>
            <li> .Almost lost all my hair last year due to a medical condition.  Used this product along with other Intra Force products and now my hair is almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leah Rae Cox</li>
            <li> Ok but not great for really fine hair.</li>
            <li> This with conditioner and mousse gives me three times my normal hair volume. People actually think I have thick hair. It&#x27;s normally fine and very thin.</li>
