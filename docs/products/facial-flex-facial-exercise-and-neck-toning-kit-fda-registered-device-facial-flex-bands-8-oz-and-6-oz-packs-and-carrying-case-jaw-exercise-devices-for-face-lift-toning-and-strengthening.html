            <li>I am happy to keep exercise move my mouth.</li>
            <li>The tone of my face, specifically my mouth, cheeks and jowl area have improved greatly.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>If it does, great---</li>
            <li>so I started with Neckline Slimmer which does work great</li>
            <li>Do research before putting in your mouth and if you do, proceed with great caution.</li>
            <li>was definitely a great buy and  would recommend it as part of your anti-aging regime.g regime.</li>
            <li>HAPPY TO RECEIVE THE UNIT AND</li>
            <li>If used every day faithly the results can be great.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li>2 minutes a day for huge improvement!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick shipping and came in a very nice container.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>And no, I don&#x27;t own stock or anything, I just think this is a brilliant product.</li>
            <li>No risky cosmetic surgery for remarkable improvement.  </li>
            <li>Again, be your own boss in determining the ideal frequency of exercising.  </li>
            <li>I took before and after photos, but even without examining them, the changes has been fairly remarkable.</li>
            <li>I also recommend reading The Beauty Detox by Kimberly Synder and Forever Beautiful by Natalia Rose.</li>
            <li>I can tell this device is not going to do much good.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good age.</li>
            <li>It feels good when I am done using it 3 minutes a day.</li>
            <li>Not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>I am not against the device because I believe this might be a good  stuff  </li>
            <li>seem good</li>
            <li>Quality of the product is good.</li>
            <li>Seems lie a good product</li>
            <li>one can get some good results.</li>
            <li>I have been using it fairly faithfully for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Good color to your skin because of the increased circulation.</li>
            <li>, it feels so good to feel my face taut and fit!!</li>
            <li>Love this thing works great.</li>
            <li>but once you begin using it consistently you will discover just how wonderful this works.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>okay!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>so I remembered how much I liked it and wanted another one and just got this, I am VERY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Everything arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I received this on time, but would have liked directions included with this.</li>
            <li>Works great - Fast shipping - Great item</li>
            <li>but I know this will cause more damage than good.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>It has toned my cheeks and as a nice surprise, has plumped my lips and reduced my lip lines.  </li>
            <li>I liked my mouth before and</li>
            <li>I had it for many years and loved it.</li>
            <li>So, I googled this product and found more good reviews, so I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick ship.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy .</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>My face feels nice and relax after use. :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use !</li>
            <li>Absolutely love, love love love this!</li>
            <li>After 2 months of consistent use, all line around my mouth are gone, and jaw and neck area have improved greatly.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and results are really appreciative</li>
            <li>Our good friend Amazon sells all of these products with really quick shipping.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put two bands on for more resistance.</li>
            <li>It comes with two levels of resistance but greater resistance bands can be ordered separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, because this device mimics smiling until your cheeks feel it, it has a powerful effect on stimulating the muscles of your face to make your brain perceive that you are smiling, and that has been shown to improve feel good chemicals in the brain, read the article from July 31 2012  in Psychology</li>
            <li>I think it will take longer to get the full benefit, but I am already very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The exercise is mainly good for the smile area and perhaps will have longer term effect on the marionette lines.</li>
            <li>Will write a better review about a two month use</li>
            <li>If I see any difference I will surely amend this review.</li>
            <li>If you look at the before and after photos, it seems to work by adjusting the jawline--the jaw sticks out more in the after photos and that seems to soften the lines around the mouth.  </li>
            <li>I see where this could work better if I used it as I should</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Dont do an O, make sure you form your mouth in an oval instead.</li>
            <li>i do feel a tightening as soon as im finished with my reps, so maybe just more time is all i need.</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>When I found the Facial-Flex on Amazon, I thought I would give it a try and am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, pleased with this gadget and will keep using it and hope to see results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to do 5 minutes for each session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth is more upturned too.</li>
            <li>I love this product helps me exercise my face</li>
            <li>Face does look better and firmer.</li>
            <li>Neck looks better.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for one I have had for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting to me that so many people like this product.</li>
            <li>I started with Flexeffect, which is a hands on resistance system that works wonders, but takes more time each day to do.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles became more pronounced.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I cannot be 100% sure yet.</li>
            <li>Every work out makes me feel like I put a dime away; and someday I will have checks that I purchased without surgery :)</li>
            <li>makes my face look 100% more tone...</li>
            <li>Interesting product.</li>
            <li>My face muscles have changed but im not quite sure</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>bands, about 120 reps (or more) a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>The produce itself is not working smoothly at all!  </li>
            <li>ok, wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work,  </li>
            <li>But I read reviews as I am sure you are doing and thought what the heck couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>The face has many muscles.</li>
            <li>if you try to do too many repetitions too soon, you will develop a neck/headache.  </li>
            <li>I use the tightest of three rubber band strengths and admittedly am faithful to exercise 120 times most days.</li>
            <li>But it does more than that</li>
            <li>Great results, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>It was safely packaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;denise :)</li>
            <li>a while I think, its challenging.</li>
            <li>My chin area and mouth look better, my jowl has more definition.</li>
            <li>I feel the burn more when I squeeze my lips in and &amp;#34;out&amp;#34;, like you&#x27;re trying to kiss someone just out of reach.</li>
            <li>This design is better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>need to use more often - can tell it is working.</li>
            <li>and I Love Love it.</li>
            <li>but my fuller lips do look a lot more youthful and sexy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Ok, I waited to review this item because I wanted to give it a chance to work.</li>
            <li>What I found is that I feel more definition  around my jawline, and chin.</li>
            <li>Love this gadget.</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow video so to not deepen lip lines.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 3O days and my  jaw has more definition.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Either in the directions or a video of the &amp;#34;Facial-Flex Ultra&amp;#34;, it is stated that after six weeks, most people notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.  :-)</li>
            <li>Your skin looks healthy, virbrate and</li>
            <li>The results are just as good as when I first used it...</li>
            <li>This item is good for tightening muscles in the face when using on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the 2 minutes it takes in the morning and evening!!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase and very lucky</li>
            <li>,I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Simple and extraordinary invention !</li>
            <li>that was a better fit.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product although you do have to be careful with washing the product as it can make the plastic part that holds it together flimsy and break off....</li>
            <li>When I was using it, didn&#x27;t realize it was causing so many jaw problems - couldn&#x27;t close my mouth comfortably.</li>
            <li>(O: this one seems nice enough, its NOT gold plated but it will do what I want it to do and after using it again for about 5 days I am SO THRILLED to have it again!</li>
            <li>good price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Nicely made and worth the money...</li>
            <li>good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>this is a great, easy, and natural way to do it.</li>
            <li>- I have already recommended it to several friends (though they laughed at me after seeing the video on youtube of how to use!)</li>
            <li>Works as designed and it fun :) :)</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use my Amazon account that I ordered this time from here.</li>
            <li>It work and easy for you to practice.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it takes under five minutes.</li>
            <li>Its strong and flexible.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed this product in particular had hundreds of good reviews.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good to flush blood thru normally stagnant areas of the cheeks.</li>
            <li>i m doing very good with it, but remember drink plenty of water before you do cuz it may dry your mouth while exercising.</li>
            <li>The device itself is fine</li>
            <li>Seems fine.</li>
            <li>so these implements really help me to care for my self in a really satisfying way!</li>
            <li>obviously the quality control has been greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>I have people now telling me I look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Great exercise for lower face and neck…use it regularly {every day} and you&#x27;ll feel the the tightness under your chin and your jowls will vanish</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s more fun to do it to the beat while I&#x27;m listening to music opposed to standing in the mirror for 5 minutes counting.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Great for facial exercises.</li>
            <li>An intermediate resistance should be available.  </li>
            <li>An intermediate resistance should be available.  </li>
            <li>It actually filled in the lines (they&#x27;re gone)</li>
            <li>Smile more instead.</li>
            <li>No instructions or chart and cheap case that will not close.</li>
            <li>I enjoy working out, so If I workout for my body</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about how motivated you are to get fit.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for maintaining a contoured jawline, if used as directed</li>
            <li>; free.  </li>
            <li>Great for facial strengthening.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I think I will dig it out &amp; start using it again as I&#x27;m sure it works when you use it the right way.</li>
            <li>It is very good for muscles of the face, the face tightens and becomes thinner , and younger, I like it very much</li>
            <li>My jaw line has more definition, my cheeks are more shapely and thinner, my eyes and upper forehead feel more taut and my eyes feel more open and bright.</li>
            <li>Still, this is an amazing product &amp;  I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>She is a very beautiful African American woman, because of her, before &amp; after pictures and very detailed instructions</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it</li>
            <li>I purchased the original and had it for years</li>
            <li>but really excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product originally from QVC.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited about this device.</li>
            <li>I will say after only 2 weeks I have seen remarkable improvement.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I then followed the instructions to clean the device.</li>
            <li>I did find that I needed to quickly change to the mid-strength resistance bands which helped tone more just like a higher weight would.</li>
            <li>I just started using it yesterday, so I can&#x27;t say yet what the benefits will be for sure, but I can certainly feel it working the muscles in my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just very just appointed  in the latest manufacturing process</li>
            <li>This really works love it</li>
            <li>This is a good facial exerciser .I</li>
            <li>, I can see a real difference when I do as many reps</li>
            <li>I thought that this was a good item, but it broke within 5 weeks of daily usage.</li>
            <li>And that just aint cool.</li>
            <li>A soft jawline (to put it nicely) runs in my family.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 6 weeks to show full effects, or did with me.</li>
            <li>I think consistency is the key to good results.</li>
            <li>It is too tiny to do much good for me.  </li>
            <li>this is my second one, I lost my original one, so glad to be able to find another</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>To be fair, I think my cheek bones are looking a little more defined, but because of what I mentioned I&#x27;m scared to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s awesome to tone your facial muscles</li>
            <li>I feel like I have done something worthy for myself.</li>
            <li>great product it really does tightening up your face muscles, my face looks younger.</li>
            <li>After abouy six months of using this producy, my double chin and face fat are gone, and my cheekbones are more prominent.</li>
            <li>, then I would highly recommend this product, it could make you feel a lot better about yourself.  </li>
            <li>Had one that I purchased from QVC years and years ago - it finally broke, and because I do NOT want to look my age, I was very glad to find one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied after several months of use.  </li>
            <li>Like anything else-Stay consistent!</li>
            <li>Remember, I&#x27;m using it constantly when at home,I rest it, then go again, I&#x27;m enjoying it so why stop!  </li>
            <li>I had hoped to post some before and after photos to show my results, but I haven&#x27;t found any good &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; shots yet, as I usually do not keep photos where I look old and haggard.</li>
            <li>At 51 years ago, I&#x27;m saving that money and loving this magical little device.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product that produces real results</li>
            <li>I can only hope I get 1/2 the amazing results</li>
            <li>Some Smile Therapy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Education is powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my facial flex.</li>
            <li>This tiny device, along with a good moisturizer, really made a difference in my look.</li>
            <li>It does require commitment, it becomes like brushing your teeth, worth it and worth the time.  </li>
            <li>Hope it was worth the money</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s worth about $4 including the cost of postage.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Worth a try to fight turkey neck.</li>
            <li>to see if it is worth continuing using it.</li>
            <li>its worth it</li>
            <li>10 days with this device and the lines are completely gone - and I have substantially more lip showing.  </li>
            <li>However, for me it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Facial Flex awhile back hoping to improve a burgeoning turkey neck, and loved the results after just a week!  </li>
            <li>I will probably get it from another seller next time, and make sure it originally sealed.</li>
            <li>Arrived pretty quick after I ordered ..</li>
            <li>Extraordinarily, my lips have pouffed up and are very rosy!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything to significantly tighten around the mouth.</li>
            <li>After using this for the first couple times - once in the evening, and then again the next morning -- my mom, unprompted and with no knowledge that I&#x27;d used Facial-Flex said, -- &#x27;Wow, your face looks really great.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m doing it right</li>
            <li>Right.</li>
            <li>I may order another, but I can&#x27;t afford it right now.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one from QVC and returned it for this reason but they were kind enough to give me a refund.</li>
            <li>If your life has been stressful and full of one thing after another and your face shows it because you just don&#x27;t smile that much anymore</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to find the YouTube video I had originally seen, that had me trying to track this item down to buy.</li>
            <li>I love it, and the results are amazing if you use it properly and do it twice daily.</li>
            <li>Sad I had read so many great reviews</li>
            <li>I do a few of these in combination with the Facial Flex for best results.  </li>
            <li>However, facial muscles are not like biceps and facial structure varies greatly from person to person.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much after 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this little gizmo would work, but I can definitely feel the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; (a good thing) and see a difference.  </li>
            <li>My first unit lasted about eight years no problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchase this product, its simple to use.</li>
            <li>The product really works!</li>
            <li>Pouting movements over and over, with no resistance will eventually create thinner upper lip and more feathered lips.</li>
            <li>You just need to be consistent with the exercises if you stop doing them, everything will be like before.</li>
            <li>I felt my face muscles work the first time I used it, but then nothing after that.</li>
            <li>This works but you have to be consistent with the use of the product.  </li>
            <li>that if I make this a regular scheduled routine that my face and neck would have more definition.</li>
            <li>I love the Facial Flex Ultra</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more because I had lost the last one that I had..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a smooth action.</li>
            <li>I saw improvement in the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Got the product fast !</li>
            <li>It does make a difference if used consistently.</li>
            <li>will help you to maintain a healthy younger looking face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a 3 weeks consistently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful that it will only get better with continued use.</li>
            <li>well, i don&#x27;t have wrinkles to know if the wrinkles are going away or not, but my face is definitely slimmer with more of a contour to the cheeks.</li>
            <li>I believe this exercise does really help !</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love and continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love and continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li>It seems to do exactly what they say it does.</li>
            <li>I like to use it while looking in the mirror to make sure I have the correct form, but that is not necessary.</li>
            <li>and I have been gradually moving to a higher strenght.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first bands.</li>
            <li>It actually works wonders and keep your neck and face well toned but not all muscle bound looking just mot sagging and cute.</li>
            <li>I think this might be better for the jowls, lower jaw and neck fat only.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and it already feelss like it is working.</li>
            <li>but after years of use, you will see great results - I gave four stars only because I have not had it for long</li>
            <li>It had better last</li>
            <li>I have only had this brilliant contraption for less than a week.  </li>
            <li>There were two women (more than that really, but these particular women I could completely identify with) who shared their stories and even demonstrated how to use it.  </li>
            <li>Very nice small device - go for it!</li>
            <li>I love the facial flex ultra, it really tones up the face muscles.</li>
            <li>They are taking advantage of the lack of good competition in the market since the chinese copies have proven to be really low quality.</li>
            <li>I do see the benefit of it, if it could actually expand enough to do any good.</li>
            <li>so that was definitely a positive aspect of the purchase.</li>
            <li>I was reviewing neck creams and saw this product after reading all the positive reviews I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Heck, if you roll your eyes way up and lift your lower eyelids a bit while you use the Facial Flex, you&#x27;ll even get tightening below the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $35, there simply isn&#x27;t a better value in facial anti-aging available.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t use it too long - read too many reviews that said it causes wrinkles</li>
            <li>It really works if your consistent with it as i am .</li>
            <li>Its not hard and well worth the time and investment.</li>
            <li>And doing those only takes a couple minutes per day as well, but you can actually feel the muscles working with that nice tingly burn that tells you you&#x27;re on the right track.</li>
            <li>My own problem is that I get bored with things very easily.</li>
            <li>The rubber bands last a while and are easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I bought my Facial Flex from QVC over a decade ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>It certainly is a workout, and it has toned up my face.  </li>
            <li>should add that I think you have to have a certain type of problem for this to work.</li>
            <li>I can literally feel my muscles tightening on certain parts of my face.</li>
            <li>This is a little more fun.</li>
            <li>This really works the jowl &amp; neck area.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see really works.</li>
            <li>I really hope this works for me to get ride of my nasolabial folds.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel it &#x27;working&#x27; the muscles in my face, even when I used the &#x27;highest tension band&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a whole week&#x27;s use though, I did notice it gets easier and hence feels like the rubberband that allows the movement to work needs to be \\&quot;tightened\\&quot; somehow since our muscle is used to it, it almost seems like it&#x27;s too \\&quot;easy\\&quot; on the muscle...hard to explain...</li>
            <li>and my face has really thinned out.</li>
            <li>While researching the web I came upon the Facial-Flex and after reading the product description and the reasonable price, I decided to purchase one.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really changed, but it was holding.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t really care if anyone sees).  </li>
            <li>You really do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing a whole lot of difference</li>
            <li>I use it for a fast 1 minute session, 2 sets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work for someone else, but this was WAY too wide for my mouth.</li>
            <li>these are very durable...</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li>but I have to tell ya, the creams may help, but really didn&#x27;t see a difference yet.  </li>
            <li>but this, I got about a week ago, and I use as much as I can,  2 to 4 times a day.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not, however, the whole ball of wax.  </li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t think it was working until I saw pictures of me over the holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was wondering why it cost so much.</li>
            <li>My face feels like its gotten a gentle workout.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>My cheeks and chin have really started to sag.</li>
            <li>My jaw and cheeks have definitely firmed up, and filled out.</li>
            <li>Time will tell f the product really works.</li>
            <li>My whole face has lifted.  </li>
            <li>My neck, under the chin area, jaw-line and cheeks are all very sore...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using facial flex for many months, nearly 2 years.  </li>
            <li>So far I have noticed more fullnes in my upper lip that had just started thinning out.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this on QVC then lost it so came here to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>I read several product reviews before purchasing this item and was not disappointed with it.</li>
            <li>I also had some extra skin under my neck that would wrinkle when I turned my head, but that wasn&#x27;t a significant waddle.</li>
            <li>It was originally presented as a product used to help victims of stroke-damaged facial muscles.  </li>
            <li>Updating that my bottom mouth lines never went away, even have a small one on the top right similar to the where the plastic piece fit.</li>
            <li>I jumped to using the 8oz bands and quickly went back to the 6oz because my mouth was not yet ready for this intense exercise.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I believe that the facial flex helped somewhat because, after reading another reviewer comments, I began to use both my hands by touching the sides of my eyes with my fingers and gently pulling back (and up) the skin while performing the exercises.</li>
            <li>not sure if I can honestly recommend it.</li>
            <li>like when it feels like my actual facial muscles are in good shape, im 57 and our &amp;#34;family&amp;#34; has that sort of slavic facial structure that lends itself well to sagging from the weight of those generations of digging potatoes up from under the frozen tundra ... for dinner.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re willing to put in the efford (which is not much, a few minutes a day) you will get results.</li>
            <li>and I got a second unit recently which I&#x27;m hoping will have better productivity.</li>
            <li>Over exertion could actually result in more feather lines, in areas on upper lip.</li>
            <li>I thought since this is more expensive it will be better.  </li>
            <li>i started using it 2 days ago, morning and night for 2 min each, the first i noticed was the headache i get after using it, still early to tell, maybe this is normal since the muscles started working , will give it a week and share my experience</li>
            <li>Not to mention quick results (like starting to notice improvements within days, not months).</li>
            <li>Realistic expectations are also helpful.....</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend....</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Notice a little more contour around chin area.  </li>
            <li>and I can see my cheeks more firm .</li>
            <li>The product is a nice facial work out ... but really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to witness the effects, but it&#x27;s like exercise ..</li>
            <li>The facial flex paired with &#x27;the neck line trimmer&#x27; are a powerful duo.</li>
            <li>If it did nothing else, Facial Flex would be useful just for improved circulation and skin tone.  </li>
            <li>but it actually caused additional deepness within one of my laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>That is just normal muscle spasms after not working out that part of my body in that way... ever.</li>
            <li>- I have deep smile lines</li>
            <li>I will be 59 next week and this little gizmo has taken some years off me for sure!</li>
            <li>It looks as ridiculous as I felt buying it, but I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I lost mine traveling and so ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>replacement - needed new one.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy little device that does exactly what you would expect - works the middle third of your face where the &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; of the exercise takes place.  </li>
            <li>The reasons I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is that, first it&#x27;s obviously overpriced.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it seems pretty well made and came with the extra rubber bands.</li>
            <li>Second set as I lost my first one...</li>
            <li>The Facial Flex worked the first day, I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>Bought my first one 7 years ago and it finally broke so ordered another.</li>
            <li>I had a firmer neck, reduced facial fat, plus higher and rosier cheeks...</li>
            <li>My first facial flex broke.</li>
            <li>Too many people work the other muscles of the body and forget that they have facial muscles.</li>
            <li>Bought a second from Amazon in case I break or lose the first.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a second, backup for my first one.</li>
            <li>Her name starts with the same two letters of my first name)  </li>
            <li>WOW, just what I have been searching for!</li>
            <li>I may be using it incorrectly, because I&#x27;m lazy and in a hurry most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one I used regularly and it lasted about 12 years.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement after about 3 weeks of twice daily use, and my smile lines actually look a little more pronounced.</li>
            <li>I used the small bands the first day, and continued to use the device on and off that whole first day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking cute, little double chin.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m deducting one star is that I feel the claims for the device (when used by itself) are somewhat exaggerated and that the leap from 8 oz to 14 oz resistance bans is too great.  </li>
            <li>Not so much with Facial Concepts service.</li>
            <li>It has tightened up my face near my nostrils and the corners of my mouth as well as my neck and under my chin.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 years old (I feel 40 on the inside!!)&lt;br /&gt;PS  </li>
            <li>As someone who is almost 68 years of age, I have developed some jowls and lower jaw issues</li>
            <li>so it too early to tell if there are any substantial results however I&#x27;m using it twice a day as instructed</li>
            <li>I couldnt order another one fast enough.</li>
            <li>I have owned this device for 6 weeks, and I have to say I am really surprised with how well it works.</li>
            <li>The device seems to be very well made and it did come with extra bands so you can change them out each week as indicated in the instructions included.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful about this product but it is too early to give a review.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Facial Flex is a very convenient and time-saving way to get bang for your buck in working the middle of the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some scratches on the two parts that go directly into the mouth, but I thought  for some reason, it  was  manufactured just like that.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how much of a transformation in the next 60 days.</li>
            <li>This product far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t activated my TMJ.</li>
            <li>very discouraging, wish I could send it back for a refund, regret ordering it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete rip off.  </li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>This tool really helps with tightening your facial muscles and your chin definition.</li>
            <li>BUT IT&#x27;S TOO EARLY TO SEE RESULTS.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I am wondering since I do have such success with it if some possibly didn&#x27;t want it out.</li>
            <li>but honestly think some wrinkles are getting worse.</li>
            <li>My face is thinner and my neck lines are slowly looking so much better.</li>
            <li>I often wonder how authentic these reviews really are, because, I feel like I keep wasting money on false hope.</li>
            <li>When I examined the Facial Flex I saw the difference between the right side that goes into the mouth and the left.</li>
            <li>After stopping for awhile, my jaw is now back to normal and it&#x27;s a relief!</li>
            <li>The facial flex is better than other facial exercisers.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true I can see such a big differences with my laugh lines the facial flex along with your regular facial regimen</li>
            <li>I like being hands free to do my other facial exercise during that two min!</li>
            <li>I call my Facial Flex, my little miracle!  :-)</li>
            <li>; I guess it&#x27;s the same concept as toning your muscles everywhere else, by using this to help stretch and contract your facial muscles, over time, it&#x27;ll be more toned and less prone to sagging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to buy two units with in the last four months because the first one did notfunction properly and broke within a month</li>
            <li>In my second week I received complements on how my face looked toned and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I like the concept but the value for money is not worth its very plastic , the picture  shows it as very premium</li>
            <li>- it is awkward at first to use, but I was used to it after about 3 or 4 times - it is one of those items that seems you will need to use consistently for good results - I use in morning and evening when I brush my teeth (or when I dry my hair) and plan on using it continuously going forward as it seems to be one of those that you may not see a big difference in the short term</li>
            <li>This device did, however, get me back in the habit of doing my facial exercises from 2 books that I own, so there&#x27;s that, at least.</li>
            <li>story, short-----it accentuated the wrinkles I was trying to get rid of and it has taken over 2 1/2 weeks to get my face back to as normal as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd facial flex,  this one is not as comfortable as my other one, but I have to say this works</li>
            <li>If the motion appears to be deepening creases or causing new wrinkles, either modify the way you&#x27;re performing the exercise or do something different.  </li>
            <li>It was very well packaged and has enough pressure bands to last for a couple of months.</li>
            <li>My results are very apparent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a major difference in anything yet but it will take time to do so.</li>
            <li>I am a Massage Therapist, so I understand the process of re-building a muscle, and I know that as I have aged, my facial muscles are &amp;#34;slack&amp;#34; so this is just the right thing to resolve that situation.</li>
            <li>The right was thicker and very smooth and the left was quite thin and had an extremely rough edge.</li>
            <li>There are enough programs out there that you can improve your facial tone once you find the particular exercises that work for you.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell about ultimate results</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending me two complete sealed Facial Flex Ultra kits from the photo on Amazon</li>
            <li>This has barely any resistance to it.  </li>
            <li>I realized I could mimic this same action with two fingers spacing my lips apart, so did not need the device to do that.</li>
            <li>Have been using Facial Flex for years and have always ordered from the company directly.</li>
            <li>Ordered one today directly from Facial Flex and threw this one in the trash.</li>
            <li>I am 43 yrs old about 5’4 140lbs, no one in my family is overweight or has a double chin.</li>
            <li>I have now purchased my 3rd one and so far it is performing well.  </li>
            <li>But I am sure of it made my marionette lines worse.</li>
            <li>Wish my family had said something sooner than they did that my face was looking worse, but glad they spoke when they did.</li>
            <li>holes too big or loose, as a resuIt it tilts and doesn&#x27;t stay straight on both sides of mouth.</li>
            <li>A simple device like this shouldn&#x27;t cost more than $5 especially since it&#x27;s been in the market for a very long time and with very little changes.</li>
            <li>Also maybe the smile lines on one side next to my mouth may be a little deeper.  </li>
            <li>all of a sudden, I developed a double chin!!</li>
            <li>This little gadget when used consistently works wonders.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just beginning to see those C folds right next to my nose, and I was hoping that this product would help to firm that up.</li>
            <li>it tightens the jaw, works on lines around the mouth, not sure yet about the laugh lines -</li>
            <li>My cheeks have certainly lifted and oddly it seems like my overbite is miraculously fixing itself.</li>
            <li>the first week you use it, you will notice your lips feel stiff.</li>
            <li>I am 56 and when I tell people I have been teaching for 32 years, no one believes I could be old enough to have worked that long.  </li>
            <li>Second One - Misplaced my first one after 2 years of use...</li>
            <li>The first few times I did this there was a definite tightening in the jaw area and a feeling of fullness in my lips.</li>
            <li>If used correctly and consistently, it does firm the jaw, chin and overall firmness of the face.  </li>
            <li>I could see a subtle but significant difference almost immediately, and increased improvement with every subsequent use.</li>
            <li>it fine, what do i do if it get broken?</li>
            <li>I really like this little miracle gadget .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I loved it!</li>
            <li> Price paid was comparable, so happy with that aspect of the purchase too.</li>
            <li> My cheeks and jowls get a great workout.</li>

            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> If it does, great---</li>
            <li> so I started with Neckline Slimmer which does work great</li>
            <li> Do research before putting in your mouth and if you do, proceed with great caution.</li>
            <li> was definitely a great buy and  would recommend it as part of your anti-aging regime.g regime.</li>
            <li> HAPPY TO RECEIVE THE UNIT AND</li>
            <li> If used every day faithly the results can be great.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li> 2 minutes a day for huge improvement!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick shipping and came in a very nice container.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li> And no, I don&#x27;t own stock or anything, I just think this is a brilliant product.</li>
            <li> No risky cosmetic surgery for remarkable improvement.  </li>
            <li> Again, be your own boss in determining the ideal frequency of exercising.  </li>
            <li> I took before and after photos, but even without examining them, the changes has been fairly remarkable.</li>
            <li> I also recommend reading The Beauty Detox by Kimberly Synder and Forever Beautiful by Natalia Rose.</li>
            <li> I can tell this device is not going to do much good.  </li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good age.</li>
            <li> It feels good when I am done using it 3 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> Not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> I am not against the device because I believe this might be a good  stuff  </li>
            <li> seem good</li>
            <li> Quality of the product is good.</li>
            <li> Seems lie a good product</li>
            <li> one can get some good results.</li>
            <li> I have been using it fairly faithfully for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Good color to your skin because of the increased circulation.</li>
            <li> , it feels so good to feel my face taut and fit!!</li>
            <li> Love this thing works great.</li>
            <li> but once you begin using it consistently you will discover just how wonderful this works.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> okay!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> so I remembered how much I liked it and wanted another one and just got this, I am VERY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Everything arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I received this on time, but would have liked directions included with this.</li>
            <li> Works great - Fast shipping - Great item</li>
            <li> but I know this will cause more damage than good.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> It has toned my cheeks and as a nice surprise, has plumped my lips and reduced my lip lines.  </li>
            <li> I liked my mouth before and</li>
            <li> I had it for many years and loved it.</li>
            <li> So, I googled this product and found more good reviews, so I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick ship.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy .</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My face feels nice and relax after use. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use !</li>
            <li> Absolutely love, love love love this!</li>
            <li> After 2 months of consistent use, all line around my mouth are gone, and jaw and neck area have improved greatly.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and results are really appreciative</li>
            <li> Our good friend Amazon sells all of these products with really quick shipping.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put two bands on for more resistance.</li>
            <li> It comes with two levels of resistance but greater resistance bands can be ordered separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, because this device mimics smiling until your cheeks feel it, it has a powerful effect on stimulating the muscles of your face to make your brain perceive that you are smiling, and that has been shown to improve feel good chemicals in the brain, read the article from July 31 2012  in Psychology</li>
            <li> I think it will take longer to get the full benefit, but I am already very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The exercise is mainly good for the smile area and perhaps will have longer term effect on the marionette lines.</li>
            <li> Will write a better review about a two month use</li>
            <li> If I see any difference I will surely amend this review.</li>
            <li> If you look at the before and after photos, it seems to work by adjusting the jawline--the jaw sticks out more in the after photos and that seems to soften the lines around the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I see where this could work better if I used it as I should</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Dont do an O, make sure you form your mouth in an oval instead.</li>
            <li> i do feel a tightening as soon as im finished with my reps, so maybe just more time is all i need.</li>
            <li> Im sure</li>
            <li> When I found the Facial-Flex on Amazon, I thought I would give it a try and am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, pleased with this gadget and will keep using it and hope to see results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to do 5 minutes for each session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth is more upturned too.</li>
            <li> I love this product helps me exercise my face</li>
            <li> Face does look better and firmer.</li>
            <li> Neck looks better.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for one I have had for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting to me that so many people like this product.</li>
            <li> I started with Flexeffect, which is a hands on resistance system that works wonders, but takes more time each day to do.  </li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles became more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I cannot be 100% sure yet.</li>
            <li> Every work out makes me feel like I put a dime away; and someday I will have checks that I purchased without surgery :)</li>
            <li> makes my face look 100% more tone...</li>
            <li> Interesting product.</li>
            <li> My face muscles have changed but im not quite sure</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> bands, about 120 reps (or more) a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> The produce itself is not working smoothly at all!  </li>
            <li> ok, wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work,  </li>
            <li> But I read reviews as I am sure you are doing and thought what the heck couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> The face has many muscles.</li>
            <li> if you try to do too many repetitions too soon, you will develop a neck/headache.  </li>
            <li> I use the tightest of three rubber band strengths and admittedly am faithful to exercise 120 times most days.</li>
            <li> But it does more than that</li>
            <li> Great results, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li> It was safely packaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;denise :)</li>
            <li> a while I think, its challenging.</li>
            <li> My chin area and mouth look better, my jowl has more definition.</li>
            <li> I feel the burn more when I squeeze my lips in and &amp;#34;out&amp;#34;, like you&#x27;re trying to kiss someone just out of reach.</li>
            <li> This design is better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> need to use more often - can tell it is working.</li>
            <li> and I Love Love it.</li>
            <li> but my fuller lips do look a lot more youthful and sexy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Ok, I waited to review this item because I wanted to give it a chance to work.</li>
            <li> What I found is that I feel more definition  around my jawline, and chin.</li>
            <li> Love this gadget.</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow video so to not deepen lip lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3O days and my  jaw has more definition.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Either in the directions or a video of the &amp;#34;Facial-Flex Ultra&amp;#34;, it is stated that after six weeks, most people notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.  :-)</li>
            <li> Your skin looks healthy, virbrate and</li>
            <li> The results are just as good as when I first used it...</li>
            <li> This item is good for tightening muscles in the face when using on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the 2 minutes it takes in the morning and evening!!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase and very lucky</li>
            <li> ,I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Simple and extraordinary invention !</li>
            <li> that was a better fit.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product although you do have to be careful with washing the product as it can make the plastic part that holds it together flimsy and break off....</li>
            <li> When I was using it, didn&#x27;t realize it was causing so many jaw problems - couldn&#x27;t close my mouth comfortably.</li>
            <li> (O: this one seems nice enough, its NOT gold plated but it will do what I want it to do and after using it again for about 5 days I am SO THRILLED to have it again!</li>
            <li> good price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Nicely made and worth the money...</li>
            <li> good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> this is a great, easy, and natural way to do it.</li>
            <li> - I have already recommended it to several friends (though they laughed at me after seeing the video on youtube of how to use!)</li>
            <li> Works as designed and it fun :) :)</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use my Amazon account that I ordered this time from here.</li>
            <li> It work and easy for you to practice.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it takes under five minutes.</li>
            <li> Its strong and flexible.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed this product in particular had hundreds of good reviews.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s good to flush blood thru normally stagnant areas of the cheeks.</li>
            <li> i m doing very good with it, but remember drink plenty of water before you do cuz it may dry your mouth while exercising.</li>
            <li> The device itself is fine</li>
            <li> Seems fine.</li>
            <li> so these implements really help me to care for my self in a really satisfying way!</li>
            <li> obviously the quality control has been greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> I have people now telling me I look fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Great exercise for lower face and neck…use it regularly {every day} and you&#x27;ll feel the the tightness under your chin and your jowls will vanish</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s more fun to do it to the beat while I&#x27;m listening to music opposed to standing in the mirror for 5 minutes counting.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Great for facial exercises.</li>
            <li> An intermediate resistance should be available.  </li>
            <li> An intermediate resistance should be available.  </li>
            <li> It actually filled in the lines (they&#x27;re gone)</li>
            <li> Smile more instead.</li>
            <li> No instructions or chart and cheap case that will not close.</li>
            <li> I enjoy working out, so If I workout for my body</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about how motivated you are to get fit.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for maintaining a contoured jawline, if used as directed</li>
            <li> ; free.  </li>
            <li> Great for facial strengthening.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I think I will dig it out &amp; start using it again as I&#x27;m sure it works when you use it the right way.</li>
            <li> It is very good for muscles of the face, the face tightens and becomes thinner , and younger, I like it very much</li>
            <li> My jaw line has more definition, my cheeks are more shapely and thinner, my eyes and upper forehead feel more taut and my eyes feel more open and bright.</li>
            <li> Still, this is an amazing product &amp;  I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> She is a very beautiful African American woman, because of her, before &amp; after pictures and very detailed instructions</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it</li>
            <li> I purchased the original and had it for years</li>
            <li> but really excited about this product.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product originally from QVC.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited about this device.</li>
            <li> I will say after only 2 weeks I have seen remarkable improvement.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I then followed the instructions to clean the device.</li>
            <li> I did find that I needed to quickly change to the mid-strength resistance bands which helped tone more just like a higher weight would.</li>
            <li> I just started using it yesterday, so I can&#x27;t say yet what the benefits will be for sure, but I can certainly feel it working the muscles in my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just very just appointed  in the latest manufacturing process</li>
            <li> This really works love it</li>
            <li> This is a good facial exerciser .I</li>
            <li> , I can see a real difference when I do as many reps</li>
            <li> I thought that this was a good item, but it broke within 5 weeks of daily usage.</li>
            <li> And that just aint cool.</li>
            <li> A soft jawline (to put it nicely) runs in my family.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 6 weeks to show full effects, or did with me.</li>
            <li> I think consistency is the key to good results.</li>
            <li> It is too tiny to do much good for me.  </li>
            <li> this is my second one, I lost my original one, so glad to be able to find another</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> To be fair, I think my cheek bones are looking a little more defined, but because of what I mentioned I&#x27;m scared to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s awesome to tone your facial muscles</li>
            <li> I feel like I have done something worthy for myself.</li>
            <li> great product it really does tightening up your face muscles, my face looks younger.</li>
            <li> After abouy six months of using this producy, my double chin and face fat are gone, and my cheekbones are more prominent.</li>
            <li> , then I would highly recommend this product, it could make you feel a lot better about yourself.  </li>
            <li> Had one that I purchased from QVC years and years ago - it finally broke, and because I do NOT want to look my age, I was very glad to find one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied after several months of use.  </li>
            <li> Like anything else-Stay consistent!</li>
            <li> Remember, I&#x27;m using it constantly when at home,I rest it, then go again, I&#x27;m enjoying it so why stop!  </li>
            <li> I had hoped to post some before and after photos to show my results, but I haven&#x27;t found any good &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; shots yet, as I usually do not keep photos where I look old and haggard.</li>
            <li> At 51 years ago, I&#x27;m saving that money and loving this magical little device.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that produces real results</li>
            <li> I can only hope I get 1/2 the amazing results</li>
            <li> Some Smile Therapy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Education is powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my facial flex.</li>
            <li> This tiny device, along with a good moisturizer, really made a difference in my look.</li>
            <li> It does require commitment, it becomes like brushing your teeth, worth it and worth the time.  </li>
            <li> Hope it was worth the money</li>
            <li> I imagine it&#x27;s worth about $4 including the cost of postage.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Worth a try to fight turkey neck.</li>
            <li> to see if it is worth continuing using it.</li>
            <li> its worth it</li>
            <li> 10 days with this device and the lines are completely gone - and I have substantially more lip showing.  </li>
            <li> However, for me it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Facial Flex awhile back hoping to improve a burgeoning turkey neck, and loved the results after just a week!  </li>
            <li> I will probably get it from another seller next time, and make sure it originally sealed.</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty quick after I ordered ..</li>
            <li> Extraordinarily, my lips have pouffed up and are very rosy!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything to significantly tighten around the mouth.</li>
            <li> After using this for the first couple times - once in the evening, and then again the next morning -- my mom, unprompted and with no knowledge that I&#x27;d used Facial-Flex said, -- &#x27;Wow, your face looks really great.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m doing it right</li>
            <li> Right.</li>
            <li> I may order another, but I can&#x27;t afford it right now.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one from QVC and returned it for this reason but they were kind enough to give me a refund.</li>
            <li> If your life has been stressful and full of one thing after another and your face shows it because you just don&#x27;t smile that much anymore</li>
            <li> Fortunately I was able to find the YouTube video I had originally seen, that had me trying to track this item down to buy.</li>
            <li> I love it, and the results are amazing if you use it properly and do it twice daily.</li>
            <li> Sad I had read so many great reviews</li>
            <li> I do a few of these in combination with the Facial Flex for best results.  </li>
            <li> However, facial muscles are not like biceps and facial structure varies greatly from person to person.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this little gizmo would work, but I can definitely feel the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; (a good thing) and see a difference.  </li>
            <li> My first unit lasted about eight years no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchase this product, its simple to use.</li>
            <li> The product really works!</li>
            <li> Pouting movements over and over, with no resistance will eventually create thinner upper lip and more feathered lips.</li>
            <li> You just need to be consistent with the exercises if you stop doing them, everything will be like before.</li>
            <li> I felt my face muscles work the first time I used it, but then nothing after that.</li>
            <li> This works but you have to be consistent with the use of the product.  </li>
            <li> that if I make this a regular scheduled routine that my face and neck would have more definition.</li>
            <li> I love the Facial Flex Ultra</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more because I had lost the last one that I had..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a smooth action.</li>
            <li> I saw improvement in the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Got the product fast !</li>
            <li> It does make a difference if used consistently.</li>
            <li> will help you to maintain a healthy younger looking face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a 3 weeks consistently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful that it will only get better with continued use.</li>
            <li> well, i don&#x27;t have wrinkles to know if the wrinkles are going away or not, but my face is definitely slimmer with more of a contour to the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I believe this exercise does really help !</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love and continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love and continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li> It seems to do exactly what they say it does.</li>
            <li> I like to use it while looking in the mirror to make sure I have the correct form, but that is not necessary.</li>
            <li> and I have been gradually moving to a higher strenght.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first bands.</li>
            <li> It actually works wonders and keep your neck and face well toned but not all muscle bound looking just mot sagging and cute.</li>
            <li> I think this might be better for the jowls, lower jaw and neck fat only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive and it already feelss like it is working.</li>
            <li> but after years of use, you will see great results - I gave four stars only because I have not had it for long</li>
            <li> It had better last</li>
            <li> I have only had this brilliant contraption for less than a week.  </li>
            <li> There were two women (more than that really, but these particular women I could completely identify with) who shared their stories and even demonstrated how to use it.  </li>
            <li> Very nice small device - go for it!</li>
            <li> I love the facial flex ultra, it really tones up the face muscles.</li>
            <li> They are taking advantage of the lack of good competition in the market since the chinese copies have proven to be really low quality.</li>
            <li> I do see the benefit of it, if it could actually expand enough to do any good.</li>
            <li> so that was definitely a positive aspect of the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was reviewing neck creams and saw this product after reading all the positive reviews I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Heck, if you roll your eyes way up and lift your lower eyelids a bit while you use the Facial Flex, you&#x27;ll even get tightening below the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $35, there simply isn&#x27;t a better value in facial anti-aging available.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it too long - read too many reviews that said it causes wrinkles</li>
            <li> It really works if your consistent with it as i am .</li>
            <li> Its not hard and well worth the time and investment.</li>
            <li> And doing those only takes a couple minutes per day as well, but you can actually feel the muscles working with that nice tingly burn that tells you you&#x27;re on the right track.</li>
            <li> My own problem is that I get bored with things very easily.</li>
            <li> The rubber bands last a while and are easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought my Facial Flex from QVC over a decade ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> It certainly is a workout, and it has toned up my face.  </li>
            <li> should add that I think you have to have a certain type of problem for this to work.</li>
            <li> I can literally feel my muscles tightening on certain parts of my face.</li>
            <li> This is a little more fun.</li>
            <li> This really works the jowl &amp; neck area.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see really works.</li>
            <li> I really hope this works for me to get ride of my nasolabial folds.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel it &#x27;working&#x27; the muscles in my face, even when I used the &#x27;highest tension band&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a whole week&#x27;s use though, I did notice it gets easier and hence feels like the rubberband that allows the movement to work needs to be \\&quot;tightened\\&quot; somehow since our muscle is used to it, it almost seems like it&#x27;s too \\&quot;easy\\&quot; on the muscle...hard to explain...</li>
            <li> and my face has really thinned out.</li>
            <li> While researching the web I came upon the Facial-Flex and after reading the product description and the reasonable price, I decided to purchase one.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really changed, but it was holding.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t really care if anyone sees).  </li>
            <li> You really do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing a whole lot of difference</li>
            <li> I use it for a fast 1 minute session, 2 sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work for someone else, but this was WAY too wide for my mouth.</li>
            <li> these are very durable...</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li> but I have to tell ya, the creams may help, but really didn&#x27;t see a difference yet.  </li>
            <li> but this, I got about a week ago, and I use as much as I can,  2 to 4 times a day.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not, however, the whole ball of wax.  </li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t think it was working until I saw pictures of me over the holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was wondering why it cost so much.</li>
            <li> My face feels like its gotten a gentle workout.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> My cheeks and chin have really started to sag.</li>
            <li> My jaw and cheeks have definitely firmed up, and filled out.</li>
            <li> Time will tell f the product really works.</li>
            <li> My whole face has lifted.  </li>
            <li> My neck, under the chin area, jaw-line and cheeks are all very sore...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using facial flex for many months, nearly 2 years.  </li>
            <li> So far I have noticed more fullnes in my upper lip that had just started thinning out.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this on QVC then lost it so came here to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> I read several product reviews before purchasing this item and was not disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I also had some extra skin under my neck that would wrinkle when I turned my head, but that wasn&#x27;t a significant waddle.</li>
            <li> It was originally presented as a product used to help victims of stroke-damaged facial muscles.  </li>
            <li> Updating that my bottom mouth lines never went away, even have a small one on the top right similar to the where the plastic piece fit.</li>
            <li> I jumped to using the 8oz bands and quickly went back to the 6oz because my mouth was not yet ready for this intense exercise.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I believe that the facial flex helped somewhat because, after reading another reviewer comments, I began to use both my hands by touching the sides of my eyes with my fingers and gently pulling back (and up) the skin while performing the exercises.</li>
            <li> not sure if I can honestly recommend it.</li>
            <li> like when it feels like my actual facial muscles are in good shape, im 57 and our &amp;#34;family&amp;#34; has that sort of slavic facial structure that lends itself well to sagging from the weight of those generations of digging potatoes up from under the frozen tundra ... for dinner.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re willing to put in the efford (which is not much, a few minutes a day) you will get results.</li>
            <li> and I got a second unit recently which I&#x27;m hoping will have better productivity.</li>
            <li> Over exertion could actually result in more feather lines, in areas on upper lip.</li>
            <li> I thought since this is more expensive it will be better.  </li>
            <li> i started using it 2 days ago, morning and night for 2 min each, the first i noticed was the headache i get after using it, still early to tell, maybe this is normal since the muscles started working , will give it a week and share my experience</li>
            <li> Not to mention quick results (like starting to notice improvements within days, not months).</li>
            <li> Realistic expectations are also helpful.....</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend....</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Notice a little more contour around chin area.  </li>
            <li> and I can see my cheeks more firm .</li>
            <li> The product is a nice facial work out ... but really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to witness the effects, but it&#x27;s like exercise ..</li>
            <li> The facial flex paired with &#x27;the neck line trimmer&#x27; are a powerful duo.</li>
            <li> If it did nothing else, Facial Flex would be useful just for improved circulation and skin tone.  </li>
            <li> but it actually caused additional deepness within one of my laugh lines.  </li>
            <li> That is just normal muscle spasms after not working out that part of my body in that way... ever.</li>
            <li> - I have deep smile lines</li>
            <li> I will be 59 next week and this little gizmo has taken some years off me for sure!</li>
            <li> It looks as ridiculous as I felt buying it, but I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I lost mine traveling and so ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> replacement - needed new one.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy little device that does exactly what you would expect - works the middle third of your face where the &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; of the exercise takes place.  </li>
            <li> The reasons I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is that, first it&#x27;s obviously overpriced.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it seems pretty well made and came with the extra rubber bands.</li>
            <li> Second set as I lost my first one...</li>
            <li> The Facial Flex worked the first day, I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> Bought my first one 7 years ago and it finally broke so ordered another.</li>
            <li> I had a firmer neck, reduced facial fat, plus higher and rosier cheeks...</li>
            <li> My first facial flex broke.</li>
            <li> Too many people work the other muscles of the body and forget that they have facial muscles.</li>
            <li> Bought a second from Amazon in case I break or lose the first.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a second, backup for my first one.</li>
            <li> Her name starts with the same two letters of my first name)  </li>
            <li> WOW, just what I have been searching for!</li>
            <li> I may be using it incorrectly, because I&#x27;m lazy and in a hurry most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one I used regularly and it lasted about 12 years.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement after about 3 weeks of twice daily use, and my smile lines actually look a little more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I used the small bands the first day, and continued to use the device on and off that whole first day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking cute, little double chin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m deducting one star is that I feel the claims for the device (when used by itself) are somewhat exaggerated and that the leap from 8 oz to 14 oz resistance bans is too great.  </li>
            <li> Not so much with Facial Concepts service.</li>
            <li> It has tightened up my face near my nostrils and the corners of my mouth as well as my neck and under my chin.  </li>
            <li> I am 63 years old (I feel 40 on the inside!!)&lt;br /&gt;PS  </li>
            <li> As someone who is almost 68 years of age, I have developed some jowls and lower jaw issues</li>
            <li> so it too early to tell if there are any substantial results however I&#x27;m using it twice a day as instructed</li>
            <li> I couldnt order another one fast enough.</li>
            <li> I have owned this device for 6 weeks, and I have to say I am really surprised with how well it works.</li>
            <li> The device seems to be very well made and it did come with extra bands so you can change them out each week as indicated in the instructions included.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful about this product but it is too early to give a review.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Facial Flex is a very convenient and time-saving way to get bang for your buck in working the middle of the face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some scratches on the two parts that go directly into the mouth, but I thought  for some reason, it  was  manufactured just like that.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how much of a transformation in the next 60 days.</li>
            <li> This product far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t activated my TMJ.</li>
            <li> very discouraging, wish I could send it back for a refund, regret ordering it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete rip off.  </li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> This tool really helps with tightening your facial muscles and your chin definition.</li>
            <li> BUT IT&#x27;S TOO EARLY TO SEE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I am wondering since I do have such success with it if some possibly didn&#x27;t want it out.</li>
            <li> but honestly think some wrinkles are getting worse.</li>
            <li> My face is thinner and my neck lines are slowly looking so much better.</li>
            <li> I often wonder how authentic these reviews really are, because, I feel like I keep wasting money on false hope.</li>
            <li> When I examined the Facial Flex I saw the difference between the right side that goes into the mouth and the left.</li>
            <li> After stopping for awhile, my jaw is now back to normal and it&#x27;s a relief!</li>
            <li> The facial flex is better than other facial exercisers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s true I can see such a big differences with my laugh lines the facial flex along with your regular facial regimen</li>
            <li> I like being hands free to do my other facial exercise during that two min!</li>
            <li> I call my Facial Flex, my little miracle!  :-)</li>
            <li> ; I guess it&#x27;s the same concept as toning your muscles everywhere else, by using this to help stretch and contract your facial muscles, over time, it&#x27;ll be more toned and less prone to sagging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to buy two units with in the last four months because the first one did notfunction properly and broke within a month</li>
            <li> In my second week I received complements on how my face looked toned and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I like the concept but the value for money is not worth its very plastic , the picture  shows it as very premium</li>
            <li> - it is awkward at first to use, but I was used to it after about 3 or 4 times - it is one of those items that seems you will need to use consistently for good results - I use in morning and evening when I brush my teeth (or when I dry my hair) and plan on using it continuously going forward as it seems to be one of those that you may not see a big difference in the short term</li>
            <li> This device did, however, get me back in the habit of doing my facial exercises from 2 books that I own, so there&#x27;s that, at least.</li>
            <li> story, short-----it accentuated the wrinkles I was trying to get rid of and it has taken over 2 1/2 weeks to get my face back to as normal as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd facial flex,  this one is not as comfortable as my other one, but I have to say this works</li>
            <li> If the motion appears to be deepening creases or causing new wrinkles, either modify the way you&#x27;re performing the exercise or do something different.  </li>
            <li> It was very well packaged and has enough pressure bands to last for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> My results are very apparent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a major difference in anything yet but it will take time to do so.</li>
            <li> I am a Massage Therapist, so I understand the process of re-building a muscle, and I know that as I have aged, my facial muscles are &amp;#34;slack&amp;#34; so this is just the right thing to resolve that situation.</li>
            <li> The right was thicker and very smooth and the left was quite thin and had an extremely rough edge.</li>
            <li> There are enough programs out there that you can improve your facial tone once you find the particular exercises that work for you.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell about ultimate results</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending me two complete sealed Facial Flex Ultra kits from the photo on Amazon</li>
            <li> This has barely any resistance to it.  </li>
            <li> I realized I could mimic this same action with two fingers spacing my lips apart, so did not need the device to do that.</li>
            <li> Have been using Facial Flex for years and have always ordered from the company directly.</li>
            <li> Ordered one today directly from Facial Flex and threw this one in the trash.</li>
            <li> I am 43 yrs old about 5’4 140lbs, no one in my family is overweight or has a double chin.</li>
            <li> I have now purchased my 3rd one and so far it is performing well.  </li>
            <li> But I am sure of it made my marionette lines worse.</li>
            <li> Wish my family had said something sooner than they did that my face was looking worse, but glad they spoke when they did.</li>
            <li> holes too big or loose, as a resuIt it tilts and doesn&#x27;t stay straight on both sides of mouth.</li>
            <li> A simple device like this shouldn&#x27;t cost more than $5 especially since it&#x27;s been in the market for a very long time and with very little changes.</li>
            <li> Also maybe the smile lines on one side next to my mouth may be a little deeper.  </li>
            <li> all of a sudden, I developed a double chin!!</li>
            <li> This little gadget when used consistently works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just beginning to see those C folds right next to my nose, and I was hoping that this product would help to firm that up.</li>
            <li> it tightens the jaw, works on lines around the mouth, not sure yet about the laugh lines -</li>
            <li> My cheeks have certainly lifted and oddly it seems like my overbite is miraculously fixing itself.</li>
            <li> the first week you use it, you will notice your lips feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I am 56 and when I tell people I have been teaching for 32 years, no one believes I could be old enough to have worked that long.  </li>
            <li> Second One - Misplaced my first one after 2 years of use...</li>
            <li> The first few times I did this there was a definite tightening in the jaw area and a feeling of fullness in my lips.</li>
            <li> If used correctly and consistently, it does firm the jaw, chin and overall firmness of the face.  </li>
            <li> I could see a subtle but significant difference almost immediately, and increased improvement with every subsequent use.</li>
            <li> it fine, what do i do if it get broken?</li>
            <li> I really like this little miracle gadget .</li>
            <li> [...] I suspect the good reviews of this product are fake and please read all the other reviews carefully.</li>
            <li> as I can till facial fatigue, your cheekbones really stand out and your face looks firm!</li>
            <li> It has not be long enough for me to know if it will help with the firmness and facial lines that I have</li>
            <li> Very helpful little device!  </li>
            <li> Getting the product seems to take much longer than in the past.</li>
            <li> In the past 2 years I have really started to hit the downhill slope.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t try it out for long enough, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Need to start using this again as I was on long holiday - think it helps with facial muscles, we&#x27;ll see how it goes have to start all over again!</li>
            <li> I found the daily routine took too long,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and thin, but have always had full cheeks.</li>
            <li> I started using the Facial Flex and noticed less wiggle to my wattle after the first few days.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this a few months ago because I began a new regimen</li>
            <li> I REALLY do not want to get a face lift and NOT be in control of my facial future!</li>
            <li> must hve tool for getting tight and young looking skin..</li>
            <li> When using Facial Flex or doing other facial exercises, look in the mirror while exercising and afterward.  </li>
            <li> This is a middle aged jowl buster.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long</li>
            <li> Really strange contraption that I thought might help with wrinkles</li>
            <li> So this is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I think it works and it doesn&#x27;t take that long.</li>
            <li> I feel my smile lines are much worse....</li>
            <li> My facial muscles get super tired after I do this a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This has lifted my cheeks back up toward my cheek bone, which is beginning to cover dark circles which I have been plagued with.  </li>
            <li> and I kept what I had, plus continued to do some flex effect for the upper face which cut my time down.  </li>
            <li> I have used it less than 2 weeks, and already my lips seem fuller, they have color back in them.  </li>
            <li> One of the two small plastic pieces that holds the rubber band broke off when I was trying to change it, rendering the device useless, and I hadn&#x27;t even used it that many times.</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s a little improvement starting in some places</li>
            <li> So about 2X&#x27;s a day I&#x27;ll pop it in and do roughly 2 rounds of 60.</li>
            <li> It only requires a few mins a day and you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> It is usable but too wide for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was sooner than expected</li>
            <li> i stopped using it for the last few weeks</li>
            <li> I know you have to be careful to make an oval shape, not an &#x27;o&#x27; shape.  </li>
            <li> tighten — like firm skin that is a lot younger.</li>
            <li> I have not however found any other product that tightens the jawline or brings fullness back to lips like this little gadget.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does the trick in less time than it takes to watch a television commercial.</li>
            <li> It may look silly, but works very, very well.</li>
            <li> Very little time and effort to use daily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to review this, because I started a heavy regimen of facial exercise with multiple devices.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews with skepticism.  </li>
            <li> The lower weight bands were too flimsy (resistance-wise) and doubling them up made it way too difficult, as did using the higher weight bands.</li>
            <li> I do other exercises</li>
            <li> Not worth the money spent at all.</li>
            <li> Exercise those facial muscles that otherwise would be hard to work with your hands.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for one week so hard to tell how well it works, but I feel tighter in jaw line and nasolabial lines</li>
            <li> Only used this a few times not sure I like it yet</li>
            <li> slowly came back.</li>
            <li> so, just look down at any mirror</li>
            <li> that come down from my nose and frame the mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already difficult just to jam this device in and since my mouth is even smaller than its stretched (closed) position,that left me very little exercising space!</li>
            <li> It works very hard, not smoothly like the old one.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend, who is kinda chubby, has a face with less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I do feel slight tighting under my chin area.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing wrinkles around my lips, wrinkles in the skin below my cheek bones, and slight jowls along my jaw.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; quite as smoothly as my previous one.</li>
            <li> You can tell this item had been used by someone previously.</li>
            <li> My cheeks looks firmer and my mouth looks/feels slightly fuller.</li>
            <li> I had lost my previous flex which I had for years.  </li>
            <li> I went online in an attempt to put this back in position and the instructions were so bad and seem more complicated than they should have been.  </li>
            <li> So that was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> With a cotton ball or your finger rub a little bit of olive oil on.</li>
            <li> believe this made a difference, but it was not significant  for what I needed (under eye issues).</li>
            <li> so i am 26 and got this to just start working on antiaging and also to make my face a little slimmer.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a little over a month and have seen results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retired, use little make up, this is my little vanity.  </li>
            <li> and they give you a ton of the little rubber bands with it too</li>
            <li> Sucked didn&#x27;t work waste of money</li>
            <li> Being a thin person, has actually worked against me, because my face has lost a lot off adipose tissue (which is fat).  </li>
            <li> Will post in a few weeks on the effects of using it.</li>
            <li> I just moved and has misplaced it so</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day everyday for over two months and would do125.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I misplaced the device and the turkey neck</li>
            <li> I do used a lot for everyday to keep excercise face.</li>
            <li> but I gave it five stars because my face is firm and</li>
            <li> after using face-flex for a few months now, I think its working</li>
            <li> I think my kids have a few prize shots that should be floating around</li>
            <li> I have been using this Facial-Flex for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Broke within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I bought it and used it for a few weeks and was hooked when my neighbour looked at me and said that I looked \\&quot;different\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> If you want to waste your time and money, then buy it.</li>
            <li> Because I did not keep the paperwork, I feel I must keep it and wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this everyday</li>
            <li> anyway somewhere along the &amp;#34;path&amp;#34; it got misplaced and I haven&#x27;t had one for about 8 yrs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product.  </li>
            <li> ive just had product for a few days.</li>
            <li> it became too much trouble to use.</li>
            <li> that has made a dramatic improvement in  The appearance of my overall face vs.  isolated areas.</li>
            <li> bought this little thing to try out; been using it every nite for over a week now; Not sure if it&#x27;ll work or not, but saw reviews online that it has worked for people who&#x27;ve used it for years</li>
            <li> Being in my fifties the wrinkles and sagging skin are a given, but I wanted to try and find something to help me slow down the aging process a bit and maintain some elasticity.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive for what you actually get,</li>
            <li> I decided to check carefully what went wrong after watching other people videos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 in the past.</li>
            <li> Ill continue to use and update later with results!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a knock-off or</li>
            <li> I am still trying to use this on a regular basis; unfortunately the exercise seems to cause pain to my TMJ.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied...</li>
            <li> sorry I purchased and I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will keep updating but don&#x27;t waste your money on neck creams when you can get this!</li>
            <li> It is for people with small mouths.</li>
            <li> The before and after photos are unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> It is not a magic bullet, but It helps.  </li>
            <li> Before they looked grey to me and they were very thin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not against working hard to get the results you want, but I didn&#x27;t even feel the muscles in question working.</li>
            <li> My dimples were beginning to look a little tired, but now look springy and youthful.</li>
            <li> Lately my cheeks started sagging and I showed signs of saggy joules and downturn ed mouth.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 4 times a week and my jaws aren&#x27;t so droopy.</li>
            <li> The skin around my mouth started sagging being in my late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started slowly with using the beginner&#x27;s bands</li>
            <li> I am seeing results in less than a week and like using it, even though my boyfriend says it looks creepy...</li>
            <li> This thing works and not surprisingly.</li>
            <li> I saw a picture of myself before I started using the Facial Flex and was shocked.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, somehow it&#x27;s missing</li>
            <li> This new version is horribly made and not worth a penny!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed and sent the product back.</li>
            <li> Very hard to work.</li>
            <li> Frustrating to use&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the shipping time from this store.</li>
            <li> but I think the wrinkles are getting worse in others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even took the mattress off the bed and looked behind the bed to no avail.</li>
            <li> Have nasal folds &amp; using this device just 2 twice made them look worse.  </li>
            <li> it is not making my face tired at all</li>
            <li> Though I did NOT purchase this on Amazon, beware of this device, it causes swelling of the lower face, aggravates the jaws, creates mouth lines, and even worse - see this official report:</li>
            <li> Have used for approximately one month.</li>
            <li> I try not to be terribly vain, but to be honest, it was horrifying</li>
            <li> For those who are skeptical like me, I can tell you that this product WORKS as a charm.</li>
            <li> Could it be that I am going through medically induced menopause or am I just ageing horribly..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, when I placed it between my lips, it doesn&#x27;t extend fully as it should, even if I compress and release it.</li>
            <li> Prepare to look really silly when doing the excercise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using creams (some expensive, some not), but was noticing that it&#x27;s not just the superficial skin changes that are doing me in.</li>
            <li> I merely found out about it on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> It is quite expensive when you consider what it&#x27;s made of.  </li>
            <li> or I will be submitting an angry review.</li>
            <li> I am using it at least twice a day to work on my jaw line which is begining to sag :(</li>
            <li> I used this for awhile and started to feel very uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> The product arrived with no instructions and a badly designed case that can&#x27;t accommodate the device.</li>
            <li> and I have notices how badly it hurts the ends of my mouth and already can see how wrinkles can form if I continue this.</li>
            <li> painful, drool when I try to use it,</li>
            <li> I was a tad SHOCKED at the price, but</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this one.  </li>
            <li> I hate exercising.  </li>
            <li> This crazy thing works!!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  </li>
            <li> Horrible quality.  </li>
            <li> This is the cheapest, worst product I ever ordered from Amazon.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Had one that I purchased from QVC years and years ago - it finally broke, and because I do NOT want to look my age, I was very glad to find one on Amazon.  Price paid was comparable, so happy with that aspect of the purchase too.</li>
            <li> The device itself is fine but it didn&#x27;t come with the pamphlet that tells you how to use, progress, etc. So I had to go to the intranet to even know the proper technique to use it.  There were just the 6 &amp; 8 tension rubber bands. So that was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> The facial flex works as promised so I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. Not so much with Facial Concepts service. The product arrived with no instructions and a badly designed case that can&#x27;t accommodate the device. I emailed Facial Concepts 3 weeks ago with my concerns and have yet to receive a reply.</li>
            <li> Face exercises are part of my beauty routine, but this thing broke after just four months.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about a mouth and found my facial muscles and neck are beginnning to tightened.</li>
            <li> The price was in line with what this product does..I purchase 4 of them to share with clients. They all say that it works well and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This facial-flex does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 in the past. Two of them my dog got ahold of.  Love them. My cheeks and jowls get a great workout. I think I notice a difference. Sometimes I put two bands on for more resistance. With a cotton ball or your finger rub a little bit of olive oil on. I noticed my facial flex hesitated a bit. I guess you can use any edible oil.</li>
            <li> I love the facial flex ultra, it really tones up the face muscles. I lost mine traveling and so ordered a new one. It never came, and no one seems to know what happened, so I am currently without.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick ship.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love it, and the results are amazing if you use it properly and do it twice daily. After 2 months of consistent use, all line around my mouth are gone, and jaw and neck area have improved greatly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years. My first unit lasted about eight years no problems. I&#x27;ve had to buy two units with in the last four months because the first one did notfunction properly and broke within a month and I got a second unit recently which I&#x27;m hoping will have better productivity. I do believe in the product. I&#x27;m just very just appointed  in the latest manufacturing process obviously the quality control has been greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Facial-Flex for several weeks now and I&#x27;m impressed with it.  It certainly is a workout, and it has toned up my face.  It has tightened up my face near my nostrils and the corners of my mouth as well as my neck and under my chin.  It has improved the blood flow throughout my face and as a result my skin tone looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Facial-Flex isn&#x27;t built like a tank but it&#x27;s not flimsy either.  The rubber bands last a while and are easy to replace.  It comes with two levels of resistance but greater resistance bands can be ordered separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Facial-Flex won&#x27;t make you look 10 years younger but it&#x27;s definitely a great product that works as described.</li>
            <li> There was no instructions or booklet included as stated..just winging it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchase this product, its simple to use. Its too soon see results, however  I can definitely feel it working the facial muscles. My face feels nice and relax after use. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Everything arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thank you! 😊</li>
            <li> The product really works!</li>
            <li> This thing works and not surprisingly. If you&#x27;ve ever done weightlifting you know that resistance causes muscle growth. The reasons I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is that, first it&#x27;s obviously overpriced. A simple device like this shouldn&#x27;t cost more than $5 especially since it&#x27;s been in the market for a very long time and with very little changes. They are taking advantage of the lack of good competition in the market since the chinese copies have proven to be really low quality. Second, instead of having 6oz and 8oz bands, they could have included 4oz and 6oz bands and then you could have 2oz increments in your resistance. For example, by including two 4oz bands you&#x27;d get 8oz, and then by combining a 4oz and a 6oz, you&#x27;d get 10oz, and so on.</li>
            <li> elastics kep breaking</li>
            <li> Sucked didn&#x27;t work waste of money</li>
            <li> Works as designed and it fun :) :)</li>
            <li> This thing rocks.  I am seeing results in less than a week and like using it, even though my boyfriend says it looks creepy... for some reason, it does bring Hannibal Lecter&#x27;s mask to mind, but whatever!  Facial Flex FTW!!!</li>
            <li> this thing is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews with skepticism.  However by using it twice a day I have people now telling me I look fantastic.  This has lifted my cheeks back up toward my cheek bone, which is beginning to cover dark circles which I have been plagued with.  If your life has been stressful and full of one thing after another and your face shows it because you just don&#x27;t smile that much anymore, then I would highly recommend this product, it could make you feel a lot better about yourself.  In addition, because this device mimics smiling until your cheeks feel it, it has a powerful effect on stimulating the muscles of your face to make your brain perceive that you are smiling, and that has been shown to improve feel good chemicals in the brain, read the article from July 31 2012  in Psychology Today called &amp;#34;Try Some Smile Therapy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this thing works great. I can see results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know! I bought this and used it for a month &amp; then threw it in a drawer! I think I will dig it out &amp; start using it again as I&#x27;m sure it works when you use it the right way.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims. Exercise those facial muscles that otherwise would be hard to work with your hands. I am recommending to all my friends...</li>
            <li> This is a great exercise tool for the face.  I first purchased this on QVC then lost it so came here to purchase a new one. Great workout for the face!</li>
            <li> I have used it less than 2 weeks, and already my lips seem fuller, they have color back in them.  Before they looked grey to me and they were very thin.  I think it will take longer to get the full benefit, but I am already very satisfied.  I am a Massage Therapist, so I understand the process of re-building a muscle, and I know that as I have aged, my facial muscles are &amp;#34;slack&amp;#34; so this is just the right thing to resolve that situation. Being a thin person, has actually worked against me, because my face has lost a lot off adipose tissue (which is fat).  My girlfriend, who is kinda chubby, has a face with less wrinkles.  I am 63 years old (I feel 40 on the inside!!)&lt;br /&gt;PS  IT ONLY TAKES 2 MINUTES  - TWICE A DAY.  What are you waiting for ??</li>
            <li> This really works the jowl &amp; neck area.  I stopped using this a few months ago because I began a new regimen: facial building exercises  that has made a dramatic improvement in  The appearance of my overall face vs.  isolated areas. I especially needed help for my under eye area (wrinkles) &amp; I believe that the facial flex helped somewhat because, after reading another reviewer comments, I began to use both my hands by touching the sides of my eyes with my fingers and gently pulling back (and up) the skin while performing the exercises. believe this made a difference, but it was not significant  for what I needed (under eye issues). Still, this is an amazing product &amp;  I highly recommend it.  I also recommend that you buy the DVD, like I did, so you can perform exercises correctly.  Education is powerful.</li>
            <li> Great exercise for lower face and neck…use it regularly {every day} and you&#x27;ll feel the the tightness under your chin and your jowls will vanish</li>
            <li> The exercise is mainly good for the smile area and perhaps will have longer term effect on the marionette lines. The feather lines and upper lip, under nose area; I doubt can be affected at all because the resistance is only on the sides (corners of mouth). Over exertion could actually result in more feather lines, in areas on upper lip. Pouting movements over and over, with no resistance will eventually create thinner upper lip and more feathered lips.</li>
            <li> Still using it.  Notice a little more contour around chin area.  Will write a better review about a two month use</li>
            <li> This really works love it</li>
            <li> Frustrating to use&lt;br /&gt;The only area where I seem to feel any muscular activity is around my lips. The edges of where you rest your lip has caused chaffing. If I see any difference I will surely amend this review.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement after about 3 weeks of twice daily use, and my smile lines actually look a little more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I received this on time, but would have liked directions included with this. Otherwise it seems pretty well made and came with the extra rubber bands. Will post in a few weeks on the effects of using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I have not yet completed two months recommended</li>
            <li> The rubber band don´t last</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see really works.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase and very lucky</li>
            <li> I used this for awhile and started to feel very uncomfortable... as if my teeth were out of alignment or something and my upper and lower teeth didn&#x27;t make contact properly.  If you look at the before and after photos, it seems to work by adjusting the jawline--the jaw sticks out more in the after photos and that seems to soften the lines around the mouth.  After stopping for awhile, my jaw is now back to normal and it&#x27;s a relief!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my facial flex. Its been a month of using it twice a day for 2 min. I like being hands free to do my other facial exercise during that two min!</li>
            <li> This is a good facial exerciser .I recommend others to exercise their facial muscles too, with these.I like it that is why I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like anything else-Stay consistent! I keep this device in my car b/c I have a 50 min commute. So about 2X&#x27;s a day I&#x27;ll pop it in and do roughly 2 rounds of 60. I figured I might as well be productive if I&#x27;m in traffic. Also it&#x27;s more fun to do it to the beat while I&#x27;m listening to music opposed to standing in the mirror for 5 minutes counting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of plastic parts, so beware. The rubber bands need replacing periodically. One of the two small plastic pieces that holds the rubber band broke off when I was trying to change it, rendering the device useless, and I hadn&#x27;t even used it that many times. Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I see where this could work better if I used it as I should</li>
            <li> For those who are skeptical like me, I can tell you that this product WORKS as a charm. You just need to be consistent with the exercises if you stop doing them, everything will be like before. So, let&#x27;s work out our lower face, girls!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Could tell a difference in the firmness of my face after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using the Facial Flex my facial muscles have firmed.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time so as I continue to use it, I&#x27;ll be watching to see the effect it has on tightening up my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything to significantly tighten around the mouth.</li>
            <li> I really hope this works for me to get ride of my nasolabial folds. I used it twice a day for 30 days. Nasolabial folds are still as the same if not deeper... But I am sure of it made my marionette lines worse. Hope stopping it will help my lines to go away.</li>
            <li> I can tell this device is not going to do much good.  I felt my face muscles work the first time I used it, but then nothing after that.</li>
            <li> I really like this I them . I just moved and has misplaced it so am doing the exercises with out the product.. I like it though, I am still checking for results...</li>
            <li> This thing works. I do 100 morning and night. Watch video on u tube for proper use. Dont do an O, make sure you form your mouth in an oval instead. I focus when i do it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.  I didn&#x27;t really feel it &#x27;working&#x27; the muscles in my face, even when I used the &#x27;highest tension band&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Good concept, but the design of the apparatus needs to be improved.</li>
            <li> Second set as I lost my first one...</li>
            <li> This works but you have to be consistent with the use of the product.  It only requires a few mins a day and you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for 2 weeks but i havent noticed and difference. I was really excited to try it so I will keep going diligently for 2 months, and if i still dont see a difference i guess i shouldn&#x27;t expect one. i do feel a tightening as soon as im finished with my reps, so maybe just more time is all i need.</li>
            <li> It does what its intended to do. My facial muscles get super tired after I do this a few minutes. My own problem is that I get bored with things very easily. Im sure that if I make this a regular scheduled routine that my face and neck would have more definition. Im 35 btw. I have 2 semi-deep neck lines that are driving me nuts! Also I feel that I want a slimmer jaw line. Ill continue to use and update later with results!</li>
            <li> The product is as described and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. Too early to tell about ultimate results but I can feel it working!</li>
            <li> Facial Exercises are the fountain of youth for your face, no doubt.  I believe people&#x27;s faces become saggy because they lose facial muscles, just like anywhere else on the body.  The Facial Flex worked the first day, I noticed a difference.  I am very happy I purchase the item and look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> It got rid of my jowls. I used it twice a day everyday for over two months and would do125. I still use it, but sometimes I skip a day if my jowl area feels like it had a work out. I put two elastics on after a while, if I don&#x27;t, I just don&#x27;t feel it. I never had to change them yet, because the two work awesome. I rinse in it mouthwash. This will be in my life forever. I think I will order another one just in case this one breaks.</li>
            <li> Really great!! Its easy to use and results are really appreciative must hve tool for getting tight and young looking skin..</li>
            <li> I am working with the flex last two weeks and I think I see already results. It is very easy . Very nice small device - go for it!</li>
            <li> You have to really commit to doing this everyday, so not for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an exercise tool to help tone my aging face, neck and jowls.  When I found the Facial-Flex on Amazon, I thought I would give it a try and am really glad I did.  I have been using it for a couple months now, and my friends are telling me how great I look,  and asking if I have lost weight (I have not!).  It is worth the 2 minutes it takes in the morning and evening!!</li>
            <li> I love the Facial Flex Ultra I ordered 2 more because I had lost the last one that I had.. As someone who is almost 68 years of age, I have developed some jowls and lower jaw issues I know if I start using this Facial Flex Ultra faithfully it will help tighten that area. Thank you for sending me two complete sealed Facial Flex Ultra kits from the photo on Amazon I thought that I was getting just two Facial Flex Ultras with the bands..</li>
            <li> This has barely any resistance to it.  Horrible product.  I have a different one and it&#x27;s way better.  I thought since this is more expensive it will be better.  I was wring</li>
            <li> It is usable but too wide for my mouth.  I had one years ago that was a better fit.</li>
            <li> Been reading and learning a lot about \\&quot;preventing\\&quot; wrinkles and saggy skin before they begin...bought this little thing to try out; been using it every nite for over a week now; Not sure if it&#x27;ll work or not, but saw reviews online that it has worked for people who&#x27;ve used it for years; I guess it&#x27;s the same concept as toning your muscles everywhere else, by using this to help stretch and contract your facial muscles, over time, it&#x27;ll be more toned and less prone to sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a whole week&#x27;s use though, I did notice it gets easier and hence feels like the rubberband that allows the movement to work needs to be \\&quot;tightened\\&quot; somehow since our muscle is used to it, it almost seems like it&#x27;s too \\&quot;easy\\&quot; on the muscle...hard to explain...but I was re-reading the manual and it said over time we&#x27;ll need to use a tighter band or something along that line...I&#x27;m thinking of doubling up the band that came w/ it (came w/ a bunch btw), and hope to create a tighter stretch...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, pleased with this gadget and will keep using it and hope to see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the facial flex for one month and I can see my cheeks more firm . My face is not yet how I want it to be but I would still using it to see the results .</li>
            <li> replacement - needed new one.  good price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a smooth action. Poorly designed. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for about 1 1/2 weeks so it too early to tell if there are any substantial results however I&#x27;m using it twice a day as instructed and I&#x27;m able to do 5 minutes for each session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell but I plan to continue work with the Facial-Flex Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was sooner than expected so that was definitely a positive aspect of the purchase.</li>
            <li> i started using it 2 days ago, morning and night for 2 min each, the first i noticed was the headache i get after using it, still early to tell, maybe this is normal since the muscles started working , will give it a week and share my experience</li>
            <li> I have been using Facial-Flex Ultra for 6 weeks and it&#x27;s great.  I can feel a change in my skin after using it in the morning for 3 minutes and at night for 3 minutes.  Yes, I increased the time.  I jumped to using the 8oz bands and quickly went back to the 6oz because my mouth was not yet ready for this intense exercise.  In my second week I received complements on how my face looked toned and vibrant.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what 6 months will produce.  I&#x27;m in my sixties and I&#x27;m embracing the change.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works. Bought my first one 7 years ago and it finally broke so ordered another.</li>
            <li> This tiny device, along with a good moisturizer, really made a difference in my look. It tightened the area around my mouth and gave me a smoother appearance.</li>
            <li> The product is a nice facial work out ... but really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to witness the effects, but it&#x27;s like exercise ..You must do it awhile to notice a difference</li>
            <li> hope it works. if it does I will refer it to my friends and family.. i will start using it in the and pm.</li>
            <li> This little gadget when used consistently works wonders.  You won&#x27;t see a miraculous change overnight but once you begin using it consistently you will discover just how wonderful this works.  I believe we sometimes forget that our faces have muscles and need a workout like the rest of our body.  With time you will see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping and came in a very nice container.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Only used this a few times not sure I like it yet</li>
            <li> I purchased this after watching several videos.  Tried it for two days and the rubber elastics snapped off and the two pieces separated.  I went online in an attempt to put this back in position and the instructions were so bad and seem more complicated than they should have been.  I think the results can be achieved by putting your index and middle fingers in your mouth and resisting while forming the letter &amp;#34;O&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought the Facial Flex awhile back hoping to improve a burgeoning turkey neck, and loved the results after just a week!  I had a firmer neck, reduced facial fat, plus higher and rosier cheeks... simply AMAZINGLY!! I misplaced the device and the turkey neck slowly came back. Thank goodness I found it two weeks ago and have used it every day for 2-5 minutes. The results are just as good as when I first used it... So very happy! I was contemplating getting a facial/neck treatment called Ultherapy that&#x27;s $1,500-3,000, but not anymore. At 51 years ago, I&#x27;m saving that money and loving this magical little device.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I never give product reviews but this one is great. I&#x27;m 53 and thin, but have always had full cheeks. Lately my cheeks started sagging and I showed signs of saggy joules and downturn ed mouth. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and I can&#x27;t believe the improvement. The sagging is almost gone and my face has really thinned out. My mouth is more upturned too. Use it twice a day for 3 minutes. So happy I bought this. I&#x27;ll never stop using it. A facelift without the surgery!</li>
            <li> I really like this little miracle gadget . I saw improvement in the first two weeks of use. My cheeks have certainly lifted and oddly it seems like my overbite is miraculously fixing itself. I will updae in anoher couple  of weeks</li>
            <li> I am still working at it, (into the 2 months), I am seeing improvement around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Nicely made and worth the money... well packaged and arrived on time</li>
            <li> it fine, what do i do if it get broken?</li>
            <li> Sad I had read so many great reviews but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Also the directions were not reliable.</li>
            <li> I love this product helps me exercise my face</li>
            <li> Got the product fast !👌</li>
            <li> Face does look better and firmer. Neck looks better. It does require commitment, it becomes like brushing your teeth, worth it and worth the time.  Oh, jowls are reduced.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for one I have had for many years. It does make a difference if used consistently.</li>
            <li> Being in my fifties the wrinkles and sagging skin are a given, but I wanted to try and find something to help me slow down the aging process a bit and maintain some elasticity.  While researching the web I came upon the Facial-Flex and after reading the product description and the reasonable price, I decided to purchase one.  This is an amazing product!  It has helped me learn how to exercise the facial muscles so those lines above my lip and crow&#x27;s feet have actually softened and my sagging neck skin has toned quite a bit in the 3 weeks I have been using it.  If your looking not for a miracle cream but a product that helps you exercise the face then this is for you!  The body needs exercise and so does the face..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting to me that so many people like this product. I have to say, I don&#x27;t agree with a lot of the reviews.  I&#x27;ve done facial exercises for 20 years.  I started with Flexeffect, which is a hands on resistance system that works wonders, but takes more time each day to do.  Years later I went on to this and I kept what I had, plus continued to do some flex effect for the upper face which cut my time down.  Nothing really changed, but it was holding.  Then I was told by a friend about another one called flexaway, so I switched.  Guess what?  No comparison.  My mouth was fuller within a month and the marionette lines are almost gone.  Now that is something!</li>
            <li> great product! I read several product reviews before purchasing this item and was not disappointed with it. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Works great - Fast shipping - Great item</li>
            <li> Omg! This product works wonders! it&#x27;s true I can see such a big differences with my laugh lines the facial flex along with your regular facial regimen will help you to maintain a healthy younger looking face.</li>
            <li> so, just look down at any mirror and you&#x27;ll know if you need this or not.&lt;br /&gt;after 40, i think, we all do...&lt;br /&gt;i use it in the car driving to/from work daily (don&#x27;t really care if anyone sees).  it tightens the jaw, works on lines around the mouth, not sure yet about the laugh lines - but it&#x27;s the matter of time.</li>
            <li> I bought my Facial Flex from QVC over a decade ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong. Yes, you look like a doofus using the thing. I don&#x27;t care, and neither should you. This thing works, works, works -- firms the jawline, lifts the chin, reverses the sagging of the cheeks. It even helps plump lips -- the first week you use it, you will notice your lips feel stiff. That is the lip muscles getting stronger, and keeping your lips from shrinking as you age. Heck, if you roll your eyes way up and lift your lower eyelids a bit while you use the Facial Flex, you&#x27;ll even get tightening below the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $35, there simply isn&#x27;t a better value in facial anti-aging available. You want this thing. You really do. And no, I don&#x27;t own stock or anything, I just think this is a brilliant product.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Hope to see some improvements as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd facial flex,  this one is not as comfortable as my other one, but I have to say this works</li>
            <li> I realized I could mimic this same action with two fingers spacing my lips apart, so did not need the device to do that. Having the device out where you see it though, helps to remind you to do it, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> This product to not work for me.  Wrinkles became more pronounced.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It firms up sagging muscles. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it 2 times a day I&#x27;m not seeing a whole lot of difference but I&#x27;ve been using it for a month so hoping soon.I will buy another one if I see a difference soon</li>
            <li> I love it. Look great! I do used a lot for everyday to keep excercise face. I am happy to keep exercise move my mouth. Good age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a 3 weeks consistently. I do feel slight tighting under my chin area. I&#x27;m hopeful that it will only get better with continued use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using facial flex for many months, nearly 2 years.  This is a product that works. This is a middle aged jowl buster. The tone of my face, specifically my mouth, cheeks and jowl area have improved greatly. I use it for a fast 1 minute session, 2 sets. Did you read that? 2 minutes a day for huge improvement!!!  The facial flex paired with &#x27;the neck line trimmer&#x27; are a powerful duo. I use at night while watching TV. Its not hard and well worth the time and investment. No risky cosmetic surgery for remarkable improvement.  My first facial flex broke. I read the warranty and its guaranteed 1 year. I couldnt order another one fast enough. The facial flex is better than other facial exercisers. Ive tried several, its smoother and easier to use. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and watched youtube videos and then I purchased. I have used it once and I have notices how badly it hurts the ends of my mouth and already can see how wrinkles can form if I continue this. I am not sure if this is a knock-off or what but I know this will cause more damage than good. I looked at my face after using it last night and this morning and the edges of my mouth wore red and sore and while exercising it doesn&#x27;t even move the neck. I want a refund</li>
            <li> Jury is still out but I gave it five stars because my face is firm and you can NOT tell that I am at the beginning of middle age. I&#x27;d like to think this has something to do with it along with my plethora of skin care products. I am fighting mother nature and father time with every weapon I got!!!</li>
            <li> after using face-flex for a few months now, I think its working but I cannot be 100% sure yet. But I like the fact that I am exercising my face as well as my body. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product although you do have to be careful with washing the product as it can make the plastic part that holds it together flimsy and break off....I bought my first one from QVC and returned it for this reason but they were kind enough to give me a refund. Re-ordered product from Amazon.com and have not had any problems with it yet....Overall it&#x27;s awesome to tone your facial muscles, I can see a real difference when I do as many reps as I can till facial fatigue, your cheekbones really stand out and your face looks firm!</li>
            <li> I have owned this device for 6 weeks, and I have to say I am really surprised with how well it works. I could see a subtle but significant difference almost immediately, and increased improvement with every subsequent use. I like to exercise and this made sense to me: you have muscles in your face and if you exercise them properly they should help keep your face in shape, just like the rest of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I think you have to have a certain type of problem for this to work. I was experiencing wrinkles around my lips, wrinkles in the skin below my cheek bones, and slight jowls along my jaw. I also had some extra skin under my neck that would wrinkle when I turned my head, but that wasn&#x27;t a significant waddle. I had hoped to post some before and after photos to show my results, but I haven&#x27;t found any good &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; shots yet, as I usually do not keep photos where I look old and haggard. :-( I&#x27;ll keep looking. I think my kids have a few prize shots that should be floating around somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you want to lessen the signs of jowls and &amp;#34;neckage,&amp;#34; (what I call neck wrinkles) this is a great, easy, and natural way to do it.</li>
            <li> good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work for someone else, but this was WAY too wide for my mouth. Even whenever I had it pushed in, my mouth was open at max. If you have a smaller mouth, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2-3 months, so no results</li>
            <li> This item is so awesome. I wish I would have purchased it a long time ago. It feels good when I am done using it 3 minutes a day. I feel like I have done something worthy for myself. It is easy to use. Its strong and flexible. They send you extra bands. Rome wasn&#x27;t build in one day so of course you won&#x27;t see results for a while so stick to it. Every work out makes me feel like I put a dime away; and someday I will have checks that I purchased without surgery :)</li>
            <li> Well....I wanted to like it. Maybe I didn&#x27;t try it out for long enough, I don&#x27;t know. The lower weight bands were too flimsy (resistance-wise) and doubling them up made it way too difficult, as did using the higher weight bands. I&#x27;m not against working hard to get the results you want, but I didn&#x27;t even feel the muscles in question working. This device did, however, get me back in the habit of doing my facial exercises from 2 books that I own, so there&#x27;s that, at least. And doing those only takes a couple minutes per day as well, but you can actually feel the muscles working with that nice tingly burn that tells you you&#x27;re on the right track. Not to mention quick results (like starting to notice improvements within days, not months). Anyway, I&#x27;m sending this back.</li>
            <li> Second One - Misplaced my first one after 2 years of use...I have had this one now for 6 months and it is great !!!  makes my face look 100% more tone...you CAN see a difference within days..i use mine once a day for 5 minutes...these are very durable...PLEASE NOTE : I did try one of those 2 dollar Chinese ones and they fall apart and don&#x27;t exercise the muscles</li>
            <li> Have been using Facial Flex for years and have always ordered from the company directly. So easy to use my Amazon account that I ordered this time from here. Don&#x27;t know if device I received is defective or a \\&quot;knock off.\\&quot; Could not figure out why after using it only 3 days the inside of my mouth on the left side felt so sore. When I examined the Facial Flex I saw the difference between the right side that goes into the mouth and the left. The right was thicker and very smooth and the left was quite thin and had an extremely rough edge. Should have kept packaging and returned it. Ordered one today directly from Facial Flex and threw this one in the trash. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I had one of these several years ago; however, I lost it!  It does work -- one just needs to use it!!  This one doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; quite as smoothly as my previous one.</li>
            <li> I have used it every day since I received it.. And I&#x27;m noticing a difference especially in pictures.. Arrived pretty quick after I ordered ..</li>
            <li> Break at the middle joint after 1 months of usage. Good but not durable!</li>
            <li> They sent me the crappy one,....holes too big or loose, as a resuIt it tilts and doesn&#x27;t stay straight on both sides of mouth. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller. It does help the face muscles if used regularly.</li>
            <li> Interesting product. I have been using about 2 months twice a day. My face muscles have changed but im not quite sure if I look younger or not. My grandkids stare with amazement when I use it.  Getting the product seems to take much longer than in the past. I am not happy with the shipping time from this store.</li>
            <li> so i am 26 and got this to just start working on antiaging and also to make my face a little slimmer. well, i don&#x27;t have wrinkles to know if the wrinkles are going away or not, but my face is definitely slimmer with more of a contour to the cheeks. i stopped using it for the last few weeks so i would not start looking too gaunt but it def works!!</li>
            <li> I believe this exercise does really help ! Easy to use ! I like the convenience of using it as I drive ! Multi-tasking !</li>
            <li> You need to buy that, I have unseeing it only 5 day and I see the different. I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought that this was a good item, but it broke within 5 weeks of daily usage.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED ON TIME AND WORKS ECELLENT....</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks with the 8 oz. bands, about 120 reps (or more) a couple of times a day.  I think there&#x27;s a little improvement starting in some places but I think the wrinkles are getting worse in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed wrinkles starting around my mouth that weren&#x27;t there before.  Also maybe the smile lines on one side next to my mouth may be a little deeper.  I know you have to be careful to make an oval shape, not an &#x27;o&#x27; shape.  I think I&#x27;m doing it right but honestly think some wrinkles are getting worse. To be fair, I think my cheek bones are looking a little more defined, but because of what I mentioned I&#x27;m scared to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Really impressed. I&#x27;m 38 and am getting a bit jowly. And that just aint cool. Bought this after looking at several reviews and I&#x27;m really glad I did. An added plus, my lips were fuller within 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> This item is good for tightening muscles in the face when using on a consistent basis.  I use it at least 4 times a week and my jaws aren&#x27;t so droopy.</li>
            <li> Need to start using this again as I was on long holiday - think it helps with facial muscles, we&#x27;ll see how it goes have to start all over again!</li>
            <li> It stuck while trying to do the exercise.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to use this on a regular basis; unfortunately the exercise seems to cause pain to my TMJ.</li>
            <li> The skin around my mouth started sagging being in my late 40&#x27;s. I searched the internet thinking there must be a product to help exercise facial muscles. I am thrilled with this product. I did find that I needed to quickly change to the mid-strength resistance bands which helped tone more just like a higher weight would. Try this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Facial-Flex for a few weeks now and I do feel it working my facial muscles as it claims to do.  It has not be long enough for me to know if it will help with the firmness and facial lines that I have but I will keep using as instructed and hopefully I will have some wonderful results!  The device seems to be very well made and it did come with extra bands so you can change them out each week as indicated in the instructions included.  I watched a video on You Tube to see how to use this which helped a lot.  Hope it was worth the money to purchase - time will tell!  I gave it 4 stars since I don&#x27;t know if it will do the job it is intended to do yet.</li>
            <li> I can literally feel my muscles tightening on certain parts of my face. Too many people work the other muscles of the body and forget that they have facial muscles. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that they claimed I ordered 2 when I didn&#x27;t and I had to pay the shipping to send one back though.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works great! I been using it for a month now. The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I just received the facial-flex. It was very well packaged and has enough pressure bands to last for a couple of months. I haven&#x27;t used it that long so I can&#x27;t say that it works just yet. I am using it at least twice a day to work on my jaw line which is begining to sag :( a bit.  I must say that I rather use the facial-flex than use any type of injections.&lt;br /&gt;Will post another comment in a month or two when I can see actual results</li>
            <li> Great for building / toning embouchure!</li>
            <li> I often wonder how authentic these reviews really are, because, I feel like I keep wasting money on false hope. I been using this devise for about 2 1/2 weeks and all of a sudden, I developed a double chin!! Yuk!! Where the hell did this come from? I am not over weight. I am 43 yrs old about 5’4 140lbs, no one in my family is overweight or has a double chin. I just don’t get it. Could it be that I am going through medically induced menopause or am I just ageing horribly.. whatever the case I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Broke within a few days.  Horrible quality.  I purchased the original and had it for years and it finally broke several years later.  This new version is horribly made and not worth a penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use this to help my facial muscles.  I hate exercising.  This is a little more fun.</li>
            <li> After using this for the first couple times - once in the evening, and then again the next morning -- my mom, unprompted and with no knowledge that I&#x27;d used Facial-Flex said, -- &#x27;Wow, your face looks really great. Looks like you&#x27;ve had a Botox session&#x27;. &#x27;Nuff said. This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Great for facial exercises.</li>
            <li> WHERE DO I GET OF THE RUBBER BANDS.  I&#x27;M ALMOST OUT AND I NEED THEM.</li>
            <li> YES it arrived on time!  The produce itself is not working smoothly at all!  Not satisfied...</li>
            <li> ok, wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work,  but i just recently started fighting the neck problem, but some creams etc,  but I have to tell ya, the creams may help, but really didn&#x27;t see a difference yet.  but this, I got about a week ago, and I use as much as I can,  2 to 4 times a day.  And by golly I can tell a difference, feel it big time under my chin.  and my neck feels stronger...if that is possible  but really excited about this product.  I had brought another neck product  and used that, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything happening with it like I do this.  I would recommend it.  I am 55.</li>
            <li> seems like it exercises lots of muscles, face, neck ...easy to use daily.</li>
            <li> this is my second one, I lost my original one, so glad to be able to find another</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. A facial exercise thingy? Really? But I read reviews as I am sure you are doing and thought what the heck couldn&#x27;t hurt. Right. So I bought one. Been using it for a little over a month and have seen results. It kinda makes sense. The face has many muscles. Exercising them will stimulate growth as well as Collagen.</li>
            <li> This actually works with regular use.  Keeps the &amp;#34;side pockets&amp;#34; at bay.  A little expensive for what you actually get, but I guess it&#x27;s the results you pay for.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this makes a big difference in my facial appearance.  Very little time and effort to use daily.  I saw a picture of myself before I started using the Facial Flex and was shocked.  Not in a good way.  Mistakenly tossed my Facial Flex in the wastebasket.  I&#x27;m retired, use little make up, this is my little vanity.  There is no cream or make up that can improve skin tone like facial exercse.  I bought one of those battery operated facial toners to replace my Facial Flex. I found the daily routine took too long,  It started to annoy me and I stopped using it.. My face drooped. This little gadget does the trick in less time than it takes to watch a television commercial. I only use it once or twice a day for about 2-3 minutes. It works great.</li>
            <li> I got the Facial Flex Ultra because, at almost 50, I was starting to see that turkey wattle on my neck.  A soft jawline (to put it nicely) runs in my family.  I started using the Facial Flex and noticed less wiggle to my wattle after the first few days.  It wasn&#x27;t gone but was definitely starting to tighten up.  Note:  if you try to do too many repetitions too soon, you will develop a neck/headache.  Also, if you don&#x27;t change the rubber band, you will not get the resistance needed for the Facial Flex to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this before your wattle gets out of hand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful about this product but it is too early to give a review.  It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and I have not yet noticed any changes or improvements.  I would expect that one must finish the 1st cycle of 6oz rubber bands and then 8oz to see if the product works.  I will provide an update after the fact.</li>
            <li> I use the tightest of three rubber band strengths and admittedly am faithful to exercise 120 times most days. You will begin to feel saggy skin (marionette lines and crepe-y neck) tighten — like firm skin that is a lot younger. I used to wear turtle necks and dream about having a neck lift, but not anymore. I will be 59 next week and this little gizmo has taken some years off me for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already difficult just to jam this device in and since my mouth is even smaller than its stretched (closed) position,that left me very little exercising space!</li>
            <li> This is a handy little device that does exactly what you would expect - works the middle third of your face where the &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; of the exercise takes place.  If it did nothing else, Facial Flex would be useful just for improved circulation and skin tone.  But it does more than that and I&#x27;m very satisfied after several months of use.  It has toned my cheeks and as a nice surprise, has plumped my lips and reduced my lip lines.  Overall, it has improved the frame of my face and tightened my sagging 56 y/o skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not, however, the whole ball of wax.  A variety of facial exercise programs offer tips on how to strengthen the forehead, eye area and jaw line.  I do a few of these in combination with the Facial Flex for best results.  One of my beefs about facial exercise programs is that they prescribe a total face regimen that is essentially the same for everyone and takes like 20 minutes. However, facial muscles are not like biceps and facial structure varies greatly from person to person. When using Facial Flex or doing other facial exercises, look in the mirror while exercising and afterward.  If the motion appears to be deepening creases or causing new wrinkles, either modify the way you&#x27;re performing the exercise or do something different.  Giving up on facial exercise altogether is sort of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  There are enough programs out there that you can improve your facial tone once you find the particular exercises that work for you.  Again, be your own boss in determining the ideal frequency of exercising.  I use the Facial Flex only once a day, in the evening, because twice a day was simply too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Flex is a very convenient and time-saving way to get bang for your buck in working the middle of the face.  The only reason I&#x27;m deducting one star is that I feel the claims for the device (when used by itself) are somewhat exaggerated and that the leap from 8 oz to 14 oz resistance bans is too great.  An intermediate resistance should be available.  Otherwise, I love and continue to use this product daily.An intermediate resistance should be available.  Otherwise, I love and continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li> The product came in both box and case  that look  different from the picture shown. The case was white and the box has no image on it, and was not sealed at all . I then followed the instructions to clean the device. I&#x27;ve noticed some scratches on the two parts that go directly into the mouth, but I thought  for some reason, it  was  manufactured just like that. Then I tried it to see how it works. unfortunately, when I placed it between my lips, it doesn&#x27;t extend fully as it should, even if I compress and release it. I decided to check carefully what went wrong after watching other people videos. I found out that the resistance band was loosed, almost cut, and the scratches were noticeable on the device. You can tell this item had been used by someone previously. I was so disappointed and sent the product back. I am not against the device because I believe this might be a good  stuff  if  this didn&#x27;t happen to me. I will probably get it from another seller next time, and make sure it originally sealed.</li>
            <li> It seems to do exactly what they say it does. I just started using it yesterday, so I can&#x27;t say yet what the benefits will be for sure, but I can certainly feel it working the muscles in my face. If it makes an improvement with regular use then I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> seem good I hope see the result in short time .</li>
            <li> Bought this to strengthen my chops for trumpet playing. Only been using it a month, but seems to be helping. Too soon to tell if it will make me look younger. If it does, great---but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.  It DOES work the muscles around your mouth. Quality of the product is good.</li>
            <li> I already had one I had bought about ten years ago.  I wanted an extra one. This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Could not figure it out!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great results, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it too long - read too many reviews that said it causes wrinkles so I started with Neckline Slimmer which does work great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I can taste rubber band in my mouth when I use this.</li>
            <li> Really strange contraption that I thought might help with wrinkles but it actually caused additional deepness within one of my laugh lines.  I have stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Bought this product originally from QVC.  Bought a second from Amazon in case I break or lose the first. It was originally presented as a product used to help victims of stroke-damaged facial muscles.  I bought it and used it for a few weeks and was hooked when my neighbour looked at me and said that I looked \\&quot;different\\&quot;. I have used it for many years.  I have none of the age related muscle slackness in my facial muscles: no lines from nose to the corners of the mouth, no hanging jowls, no double chins, no slack skin on the neck.  No one has ever guessed my chronological age correctly.  I look at this product in the same way as I look at the five pound dumbells I use to keep my breasts from sagging by doing dumbell flys.</li>
            <li> Started using this immediately and have seen a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; in my jowls which is the area I wanted to focus on being 62. Can&#x27;t wait to see how much of a transformation in the next 60 days. Neck is lifted also.....yippee!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a second, backup for my first one. Don&#x27;t want to be without. I have been using Facial-Flex since July 2014 that&#x27;s three months. I can already tell the difference. The muscles in my cheek areas are starting to get firmer. This really works.</li>
            <li> The first few times I did this there was a definite tightening in the jaw area and a feeling of fullness in my lips. That is just normal muscle spasms after not working out that part of my body in that way... ever. Been doing this now for 2 months. It actually filled in the lines (they&#x27;re gone) that come down from my nose and frame the mouth. My cheeks looks firmer and my mouth looks/feels slightly fuller.</li>
            <li> It may look silly, but works very, very well. It has to be used daily, but has taken years off my appearance. I stopped using it for a month or so and my face sorta fell. It does not work the upper lids or forehead, so I do a couple of face exercises for those. I have not however found any other product that tightens the jawline or brings fullness back to lips like this little gadget. I am soon going to buy another one, just to have a spare on hand. I am up to the 14 strength rubberbands and use two of them. I am wondering since I do have such success with it if some possibly didn&#x27;t want it out. It takes about 6 weeks to show full effects, or did with me. I like to use it while looking in the mirror to make sure I have the correct form, but that is not necessary.</li>
            <li> I bought this from ProTherapy Supplies via Amazon. This product far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging &amp; Design: It came in a sealed plastic case, already assembled along with 6oz and 8oz resistance bands. The plastic and metal part of the unit are not flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage &amp; Results: I&#x27;ve read plastic surgeons&#x27; comments regarding the product saying it doesn&#x27;t work but I went and bought it anyway. Prepare to look really silly when doing the excercise. I&#x27;ve been using this 2x/day for 5mins for almost 2 weeks now. My results are very apparent. I can see definition on my jawlines, cheekbones and jowl (goodbye double-chin) I also see firmness around the neck area (goodbye turkey neck). So far it hasn&#x27;t activated my TMJ. If anything I feel that my jaws are stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t think it was working until I saw pictures of me over the holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Downside: I wish it comes with non-latex resistance bands. (that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 star) Other than that I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you&#x27;re doing the excercise correctly, you&#x27;ll immediately feel the results.</li>
            <li> It´s okay! i think maybe its too big for my mouth!</li>
            <li> Seems lie a good product</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 20 years and I am 57 with no signs of a turkey neck or jowls. I use it every day for about 5 minutes, 4 sets of 60.  I had to replace it just 1 week ago after using it for over 20 years.  It is built to last.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that produces real results</li>
            <li> I loved it! Unfortunately, somehow it&#x27;s missing and I can&#x27;t find it. I may have used it for about 4 days. I took it out of it&#x27;s container, and I can&#x27;t find it. I&#x27;ve looked everywhere! I even took the mattress off the bed and looked behind the bed to no avail. I may order another, but I can&#x27;t afford it right now. Thx.</li>
            <li> Have nasal folds &amp; using this device just 2 twice made them look worse.  Might work for sagging, jowls but giving up since using the device caused soreness inside my mouth where the piece lay, almost feels slowen &amp; like tiny papercuts.</li>
            <li> I have introduced it to my friend. It work and easy for you to practice. Try it and you will experience it&#x27;s profits. Thank for having it.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I do other exercises w/these. Between Facercise and this I see an improvement and it&#x27;s only been two weeks.</li>
            <li> painful, drool when I try to use it, very discouraging, wish I could send it back for a refund, regret ordering it</li>
            <li> So this is a complete waste of money.  Mine came without the promised (written on box) Instruction Booklet and Progress Chart.  It&#x27;s a complete rip off.  I imagine it&#x27;s worth about $4 including the cost of postage.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. Smile more instead.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest, worst product I ever ordered from Amazon.  After using it for a week, it broke in two.  If you want to waste your time and money, then buy it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money spent at all. Very hard to work. Kept sticking (not sliding properly) Was wondering why it cost so much.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can feel the facial muscles tightening. I would recommend it to a friend. excellent.</li>
            <li> No instructions or chart and cheap case that will not close. Should have purchased someplace else. Have not tried the product yet so cannot comment on if it works. It was received on time.</li>
            <li> I received the item on the date stated. It was safely packaged. What I wasn&#x27;t happy with, they DO NOT include any instructions on how to use it! Fortunately I was able to find the YouTube video I had originally seen, that had me trying to track this item down to buy. She is a very beautiful African American woman, because of her, before &amp; after pictures and very detailed instructions, I purchased this, &amp; look forward to using it. I can only hope I get 1/2 the amazing results she achieved!!&lt;br /&gt;(P.S. Her name starts with the same two letters of my first name)  Do yourself the best favor and search for her YouTube, you will want to purchase one of these yourself.&lt;br /&gt;denise :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend....exercise our face and neck! I enjoy working out, so If I workout for my body I also feel the need to exercise for my face &amp; neck....</li>
            <li> Used these for years.  Definitely gives your face a workout.</li>
            <li> I purchased this device to try to lessen the appearance of some wrinkles around the sides of my mouth.  I did as instructed for 3 weeks.  I was doing this in preparation for a trip I was taking with a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Long story, short-----it accentuated the wrinkles I was trying to get rid of and it has taken over 2 1/2 weeks to get my face back to as normal as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this device.</li>
            <li> WOW, just what I have been searching for! I used the small bands the first day, and continued to use the device on and off that whole first day I got it. By next day, I was into the 8oz. band! The third day, I&#x27;ve doubled up the two 8oz. bands, and that is going to last me a while I think, its challenging. It&#x27;s all about how motivated you are to get fit. I cannot imagine only doing 2-minutes twice daily! what?? The results on this third day are what I am hearing it takes some people weeks to get. My jaw line has more definition, my cheeks are more shapely and thinner, my eyes and upper forehead feel more taut and my eyes feel more open and bright. My chin area and mouth look better, my jowl has more definition. I am 50 yrs. old. I am so excited about this device. My face feels like its gotten a gentle workout. Remember, I&#x27;m using it constantly when at home,I rest it, then go again, I&#x27;m enjoying it so why stop!  it is not making my face tired at all, it feels so good to feel my face taut and fit!!</li>
            <li> Updating that my bottom mouth lines never went away, even have a small one on the top right similar to the where the plastic piece fit. Wish my family had said something sooner than they did that my face was looking worse, but glad they spoke when they did. When I was using it, didn&#x27;t realize it was causing so many jaw problems - couldn&#x27;t close my mouth comfortably. Do research before putting in your mouth and if you do, proceed with great caution. I deeply regret involving myself with this product.   Should be zero stars. Though I did NOT purchase this on Amazon, beware of this device, it causes swelling of the lower face, aggravates the jaws, creates mouth lines, and even worse - see this official report: [...] I suspect the good reviews of this product are fake and please read all the other reviews carefully. There are a few people really telling the truth about this. It should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it trains my face yet, but it&#x27;s sturdy and you can definitely feel the muscles working.</li>
            <li> I feel the burn more when I squeeze my lips in and &amp;#34;out&amp;#34;, like you&#x27;re trying to kiss someone just out of reach. I think it&#x27;s good to flush blood thru normally stagnant areas of the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for under a month and I already can see with regular use one can get some good results. It is easy to use and it takes under five minutes. I&#x27;ve started slowly with using the beginner&#x27;s bands and I have been gradually moving to a higher strenght. I think consistency is the key to good results. I have been using this product in conjunction with Bella Bacci facial cup and the Clairisonic Mia. Realistic expectations are also helpful.....if you are 60 this isn&#x27;t going to make you look 20. I also recommend reading The Beauty Detox by Kimberly Synder and Forever Beautiful by Natalia Rose. Our good friend Amazon sells all of these products with really quick shipping. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for 5 yrs before it broke.  This design is better.  Worth a try to fight turkey neck.</li>
            <li> I love it. The lines of expression around my mouth have improve, it woks.  and only take 2 or 4 minutes a days.</li>
            <li> I had lost my previous flex which I had for years.  I am disappointed in this one.  It works very hard, not smoothly like the old one.  Because I did not keep the paperwork, I feel I must keep it and wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Use it on a regular basis. Can feel it working the muscles just like regular exercise. I don&#x27;t notice a major difference in anything yet but it will take time to do so. I&#x27;m still on the first bands. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my mouth size.</li>
            <li> need to use more often - can tell it is working.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. Who knew...</li>
            <li> OMG  I ordered this product a while ago. I&#x27;ve used this everyday and I Love Love it. It actually works wonders and keep your neck and face well toned but not all muscle bound looking just mot sagging and cute.</li>
            <li> I feel my smile lines are much worse....not sure if I can honestly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Appears to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> In the past 2 years I have really started to hit the downhill slope. I&#x27;m been using creams (some expensive, some not), but was noticing that it&#x27;s not just the superficial skin changes that are doing me in. My cheeks and chin have really started to sag. I&#x27;m not talking cute, little double chin. I&#x27;m talking turkey neck and hog jowls in the making. I try not to be terribly vain, but to be honest, it was horrifying me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a biomedical scientist by training, and I believe that you should address the underlying factors of aging and knew that muscle tone makes a big difference. I looked up the facial-flex and found that it has some clinical testing (for example, it is being tested for Parkinson&#x27;s facial dystonia, and apnea), so I test it on me. I started using it, and withing two weeks noticed changes. I have been using it fairly faithfully for about 6 weeks. Of course I miss a day here and there, but try to get in about 5 uses a week. I usually only use once a day.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have been receiving a lot of compliments on my youthfulness, and my boyfriend has noticed changes, too (he still laughs at me for using it). I took before and after photos, but even without examining them, the changes has been fairly remarkable. My jaw and cheeks have definitely firmed up, and filled out. My dimples were beginning to look a little tired, but now look springy and youthful. Extraordinarily, my lips have pouffed up and are very rosy! I liked my mouth before and but my fuller lips do look a lot more youthful and sexy. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it incorrectly, because this was not an advertised feature. Also, I used to purse my lips all the time (unconsciously), which was giving me mouth wrinkles. Since my mouth muscle strength has improved, I don&#x27;t purse my lips.&lt;br /&gt;My chin is still saggier than I&#x27;d like. I may be using it incorrectly, because I&#x27;m lazy and in a hurry most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;This was definitely a great buy and  would recommend it as part of your anti-aging regime.g regime.</li>
            <li> Seems fine. Only had it for a month.</li>
            <li> I like it very much after 2 weeks my wrinkles disappear.  I did found at Youtube recomended.  Excellent decision !!!</li>
            <li> Using it and t seems to be working. Time will tell f the product really works. it is simple to use.</li>
            <li> Hey this thing works. I use it for about 10 minutes a day while on the computer or watching TV. Takes about a week to see a difference</li>
            <li> This tool really helps with tightening your facial muscles and your chin definition. Devote 2 minutes to yourself every day and you will see the difference!</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  I used it regularly with no results.  Doesn&#x27;t even feel like it is working.  It hurts the corners of the mouth as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any change yet&lt;br /&gt;. been a month.....</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.  I&#x27;ll watch esp. towards 8wks. to see if it is worth continuing using it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I love it! ,I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Simple and extraordinary invention !</li>
            <li> It is working great!  Love it.</li>
            <li> HAPPY TO RECEIVE THE UNIT AND I&#x27;M USING IT, BUT IT&#x27;S TOO EARLY TO SEE RESULTS. THE UNIT IS WELL MADE AND APPEARS THAT IT WILL HELP ME.</li>
            <li> Ok, I waited to review this item because I wanted to give it a chance to work. It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks, I followed the instructions and used it faithfully. What I found is that I feel more definition  around my jawline, and chin. I did not see any change on my cheeks beneath my eye area. I&#x27;m just beginning to see those C folds right next to my nose, and I was hoping that this product would help to firm that up. I think this might be better for the jowls, lower jaw and neck fat only.</li>
            <li> great product it really does tightening up your face muscles, my face looks younger.</li>
            <li> I can tell that its toning</li>
            <li> about 15 years ago I found one of these babys at walmart it was about $10-15 I had it for many years and loved it. used it every morning. anyway somewhere along the &amp;#34;path&amp;#34; it got misplaced and I haven&#x27;t had one for about 8 yrs. so I remembered how much I liked it and wanted another one and just got this, I am VERY pleased with this product. I was a tad SHOCKED at the price, but hey ! its worth it and they give you a ton of the little rubber bands with it too (O: this one seems nice enough, its NOT gold plated but it will do what I want it to do and after using it again for about 5 days I am SO THRILLED to have it again! WOW what a difference it feels so good !!&lt;br /&gt;I like when it feels like my actual facial muscles are in good shape, im 57 and our &amp;#34;family&amp;#34; has that sort of slavic facial structure that lends itself well to sagging from the weight of those generations of digging potatoes up from under the frozen tundra ... for dinner. (if u get my drift!) I REALLY do not want to get a face lift and NOT be in control of my facial future! so these implements really help me to care for my self in a really satisfying way!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all...  sorry I purchased and I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> Love this gadget.It really works if your consistent with it as i am .</li>
            <li> Absolutely love, love love love this! This is the best product I&#x27;ve purchased for beauty! My face is thinner and my neck lines are slowly looking so much better. It takes time and patience but if you&#x27;re willing to put in the efford (which is not much, a few minutes a day) you will get results.</li>
            <li> This works. Can feel the &amp;#34;workout&amp;#34; in neck/chin area. Have used for approximately one month. Can see the difference.</li>
            <li> Helps with TMJ issues as well as exercising facial muscles.</li>
            <li> It is very good for muscles of the face, the face tightens and becomes thinner , and younger, I like it very much</li>
            <li> So far so good. ive just had product for a few days. I&#x27;m working it twice a day building up reps. Make sure to follow video so to not deepen lip lines. Video on YouTube</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about 2 weeks. Ive been doing two min at night and in the am. So far I have noticed more fullnes in my upper lip that had just started thinning out.</li>
            <li> I feel like I giving my face a benefiting workout. It&#x27;s not expensive and it already feelss like it is working.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for maintaining a contoured jawline, if used as directed</li>
            <li> it became too much trouble to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent trader! Totally trustworthy</li>
            <li> This crazy thing works!!</li>
            <li> I was reviewing neck creams and saw this product after reading all the positive reviews I decided to buy it. I have had this for 3 weeks and have been taken pictures and have noticed a difference in my neck ( was my problem area) and around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep updating but don&#x27;t waste your money on neck creams when you can get this!</li>
            <li> i m doing very good with it, but remember drink plenty of water before you do cuz it may dry your mouth while exercising.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3O days and my  jaw has more definition. My lower lip is plumper and so are my cheeks. I was starting to look sullen, before I bought my Facial Flex. My husband has noticed as well!  I call my Facial Flex, my little miracle!  :-)</li>
            <li> I like the concept but the value for money is not worth its very plastic , the picture  shows it as very premium</li>
            <li> It is for people with small mouths. It is too tiny to do much good for me.  I do see the benefit of it, if it could actually expand enough to do any good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to review this, because I started a heavy regimen of facial exercise with multiple devices.  I will say after only 2 weeks I have seen remarkable improvement.  My whole face has lifted.  The before and after photos are unbelievable.  Granted, I doubled or even tripled the amount of workouts per device/equipment because I wanted rapid results.  I was not disappointed.  Along with this gadget I am using Facial Weights and a Neck Exercises.  I do all 3 at least 4 times per day, with more reps every few days.  I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but this product just blew me away.  I&#x27;m almost 60 and my facialist has wanted to fill the deep vertical lines in my upper lip for years.  10 days with this device and the lines are completely gone - and I have substantially more lip showing.  Yes, I drool while using it, but who cares?  Reading, watching movies, anytime I can I am working with this device.  I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I always had a bit of a chubby face, along w a double chin, &amp; my cheekbones never stuck out. One day, I looked at amazon for a product that would help and everything looked like an infomercial nightmare. However, I noticed this product in particular had hundreds of good reviews. So, I googled this product and found more good reviews, so I decided to give this product a try. It looks as ridiculous as I felt buying it, but I am so glad I did! It truly works. After abouy six months of using this producy, my double chin and face fat are gone, and my cheekbones are more prominent. My friends have even told me my face looks slimmer. You can simply add this to any daily skincare routine. I use it before bed, while I&#x27;m reading a book. The results aren&#x27;t immediate, so be patient, but it DOES work. ❤🙌</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for one week so hard to tell how well it works, but I feel tighter in jaw line and nasolabial lines seem to be smoothing out a bit - I have deep smile lines so I doubt they will disappear but I like the way it feels after I have used it - it is awkward at first to use, but I was used to it after about 3 or 4 times - it is one of those items that seems you will need to use consistently for good results - I use in morning and evening when I brush my teeth (or when I dry my hair) and plan on using it continuously going forward as it seems to be one of those that you may not see a big difference in the short term but after years of use, you will see great results - I gave four stars only because I have not had it for long - I have already recommended it to several friends (though they laughed at me after seeing the video on youtube of how to use!)</li>
            <li> I have only had this brilliant contraption for less than a week.  Either in the directions or a video of the &amp;#34;Facial-Flex Ultra&amp;#34;, it is stated that after six weeks, most people notice a difference.  I am 48-years-old and I can tell you that I use it two-times a day and I am already beginning to feel see a difference.  My neck, under the chin area, jaw-line and cheeks are all very sore...which is a good thing.  I know through doing resistance training that while doing the exercise, that the resistance creates micro-tears in the muscles.  The tears heal and create a stronger muscle.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this little gizmo would work, but I can definitely feel the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; (a good thing) and see a difference.  I don&#x27;t work for the company, nor did I get &amp;#34;Facial-Flex&amp;#34; free.  I merely found out about it on YouTube.  There were two women (more than that really, but these particular women I could completely identify with) who shared their stories and even demonstrated how to use it.  I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.  :-)</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product. If used every day faithly the results can be great. Face muscles are tightened and wrinkles seem to disappear. Good color to your skin because of the increased circulation. Your skin looks healthy, virbrate and it glows. I&#x27;m a senior citizen and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very helpful little device!  Great for facial strengthening.  The one drawback is that using it causes me to drool a lot.</li>
            <li> This is actually the 3rd one I have purchased over the last 16 years.  The first one I used regularly and it lasted about 12 years.  The second one broke after about 2 years.  I think it was made with inferior  materials.  I have now purchased my 3rd one and so far it is performing well.  If used correctly and consistently, it does firm the jaw, chin and overall firmness of the face.  I am 56 and when I tell people I have been teaching for 32 years, no one believes I could be old enough to have worked that long.  It is not a magic bullet, but It helps.  It is quite expensive when you consider what it&#x27;s made of.  However, for me it was worth it.  It had better last or I will be submitting an angry review.</li>
            <li> I think it works and it doesn&#x27;t take that long. I know I&#x27;m probably imagining it, but I think it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
