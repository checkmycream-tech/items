            <li>The lights are fun, and it diffuses oil great, we use it at night with lavender sometimes ecualyptus.  </li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend to anyone that loves a nice scent of your choice in your home</li>
            <li>Although some may find the light shines too bright.</li>

            <li>Pretty lights and works great.</li>
            <li>It worked great at first.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t great at covering the whole living room but it does work!</li>
            <li>This has been a great product which has done exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Thought it was great at first, but just stopped working after about 10 days.  </li>
            <li>It worked great the first three fills, but it hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
            <li>First one is still working great.</li>
            <li>Great for the first week or so.  </li>
            <li>The first time, it worked great.</li>
            <li>So glad I waited to find the right diffuser because this one is great and the price was even better.</li>
            <li>Made very cheap.</li>
            <li>and wow these things are amazing use peppermint or lavender in them!!</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to fill and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it very much!!!</li>
            <li>I love these...when they work.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I have to admit that I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I like give these as gifts to my friends who love the way my house smells.</li>
            <li>and my house smells like Christmas :)</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for diffusing essential oils and turns off on</li>
            <li>I am using it to diffuse essential oils and was iffy based in reviews that I had read, but this diffser is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and the colors are so awesome!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not like the others</li>
            <li>The steam isn&#x27;t as potent and you have to get warmer water for it to work well.  </li>
            <li>the price, it does ok.  </li>
            <li>Love that it takes tap water</li>
            <li>I like the capacity to hold more water, and the color on/off</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Have to say, I am really pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I truly am enjoying my diffuser.</li>
            <li>but I would spend more on a better diffuser.</li>
            <li>However, I do not like how the top comes apart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a task.</li>
            <li>Would be better if it had a timer.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>She has tried the diffuser that comes with the oils and this one worked better and it is a quarter of the cost.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several nights and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>but on the second day he woke up feeling great!</li>
            <li>, I really love it.</li>
            <li>Please  another machine so that I may begin enjoy using it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way better</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>this product was better quality.</li>
            <li>Love the soothing colors produced.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I love the auto-shut off</li>
            <li>Now my diffuser is working perfectly, and I purchased a second one for a gift.</li>
            <li>My favorite is using lavender with it at night to help soothe and relax me.</li>
            <li>Love this product, and the seller.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and I sleep much better with the oils I add to the diffuser</li>
            <li>and we love them.  </li>
            <li>The Greenair Spa Vapor is probably one of the best diffusers for someone starting out with aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>As I started getting into aromatherapy, I decided to put my money on good quality oils rather than a really nice diffuser for now, and I&#x27;m glad I made that decision, since it takes a while to build up some good working knowledge of essential oil blending and uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving only four stars because a diffuser that I would love (as opposed to like) would be one that performed as wonderfully</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am purchasing 3 more to use throughout the house.  </li>
            <li>We love ours and bought another for a gift.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Just wish it held more water.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this one instead.</li>
            <li>and I love the color changes.</li>
            <li>I love my diffuser.</li>
            <li>Thank You :)</li>
            <li>Had this for about a month and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100</li>
            <li>We use it mostly in our 3 year olds&#x27; room at bedtime to diffuse lavender and cedarwood, but sometimes we&#x27;ll move it to the living room if we have people over</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Plan on purchasing one or two more.</li>
            <li>I wish it would hold more water and run for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Love it and so did my coworkers and we bought two more.</li>
            <li>I wish it held more water so it would run all day, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this diffuser!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the vapor.</li>
            <li>I am compleatly satisfied with my experience</li>
            <li>I really love it -</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Love my diffuser just wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li>We use this every night religiously and it gives out the best amount of vapor...</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it, using it now :-)</li>
            <li>Love this type of diffusers.</li>
            <li>Be sure to fill the water to the line inside the unit, or it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Alissa had different oils with her and experimented with the uses to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>This product is very much enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>They love them.</li>
            <li>love, love, love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>:) if you press the button for the lights once, it rotates through the colors.</li>
            <li>It is so quiet and the amount of fragrant is perfect.</li>
            <li>My kids love the lights, and I love the lights can be optional.</li>
            <li>Much better (and prettier) is the NOW Foods Wood Grain diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love the lights, my one concern is the 3 separate pieces that you have to take off in order to put water and oil in.</li>
            <li>Bought more for gifts</li>
            <li>The recipient totally enjoyed the gift.</li>
            <li>I love that it does this WITHOUT making a noise or beep to wake me up at night.  </li>
            <li>Returned and looking for something better.</li>
            <li>I have a couple diffusers and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>I hesitated buying any diffuser because so many people complain about them stop working.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love the changing lights as it serves as a nightlight too.</li>
            <li>and they sent me two more (except for the top part).  </li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This model is much better and&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has helped my husband and I sleep much better at night.</li>
            <li>However, instead of an appropriately sized resistor, they stacked two resistors.</li>
            <li>I love to use it as a nightlight for my grandchildren.</li>
            <li>I love love it.</li>
            <li>I would give this diffuser more stars if I could.</li>
            <li>This unit has been more of a hassle than anything.</li>
            <li>I really do love this.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to get the DoTerra Petal and hope for better luck.</li>
            <li>I love the color changing too.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t overfill it.</li>
            <li>and then it was able to shake and create vapor.</li>
            <li>I love it and it helps with head colds.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have put my money into a better product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just getting started with using essential oils and love diffusing them!!!!!</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>How we are enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li>i love my diffuser</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>So instead of picking up the lid and pouring more water in you have to remove 3 separate pieces and replace them all each time.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My child loves the light color changing aspect!</li>
            <li>love, love love it</li>
            <li>It has good output and is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple brands of diffuser, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I wish it could hold more water.</li>
            <li>We love the colors.</li>
            <li>I had been wanting a diffuser, but was balking at the prices of the better rated ones.</li>
            <li>After viewing many of the diffusers, I purchased what my daughter had for her 2 year olds room.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, if you get a good one I bet you&#x27;ll love it, but it appears the reviews that criticize the company&#x27;s Quality Control are right on.</li>
            <li>So far so good!    </li>
            <li>It is far superior to this one!</li>
            <li>Adds moisture to the room, and light is very cool!</li>
            <li>Looks pretty and works great for a night light.  </li>
            <li>With small children in the home I didn&#x27;t like that, but I loved the diffuser - great for the price!</li>
            <li>Good diffuser at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was able to return through the original vendor very easily.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;re super pleased with it!</li>
            <li>The light it great for morning or evening, but it is entirely too bright to use as a nightlight.  </li>
            <li>I finally bought this after having it in my cart for month, glad I did, it&#x27;s so nice for making the house smell great.</li>
            <li>I just purchased two (2) more: one for my bed side table to put calming oils in while I sleep and one for my living/kitchen area for pleasant smells, mainly orange oil which I love.</li>
            <li>It produces a nice cool mist and runs for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet but excited to!</li>
            <li>so I guess that is worth a star!!</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I gave this newer version as a gift, and the recipient has loved it, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>Works great so far!</li>
            <li>Great price and got here pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>They are very light weight-- too light weight.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean without worrying about any kind of mold developing, etc.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and keep clean, it makes any room I put it in smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>Essential Oils smell great and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser works great in a large living area, is fairly quiet and I&#x27;m totally happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the Greenair Spa Vapor very much!!</li>
            <li>Worked great at first but now, after cleaning, put fresh water and oils in, will turn on for 3 seconds and then shuts off.</li>
            <li>Love the light show.  </li>
            <li>but so far it works great.</li>
            <li>A great product so far.</li>
            <li>I use it to freshen the air in my house &amp; the cool light show is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love the light feature and the ability to turn off the lights while diffuser still runs.</li>
            <li>Love that it changes colors or that you can turn light off.</li>
            <li>and my kids love the color changing night light.</li>
            <li>I love that the light can be turned on and off, and that it automatically turns off after about it runs out of water/oil.</li>
            <li>Just push the light button when it gets to the color you want and it will stay that color for the remainder of the run time:)</li>
            <li>It is a good starter diffuser, if you want to try one out without investing too much.</li>
            <li>and I just loved how much output it had.</li>
            <li>And while customer service is good, it doesn&#x27;t pay to get this diffuser because it&#x27;s really a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Doesen&#x27;t rise into the air as much as I would like but still a good product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li>Also easy to clean!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and love the color light show too.</li>
            <li>I PLUGGED it in after putting the right amount of warm water as it said to do..</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Great price, nice amount of vapor, definitely lasts for 5 hours when full.</li>
            <li>I was scared because of some of the other reviews I saw, but this is definitely a great starter diffuser!!!</li>
            <li>I make sure to clean it out after every use and air it out.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li>I love it and its easy to clean and operate</li>
            <li>But it might be worth spending a bit more to get something that works better.</li>
            <li>Love the mist and so easy to use and clean with no wicks to worry about.</li>
            <li>dilluted with lavendar, I just make sure to clean it with vinegar and water after (it also comes with a cleaning brush).</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much, that I purchased more for family members and friends.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to clean it after every use to prolong the life of this unit.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>The return process was easy, hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li>It cleans up easily and completely-never had a problem.</li>
            <li>very quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>This gets used basically every night and is still running strong.</li>
            <li>Must is strong and lasts for about 3-3 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>I have used it continuously for over a month, cleaned it once, and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Very good output, you only need a few drops of oil and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It will be nice to purchase a higher end diffuser when I&#x27;ve built up that knowledge.   </li>
            <li>It is quiet and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love the cool colors, and the automatic shut off when out of water.  </li>
            <li>I use doterra oils and this is a totally quiet machine that has beautiful night color display.</li>
            <li>2-3 drops works fine.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, reliable, and not too attention-getting.</li>
            <li>Now when I turn it on it make a noise and spurts out diffused air while it &amp;#34;warms up??&amp;#34;  then eventually works fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>Has a light, but can easily turn off.  </li>
            <li>The product does work just fine.</li>
            <li>This is just a slight inconvenience though compared to the value of the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greenair has really wonderful customer service as well!</li>
            <li>Light weight easy to use.</li>
            <li>This diffuser emits a spark whenever I plug it in, but worked fine for about six months.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, as described!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, you put in 1/3 cup warm water and up to 5 drops of oil, easy to clean and pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really diffuses my oils nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is the best little gizmo ever.</li>
            <li>This little diffuser has been been great!  </li>
            <li>Wish you could pick which color was on but overall very pleased!</li>
            <li>and I use them everyday, they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>As of 1/5/16 it does not work, the light work but the misting does not work.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and you have the option to turn off the light.</li>
            <li>I like that you can still use the diffuser without having the light on.</li>
            <li>I read reviews saying that you cannot keep the light on one color.....</li>
            <li>I have two of these in the earlier model and they work great.</li>
            <li>Update - Diffuser still works great even after dropping it several times.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use / clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes the light on it, but I think it looks a bit</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to clean and fill.  </li>
            <li>light changes color blows out stems</li>
            <li>Great diffuser for my doTERRA essential oils!!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the light.</li>
            <li>The light changes between colors.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use with my DoTerra essential oils and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I filled the water up to the fill line.  </li>
            <li>Customer service was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great for larger rooms!</li>
            <li>I think it will do great in larger rooms as well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic diffuser.</li>
            <li>Works great for essential oils.</li>
            <li>The light is helpful to remember when it is on.</li>
            <li>and I use it as a night light.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday in my classroom and it works GREAT!  </li>
            <li>The lights are nice for a night light, although it would be nice if you could stop them on only one color.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a cleaning brush so its easy to get in and clean.</li>
            <li>It works great, but only runs about 2 hrs.</li>
            <li>I never use the light, so I haven&#x27;t tested that.</li>
            <li>Wanted one in the living room for more fresh smells.</li>
            <li>We use it in the kitchen primarily, so the changing lights are not an issue for us.</li>
            <li>easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>that the light is optional</li>
            <li>I took mine apart, and the connections were sound.</li>
            <li>It has a separate light button and power button</li>
            <li>When the water runs out, the diffuser and light turns off.</li>
            <li>You can still use the machine with the light off.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic diffuser.</li>
            <li>Works great, is quiet, and the lights are a neat function!</li>
            <li>Easy set up and clean up</li>
            <li>It would also be neat if they had a color option for the lights...rather than the rotating light show.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap</li>
            <li>When it was working I was happy with it, but I would think it should last longer.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these diffusers because I loved the first one so much that I got another one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day!  </li>
            <li>So far so good..</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good - it&#x27;s been six?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean and user friendly</li>
            <li>Great product if your clean it regularly.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t turn the light on (thanks for making that easy to do!).</li>
            <li>i love love my new diffuser</li>
            <li>The one I received looks like the original Spa Vapor.</li>
            <li>I will be returning it since it seems like an even cheaper knockoff of the original.</li>
            <li>I originally got one from a friend and ended up buying another one.</li>
            <li>Diffuser arrived and we were excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I already have one these and was excited about getting another one.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought one first and returned to buy 4 more.</li>
            <li>Love love love this diffuser lasts several hours.</li>
            <li>but rather if they could recommend a more reliable model of their diffuser as this one seems to have consistent issues.</li>
            <li>original review:(one start rating)  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my original Greenair Spa.  </li>
            <li>Gives significant output.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I did not purchase the one offered by Young Living.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to purchase my first diffuser, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money</li>
            <li>We notified customer service and they kindly allowed us to keep the new parts as well.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t clean it, your vapor amount is reduced.</li>
            <li>Customer Service advised us how to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Love the ambience it gives with the various colors and of course the diffuser works amazing .</li>
            <li>i clean it out after use and have never had a problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned 3 different brands of diffusers and this one is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li>Just remember to clean it often.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been my best essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>I received the carrier oils today for use on our bodies using the same oils but love the diffuser to use and fill the house with amazing aroma and wellness.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I need to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with it so far ,also am pleased with the price and that it performs just as described.</li>
            <li>just makes the idea of shopping online LESS than ideal.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and operate just the right size.</li>
            <li>Just the right size to use and easy to move from room to room.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but felt strongly that this should not be listed as a Best Seller and is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to love this and was so excited to get it.</li>
            <li>and I love that I am helping my family by using pure oils.</li>
            <li>I was super excited while setting it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>At first I was happy with this product until I went to plug it in the second time.</li>
            <li>My signature scent is patchouli and sweet orange.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cannot fill to full line - it will not steam:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, looks cool, a bit loud but who cares--consider it white noise for relaxation :)</li>
            <li>Since this does everything with cool mist</li>
            <li>Some times my power button doesn&#x27;t work and some times it takes  a while to get full steam going.</li>
            <li>If I want the full four hours I fill the water  chamber to the fill line.</li>
            <li>The Vapor 2 is very efficient and can run all morning before adding more water and oils.</li>
            <li>The lights on cool too.  </li>
            <li>I love it, but mine doesn&#x27;t really mist.</li>
            <li>on the full setting.  </li>
            <li>I use a Good Night essential oil mix, and I&#x27;ve had no problems since I bought it.</li>
            <li>That is good for me because I use a different oil in the morning when Mom gets up</li>
            <li>My final choice is a good one.</li>
            <li>The changing light is fun.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend to anyone looking for a good priced diffuser.</li>
            <li>Works really good but wished it would last a full 7 hours</li>
            <li>How lucky I am to have such a bright daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li>was pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>but the fragrance would be super strong at first and then wear off within an hour, then it would stay on until you unplugged it.</li>
            <li>I use it in my kitchen with On Guard for a great homeopathic tool in the fight against the flu and other seasonal threats.  </li>
            <li>even more thrilled when I first plugged it in and started diffusing my EO&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, about a month later it has puked out.</li>
            <li>Helps with my husband&#x27;s allergies tremendously running peppermint and lavender, and</li>
            <li>Love the soft light.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really lucky, you can time it</li>
            <li>but okay glad it finally arrived..</li>
            <li>Now when you consider more and more companies can send Amazon defective products for what ever reason.. and you the consumer has to wait only to be dissapointed  </li>
            <li>Way better than the high priced ones I have used and/or seen.</li>
            <li>very good product, standing up to excessive use</li>
            <li>I love this little guy, nice option to turn the light off since my boyfriend says he can see the lights through his eyelids.</li>
            <li>The first one is still working fantastic.</li>
            <li>Initially I was very pleased with the purchase both with cost and with function.</li>
            <li>I use my dōTERRA essential oils in them and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It is pretty to look at when the light is on and its running.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li>(Aren&#x27;t positive reviews so much easier?!)&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because I really liked it at first, when it worked.</li>
            <li>Love the new improved spa vapor!&lt;br /&gt;Bought them for friends Christmas presents</li>
            <li>Had an issue with one and the customer service was top notch and sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>New updated version is top notch.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying my new diffuser.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>in combination with essential oils I am sleeping better!</li>
            <li>Came back and bought two more!</li>
            <li>I would suggest any other kind!</li>
            <li>/&gt;SMALL, PRETTY, FUNCTIONAL!</li>
            <li>Makes my personal space lovely!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super quiet and I love that the light is optional.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of diffusing essential oils, is very quiet and the size makes it easy to place in any room.</li>
            <li>This little diffuser fills up out great room, dining room, and kitchen.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>diffuser works great with little maintenance.</li>
            <li>Quit happy with my little diffuser.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for smaller room, although I use it in a large master bedroom and because it is on the nightstand next to the bed</li>
            <li>I received this diffuser a few weeks ago and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I thought it felt cheaply made straight out of the box</li>
            <li>but i too experienced it breaking on me within a few weeks of using.</li>
            <li>Powerful Diffuser.  </li>
            <li>So far seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>Got a second one at my own cost.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice diffuser for the price.</li>
            <li>Works great with my Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>Also, when you are filling and dumping water out of it, make sure not to do so near the air intake.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth it and would purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li>That way, we can return to a fresh smelling home.</li>
            <li>Love these diffusers use with young living oils for all health issues or just air freshner</li>
            <li>Read several reviews and kind of wondered but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love that the light has on on-off switch independent of the unit in-off</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>But easy to clean, colors are soothing and love the way I can use tap water and forget about it as it turns off automatically when empty.</li>
            <li>I love this product,you can get about 5 hours on the second speed,I don&#x27;t care for the lights,I can&#x27;t sleep with a light on.</li>
            <li>We all actually seems to be thriving in optimum healthy and wellness and loving my homemade floral joyful mood blends, my memory and clarity blends, and my citrus energizing blends to name a few!!</li>
            <li>but runs out of water pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>One works, but gets hot quickly and the plug shoots sparks (even when it wasn&#x27;t connected to the unit).</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.we use this on a daily basis with no issues.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>Took it out of the box and started diffusing right away.</li>
            <li>The button on the right is either on, intermittent, or off; the machine also shuts off when the water is about to run out.</li>
            <li>They will make it right.</li>
            <li>Dissappointed there was an issue right away, but it was solved with a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My puppy relaxes and goes right to sleep.</li>
            <li>The on/off button does not tell you if it is on or off and there is no way of knowing unless you can get on the right angle to see if it is misting or not.</li>
            <li>i explained the situation and they sent a brand new one in the mail very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really disappointed, because I was so happy to get this from all the great reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think they really need to update the listing so that it&#x27;s accurate and people know exactly what they&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li>One of our other friends had issues with hers, so fingers crossed, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser!  </li>
            <li>This is a great little vaporizer!  </li>
            <li>A great little diffuser! .....</li>
            <li>But...my favorite part...there is an interval option (30 sec I think), which means I can easily run it all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price and great product, have been using everyday, twice a day, for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li>I have several different kinds and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Lights work, provides hours of mist, and has a nice, long cord.</li>
            <li>Upon returning home from vacation, this original diffuser was working like new!  </li>
            <li>I also found the diffuser very easy to refill--so easy that I can trust my eighth graders to do it with little</li>
            <li>The first one I got had to be returned right away.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy that you can easily direct the mist in whatever direction works best and the lighting provides further calming effect, especially when the room is dim.</li>
            <li>Simple design, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It works great for a small unit which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Just enough diffusing, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>I liked the diffuser so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>so I can use only the diffuser part, or both the diffuser and the light, or just the light.</li>
            <li>like you can my second favorite one (hint; smile).  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I ordered another and will probably end up with a third!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little machine, it&#x27;s relatively quiet (sounds like a low hum) and it puts out a good mist that fills the room with the oil scent.</li>
            <li>I like it very much i am satisfy</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and never actually worked.  </li>
            <li>VERY VERY dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to receive my new greenair spa Diffuser</li>
            <li>I seriously loved this little diffuser when I first got it(was a gift).</li>
            <li>but overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Best of used in small area such as a bedroom.</li>
            <li>how many hours because I&#x27;ve only run it at night.</li>
            <li>Recommend this over the higher priced diffusers.</li>
            <li>The color changes are so pretty and relaxing, I get compliments on it all the time from my guests.</li>
            <li>I prefer a design that only has one piece to take off the top.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did not like about this was the part on the top comes off</li>
            <li>so I will be sending them back and looking for a better made diffuser.</li>
            <li>When I first plugged this in it didn&#x27;t appear to work.  </li>
            <li>The first one I purchased I keep with me in my office at work.  </li>
            <li>Had difficulty with this product at first, but I got the hang of it</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think they worked.</li>
            <li>Since that if what I did in the first place, I didn&#x27;t trust that I would receive what I reordered either.</li>
            <li>and I immediately threw out this diffuser as it was now most likely a fire</li>
            <li>Have used it 2 nights in a row w/ lavender oil and very relaxing!</li>
            <li>dealt with Amazon, not the seller, but was able to send it back for a prompt refund.</li>
            <li>It was my first buy</li>
            <li>What a real gift!</li>
            <li>Each diffuser comes with use and cleaning instructions which I followed exactly.</li>
            <li>The first night we used it, it stopped working, and water leaked through the bottom.</li>
            <li>To get the most out of your diffuser,just use it properly.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser is SO quiet and I love the changing colors.</li>
            <li>Only thing that would be better is longer run time.</li>
            <li>My married daughters each have two apiece.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product for myself.</li>
            <li>You should not have any problem if you follow the instructions and cleaning exactly as advised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty to watch the changing colors - very soothing for my oil therapy!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Better for smaller rooms.</li>
            <li>Initially I was pleased but it died a week ago.</li>
            <li>Next time I will invest in a better quality diffuser.</li>
            <li>Worked the first 2 days and then stopped.  </li>
            <li>It stopped working after 3-4 weeks (the on/off button also did not work consistently).  </li>
            <li>My whole family lives it!</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I bought another one!</li>
            <li>Bought the first one for my bedroom and bought this one for my kitchen area.  </li>
            <li>first diffuser just quit working all together after two weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could diffuse my favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li>I actually did love it when it worked the first night I used it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the green air spa diffuser I loved it and used it every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely disappointed because the price was great and it received good reviews.  </li>
            <li>First, You have to add luke-warm water into this diffuser;  that is a royal pain.  </li>
            <li>and it did for the first hour i used it.  </li>
            <li>It was my favorite until it died within a year and the second one with a motor I can hear across the room</li>
            <li>I am looking for a different one that works better.</li>
            <li>My first one.</li>
            <li>are that the spout for the mist is moveable and the light colors can go on dim.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described and what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly the product I wanted.</li>
            <li>My first choice is the Samyo.  </li>
            <li>I love having a second diffuser in my home.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t contact the Love 2 Shop people because it diverts you BACk to amazon..  </li>
            <li>This is significantly better, at a much lesser cost.</li>
            <li>If the water temperature wasn&#x27;t exactly the correct temperature, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>am returning this product and hoping my next diffuser will be better.</li>
            <li>I have 3 different diffusers and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to first order this diffused to use with my essential oils and the first one I received sparked A LOT every time I plugged it in.</li>
            <li>It was very frustrating to try and get the machine to the perfect water temperature to have it</li>
            <li>My little guy loves that it has lights on it because he was going through a &amp;#34;scared&amp;#34; phase and we were able to use this as his night light as well as to diffuse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to fill, empty (if needed) and clean.  </li>
            <li>It has really done wonders in helping me sleep better at night and not have my asthmatic allergies acting up.</li>
            <li>I love the light for my tiddler&#x27;s room and that we have the option of rotating colors, one color, or no light.</li>
            <li>However I have been able to work around the issue by filling the diffuser with only as much water as I need for the time I wish to diffuse.</li>
            <li>The capacity is pretty large</li>
            <li>I do have to say the first one works real well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product exactly as described...</li>
            <li>I love that it lasts so long</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, but it is the first diffuser I have owned, so don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>also love that when it turns off it does not make noise (my 80.00 spaceship looking one beeps when it is out of water and turning off, so it wakes me up)&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I love how long it lasts 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>I put about 5 drops of essential oil in it, with cool water, and it creates cool vapor by gently vibrating the inside of the diffuser, where the water is held.</li>
            <li>It has a slight hum to it that could be good for people who enjoy some white noise, but mostly easily ignorable, as I am very sensitive to sound as long as it is not on top of me I do not really hear it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again for an extra, but will probably upgrade to a better diffuser for the main part of the house.</li>
            <li>and I love the price for a decent diffuser for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>and my clients love it gives off the right amount of mist and essential oil and shuts off completely as well...</li>
            <li>The new base worked perfectly and now, months after using it, it is still going strong!</li>
            <li>This diffuser is so easy to use, just fill with water, drop some essential oils in and turn it on!  </li>
            <li>Easy to move to different rooms if need to!</li>
            <li>Works just as good if not better than my very pricy youngliving diffuser.</li>
            <li>if you press the button for the lights on a certain color, it stops on that color and no longer rotates through the colors.</li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t from over use.</li>
            <li>Spring a few more bucks for a nicer one that won&#x27;t corrode with oils (as it was intended to be used for!)</li>
            <li>so I contacted the company who sent me a new one right away.</li>
            <li>Diffusion is the safest method of essential oil use with very little to no risk for sensitization, it is also the best method for using essential oils (child safe oils only) with children.  </li>
            <li>I ordered different Greenair product which seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>Amazing little diffuser for home.</li>
            <li>It puts out lots of vapor and aroma into the air, but it does have a little noise, kind of like a computer running.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great little diffuser, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet, which is a huge plus, since I can&#x27;t sleep with any noises in the room.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can complain about is the cheap looking plastic its made from considering the price.</li>
            <li>Everytime I call, goes straight to voicemail, and no one has returned my call.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a gift for my wife &amp; she absolutely loves</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li>Seems very unsafe to me, waiting on seller and Amazon to address the problem.</li>
            <li>Very calming</li>
            <li>It sounds like a jet ready to take off.</li>
            <li>light is on off only and when on goes through a verity of colors.</li>
            <li>It  arrived in time, wrapped very well and intact.  </li>
            <li>This makes my whole working area smell spa like.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my friend for recommending this to me</li>
            <li>Very efficient.</li>
            <li>The on off button sticks - have to be gentle in pushing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last pretty long and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is really spa quality.  </li>
            <li>The person I spoke with was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>but that didn&#x27;t require as much cleaning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Product worked very well for three months.</li>
            <li>This thing really clears the air in a room.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>This service really doesn&#x27;t deserve any stars.</li>
            <li>and then it still doesn&#x27;t have much output at all.  </li>
            <li>Now my boss wants one..</li>
            <li>Favorite feature is that it automatically turns off when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li>Our son has sleep maintenance disorder (wakes up all the time at night) and now we all sleep thanks to some lavender and this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>So I used it last night without the light feature...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to distribute much fragrance.  </li>
            <li>sent the whole thing flying apart with water and oil everywhere.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving this two stars is that I enjoy the diffusers while they work, I just refuse to replace it for not working every two months.</li>
            <li>but I need to really time it.</li>
            <li>Now my daughter wants one for her apartment.</li>
            <li>but it did arrive rather fast</li>
            <li>Fast delivery is</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable but it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; style if you want something to display, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This product is the closet thing to me like being at the spa without getting to go to the spa as much as I would like to.</li>
            <li>or it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I can use regular tap water, and I can turn the light off.</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose, although it does not seem to be very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I like this diffuser, it works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li>The on/off situation seemed to have been resolved, but I don&#x27; smell anything when it runs regardless of how much oil I use.  </li>
            <li>Now the unit runs and I smell absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>A great lower-end essential oil diffuser to supplement my more expensive one...</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that there is no option to select the color of light.  </li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>and it was too much.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes things much easier.</li>
            <li>It is very finicky......</li>
            <li>and it is very quite.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>I really like it....  </li>
            <li>i was really hoping this would work</li>
            <li>Using the Breathe oil with the unit really helps with congestion.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>It does what I want it to do and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing in the evening.</li>
            <li>I had to keep putting my hand up to create a backdrop to see if there really was vapor...  </li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but no mist came out at all when I set it up.</li>
            <li>After six months when I plugged it in the whole thing sparked when I plugged in and blew the motor so now it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was the different colors it changes, but even at that it would rotate through the colors every 5 seconds</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made compared to other diffusers I have.</li>
            <li>I ordered the unit shown, which appears to be the older model, but the seller (Day Dream) sent me an email after ordering that said I&#x27;d be getting the newest model (2.0), so be aware of that if you&#x27;re specifically wanting the older model.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that the different components of the unit don&#x27;t attach to each other for a more secure diffuser.</li>
            <li>The second one not so good, I am in the process of returning it due to</li>
            <li>The large square footage was one of the main reasons I bought it.  </li>
            <li>it drips water everywhere, and if you use it every night it will last about a year if you don&#x27;t clean it really well every day.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when they arrived, only to find out that neither one of them will even turn on - neither lights or the mister work on either unit....</li>
            <li>For a small machine and for such a great price this is a real workhorse.</li>
            <li>For the price this diffuser works extremely well and my kids love the color changing lights.  </li>
            <li>You have to clean it after every use for proper maintenance.</li>
            <li>They gave me advice on how to clean the inside of the diffuser and told me to call back if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>We will clean with either citric acid, or white vinegar.  </li>
            <li>Second, the warranty states that you MUST thoroughly clean this diffuser out after EVERY use;  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s built cheaply and it&#x27;s not nearly as easy to clean as advertised.</li>
            <li>Even they were apparently too powerful (think Lavender) because they discolored the plastic on the inside.</li>
            <li>I bought the diffuser hoping it will work better than the little one I have that uses pads, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to diffuse much in the air.</li>
            <li>I just love this little thing and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>They can be opened and closed easily.  </li>
            <li>There is an opening where water can easily get into the motor if you aren&#x27;t careful....</li>
            <li>Also - it could just be the particular oils we are using-</li>
            <li>It put out a decent flow but after a month it stopped working.</li>
            <li>The aromas fill the room quickly and the unit is very quiet.</li>
            <li>This one will run for about 4 hours with one fill up, with a steady distribution of EO throughout, then will shut off when it&#x27;s out of water.</li>
            <li>Light stays on red, can&#x27;t shut it off, and no vapor action.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quiet.  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm, super quiet too.</li>
            <li>I am going to get another one for our main living room and get rid of our scentsy candles.</li>
            <li>am enjoying it every day using different essential</li>
            <li>you can even stop it on a particular color if you like&lt;br /&gt;Relatively  </li>
            <li>emission is steady and lasts a longer period during operation.</li>
            <li>This is enough to saturate my kitchen with lovely smells, and it&#x27;s enough to get rid of cooking smells.</li>
            <li>It is a decent diffuser.</li>
            <li>Spits out a steady stream of scented vapor with a directional spout.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it was a little bigger but fine for smaller areas.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is it is very light weight and can easily be tipped over.</li>
            <li>Now, it is not nearly as powerful as the Young Living one, but it also comes with a more reasonable price tag.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really be sitting right next to it</li>
            <li>I use with high quality oils and distilled water with no problem.</li>
            <li>Does the job without the high price tag.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Nothing like my sisters high scent output.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>and I have done some research, and this item comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product does a good job of distributing the aroma and a constant stream of mist, however, I do live in a small apartment and am not asking much of it.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it held more water and lasted a little bit longer.</li>
            <li>The company does offer designer styles if you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by Young Living, that and lavender put kids to bed in no time!!</li>
            <li>Oh..I also love the little cleaning brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Works fine for small areas or right on the nightstand for a lavender infused sleep.</li>
            <li>I barely had mine a week and it ran 2 days misting great and slowly was barely anything.  </li>
            <li>so far they work really well</li>
            <li>Using it everyday and love it</li>
            <li>It worked very well when I first used it, and in fact I had to hold back on the number of oil drops I used as the smell</li>
            <li>It would be nice if this diffuser could run continuously throughout the night (at least 7 hours without the mineral water dependency).</li>
            <li>I cleaned it as directed &amp; have no hard water issues.  </li>
            <li>We make sure to leave it open to air dry after each use.</li>
            <li>When I sleep I press the color button once so that it just stays on my chosen red color as the rotation of the other colors are too bright to sleep next to.</li>
            <li>But, I didn&#x27;t open it right away, and by the time it stopped working, it was no longer eligible for return.</li>
            <li>so had it been the right one maybe it would have actually worked.</li>
            <li>just right when you push the button to freeze the lights so that you can get colors between the official ones - such as blue-purple.</li>
            <li>Going to buy a few more for other rooms in the house as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it in a Great Open Room, which does not allow the smell to be transferred into the entire room, therefore if you are looking to for a larger room this may not be the model for you.  </li>
            <li>The advice was....hot HOT water in the diffuser (after it is unplugged of course), let it sit for a few minutes and use a q-tip to clean the ceramic disc.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not particularly fond of, is all the parts to the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lights can be turned off, and the vaporizer shuts off automatically when the water runs out, no annoying beap to wake you or your kids up like other models.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing new and improved here.</li>
            <li>Requested a new one and have not gotten it yet.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new unit.</li>
            <li>What a shame now I have to go find a new one.</li>
            <li>Can I return this one for a new one?  </li>
            <li>Came within the week in new condition.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m thinking that this is going to be too unreliable and will be on the search for a new one.</li>
            <li>Have used this for yrs and had to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I learned the hard way that this is better than taking the whole unit to the sink.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much all day long</li>
            <li>The appearance is subtle, which is nice.</li>
            <li>received this gift from my son, used it 4-5 times, and it never worked again, tried to contact company, no response, do not waste your money on this item, I am a 72 yr old mother and took care of it the way the directions said, very disapointed in the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the diffuser a few weeks now and so far am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Very loud for a diffuser</li>
            <li>I tried a few different essential oil diffusers and this was the first one I liked.</li>
            <li>The Greenair Spa Vapor Diffuser was the first essential oil diffuser that our family purchased.  </li>
            <li>It is very key to make sure you only fill up to the line or it will not work properly.</li>
            <li>On a related note, I dropped it on the first day onto a hardwood floor and it survived with no problems.</li>
            <li>Then today, I went to refill it and unplugged it and noticed that the input for the power cord was completely corroded!</li>
            <li>It is the exact same one.</li>
            <li>i had to send the first one back; it was defective.</li>
            <li>One thing I would caution you on is not to add too much essential oil the first time.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the diffuser I put in 5 drops of do Terra Breathe essential oil</li>
            <li>I use the do-Terra essential oils in Serenity and Lavender in it for a peaceful nights rest.</li>
            <li>The only thing, though, is that this puts out a pretty substantial cloud.  </li>
            <li>This is the second of this exact diffuser that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is also a newer version of this with a larger water tank that lasts longer and has only one lid (fewer parts to clean or lose).</li>
            <li>If you take care to clean the unit after each use, you will likely get a decent long life of this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>There are 3 different light settings - no light, a solid light, and a mode where the colors fade together.</li>
            <li>I have 3 other different diffusers throughout my home, and this is my favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the new version (since it clearly states in the description as the &amp;#34;new and improved greenspa vapor 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have to feel around inside the diffuser to find the &amp;#34;fill to&amp;#34; water line, but the new version has a visible ridge all the way around the diffuser to show how far to fill it with water.</li>
            <li>so far the new diffuser is working well.</li>
            <li>Mine produces mist for 6-7 hours, but I read in another review that if you turn the light on, it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>Item was received quickly and packaged carefully.</li>
            <li>The issue I found was that every use actually meant two or three uses, because I more often diffused for short periods of time (30 minutes) rather than long periods of time (4 hours).</li>
            <li>The light cycles through several colors, or can be stopped on a single color.</li>
            <li>I was very particular about cleaning after every use, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>We use it several times a day when we are home and it fills a large room with the diffused oils.</li>
            <li>The second one I bought is more expensive than the first one I bought and doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>and I have plugged it into multiple power outlets, made sure it was tightly plugged in, and nothing works.</li>
            <li>It puts out as much vapor as my big MIU 500ml diffuser that I bought for our large open floorplan living area.</li>
            <li>I love this little machine!!</li>
            <li>Maintenance is minimal but after only one month of use the On button and Light button didn&#x27;t work one evening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for nearly 3wks now</li>
            <li>It works well so far.</li>
            <li>I wish  I can do something to clear the old oil smell.</li>
            <li>I have this is my young sons room.</li>
            <li>This one, the II version, is incredibly loud.</li>
            <li>As far as performance, it works</li>
            <li>Mine does not work, completely pissed</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say as loud as a humidifier or anything, but it does make a bit of a noise.</li>
            <li>So far, I have bought 6</li>
            <li>but as I am very dissatisfied with the customer service at Amazon , In the future,  I will search elsewhere for what I need.</li>
            <li>The second one I bought at Whole foods</li>
            <li>and it is so loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much nicer to use and get the benefits of healing essential oils that you can mix and customize, in an air freshener type product.</li>
            <li>I will be buying at least one more for my house.</li>
            <li>Even though the price is low, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Bought two so far.  </li>
            <li>The power button is sensitive though</li>
            <li>I absolutely believe the Spa Vapor and essential oils contributed to my husband recovery.</li>
            <li>Bought this one after seeing in action at sister&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this diffuser to my Young Living team all the time.</li>
            <li>Much smaller than imagined, also does not put off much vapor like my youngliving diffusers.  </li>
            <li>So far, it works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping my old review up as an FYI.  </li>
            <li>follows is my old</li>
            <li>Use a smaller amount to see how much it mists out.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money or time on this over priced-non working product.</li>
            <li>So really that only leaves one side that can face the faucet.</li>
            <li>I got busy with a move and never called the company.</li>
            <li>I decided to get a second one after my sister mentioned they were changed a bit and that customer service was really helpful if I had a problem again.</li>
            <li>however, i contacted the manufacturer directly via email.</li>
            <li>(the lights were flashing and there was some water near it)...</li>
            <li>So far it works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working without any issues.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also an on-off setting for the light, but there&#x27;s no control over which color you get; it just switches through each color, a few seconds at a time.</li>
            <li>Its a bit larger than I expected, maybe about 10&amp;#34; high but its a nice little unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, produces a strong mist and never lets me down.  </li>
            <li>It shuts off when empty and the lights are nice especially when dark.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I returned it and have found a new one I like even better!</li>
            <li>I had an issue with a different model and they sent me a new one, no questions asked!</li>
            <li>They do not require a lot of maintenance, but clean every few uses.  </li>
            <li>I learned about this particular diffuser while in a middle school classroom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these exact same ones now and its the same thing with both of them.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one the first one lasted a year, the second one has a noisy motor</li>
            <li>we found 5-6 drops (the amount recommended on instructions) to be a little strong if you are actually sitting in the room where the diffuser is.</li>
            <li>A few days short of 2 years, with consistent usage, and this little guy is still going strong!  </li>
            <li>I changed oils and took very good care of it. :(</li>
            <li>It is a very powerful little diffuser !</li>
            <li>Normally, I will send someone something that I personally like</li>
            <li>Be aware that this does make a little noise (think the volume level of the fan in your computer), plus there&#x27;s a little water splashing sound</li>
            <li>When the diffuser still wasn&#x27;t working properly, customer service promptly sent out a new part.  </li>
            <li>Because it was supposed to be new and improved I ordered this product rather than the cheaper one by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li>it shows the model with only two buttons, but the new model has 3 buttons plus indicator lights as to what setting you have it on (I&#x27;ve added a picture of the one I got, for reference/comparison).</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one.</li>
            <li>This is the second one and having two of these things going at the same time fills my whole house with grate smelling aromas.</li>
            <li>Wish it ran for at least 8 hours, or I was able to slow it down to last longer, but very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I bought it after a lot of consideration of other diffusers out there, and it was the first one I ever bought.</li>
            <li>The fill line inside melted off during the first use (the water is not hot).  </li>
            <li>The two major problems I have with this product are: 1)  </li>
            <li>I clean it about once a week with a Q-tip on the small plate</li>
            <li>Prior to buying this little beauty, I was using a plug in room diffuser (the little ball type) which was fine for a first introduction to EOs</li>
            <li>The only issue I have, and it&#x27;s not related to the machine itself, is that after a few hours the EO&#x27;s aren&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>The only down side is you have to clean it really regularly</li>
            <li>It is significantly less than many other diffusers on the market and has withstood the test of time and countless days and nights of diffusing.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend for general use.</li>
            <li>Customer service gave me the run-around and was generally unhelpful.</li>
            <li>Very dependable and long lasting.</li>
            <li>So far, I have had this diffuser for 6 months and its still running strong...even being used daily!!!!!</li>
            <li>Fill it with doTERRA&#x27;s On Guard or Young Living&#x27;s Thieves and diffuse next to you or your children at night to kill any germs in their bedroom or their body.</li>
            <li>I use many different blends of essential oils in my diffuser and it has been running in the room with my small pet birds the entire time and they have not been bothered whatsoever.</li>
            <li>they sent me old model ,it doesnt working with water and picture is different than i got,i give them 0.00 star</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near 4 hours.</li>
            <li>although i was disappointed my diffuser broke, i was very surprised and pleased that the company sent a replacement completely complimentary.</li>
            <li>After returning my first unit, I thought I would try again, seeing if I just got the odd bum one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;update: (five stars)&lt;br /&gt;After contacting Greenair I spoke with one of the most friendly customer service agents I have ever spoken to.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to put off as much steam and vapor as other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>Compared to some other diffusers, this one really dispurses the vapor/oils</li>
            <li>I love this little machine and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I Love my Greenair Spa Vapor 2 and have used it once everyday since I purchased a little over two months ago.  </li>
            <li>Quiet - soft white noise</li>
            <li>then I will go on every Social media and share this review..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but for now it is working fine.  </li>
            <li>I do clean it as recommended, we have hard water; I just use a different brush.  </li>
            <li>but they should really get that spark thing under control, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where people had the same problem.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they&#x27;ll be mailing me a replacement (3 months later).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this diffuser and any other product Greenair makes.</li>
            <li>It is not at all an expensive design, plasticy really, but it immediately produces sweet smell smelling steam, filling the air with the fragrance of one&#x27;s choosing.</li>
            <li>Not a  long lasting diffuser</li>
            <li>There was not too much or too little water.</li>
            <li>The company told me they are the same thing, so I could have gotten the other model (not the new and improved plus one) for a lower price.</li>

            <li> This is not my favorite but a great option.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> the most important thing is this:  1)  lukewarm water works best.  </li>

            <li> function is nice.</li>
            <li> The colored lights are nice and it does diffuse well though.</li>
            <li> and I like that it turns off on its own.</li>
            <li> and now I own and Epson printer.</li>
            <li> It creates mist as soon as you turn it on, and the rotating colored lights are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The instructions do not tell you, but i figured out that you have to use warm water for it to work at all</li>
            <li> The colors are really nice too.</li>
            <li> Have a nice day.&amp;#34; See the attached picture of the corrosion on the board.</li>
            <li> I own two of these diffusers and my colleague owns 2 as well and her family all purchased one.</li>
            <li> I liked this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Nice diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Oh, what a spectacular surprise when she set it up.  </li>
            <li> this item is great we have bought 5 of them and all have arrived really soon and worked great</li>

            <li> It has automatic shut off, which is really nice since I cant remember to check on it.</li>
            <li> We love to diffuse the Breath blend at night when we have the sniffles to keep coughing at bay and these run a good 8</li>
            <li> The lights inside it make a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for the excellent customer service tho!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes the house smell so good with the Thieves Oil I&#x27;ve added.</li>
            <li> for how it was while it worked, I liked it.</li>

            <li> Very easy to set up and plug in.  </li>
            <li> This would be very easy to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> I love it and my kids love it!</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased, will be ordering more for each room!</li>
            <li> Very good product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It was too bright for my son while he was sleeping so it was nice to be able to turn the light off.</li>
            <li> I love it and intend to buy one of my own.</li>
            <li> The lights are fun, and it diffuses oil great, we use it at night with lavender sometimes ecualyptus.  </li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend to anyone that loves a nice scent of your choice in your home</li>
            <li> Although some may find the light shines too bright.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 more and they work amazing.</li>

            <li> Works great very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great diffuser at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a whole month!</li>
            <li> Exactly what wanted great product</li>
            <li> and I am pretty darn happy with it.</li>
            <li> We purchased this item and it worked great at first</li>
            <li> Works great and the LED lights are pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty lights and works great.</li>
            <li> It worked great at first.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t great at covering the whole living room but it does work!</li>
            <li> This has been a great product which has done exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was great at first, but just stopped working after about 10 days.  </li>
            <li> It worked great the first three fills, but it hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
            <li> First one is still working great.</li>
            <li> Great for the first week or so.  </li>
            <li> The first time, it worked great.</li>
            <li> So glad I waited to find the right diffuser because this one is great and the price was even better.</li>
            <li> Made very cheap.</li>
            <li> and wow these things are amazing use peppermint or lavender in them!!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to fill and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it very much!!!</li>
            <li> I love these...when they work.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit that I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I like give these as gifts to my friends who love the way my house smells.</li>
            <li> and my house smells like Christmas :)</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for diffusing essential oils and turns off on</li>
            <li> I am using it to diffuse essential oils and was iffy based in reviews that I had read, but this diffser is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and the colors are so awesome!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not like the others</li>
            <li> The steam isn&#x27;t as potent and you have to get warmer water for it to work well.  </li>
            <li> the price, it does ok.  </li>
            <li> Love that it takes tap water</li>
            <li> I like the capacity to hold more water, and the color on/off</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Have to say, I am really pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I truly am enjoying my diffuser.</li>
            <li> but I would spend more on a better diffuser.</li>
            <li> However, I do not like how the top comes apart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a task.</li>
            <li> Would be better if it had a timer.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> She has tried the diffuser that comes with the oils and this one worked better and it is a quarter of the cost.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several nights and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> but on the second day he woke up feeling great!</li>
            <li> , I really love it.</li>
            <li> Please  another machine so that I may begin enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way better</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> this product was better quality.</li>
            <li> Love the soothing colors produced.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I love the auto-shut off</li>
            <li> Now my diffuser is working perfectly, and I purchased a second one for a gift.</li>
            <li> My favorite is using lavender with it at night to help soothe and relax me.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and the seller.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> and I sleep much better with the oils I add to the diffuser</li>
            <li> and we love them.  </li>
            <li> The Greenair Spa Vapor is probably one of the best diffusers for someone starting out with aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> As I started getting into aromatherapy, I decided to put my money on good quality oils rather than a really nice diffuser for now, and I&#x27;m glad I made that decision, since it takes a while to build up some good working knowledge of essential oil blending and uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving only four stars because a diffuser that I would love (as opposed to like) would be one that performed as wonderfully</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am purchasing 3 more to use throughout the house.  </li>
            <li> We love ours and bought another for a gift.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Just wish it held more water.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this one instead.</li>
            <li> and I love the color changes.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Thank You :)</li>
            <li> Had this for about a month and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100</li>
            <li> We use it mostly in our 3 year olds&#x27; room at bedtime to diffuse lavender and cedarwood, but sometimes we&#x27;ll move it to the living room if we have people over</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Plan on purchasing one or two more.</li>
            <li> I wish it would hold more water and run for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Love it and so did my coworkers and we bought two more.</li>
            <li> I wish it held more water so it would run all day, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love the vapor.</li>
            <li> I am compleatly satisfied with my experience</li>
            <li> I really love it -</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love my diffuser just wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li> We use this every night religiously and it gives out the best amount of vapor...</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, using it now :-)</li>
            <li> Love this type of diffusers.</li>
            <li> Be sure to fill the water to the line inside the unit, or it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Alissa had different oils with her and experimented with the uses to get the best results.  </li>
            <li> This product is very much enjoyed.  </li>
            <li> They love them.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> :) if you press the button for the lights once, it rotates through the colors.</li>
            <li> It is so quiet and the amount of fragrant is perfect.</li>
            <li> My kids love the lights, and I love the lights can be optional.</li>
            <li> Much better (and prettier) is the NOW Foods Wood Grain diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love the lights, my one concern is the 3 separate pieces that you have to take off in order to put water and oil in.</li>
            <li> Bought more for gifts</li>
            <li> The recipient totally enjoyed the gift.</li>
            <li> I love that it does this WITHOUT making a noise or beep to wake me up at night.  </li>
            <li> Returned and looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I have a couple diffusers and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> I hesitated buying any diffuser because so many people complain about them stop working.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Love the changing lights as it serves as a nightlight too.</li>
            <li> and they sent me two more (except for the top part).  </li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model is much better and&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has helped my husband and I sleep much better at night.</li>
            <li> However, instead of an appropriately sized resistor, they stacked two resistors.</li>
            <li> I love to use it as a nightlight for my grandchildren.</li>
            <li> I love love it.</li>
            <li> I would give this diffuser more stars if I could.</li>
            <li> This unit has been more of a hassle than anything.</li>
            <li> I really do love this.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to get the DoTerra Petal and hope for better luck.</li>
            <li> I love the color changing too.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t overfill it.</li>
            <li> and then it was able to shake and create vapor.</li>
            <li> I love it and it helps with head colds.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have put my money into a better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting started with using essential oils and love diffusing them!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> How we are enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li> i love my diffuser</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> So instead of picking up the lid and pouring more water in you have to remove 3 separate pieces and replace them all each time.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My child loves the light color changing aspect!</li>
            <li> love, love love it</li>
            <li> It has good output and is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple brands of diffuser, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I wish it could hold more water.</li>
            <li> We love the colors.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting a diffuser, but was balking at the prices of the better rated ones.</li>
            <li> After viewing many of the diffusers, I purchased what my daughter had for her 2 year olds room.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, if you get a good one I bet you&#x27;ll love it, but it appears the reviews that criticize the company&#x27;s Quality Control are right on.</li>
            <li> So far so good!    </li>
            <li> It is far superior to this one!</li>
            <li> Adds moisture to the room, and light is very cool!</li>
            <li> Looks pretty and works great for a night light.  </li>
            <li> With small children in the home I didn&#x27;t like that, but I loved the diffuser - great for the price!</li>
            <li> Good diffuser at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was able to return through the original vendor very easily.  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;re super pleased with it!</li>
            <li> The light it great for morning or evening, but it is entirely too bright to use as a nightlight.  </li>
            <li> I finally bought this after having it in my cart for month, glad I did, it&#x27;s so nice for making the house smell great.</li>
            <li> I just purchased two (2) more: one for my bed side table to put calming oils in while I sleep and one for my living/kitchen area for pleasant smells, mainly orange oil which I love.</li>
            <li> It produces a nice cool mist and runs for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but excited to!</li>
            <li> so I guess that is worth a star!!</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I gave this newer version as a gift, and the recipient has loved it, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Works great so far!</li>
            <li> Great price and got here pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> They are very light weight-- too light weight.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean without worrying about any kind of mold developing, etc.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and keep clean, it makes any room I put it in smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Essential Oils smell great and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser works great in a large living area, is fairly quiet and I&#x27;m totally happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Greenair Spa Vapor very much!!</li>
            <li> Worked great at first but now, after cleaning, put fresh water and oils in, will turn on for 3 seconds and then shuts off.</li>
            <li> Love the light show.  </li>
            <li> but so far it works great.</li>
            <li> A great product so far.</li>
            <li> I use it to freshen the air in my house &amp; the cool light show is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love the light feature and the ability to turn off the lights while diffuser still runs.</li>
            <li> Love that it changes colors or that you can turn light off.</li>
            <li> and my kids love the color changing night light.</li>
            <li> I love that the light can be turned on and off, and that it automatically turns off after about it runs out of water/oil.</li>
            <li> Just push the light button when it gets to the color you want and it will stay that color for the remainder of the run time:)</li>
            <li> It is a good starter diffuser, if you want to try one out without investing too much.</li>
            <li> and I just loved how much output it had.</li>
            <li> And while customer service is good, it doesn&#x27;t pay to get this diffuser because it&#x27;s really a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Doesen&#x27;t rise into the air as much as I would like but still a good product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li> Also easy to clean!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and love the color light show too.</li>
            <li> I PLUGGED it in after putting the right amount of warm water as it said to do..</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Great price, nice amount of vapor, definitely lasts for 5 hours when full.</li>
            <li> I was scared because of some of the other reviews I saw, but this is definitely a great starter diffuser!!!</li>
            <li> I make sure to clean it out after every use and air it out.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li> I love it and its easy to clean and operate</li>
            <li> But it might be worth spending a bit more to get something that works better.</li>
            <li> Love the mist and so easy to use and clean with no wicks to worry about.</li>
            <li> dilluted with lavendar, I just make sure to clean it with vinegar and water after (it also comes with a cleaning brush).</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much, that I purchased more for family members and friends.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to clean it after every use to prolong the life of this unit.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> The return process was easy, hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> It cleans up easily and completely-never had a problem.</li>
            <li> very quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> This gets used basically every night and is still running strong.</li>
            <li> Must is strong and lasts for about 3-3 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li> I have used it continuously for over a month, cleaned it once, and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Very good output, you only need a few drops of oil and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> It will be nice to purchase a higher end diffuser when I&#x27;ve built up that knowledge.   </li>
            <li> It is quiet and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love the cool colors, and the automatic shut off when out of water.  </li>
            <li> I use doterra oils and this is a totally quiet machine that has beautiful night color display.</li>
            <li> 2-3 drops works fine.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, reliable, and not too attention-getting.</li>
            <li> Now when I turn it on it make a noise and spurts out diffused air while it &amp;#34;warms up??&amp;#34;  then eventually works fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  </li>
            <li> Has a light, but can easily turn off.  </li>
            <li> The product does work just fine.</li>
            <li> This is just a slight inconvenience though compared to the value of the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greenair has really wonderful customer service as well!</li>
            <li> Light weight easy to use.</li>
            <li> This diffuser emits a spark whenever I plug it in, but worked fine for about six months.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping, as described!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, you put in 1/3 cup warm water and up to 5 drops of oil, easy to clean and pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really diffuses my oils nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is the best little gizmo ever.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser has been been great!  </li>
            <li> Wish you could pick which color was on but overall very pleased!</li>
            <li> and I use them everyday, they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> As of 1/5/16 it does not work, the light work but the misting does not work.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and you have the option to turn off the light.</li>
            <li> I like that you can still use the diffuser without having the light on.</li>
            <li> I read reviews saying that you cannot keep the light on one color.....</li>
            <li> I have two of these in the earlier model and they work great.</li>
            <li> Update - Diffuser still works great even after dropping it several times.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use / clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes the light on it, but I think it looks a bit</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to clean and fill.  </li>
            <li> light changes color blows out stems</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for my doTERRA essential oils!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light.</li>
            <li> The light changes between colors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my DoTerra essential oils and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I filled the water up to the fill line.  </li>
            <li> Customer service was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great for larger rooms!</li>
            <li> I think it will do great in larger rooms as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works great for essential oils.</li>
            <li> The light is helpful to remember when it is on.</li>
            <li> and I use it as a night light.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday in my classroom and it works GREAT!  </li>
            <li> The lights are nice for a night light, although it would be nice if you could stop them on only one color.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a cleaning brush so its easy to get in and clean.</li>
            <li> It works great, but only runs about 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> I never use the light, so I haven&#x27;t tested that.</li>
            <li> Wanted one in the living room for more fresh smells.</li>
            <li> We use it in the kitchen primarily, so the changing lights are not an issue for us.</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> that the light is optional</li>
            <li> I took mine apart, and the connections were sound.</li>
            <li> It has a separate light button and power button</li>
            <li> When the water runs out, the diffuser and light turns off.</li>
            <li> You can still use the machine with the light off.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works great, is quiet, and the lights are a neat function!</li>
            <li> Easy set up and clean up</li>
            <li> It would also be neat if they had a color option for the lights...rather than the rotating light show.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap</li>
            <li> When it was working I was happy with it, but I would think it should last longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these diffusers because I loved the first one so much that I got another one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day!  </li>
            <li> So far so good..</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good - it&#x27;s been six?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean and user friendly</li>
            <li> Great product if your clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t turn the light on (thanks for making that easy to do!).</li>
            <li> i love love my new diffuser</li>
            <li> The one I received looks like the original Spa Vapor.</li>
            <li> I will be returning it since it seems like an even cheaper knockoff of the original.</li>
            <li> I originally got one from a friend and ended up buying another one.</li>
            <li> Diffuser arrived and we were excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I already have one these and was excited about getting another one.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought one first and returned to buy 4 more.</li>
            <li> Love love love this diffuser lasts several hours.</li>
            <li> but rather if they could recommend a more reliable model of their diffuser as this one seems to have consistent issues.</li>
            <li> original review:(one start rating)  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my original Greenair Spa.  </li>
            <li> Gives significant output.  </li>
            <li> Very glad I did not purchase the one offered by Young Living.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase my first diffuser, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money</li>
            <li> We notified customer service and they kindly allowed us to keep the new parts as well.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t clean it, your vapor amount is reduced.</li>
            <li> Customer Service advised us how to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Love the ambience it gives with the various colors and of course the diffuser works amazing .</li>
            <li> i clean it out after use and have never had a problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 different brands of diffusers and this one is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li> Just remember to clean it often.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been my best essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> I received the carrier oils today for use on our bodies using the same oils but love the diffuser to use and fill the house with amazing aroma and wellness.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with it so far ,also am pleased with the price and that it performs just as described.</li>
            <li> just makes the idea of shopping online LESS than ideal.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and operate just the right size.</li>
            <li> Just the right size to use and easy to move from room to room.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but felt strongly that this should not be listed as a Best Seller and is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this and was so excited to get it.</li>
            <li> and I love that I am helping my family by using pure oils.</li>
            <li> I was super excited while setting it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> At first I was happy with this product until I went to plug it in the second time.</li>
            <li> My signature scent is patchouli and sweet orange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cannot fill to full line - it will not steam:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, looks cool, a bit loud but who cares--consider it white noise for relaxation :)</li>
            <li> Since this does everything with cool mist</li>
            <li> Some times my power button doesn&#x27;t work and some times it takes  a while to get full steam going.</li>
            <li> If I want the full four hours I fill the water  chamber to the fill line.</li>
            <li> The Vapor 2 is very efficient and can run all morning before adding more water and oils.</li>
            <li> The lights on cool too.  </li>
            <li> I love it, but mine doesn&#x27;t really mist.</li>
            <li> on the full setting.  </li>
            <li> I use a Good Night essential oil mix, and I&#x27;ve had no problems since I bought it.</li>
            <li> That is good for me because I use a different oil in the morning when Mom gets up</li>
            <li> My final choice is a good one.</li>
            <li> The changing light is fun.</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend to anyone looking for a good priced diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works really good but wished it would last a full 7 hours</li>
            <li> How lucky I am to have such a bright daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> was pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> but the fragrance would be super strong at first and then wear off within an hour, then it would stay on until you unplugged it.</li>
            <li> I use it in my kitchen with On Guard for a great homeopathic tool in the fight against the flu and other seasonal threats.  </li>
            <li> even more thrilled when I first plugged it in and started diffusing my EO&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, about a month later it has puked out.</li>
            <li> Helps with my husband&#x27;s allergies tremendously running peppermint and lavender, and</li>
            <li> Love the soft light.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really lucky, you can time it</li>
            <li> but okay glad it finally arrived..</li>
            <li> Now when you consider more and more companies can send Amazon defective products for what ever reason.. and you the consumer has to wait only to be dissapointed  </li>
            <li> Way better than the high priced ones I have used and/or seen.</li>
            <li> very good product, standing up to excessive use</li>
            <li> I love this little guy, nice option to turn the light off since my boyfriend says he can see the lights through his eyelids.</li>
            <li> The first one is still working fantastic.</li>
            <li> Initially I was very pleased with the purchase both with cost and with function.</li>
            <li> I use my dōTERRA essential oils in them and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is pretty to look at when the light is on and its running.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> (Aren&#x27;t positive reviews so much easier?!)&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because I really liked it at first, when it worked.</li>
            <li> Love the new improved spa vapor!&lt;br /&gt;Bought them for friends Christmas presents</li>
            <li> Had an issue with one and the customer service was top notch and sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> New updated version is top notch.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new diffuser.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> in combination with essential oils I am sleeping better!</li>
            <li> Came back and bought two more!</li>
            <li> I would suggest any other kind!</li>
            <li> /&gt;SMALL, PRETTY, FUNCTIONAL!</li>
            <li> Makes my personal space lovely!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super quiet and I love that the light is optional.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of diffusing essential oils, is very quiet and the size makes it easy to place in any room.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser fills up out great room, dining room, and kitchen.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> diffuser works great with little maintenance.</li>
            <li> Quit happy with my little diffuser.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for smaller room, although I use it in a large master bedroom and because it is on the nightstand next to the bed</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser a few weeks ago and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I thought it felt cheaply made straight out of the box</li>
            <li> but i too experienced it breaking on me within a few weeks of using.</li>
            <li> Powerful Diffuser.  </li>
            <li> So far seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> Got a second one at my own cost.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice diffuser for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great with my Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> Also, when you are filling and dumping water out of it, make sure not to do so near the air intake.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth it and would purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> That way, we can return to a fresh smelling home.</li>
            <li> Love these diffusers use with young living oils for all health issues or just air freshner</li>
            <li> Read several reviews and kind of wondered but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love that the light has on on-off switch independent of the unit in-off</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> But easy to clean, colors are soothing and love the way I can use tap water and forget about it as it turns off automatically when empty.</li>
            <li> I love this product,you can get about 5 hours on the second speed,I don&#x27;t care for the lights,I can&#x27;t sleep with a light on.</li>
            <li> We all actually seems to be thriving in optimum healthy and wellness and loving my homemade floral joyful mood blends, my memory and clarity blends, and my citrus energizing blends to name a few!!</li>
            <li> but runs out of water pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> One works, but gets hot quickly and the plug shoots sparks (even when it wasn&#x27;t connected to the unit).</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.we use this on a daily basis with no issues.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> Took it out of the box and started diffusing right away.</li>
            <li> The button on the right is either on, intermittent, or off; the machine also shuts off when the water is about to run out.</li>
            <li> They will make it right.</li>
            <li> Dissappointed there was an issue right away, but it was solved with a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My puppy relaxes and goes right to sleep.</li>
            <li> The on/off button does not tell you if it is on or off and there is no way of knowing unless you can get on the right angle to see if it is misting or not.</li>
            <li> i explained the situation and they sent a brand new one in the mail very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really disappointed, because I was so happy to get this from all the great reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think they really need to update the listing so that it&#x27;s accurate and people know exactly what they&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li> One of our other friends had issues with hers, so fingers crossed, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser!  </li>
            <li> This is a great little vaporizer!  </li>
            <li> A great little diffuser! .....</li>
            <li> But...my favorite part...there is an interval option (30 sec I think), which means I can easily run it all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good price and great product, have been using everyday, twice a day, for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have several different kinds and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Lights work, provides hours of mist, and has a nice, long cord.</li>
            <li> Upon returning home from vacation, this original diffuser was working like new!  </li>
            <li> I also found the diffuser very easy to refill--so easy that I can trust my eighth graders to do it with little</li>
            <li> The first one I got had to be returned right away.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy that you can easily direct the mist in whatever direction works best and the lighting provides further calming effect, especially when the room is dim.</li>
            <li> Simple design, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It works great for a small unit which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Just enough diffusing, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I liked the diffuser so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> so I can use only the diffuser part, or both the diffuser and the light, or just the light.</li>
            <li> like you can my second favorite one (hint; smile).  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I ordered another and will probably end up with a third!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little machine, it&#x27;s relatively quiet (sounds like a low hum) and it puts out a good mist that fills the room with the oil scent.</li>
            <li> I like it very much i am satisfy</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and never actually worked.  </li>
            <li> VERY VERY dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive my new greenair spa Diffuser</li>
            <li> I seriously loved this little diffuser when I first got it(was a gift).</li>
            <li> but overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Best of used in small area such as a bedroom.</li>
            <li> how many hours because I&#x27;ve only run it at night.</li>
            <li> Recommend this over the higher priced diffusers.</li>
            <li> The color changes are so pretty and relaxing, I get compliments on it all the time from my guests.</li>
            <li> I prefer a design that only has one piece to take off the top.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like about this was the part on the top comes off</li>
            <li> so I will be sending them back and looking for a better made diffuser.</li>
            <li> When I first plugged this in it didn&#x27;t appear to work.  </li>
            <li> The first one I purchased I keep with me in my office at work.  </li>
            <li> Had difficulty with this product at first, but I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think they worked.</li>
            <li> Since that if what I did in the first place, I didn&#x27;t trust that I would receive what I reordered either.</li>
            <li> and I immediately threw out this diffuser as it was now most likely a fire</li>
            <li> Have used it 2 nights in a row w/ lavender oil and very relaxing!</li>
            <li> dealt with Amazon, not the seller, but was able to send it back for a prompt refund.</li>
            <li> It was my first buy</li>
            <li> What a real gift!</li>
            <li> Each diffuser comes with use and cleaning instructions which I followed exactly.</li>
            <li> The first night we used it, it stopped working, and water leaked through the bottom.</li>
            <li> To get the most out of your diffuser,just use it properly.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser is SO quiet and I love the changing colors.</li>
            <li> Only thing that would be better is longer run time.</li>
            <li> My married daughters each have two apiece.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this product for myself.</li>
            <li> You should not have any problem if you follow the instructions and cleaning exactly as advised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty to watch the changing colors - very soothing for my oil therapy!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Better for smaller rooms.</li>
            <li> Initially I was pleased but it died a week ago.</li>
            <li> Next time I will invest in a better quality diffuser.</li>
            <li> Worked the first 2 days and then stopped.  </li>
            <li> It stopped working after 3-4 weeks (the on/off button also did not work consistently).  </li>
            <li> My whole family lives it!</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I bought another one!</li>
            <li> Bought the first one for my bedroom and bought this one for my kitchen area.  </li>
            <li> first diffuser just quit working all together after two weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could diffuse my favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li> I actually did love it when it worked the first night I used it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the green air spa diffuser I loved it and used it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely disappointed because the price was great and it received good reviews.  </li>
            <li> First, You have to add luke-warm water into this diffuser;  that is a royal pain.  </li>
            <li> and it did for the first hour i used it.  </li>
            <li> It was my favorite until it died within a year and the second one with a motor I can hear across the room</li>
            <li> I am looking for a different one that works better.</li>
            <li> My first one.</li>
            <li> are that the spout for the mist is moveable and the light colors can go on dim.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described and what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I wanted.</li>
            <li> My first choice is the Samyo.  </li>
            <li> I love having a second diffuser in my home.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t contact the Love 2 Shop people because it diverts you BACk to amazon..  </li>
            <li> This is significantly better, at a much lesser cost.</li>
            <li> If the water temperature wasn&#x27;t exactly the correct temperature, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> am returning this product and hoping my next diffuser will be better.</li>
            <li> I have 3 different diffusers and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to first order this diffused to use with my essential oils and the first one I received sparked A LOT every time I plugged it in.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating to try and get the machine to the perfect water temperature to have it</li>
            <li> My little guy loves that it has lights on it because he was going through a &amp;#34;scared&amp;#34; phase and we were able to use this as his night light as well as to diffuse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to fill, empty (if needed) and clean.  </li>
            <li> It has really done wonders in helping me sleep better at night and not have my asthmatic allergies acting up.</li>
            <li> I love the light for my tiddler&#x27;s room and that we have the option of rotating colors, one color, or no light.</li>
            <li> However I have been able to work around the issue by filling the diffuser with only as much water as I need for the time I wish to diffuse.</li>
            <li> The capacity is pretty large</li>
            <li> I do have to say the first one works real well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product exactly as described...</li>
            <li> I love that it lasts so long</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, but it is the first diffuser I have owned, so don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> also love that when it turns off it does not make noise (my 80.00 spaceship looking one beeps when it is out of water and turning off, so it wakes me up)&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I love how long it lasts 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> I put about 5 drops of essential oil in it, with cool water, and it creates cool vapor by gently vibrating the inside of the diffuser, where the water is held.</li>
            <li> It has a slight hum to it that could be good for people who enjoy some white noise, but mostly easily ignorable, as I am very sensitive to sound as long as it is not on top of me I do not really hear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again for an extra, but will probably upgrade to a better diffuser for the main part of the house.</li>
            <li> and I love the price for a decent diffuser for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> and my clients love it gives off the right amount of mist and essential oil and shuts off completely as well...</li>
            <li> The new base worked perfectly and now, months after using it, it is still going strong!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is so easy to use, just fill with water, drop some essential oils in and turn it on!  </li>
            <li> Easy to move to different rooms if need to!</li>
            <li> Works just as good if not better than my very pricy youngliving diffuser.</li>
            <li> if you press the button for the lights on a certain color, it stops on that color and no longer rotates through the colors.</li>
            <li> It certainly wasn&#x27;t from over use.</li>
            <li> Spring a few more bucks for a nicer one that won&#x27;t corrode with oils (as it was intended to be used for!)</li>
            <li> so I contacted the company who sent me a new one right away.</li>
            <li> Diffusion is the safest method of essential oil use with very little to no risk for sensitization, it is also the best method for using essential oils (child safe oils only) with children.  </li>
            <li> I ordered different Greenair product which seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing little diffuser for home.</li>
            <li> It puts out lots of vapor and aroma into the air, but it does have a little noise, kind of like a computer running.  </li>
            <li> This is a really great little diffuser, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet, which is a huge plus, since I can&#x27;t sleep with any noises in the room.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can complain about is the cheap looking plastic its made from considering the price.</li>
            <li> Everytime I call, goes straight to voicemail, and no one has returned my call.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my wife &amp; she absolutely loves</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> Seems very unsafe to me, waiting on seller and Amazon to address the problem.</li>
            <li> Very calming</li>
            <li> It sounds like a jet ready to take off.</li>
            <li> light is on off only and when on goes through a verity of colors.</li>
            <li> It  arrived in time, wrapped very well and intact.  </li>
            <li> This makes my whole working area smell spa like.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to my friend for recommending this to me</li>
            <li> Very efficient.</li>
            <li> The on off button sticks - have to be gentle in pushing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last pretty long and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is really spa quality.  </li>
            <li> The person I spoke with was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> but that didn&#x27;t require as much cleaning.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Product worked very well for three months.</li>
            <li> This thing really clears the air in a room.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> This service really doesn&#x27;t deserve any stars.</li>
            <li> and then it still doesn&#x27;t have much output at all.  </li>
            <li> Now my boss wants one..</li>
            <li> Favorite feature is that it automatically turns off when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> Our son has sleep maintenance disorder (wakes up all the time at night) and now we all sleep thanks to some lavender and this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> So I used it last night without the light feature...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to distribute much fragrance.  </li>
            <li> sent the whole thing flying apart with water and oil everywhere.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this two stars is that I enjoy the diffusers while they work, I just refuse to replace it for not working every two months.</li>
            <li> but I need to really time it.</li>
            <li> Now my daughter wants one for her apartment.</li>
            <li> but it did arrive rather fast</li>
            <li> Fast delivery is</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable but it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; style if you want something to display, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This product is the closet thing to me like being at the spa without getting to go to the spa as much as I would like to.</li>
            <li> or it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I can use regular tap water, and I can turn the light off.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose, although it does not seem to be very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I like this diffuser, it works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li> The on/off situation seemed to have been resolved, but I don&#x27; smell anything when it runs regardless of how much oil I use.  </li>
            <li> Now the unit runs and I smell absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> A great lower-end essential oil diffuser to supplement my more expensive one...</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that there is no option to select the color of light.  </li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> and it was too much.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes things much easier.</li>
            <li> It is very finicky......</li>
            <li> and it is very quite.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> I really like it....  </li>
            <li> i was really hoping this would work</li>
            <li> Using the Breathe oil with the unit really helps with congestion.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> It does what I want it to do and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing in the evening.</li>
            <li> I had to keep putting my hand up to create a backdrop to see if there really was vapor...  </li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but no mist came out at all when I set it up.</li>
            <li> After six months when I plugged it in the whole thing sparked when I plugged in and blew the motor so now it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about it was the different colors it changes, but even at that it would rotate through the colors every 5 seconds</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made compared to other diffusers I have.</li>
            <li> I ordered the unit shown, which appears to be the older model, but the seller (Day Dream) sent me an email after ordering that said I&#x27;d be getting the newest model (2.0), so be aware of that if you&#x27;re specifically wanting the older model.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the different components of the unit don&#x27;t attach to each other for a more secure diffuser.</li>
            <li> The second one not so good, I am in the process of returning it due to</li>
            <li> The large square footage was one of the main reasons I bought it.  </li>
            <li> it drips water everywhere, and if you use it every night it will last about a year if you don&#x27;t clean it really well every day.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when they arrived, only to find out that neither one of them will even turn on - neither lights or the mister work on either unit....</li>
            <li> For a small machine and for such a great price this is a real workhorse.</li>
            <li> For the price this diffuser works extremely well and my kids love the color changing lights.  </li>
            <li> You have to clean it after every use for proper maintenance.</li>
            <li> They gave me advice on how to clean the inside of the diffuser and told me to call back if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> We will clean with either citric acid, or white vinegar.  </li>
            <li> Second, the warranty states that you MUST thoroughly clean this diffuser out after EVERY use;  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built cheaply and it&#x27;s not nearly as easy to clean as advertised.</li>
            <li> Even they were apparently too powerful (think Lavender) because they discolored the plastic on the inside.</li>
            <li> I bought the diffuser hoping it will work better than the little one I have that uses pads, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to diffuse much in the air.</li>
            <li> I just love this little thing and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> They can be opened and closed easily.  </li>
            <li> There is an opening where water can easily get into the motor if you aren&#x27;t careful....</li>
            <li> Also - it could just be the particular oils we are using-</li>
            <li> It put out a decent flow but after a month it stopped working.</li>
            <li> The aromas fill the room quickly and the unit is very quiet.</li>
            <li> This one will run for about 4 hours with one fill up, with a steady distribution of EO throughout, then will shut off when it&#x27;s out of water.</li>
            <li> Light stays on red, can&#x27;t shut it off, and no vapor action.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quiet.  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm, super quiet too.</li>
            <li> I am going to get another one for our main living room and get rid of our scentsy candles.</li>
            <li> am enjoying it every day using different essential</li>
            <li> you can even stop it on a particular color if you like&lt;br /&gt;Relatively  </li>
            <li> emission is steady and lasts a longer period during operation.</li>
            <li> This is enough to saturate my kitchen with lovely smells, and it&#x27;s enough to get rid of cooking smells.</li>
            <li> It is a decent diffuser.</li>
            <li> Spits out a steady stream of scented vapor with a directional spout.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it was a little bigger but fine for smaller areas.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is it is very light weight and can easily be tipped over.</li>
            <li> Now, it is not nearly as powerful as the Young Living one, but it also comes with a more reasonable price tag.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really be sitting right next to it</li>
            <li> I use with high quality oils and distilled water with no problem.</li>
            <li> Does the job without the high price tag.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nothing like my sisters high scent output.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> and I have done some research, and this item comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of distributing the aroma and a constant stream of mist, however, I do live in a small apartment and am not asking much of it.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it held more water and lasted a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> The company does offer designer styles if you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by Young Living, that and lavender put kids to bed in no time!!</li>
            <li> Oh..I also love the little cleaning brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Works fine for small areas or right on the nightstand for a lavender infused sleep.</li>
            <li> I barely had mine a week and it ran 2 days misting great and slowly was barely anything.  </li>
            <li> so far they work really well</li>
            <li> Using it everyday and love it</li>
            <li> It worked very well when I first used it, and in fact I had to hold back on the number of oil drops I used as the smell</li>
            <li> It would be nice if this diffuser could run continuously throughout the night (at least 7 hours without the mineral water dependency).</li>
            <li> I cleaned it as directed &amp; have no hard water issues.  </li>
            <li> We make sure to leave it open to air dry after each use.</li>
            <li> When I sleep I press the color button once so that it just stays on my chosen red color as the rotation of the other colors are too bright to sleep next to.</li>
            <li> But, I didn&#x27;t open it right away, and by the time it stopped working, it was no longer eligible for return.</li>
            <li> so had it been the right one maybe it would have actually worked.</li>
            <li> just right when you push the button to freeze the lights so that you can get colors between the official ones - such as blue-purple.</li>
            <li> Going to buy a few more for other rooms in the house as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it in a Great Open Room, which does not allow the smell to be transferred into the entire room, therefore if you are looking to for a larger room this may not be the model for you.  </li>
            <li> The advice was....hot HOT water in the diffuser (after it is unplugged of course), let it sit for a few minutes and use a q-tip to clean the ceramic disc.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not particularly fond of, is all the parts to the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lights can be turned off, and the vaporizer shuts off automatically when the water runs out, no annoying beap to wake you or your kids up like other models.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing new and improved here.</li>
            <li> Requested a new one and have not gotten it yet.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new unit.</li>
            <li> What a shame now I have to go find a new one.</li>
            <li> Can I return this one for a new one?  </li>
            <li> Came within the week in new condition.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m thinking that this is going to be too unreliable and will be on the search for a new one.</li>
            <li> Have used this for yrs and had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that this is better than taking the whole unit to the sink.</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much all day long</li>
            <li> The appearance is subtle, which is nice.</li>
            <li> received this gift from my son, used it 4-5 times, and it never worked again, tried to contact company, no response, do not waste your money on this item, I am a 72 yr old mother and took care of it the way the directions said, very disapointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the diffuser a few weeks now and so far am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Very loud for a diffuser</li>
            <li> I tried a few different essential oil diffusers and this was the first one I liked.</li>
            <li> The Greenair Spa Vapor Diffuser was the first essential oil diffuser that our family purchased.  </li>
            <li> It is very key to make sure you only fill up to the line or it will not work properly.</li>
            <li> On a related note, I dropped it on the first day onto a hardwood floor and it survived with no problems.</li>
            <li> Then today, I went to refill it and unplugged it and noticed that the input for the power cord was completely corroded!</li>
            <li> It is the exact same one.</li>
            <li> i had to send the first one back; it was defective.</li>
            <li> One thing I would caution you on is not to add too much essential oil the first time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the diffuser I put in 5 drops of do Terra Breathe essential oil</li>
            <li> I use the do-Terra essential oils in Serenity and Lavender in it for a peaceful nights rest.</li>
            <li> The only thing, though, is that this puts out a pretty substantial cloud.  </li>
            <li> This is the second of this exact diffuser that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is also a newer version of this with a larger water tank that lasts longer and has only one lid (fewer parts to clean or lose).</li>
            <li> If you take care to clean the unit after each use, you will likely get a decent long life of this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 different light settings - no light, a solid light, and a mode where the colors fade together.</li>
            <li> I have 3 other different diffusers throughout my home, and this is my favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the new version (since it clearly states in the description as the &amp;#34;new and improved greenspa vapor 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have to feel around inside the diffuser to find the &amp;#34;fill to&amp;#34; water line, but the new version has a visible ridge all the way around the diffuser to show how far to fill it with water.</li>
            <li> so far the new diffuser is working well.</li>
            <li> Mine produces mist for 6-7 hours, but I read in another review that if you turn the light on, it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and packaged carefully.</li>
            <li> The issue I found was that every use actually meant two or three uses, because I more often diffused for short periods of time (30 minutes) rather than long periods of time (4 hours).</li>
            <li> The light cycles through several colors, or can be stopped on a single color.</li>
            <li> I was very particular about cleaning after every use, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> We use it several times a day when we are home and it fills a large room with the diffused oils.</li>
            <li> The second one I bought is more expensive than the first one I bought and doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> and I have plugged it into multiple power outlets, made sure it was tightly plugged in, and nothing works.</li>
            <li> It puts out as much vapor as my big MIU 500ml diffuser that I bought for our large open floorplan living area.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine!!</li>
            <li> Maintenance is minimal but after only one month of use the On button and Light button didn&#x27;t work one evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for nearly 3wks now</li>
            <li> It works well so far.</li>
            <li> I wish  I can do something to clear the old oil smell.</li>
            <li> I have this is my young sons room.</li>
            <li> This one, the II version, is incredibly loud.</li>
            <li> As far as performance, it works</li>
            <li> Mine does not work, completely pissed</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say as loud as a humidifier or anything, but it does make a bit of a noise.</li>
            <li> So far, I have bought 6</li>
            <li> but as I am very dissatisfied with the customer service at Amazon , In the future,  I will search elsewhere for what I need.</li>
            <li> The second one I bought at Whole foods</li>
            <li> and it is so loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much nicer to use and get the benefits of healing essential oils that you can mix and customize, in an air freshener type product.</li>
            <li> I will be buying at least one more for my house.</li>
            <li> Even though the price is low, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Bought two so far.  </li>
            <li> The power button is sensitive though</li>
            <li> I absolutely believe the Spa Vapor and essential oils contributed to my husband recovery.</li>
            <li> Bought this one after seeing in action at sister&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this diffuser to my Young Living team all the time.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than imagined, also does not put off much vapor like my youngliving diffusers.  </li>
            <li> So far, it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping my old review up as an FYI.  </li>
            <li> follows is my old</li>
            <li> Use a smaller amount to see how much it mists out.</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money or time on this over priced-non working product.</li>
            <li> So really that only leaves one side that can face the faucet.</li>
            <li> I got busy with a move and never called the company.</li>
            <li> I decided to get a second one after my sister mentioned they were changed a bit and that customer service was really helpful if I had a problem again.</li>
            <li> however, i contacted the manufacturer directly via email.</li>
            <li> (the lights were flashing and there was some water near it)...</li>
            <li> So far it works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working without any issues.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also an on-off setting for the light, but there&#x27;s no control over which color you get; it just switches through each color, a few seconds at a time.</li>
            <li> Its a bit larger than I expected, maybe about 10&amp;#34; high but its a nice little unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, produces a strong mist and never lets me down.  </li>
            <li> It shuts off when empty and the lights are nice especially when dark.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I returned it and have found a new one I like even better!</li>
            <li> I had an issue with a different model and they sent me a new one, no questions asked!</li>
            <li> They do not require a lot of maintenance, but clean every few uses.  </li>
            <li> I learned about this particular diffuser while in a middle school classroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these exact same ones now and its the same thing with both of them.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one the first one lasted a year, the second one has a noisy motor</li>
            <li> we found 5-6 drops (the amount recommended on instructions) to be a little strong if you are actually sitting in the room where the diffuser is.</li>
            <li> A few days short of 2 years, with consistent usage, and this little guy is still going strong!  </li>
            <li> I changed oils and took very good care of it. :(</li>
            <li> It is a very powerful little diffuser !</li>
            <li> Normally, I will send someone something that I personally like</li>
            <li> Be aware that this does make a little noise (think the volume level of the fan in your computer), plus there&#x27;s a little water splashing sound</li>
            <li> When the diffuser still wasn&#x27;t working properly, customer service promptly sent out a new part.  </li>
            <li> Because it was supposed to be new and improved I ordered this product rather than the cheaper one by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> it shows the model with only two buttons, but the new model has 3 buttons plus indicator lights as to what setting you have it on (I&#x27;ve added a picture of the one I got, for reference/comparison).</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one.</li>
            <li> This is the second one and having two of these things going at the same time fills my whole house with grate smelling aromas.</li>
            <li> Wish it ran for at least 8 hours, or I was able to slow it down to last longer, but very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought it after a lot of consideration of other diffusers out there, and it was the first one I ever bought.</li>
            <li> The fill line inside melted off during the first use (the water is not hot).  </li>
            <li> The two major problems I have with this product are: 1)  </li>
            <li> I clean it about once a week with a Q-tip on the small plate</li>
            <li> Prior to buying this little beauty, I was using a plug in room diffuser (the little ball type) which was fine for a first introduction to EOs</li>
            <li> The only issue I have, and it&#x27;s not related to the machine itself, is that after a few hours the EO&#x27;s aren&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> The only down side is you have to clean it really regularly</li>
            <li> It is significantly less than many other diffusers on the market and has withstood the test of time and countless days and nights of diffusing.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for general use.</li>
            <li> Customer service gave me the run-around and was generally unhelpful.</li>
            <li> Very dependable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> So far, I have had this diffuser for 6 months and its still running strong...even being used daily!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fill it with doTERRA&#x27;s On Guard or Young Living&#x27;s Thieves and diffuse next to you or your children at night to kill any germs in their bedroom or their body.</li>
            <li> I use many different blends of essential oils in my diffuser and it has been running in the room with my small pet birds the entire time and they have not been bothered whatsoever.</li>
            <li> they sent me old model ,it doesnt working with water and picture is different than i got,i give them 0.00 star</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near 4 hours.</li>
            <li> although i was disappointed my diffuser broke, i was very surprised and pleased that the company sent a replacement completely complimentary.</li>
            <li> After returning my first unit, I thought I would try again, seeing if I just got the odd bum one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;update: (five stars)&lt;br /&gt;After contacting Greenair I spoke with one of the most friendly customer service agents I have ever spoken to.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to put off as much steam and vapor as other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> Compared to some other diffusers, this one really dispurses the vapor/oils</li>
            <li> I love this little machine and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I Love my Greenair Spa Vapor 2 and have used it once everyday since I purchased a little over two months ago.  </li>
            <li> Quiet - soft white noise</li>
            <li> then I will go on every Social media and share this review..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but for now it is working fine.  </li>
            <li> I do clean it as recommended, we have hard water; I just use a different brush.  </li>
            <li> but they should really get that spark thing under control, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where people had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Apparently they&#x27;ll be mailing me a replacement (3 months later).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this diffuser and any other product Greenair makes.</li>
            <li> It is not at all an expensive design, plasticy really, but it immediately produces sweet smell smelling steam, filling the air with the fragrance of one&#x27;s choosing.</li>
            <li> Not a  long lasting diffuser</li>
            <li> There was not too much or too little water.</li>
            <li> The company told me they are the same thing, so I could have gotten the other model (not the new and improved plus one) for a lower price.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly like red or green.</li>
            <li> But I will soon have 3 of these, and 2 of the other, and then my life will be complete.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t release steam on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> first of all for being listed Prime it&#x27; took several days because they were slow about shipping..</li>
            <li> Not made for large rooms, but works well in a small bedroom.</li>
            <li> The top does feel a little cheap, and it is slightly annoying that it comes in 3 parts, but the diffuser runs</li>
            <li> Granted, it doesn&#x27;t hold that much water, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would run all night</li>
            <li> I ran the machine on continuous to see how long it would last.</li>
            <li> ...take care of it and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend running that long repeatedly on a daily basis because it is a machine that will wear, but when needed it does the trick.  </li>
            <li> It starts off slow at first and then picks up.</li>
            <li> My response from Vicky Morris at New Green Air was...</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think the water last very long -</li>
            <li> As long as you fill where you&#x27;re supposed to it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> But if you do not clean the unit regularly, as I didn&#x27;t, it will break down fast and your low-cost investment will have gone up in an aromatherapy mist.</li>
            <li> Also, this item was supposed to be a newer model and was more expensive than the other one.  </li>
            <li> Much better than other expensive ones in my home.</li>
            <li> I try and clean it out at least every few days</li>
            <li> /&gt;These little guys give out just as much, if not more vapor that the more expensive models I have used.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the LED light button did not work so the lights were on no matter</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> And if you fill the water to the fill line it takes a long time to start producing vapor.&lt;br /&gt;However it lasts for quite some time which is nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh a couple things I SHOULD mention, its not loud</li>
            <li> I hope it works for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a wide range of Essential Oils and has no problems.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> It runs a long time and has the auto shutoff.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t run for long.</li>
            <li> I can use this blend while we are outside or away from the house and it shuts itself off when empty.</li>
            <li> lots of other essential oils.  </li>
            <li> i purchased two and after only a few times using and only having it for about a month.</li>
            <li> 2016:  revised down because this didn&#x27;t last that long...</li>
            <li> , its an older model despite being labeled as new, and the mist is very poor.</li>
            <li> turned it on and after a few minutes you have a TEEEEEEEEENIE TINEY bit of vapor tht you can barely notice..  </li>
            <li> The fan sounds very loud and hardly any vapor is coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time tho!  </li>
            <li> I used it in the bedroom, not a very large room.</li>
            <li> This one seems different than the previous 5 of these I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the previous version of this diffuser several times a week for almost a year, and I have to say</li>
            <li> It was $2.00 less than the same one at Amazon</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for less than three months and it is breaking.  </li>
            <li> She has used it daily for the past several months and loves it!</li>
            <li> I had purchased the previous version of this product and it did not emit enough vapor.  </li>
            <li> These work super well, turn themselves off, and are in expensive.</li>
            <li> I just add a few drops of essential oil and run it all night long!</li>
            <li> I have a diffuser from DoTerra and it works better, but i wanted something that was a little less expensive for another room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every single night since I got it - and it works like a dream!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of annoying every single time.</li>
            <li> , I DO agree with some other reviewers, you have to be really careful when cleaning and filling the water tank that you don&#x27;t get water down in the little opening in the side, near the buttons or power jack.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this little guy, just wait until you can get it at a cheaper price than $40.</li>
            <li> would like it to last little longer</li>
            <li> have friends in the essential oil community that swear by these little dudes.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the smaller size, but this little guy is a workhorse.</li>
            <li> Compared to Young Living&#x27;s Diffuser, this product hardly produces any vapor.</li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is that it heats the water a little and if you run it for back to back cycles it heats the water</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s when empty...</li>
            <li> One thing to mention is that you need to be careful when plugging it in.  </li>
            <li> The water/EO mix would subsequently sit in the unit between uses, because EO&#x27;s are costly and I didn&#x27;t want to waste the water/EO mix.</li>
            <li> One of the features that I like about it is that it shuts off automatically when it is empty.</li>
            <li> On the third day, it was dead.</li>
            <li> it worked a few times &amp; then simply stopped,</li>
            <li> I also like the auto-shutoff when the receptacle is empty.</li>
            <li> Lasts for several hours and have the option of colors or no light.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it blinks the lights a few times before it shuts off.</li>
            <li> No real opinion on the color changing.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Like that it is an option for no light, big plus for the bedroom!</li>
            <li> like product it&#x27;s cheaper made than i expected</li>
            <li> I like that the unit shuts off once it is empty.</li>
            <li> It just rotates between a few different colors</li>
            <li> I was being careful but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I never really used the lights, I preferred to leave them off, so I just went with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week with essential oil.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few Essential oil diffusers.  </li>
            <li> use was sometimes daily but sometimes not for a few days  </li>
            <li> Of the 4 I have purchased, they each vary on how long they will go until they are empty, but average 8 hours.</li>
            <li> The only annoying thing was the top, it&#x27;s 3 pieces.</li>
            <li> This is too bad and I am very surprised that it has such a high rating.</li>
            <li> Overall - I think these diffusers have some serious functionality and potential safety issues and I cannot recommend them.</li>
            <li> I keep one in my bedroom and move the other one wherever I need it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And now my last one is turning off and on every 1 minute :/  </li>
            <li> but the steam is not hot.</li>
            <li> I would have given them 5 starts, but one of the ones I bought and a couple of the ones I&#x27;ve bought for other people didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> But, I decided to keep it and use some other blends of oils to diffuse that did not contain citrus.</li>
            <li> I use it in both small and larger spaces.</li>
            <li> If you get water in there it can cause corosion and other issues.  </li>
            <li> The other one doesn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any leaking problems with it like some other reviews</li>
            <li> I was going to try and replace it, but after reading all of the other reviews I decided I&#x27;m going to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I use the other for them.  </li>
            <li> and if you added the water to the limit line and already added oils only to find it wasn&#x27;t working, well then you were in a dilemma so as not to waste your oils!  </li>
            <li> It will run for approximately 4 hours on constant flow and I will put it on intermittent flow at night in my daughter&#x27;s room and it will last close to 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product as I had read good things about it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not right.</li>
            <li> After using is as needed over the 4 months, with proper cleaning, it hardly blows out any mist.</li>
            <li> Not worth your time or money</li>
            <li> They work well for small to medium areas, but not strong enough for largre rooms.</li>
            <li> My SpaVapor broke down after perhaps 25 uses.   </li>
            <li> + hours before shutting down.  </li>
            <li> The down falls</li>
            <li> It was a little louder than my other ultrasonic, but it got the job done.</li>
            <li> Only way to have it last more than 3 hours is to use the intermittent feature, but unfortunately it is quite annoying hearing the fan rev up and down every 3 seconds.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the mist was getting less.  </li>
            <li> Half the time I couldn&#x27;t get the unit to turn on and start misting.</li>
            <li> After less than 1 week of use the diffuser does not work anymore.  </li>
            <li> The buttons don&#x27;t work half the time.</li>
            <li> a year and a half?  </li>
            <li> The fan runs but no mist comes out, the motor is dead(except to the fan, which is odd to me).&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> Also, there is a minor issue - no light on the power switch, so it is hard to know whether the unit is on or off.</li>
            <li> broke a little over a month of having it.</li>
            <li> I had a little difficulty after a couple of weeks with this diffuser working.  </li>
            <li> Now that manufacturing kinks have been worked out,  this little unit is reliable and affordable.  </li>
            <li> so I poured a little bit out</li>
            <li> , it made a little difference.</li>
            <li> So I cleaned again as the directions said and it did start up for a little while but turned off again.</li>
            <li> Beats all those commercial, expensive, single scent products.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use oil diffusers everyday- a few times a day.</li>
            <li> We can get it off and on if we hit it a few times.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in my office</li>
            <li> Hoping it will work longer then the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> Also instructions should include to hold button for a few seconds in order for infusers to turn on.</li>
            <li> Received on time and use everyday</li>
            <li> Only the green ones light up and they flash like a disco ball which is horrible.  </li>
            <li> , I like the oil reservoir, I like that there is no light on the power button</li>
            <li> Clearly missing Quality Control somewhere-</li>
            <li> Been using it everyday for 2 weeks and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> Wasted a lot of money on garbage.</li>
            <li> We have only had this diffuser in use for approximately 1 week.</li>
            <li> I expected to at least have smell in the air</li>
            <li> Use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I knew I wanted a few of them (we have a 3 story house)</li>
            <li> I received my green air diffuser about two weeks ago, I must say my family loves it.</li>
            <li> there is no light .. if you have the Lights On..</li>
            <li> I wish it would run a little longer but just because I&#x27;m maybe a bit lazy about having to refill it.</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service and within ten days I had a new base.</li>
            <li> I guess I wasted $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon and seller :/</li>
            <li> Without question Greeair took my information and sent out a new base (just the base, not the top part or the plus, which was not defective).</li>
            <li> my other diffusers burn out after 3 months!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry, it should last longer than that.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with any of the them.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s working as it should,</li>
            <li> so it is a small piece.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is cause water is getting where it shouldn&#x27;t be..</li>
            <li> Made for a small room or area</li>
            <li> It puts out a lot of scent with just a small amount (6-7 drops) of oil.</li>
            <li> This one lasted a few months until my dog knocked it off the table (BUMMER!)</li>
            <li> I am a healer and over the past month I have used it all day and night and never had any problem.</li>
            <li> Works well for small rooms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why....</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s way too much trouble for me!  </li>
            <li> Sad they take your money for a very short used time.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the 2nd one has stopped working after just 2 days!</li>
            <li> Now I am past the return window and fear I have lost my money.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;t teacher diffused On Guard in her classroom this year and her class was barely sick, especially compared to the other 2 5th grade classes.</li>
            <li> I do not have hard water issues and I cleaned it as instructed.</li>
            <li> It is not putting out hardly any must or smell</li>
            <li> Had a hard time falling asleep because of the noise.</li>
            <li> At least I can still smell it a little bit!!</li>
            <li> Says it works for at least 3 hours, pray it works one hour.</li>
            <li> It took me MONTHS to bite the bullet and just buy a diffuser because of the negative reviews on here..</li>
            <li> I also have a Canon printer that quit about six months out of warranty with a problem that seems quite common to that model printer.</li>
            <li> That is common for developing prototypes, but not for a production item.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> have owned several diffusers and this is by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> and I am a fanatic about cleaning it immediately after it finishes.</li>
            <li> and If AMAZON does NOT POST THIS because it is Negative</li>
            <li> There are three parts which just set inside each other, so its impossible to take it off with one hand and refill with the other.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> and I have it in a very small bathroom.</li>
            <li> However the one in my room is REALLY loud :(</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and even though there were negative ones, they seemed to be related to a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Are you serious?</li>
            <li> Either the bad batch is still being shipped or they have a second one.</li>
            <li> Not a good item.</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed in this item, I have had this brand before-several in fact, this one barely puts out any vapor at all.</li>
            <li> I received it broken to begin with</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s broken again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really poor quality.</li>
            <li> I keep this one on my nightstand, so I end up fumbling with all the pieces when I&#x27;m tired, trying to get in the bed.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it sparked dangerous sparks when pluging it in, and it leaked puddles of water at the base when left on the counter.</li>
            <li> very disappointed I want my money back.</li>
            <li> very disappointed since only worked for one time.  </li>
            <li> This was caused by a slow leak on a bad seal.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because of some of the reviews</li>
            <li> At three months, it failed to power on.</li>
            <li> anyway I will update my review if the unit fails me.</li>
            <li> EVER going wrong, it is about what they do when something does go wrong.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately purchased two of these.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not happy with the length of time it runs, you might want to test that theory!</li>
            <li> I was sad to find out that my diffuser has stopped working just after 6 months.</li>
            <li> nothign complicated here.  </li>
            <li> The buttons are almost like fake buttons..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sad..</li>
            <li> However, I found it extremely difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing &amp;  a waste of money....wish it could be returned!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently this company has very poor QA/</li>
            <li> so i can signal to my brain/body that it is bedtime, as circadian rhythms can be affected artificially.</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> but it started to smell bad a month after using it.</li>
            <li> Of these two, one leaked really bad.  </li>
            <li> I was contacted by greenair&#x27;s customer service and was informed that there had been a bad batch from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> really shocked that this was the #1 seller for diffusers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Borrowed one from a friend when my daughter was sick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> SO WEIRD!!</li>
            <li> , I guess it&#x27;s a crap shoot...</li>
            <li> I rated it three stars because I hate the smells that come out of this thing.</li>
            <li> This is a worthless item</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as I feel I just thru $40 away..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will get a nasty spark.  </li>
            <li> horrible</li>
            <li> PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!</li>
            <li> My son loves to see the mist billow, but it is terrible for furniture.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line on this product is that it is crap!!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst diffuser &amp; the cheapest that I have (&amp; I have 5)....</li>
            <li> This is a terrible diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrated!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that you can not diffuse citrus oils!!!!</li>
            <li> I am SO disgusted..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these...when they work.</li>
            <li> Works really good but wished it would last a full 7 hours</li>
            <li> I love it. Works excellent.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Very good value for the price! The unit works well &amp; I appreciate the automatic shutoff.</li>
            <li> This one seems different than the previous 5 of these I have purchased.  I still like it, but it&#x27;s a bit louder.  and when I hit the power button it goes in to an interval mode it seems like.  Granted,I didn&#x27;t read the instruction booklet, maybe that is a feature.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. This is the third one I purchase. It works great!</li>
            <li> great diffuser at a great price. I found I only need 1-2 drops of oil (doTerra) and it runs for quite a while. noiseless shut-off which is great for nighttime.</li>
            <li> I was daring and bought two of these. I was a bit skeptical because of some of the reviews but I have to admit that I&#x27;m quite satisfied. I&#x27;ve had them for nearly 3wks now and I use them everyday, they work perfectly. They&#x27;re super quiet and I love that the light is optional. I keep one in my bedroom and move the other one wherever I need it. The only thing I can complain about is the cheap looking plastic its made from considering the price. It looks like it would break with one slip of the hand but overall, I&#x27;m satisfied. My signature scent is patchouli and sweet orange.</li>
            <li> After lst day won&#x27;t spray out.  Tried cleaning it.  refilling it etc.  still no steam</li>
            <li> it stop working after 3rd use...</li>
            <li> I ordered this item a month ago.. Does not work. Everytime I call, goes straight to voicemail, and no one has returned my call. Says it works for at least 3 hours, pray it works one hour. Not a good item.</li>
            <li> It works well so far. I have used it a couple of time. As of 1/5/16 it does not work, the light work but the misting does not work.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying my diffuser.  Wish it ran for at least 8 hours, or I was able to slow it down to last longer, but very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my wife &amp; she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> It was good at the beginning but it started to smell bad a month after using it. I wish  I can do something to clear the old oil smell.</li>
            <li> Had for 1 wk. Worked great at first but now, after cleaning, put fresh water and oils in, will turn on for 3 seconds and then shuts off. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; service</li>
            <li> Easy to use and operate just the right size.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one, used it three times. It shut off and started smoking from the bottom! Seems very unsafe to me, waiting on seller and Amazon to address the problem.</li>
            <li> Very nice diffuser.  Quiet, works well.  Love the light show.  Very calming</li>
            <li> Works fine for small areas or right on the nightstand for a lavender infused sleep. Runs for four hours and shuts off automatically. Maintenance is minimal but after only one month of use the On button and Light button didn&#x27;t work one evening. The next morning after dumping out the unused water/essential oil, washing with soap and water, it worked again. Overall, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use oil diffusers everyday- a few times a day. They just keep running in my house and it smells like a spa in here. I tried a few different essential oil diffusers and this was the first one I liked. It produces a nice cool mist and runs for about 4 hours. It is easy to clean. I make sure to clean it out after every use and air it out. I don&#x27;t let water sit in it. It has been running great! I like give these as gifts to my friends who love the way my house smells. I always use eucalyptus and lavender oils and I add rosemary and/or orange to my concoction depending on my mood. In the winter months I add clove and cinnamon and my house smells like Christmas :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a newer version of this with a larger water tank that lasts longer and has only one lid (fewer parts to clean or lose). I like that one as well. Look at my review and you will see which one it is.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for diffusing essential oils and turns off on it&#x27;s when empty...exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser. It works well and as said in the description. I like that it is quiet and you have the option to turn off the light. It was too bright for my son while he was sleeping so it was nice to be able to turn the light off. My only comment to make would be that I wish it would come in a size that would last longer than 4 hours.</li>
            <li> The diffuser works well. I like that you can still use the diffuser without having the light on.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to try this one. I am using it to diffuse essential oils and was iffy based in reviews that I had read, but this diffser is awesome. I read reviews saying that you cannot keep the light on one color.....you can. Press once to turn on lights and a swcind time to stop on the color. I ran the machine on continuous to see how long it would last. It ran for about 6 hours and shut off. But...my favorite part...there is an interval option (30 sec I think), which means I can easily run it all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++ from me on this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have this is my young sons room. It is quiet and the colors are so awesome!! So thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not like the others</li>
            <li> I have two of these in the earlier model and they work great. This one, the II version, is incredibly loud. It sounds like a jet ready to take off. They won&#x27;t let me return it either. I&#x27;ve missed their &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; by 3 days! This thing is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Best of used in small area such as a bedroom. I use one in my office and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Very simple diffuser.  Easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to put off as much steam and vapor as other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen.  However, for the price, this is a great deal.  We use it several times a day when we are home and it fills a large room with the diffused oils.</li>
            <li> We have only been using this about a week but so far it works great. We make sure to leave it open to air dry after each use. Also - it could just be the particular oils we are using- we found 5-6 drops (the amount recommended on instructions) to be a little strong if you are actually sitting in the room where the diffuser is. 2-3 drops works fine. So far so good!    Update - Diffuser still works great even after dropping it several times.  The button broke off on the front but still works when you stick your finger in there.  One thing to mention is that you need to be careful when plugging it in.  You MUST plug it into the wall last.  DO NOT plug it into the wall and then put the adapter into the diffuser.  You will get a nasty spark.  Contacted the company and their solution was to plug it into the wall last.      For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Easy to use / clean. Definitely  disperses  oil well.</li>
            <li> I love it and its easy to clean and operate</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my DoTerra essential oils.  I have a diffuser from DoTerra and it works better, but i wanted something that was a little less expensive for another room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it works as well as my doterra one.  The steam isn&#x27;t as potent and you have to get warmer water for it to work well.  My daughter likes the light on it, but I think it looks a bit cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it does ok.  But it might be worth spending a bit more to get something that works better.</li>
            <li> I never had the chance to use it because the directions specifically say not to use with citrus essential oils.  It seems to be a good quality product.  I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected. And if you fill the water to the fill line it takes a long time to start producing vapor.&lt;br /&gt;However it lasts for quite some time which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;The light is on off only and when on goes through a verity of colors. Which my kids like. I do not. If it could stay on on one color, i would like it more.&lt;br /&gt;Im considering getting a second for my kids bedroom.</li>
            <li> Sparks when I plug it in.</li>
            <li> Works just as good if not better than my very pricy youngliving diffuser. Love that it takes tap water</li>
            <li> I like the capacity to hold more water, and the color on/off function is nice. But, I would prefer if it had an intermittent spray function.</li>
            <li> Love my vapor spa! I sleep so much better with it running! I just add a few drops of essential oil and run it all night long! My 2 boys love watching the colors change when it&#x27;s on!</li>
            <li> Well constructed and the lights make it a kid favorite!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of $. I have a Doterra diffuser also. I think this is a great deal for the $.</li>
            <li> Love the new improved spa vapor!&lt;br /&gt;Bought them for friends Christmas presents</li>
            <li> I just got my defuser and the motor is making noise I have cleaned it out like I am supposed to but the motor is taking a sh** don&#x27;t pay money for this cuz It will just brake a couple weeks after you get it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product I received does not match the photo of the item being sold. Seems this is a problem for others as well. The one I received looks like the original Spa Vapor. As far as performance, it works okay but runs out of water pretty quickly. I will be returning it since it seems like an even cheaper knockoff of the original. Nothing new and improved here.</li>
            <li> This worked great! It put out a decent flow but after a month it stopped working.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  It has really done wonders in helping me sleep better at night and not have my asthmatic allergies acting up.</li>
            <li> Have to say, I am really pleased with this purchase.  It is not at all an expensive design, plasticy really, but it immediately produces sweet smell smelling steam, filling the air with the fragrance of one&#x27;s choosing. I like the light display too, and great price</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Love the mist and so easy to use and clean with no wicks to worry about.</li>
            <li> I bought two, I guess it&#x27;s a crap shoot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One broke a little over a month of having it. That&#x27;s not right. Sorry, it should last longer than that. And it broke literally a week after I could return it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now my last one is turning off and on every 1 minute :/  I hope it&#x27;s not going out on me too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed, because I was so happy to get this from all the great reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware...</li>
            <li> Great product if your clean it regularly. Had an issue with one and the customer service was top notch and sent me a new one. Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> This thing works great! I have had this for 3 months and use it every day for several hours a day. Way better than the high priced ones I have used and/or seen. Produces LOTS of vapor. I clean it about once a week with a Q-tip on the small plate that&#x27;s inside the tank. If you don&#x27;t clean it, your vapor amount is reduced. I have also found that using warm tap water works best. I have bought 2 of these and will buy again if I ever need another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on April 2nd and it no longer will mist at all.</li>
            <li> Works great very satisfied</li>
            <li> Horrible...barely misted at all. Sent it back</li>
            <li> amazing!  I want to buy one for every room in my house!</li>
            <li> Works good. Vapor starts the second the on button is pushed. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> A great product so far. I like the quietness and the changing lights.  It difuses just enough vapor and doesn&#x27; t leave any dampness on the table I put it on. Lightweight, easy to clean and fill.  It  arrived in time, wrapped very well and intact.  I truly am enjoying my diffuser.</li>
            <li> She advises me that she is very happy with this product.  It was purchased for someone else and she has used it several times.</li>
            <li> This a very good diffuser. Runs until water is gone but I&#x27;m not sure how many hours because I&#x27;ve only run it at night. It&#x27;s easy to fill and easy to clean. Recommend this over the higher priced diffusers.</li>
            <li> I order two of these for my daughters for Christmas gifts, neither of them work.  Additionally, I received one for a gift during the holidays and it leaks.  Not satisfied with any of the them.</li>
            <li> This makes my whole working area smell spa like.  Thanks to my friend for recommending this to me</li>
            <li> Received my diffuser quickly and it works great! I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works Great!!! lasts for hours like advertised, Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser fills up out great room, dining room, and kitchen. Very efficient.</li>
            <li> This product was order by my wife. It works great, light changes color blows out stems but the steam is not hot. It is a well built product that seems like it will hold up over time. I rated it three stars because I hate the smells that come out of this thing. It smells like a flower is having  diarrhea inside and it is being blown through the room. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Motor died within a month of having the diffuser. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The on off button sticks - have to be gentle in pushing it.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot fill to full line - it will not steam:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not horrible but I would spend more on a better diffuser.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my spa vapor! The color changes are so pretty and relaxing, I get compliments on it all the time from my guests. Simple to use and keep clean, it makes any room I put it in smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for the price. However, I do not like how the top comes apart. There are three parts which just set inside each other, so its impossible to take it off with one hand and refill with the other. It&#x27;s more of a task. I prefer a design that only has one piece to take off the top.</li>
            <li> Works well, lights are beautiful and it has a generous mist output. Would be better if it had a timer.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Price is right. I use with high quality oils and distilled water with no problem. I originally got one from a friend and ended up buying another one. She has tried the diffuser that comes with the oils and this one worked better and it is a quarter of the cost.</li>
            <li> Worked great until my dog tripped over the wire and broke it.  Last pretty long and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Compared to Young Living&#x27;s Diffuser, this product hardly produces any vapor.</li>
            <li> PIECE OF CRAP!!!!! Only worked 6 times, and then quit!!! I threw it in the trash!!</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser!  Does the job without the high price tag.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s working as it should, but it&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li> What a great diffuser!  The Greenair Spa Vapor Diffuser was the first essential oil diffuser that our family purchased.  It is significantly less than many other diffusers on the market and has withstood the test of time and countless days and nights of diffusing.  After traveling with it on vacation, this diffuser temporarily stopped working.  Customer Service advised us how to clean it.  When the diffuser still wasn&#x27;t working properly, customer service promptly sent out a new part.  Upon returning home from vacation, this original diffuser was working like new!  We notified customer service and they kindly allowed us to keep the new parts as well.  We would recommend the Greenair Spa Vapor or Spa Vapor Plus Diffuser to family and friends.  Any additional diffusers for our family will be from Greenair!  Thanks for a great product at a competitive price and incredible customer service!</li>
            <li> We have 2 of these ourselves and have bought them for several of our friends and families...they are great...every house should have one...I would have given them 5 starts, but one of the ones I bought and a couple of the ones I&#x27;ve bought for other people didn&#x27;t work.  but the good news is the company send out a replacement and all was well</li>
            <li> I ordered three. One came without the adapter.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine and use it everyday. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several nights and it&#x27;s great! I use organic peppermint oil with it. My husband didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference but on the second day he woke up feeling great! I highly recommend. If you follow directions it&#x27;ll do you wonders.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;off/on&amp;#34; button stuck w/in a week.  We can get it off and on if we hit it a few times.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of distributing the aroma and a constant stream of mist, however, I do live in a small apartment and am not asking much of it.  I have had it two weeks and it is still functioning well.  It has a slight hum to it that could be good for people who enjoy some white noise, but mostly easily ignorable, as I am very sensitive to sound as long as it is not on top of me I do not really hear it.</li>
            <li> Just opened this product and it doesnt work!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for my doTERRA essential oils!! Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Works great, as described</li>
            <li> I have been using the previous version of this diffuser several times a week for almost a year, and I have to say, I really love it. It is easy to use, reliable, and not too attention-getting. I love it so much, I gave this newer version as a gift, and the recipient has loved it, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One difference I noticed between this improved version and the one I&#x27;m using is the water line inside the diffuser. I have to feel around inside the diffuser to find the &amp;#34;fill to&amp;#34; water line, but the new version has a visible ridge all the way around the diffuser to show how far to fill it with water. Much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be buying another of these soon...one of my kids has put my diffuser in their room and won&#x27;t give it up!</li>
            <li> I bought the Greenair Spa Vapor  Oil Diffuser to use with essential oils. I had seen my sister&#x27;s and thought how neat to have one for my house so I ordered one! I did as the directions  said with lukewarm wate, added my oils, and turned it on. Waited the allotted time for the mist to begin and it never did. I&#x27;m  so upset and I understand that sometimes machines may malfunction. Please  another machine so that I may begin enjoy using it! I did the troubleshooting and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Get the 2.0.... it&#x27;s way better</li>
            <li> Worked great for a whole month! I&#x27;m so upset! Can&#x27;t even return it it says. Would never buy this again. I cleaned it everytime I changed oils and took very good care of it. :(</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed in this item, I have had this brand before-several in fact, this one barely puts out any vapor at all. Will not be ordering another one!!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  I use it everyday in my office</li>
            <li> I have purchased two Greenair  spa Vapor&#x27;s.  The first one is still working fantastic. The second one not so good, I am in the process of returning it due to it not turning on. This is the second time for the  same problem on two different machines. Amazon has been fafantastic about their return policy.  I just wish  this product was better quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every single night since I got it - and it works like a dream! I use it as instructed - with warm/room temp water, 4-5 drops of essential oils and I don&#x27;t turn the light on (thanks for making that easy to do!). It&#x27;s a great little machine, it&#x27;s relatively quiet (sounds like a low hum) and it puts out a good mist that fills the room with the oil scent.</li>
            <li> Great price, nice amount of vapor, definitely lasts for 5 hours when full.</li>
            <li> I use this diffuser in my classroom to diffuse essential oils to improve student focus and mood. I love it and intend to buy one of my own. I enjoy that you can easily direct the mist in whatever direction works best and the lighting provides further calming effect, especially when the room is dim. I also found the diffuser very easy to refill--so easy that I can trust my eighth graders to do it with little direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product--highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product. Received in a timely manner. Works exactly as described. Love the soothing colors produced. Great price for the quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> Powerful Diffuser.  This is really spa quality.  I use it every day and just purchased another for a friend who saw mine and had to have it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light. The only thing I did not like about this was the part on the top comes off so it is a small piece. With small children in the home I didn&#x27;t like that, but I loved the diffuser - great for the price! I gave it to my MIL and she enjoys it.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, as described!</li>
            <li> Does not always work correctly</li>
            <li> I have had this diffuser for about a week now and it works great.  Disperses my oils perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have two of these - one at home and one at the office.  I love the auto-shut off and it&#x27;s quiet.  I only wish it were larger.</li>
            <li> This is smaller than I thought it would be but it works good for my boys room. They use it at night. You have to clean it after every use for proper maintenance. It is a good starter diffuser, if you want to try one out without investing too much. It came in very good condition, packaged neatly and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Diffuser arrived and we were excited to try it. Unfortunately it sparked dangerous sparks when pluging it in, and it leaked puddles of water at the base when left on the counter. Requesting a return now.</li>
            <li> I had a little difficulty after a couple of weeks with this diffuser working.  I called customer support, who called me back within 24 hours.  After explaining my problem, I realized that it was my fault for overfilling it.  The person I spoke with was very helpful.  I was very satisfied with their assistance.  Now my diffuser is working perfectly, and I purchased a second one for a gift.</li>
            <li> Mine does not work, completely pissed</li>
            <li> i purchased two and after only a few times using and only having it for about a month., they no longer turn on. for some reason i can not return them. very disappointed I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Love the ambience it gives with the various colors and of course the diffuser works amazing . My favorite is using lavender with it at night to help soothe and relax me. It is a very powerful little diffuser !</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these units (one for my office and one for home). I was so excited when they arrived, only to find out that neither one of them will even turn on - neither lights or the mister work on either unit....so I will be sending them back and looking for a better made diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 7 or 8 times since purchasing and it quit performing.  Was so dissappointed because I seem to be pass the 30 day return time period.  I was very particular about cleaning after every use, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Exactly what wanted great product</li>
            <li> I already have one these and was excited about getting another one. Took it out of the box and started diffusing right away. A couple of minutes later, there was water everywhere. Had to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and the seller. Got a unit that wasn&#x27;t quite perfect, and they worked with me to ensure I received a working unit. Great service, great product</li>
            <li> This diffuser seems to be hit or miss.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months and it works great!!  i clean it out after use and have never had a problem.  The only complaint i have is that it heats the water a little and if you run it for back to back cycles it heats the water A LOT.  I definitely recommend this little guy, just wait until you can get it at a cheaper price than $40.</li>
            <li> Simple design, easy to use and clean. Not made for large rooms, but works well in a small bedroom. Appreciate that you can use this without the led lights.</li>
            <li> These vapor oil dispersion units are great.  Easy to use and easy to clean without worrying about any kind of mold developing, etc.</li>
            <li> love it and I sleep much better with the oils I add to the diffuser</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these and we love them.  They produce a good amount of vapor - we add essential oils to them.  I&#x27;m so happy with them that I placed another order for one more a couple of days ago.</li>
            <li> Works great, looks cool, a bit loud but who cares--consider it white noise for relaxation :)</li>
            <li> I own 5 of these, they are the best!</li>
            <li> Will never be without this diffuser... New updated version is top notch. Purchased 3 ...</li>
            <li> The Greenair Spa Vapor is probably one of the best diffusers for someone starting out with aromatherapy. I bought it after a lot of consideration of other diffusers out there, and it was the first one I ever bought. As I started getting into aromatherapy, I decided to put my money on good quality oils rather than a really nice diffuser for now, and I&#x27;m glad I made that decision, since it takes a while to build up some good working knowledge of essential oil blending and uses. It will be nice to purchase a higher end diffuser when I&#x27;ve built up that knowledge.   I will say this about the Greenair SpaVapor. It is great when functioning correctly. But if you do not clean the unit regularly, as I didn&#x27;t, it will break down fast and your low-cost investment will have gone up in an aromatherapy mist. My SpaVapor broke down after perhaps 25 uses.   The instructions advise cleaning the unit after every use. The issue I found was that every use actually meant two or three uses, because I more often diffused for short periods of time (30 minutes) rather than long periods of time (4 hours). The water/EO mix would subsequently sit in the unit between uses, because EO&#x27;s are costly and I didn&#x27;t want to waste the water/EO mix. I don&#x27;t know if the mix sitting in the unit contributed to the breakdown.  Again, the SpaVapor is everything you want as a beginner in diffusion. If you take care to clean the unit after each use, you will likely get a decent long life of this diffuser.  I&#x27;m giving only four stars because a diffuser that I would love (as opposed to like) would be one that performed as wonderfully but that didn&#x27;t require as much cleaning.</li>
            <li> Researched many of these and even bought one that costs a lot more (which I also like) but this one is definitely good for the $$. I love the changing colors and it puts out the perfect amount of mist. My house smells good and I love that I am helping my family by using pure oils. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> great, love colored light, easy to use, works well for bedroom</li>
            <li> Not a  long lasting diffuser</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon, but I was so impressed when trying to pick a air atomizer that I had to give a review. It doesn&#x27;t blow out steam but I can smell it across my room. I love it. And it changes colors on its only. Worth it!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is wonderful. It works perfectly.  Very quiet, you can&#x27;t even hear it running. The light changes between colors. I definitely recommend this product.  Great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my DoTerra essential oils and it works great.  It has 2 settings:  constant flow and intermittent flow.  It will run for approximately 4 hours on constant flow and I will put it on intermittent flow at night in my daughter&#x27;s room and it will last close to 8 hours.  The light it great for morning or evening, but it is entirely too bright to use as a nightlight.  I am purchasing 3 more to use throughout the house.  It spread my oils around about a 800 square food area.</li>
            <li> I thought these were the diffusers that ran for 8 hours but they only run 4-5 hours. The colored lights are nice and it does diffuse well though.</li>
            <li> When I first plugged this in it didn&#x27;t appear to work.  I filled the water up to the fill line.  After it was on for several hours it finally seems to work.  I think it is best not to fill it all the way and it works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these diffusers because I loved the first one so much that I got another one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day!  The first one I purchased I keep with me in my office at work.  One of the features that I like about it is that it shuts off automatically when it is empty.</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser a few weeks ago and it worked great.  Now when I turn it on it make a noise and spurts out diffused air while it &amp;#34;warms up??&amp;#34;  then eventually works fine. Hoping it will work longer then the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> I have now bought four of these.  the most important thing is this:  1)  lukewarm water works best.  2) do not use without the inner plastic piece or the lid that directs the mist.  the mist drops and would ruin a wood piece of furniture.  My son loves to see the mist billow, but it is terrible for furniture.  With the pieces it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> The second one I bought is more expensive than the first one I bought and doesn&#x27;t work right. There is a problem with the on and off switches. Not sure if I would buy another one. I do have to say the first one works real well.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.  Just wish it held more water and lasted a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> For a small machine and for such a great price this is a real workhorse.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser.  We love ours and bought another for a gift.</li>
            <li> Product worked very well for three months. At three months, it failed to power on. I called customer service and they are arranging a replacement to be shipped FOC.</li>
            <li> It took me MONTHS to bite the bullet and just buy a diffuser because of the negative reviews on here.. I finally bit the bullet and I am pretty darn happy with it. I use it pretty much all day long and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. Its a bit larger than I expected, maybe about 10&amp;#34; high but its a nice little unit. The button on the right is either on, intermittent, or off; the machine also shuts off when the water is about to run out. The button on the left is either rotating colors (I believe there are 6 colors) one color, or off. It says to not use citrus oils but I have used lemon, lemongrass and sweet orange (shhhh!!!!) dilluted with lavendar, I just make sure to clean it with vinegar and water after (it also comes with a cleaning brush). Anyway, for the price I&#x27;m happy. It comes with a 1 year warranty. Oh a couple things I SHOULD mention, its not loud but it is definitely not silent. I wouldn&#x27;t say as loud as a humidifier or anything, but it does make a bit of a noise. Sometimes when you plug the cable into the unit it sparks a bit. Not sure if that is cause water is getting where it shouldn&#x27;t be.. anyway I will update my review if the unit fails me.</li>
            <li> This is the best little gizmo ever. Im a smoker but when my son came to visit he thought I had quit. This thing really clears the air in a room. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works well for the money. It is very key to make sure you only fill up to the line or it will not work properly. Lights work, provides hours of mist, and has a nice, long cord. Would recommend for general use.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. Multiple settings. Great output. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like it very much i am satisfy</li>
            <li> This diffuser stopped automatically turning off about two months after I got it.  I tried cleaning it and it still does not shut off. It is no longer returnable.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Item is great. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great and I like that it turns off on its own.</li>
            <li> So far, I have bought 6 and I love them. Great design and fair price.</li>
            <li> Works great very fast delivery</li>
            <li> i love love my new diffuser</li>
            <li> Really like it. Just wish it held more water.</li>
            <li> Had difficulty with this product at first, but I got the hang of it and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser for two days, using it as instructed.  On the third day, it was dead. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave one of these to me as a gift. It worked perfectly for about six weeks and then just faded out and quit. I contacted customer service and within ten days I had a new base. Customer service was fantastic. Absolutely no problems getting the issue fixed, all it took was an email. I also have a Canon printer that quit about six months out of warranty with a problem that seems quite common to that model printer. I contacted Canon customer service two weeks ago and still no reply from them. Bottom line is I bought another Greenair diffuser for a different room in my house and and now I own and Epson printer. All products can have a problem but to me, it is all about how that problem is taken care of by the company. I highly recommend this diffuser and any other product Greenair makes. This diffuser works great in a large living area, is fairly quiet and I&#x27;m totally happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 different brands of diffusers and this one is by FAR the best. I learned about this particular diffuser while in a middle school classroom. The teacher was using this and I just loved how much output it had. This is not a wimpy diffuser. Great for larger rooms!</li>
            <li> Compared to some other diffusers, this one really dispurses the vapor/oils well (instead of &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; out of the device, the vapor is pushed). Can&#x27;t comment on its longevity, but we use it three times a day and after a month, no problems.</li>
            <li> Received the items in a timely manner and like the products except the instructions were written by someone who didn&#x27;t know English well. Also instructions should include to hold button for a few seconds in order for infusers to turn on. At first I didn&#x27;t think they worked.</li>
            <li> I have two of these.  One upstairs in the bedroom and one downstairs in the kitchen/dinning area.  I have used them daily/nightly since July 2014, with no problems!!  I love them!!  Great product for the price!!  Helps with my husband&#x27;s allergies tremendously running peppermint and lavender, and lots of other essential oils.  Bought my daughter one last year as a gift.  Buying another daughter this one as a gift.  The only drawback is you cannot run citrus oils in these.</li>
            <li> works wonderful!  Adds moisture to the room, and light is very cool!</li>
            <li> So far, I have had this diffuser for 6 months and its still running strong...even being used daily!!!!! my other diffusers burn out after 3 months!!!</li>
            <li> The aromas fill the room quickly and the unit is very quiet. I just love it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product exactly as described... Will order again</li>
            <li> Very loud for a diffuser</li>
            <li> So glad I waited to find the right diffuser because this one is great and the price was even better. I bought this to diffuse eucalyptus oil in my office while I work and it&#x27;s perfect. I think it will do great in larger rooms as well. Be aware that this does make a little noise (think the volume level of the fan in your computer), plus there&#x27;s a little water splashing sound but I find it all relaxing. It creates mist as soon as you turn it on, and the rotating colored lights are a nice touch. Prior to buying this little beauty, I was using a plug in room diffuser (the little ball type) which was fine for a first introduction to EOs but the fragrance would be super strong at first and then wear off within an hour, then it would stay on until you unplugged it. This one will run for about 4 hours with one fill up, with a steady distribution of EO throughout, then will shut off when it&#x27;s out of water. I then will fill up a measuring cup with tap water and refill it. I learned the hard way that this is better than taking the whole unit to the sink. On a related note, I dropped it on the first day onto a hardwood floor and it survived with no problems. I just came across a similar unit for sale by one of those big EO companies and they were charging $120!!! So glad I found this one instead.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser at a great price. ONly wish it had an automatic timer, but then it probably would be so affordable.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!  It is easy to fill and operate, it generates a great mist flow and I love the color changes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic diffuser. Ended up buying two more because it&#x27;s so great. Reasonable price too. Just remember to clean it often.</li>
            <li> Works great!, bought two and enjoy them both.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser. I use it to freshen the air in my house &amp; the cool light show is amazing. Since this does everything with cool mist I don&#x27;t have to worry about grandchildren getting burned like I do if I&#x27;m burning candles. The only thing I would change is the time that it runs. It would be nice if it was a little bigger but fine for smaller areas.</li>
            <li> Because it was supposed to be new and improved I ordered this product rather than the cheaper one by the same manufacturer. I did not notice at that time that the discription on this page contradicts itself as to the size of the product. When I received the package, it contained the cheaper one ($5.67 difference in price). When I contacted Amazon to rectify this error, I was told that I had to return this one and reorder the one I wanted. Since that if what I did in the first place, I didn&#x27;t trust that I would receive what I reordered either. I am keeping the one I received but as I am very dissatisfied with the customer service at Amazon , In the future,  I will search elsewhere for what I need. This service really doesn&#x27;t deserve any stars. I have since ordered another item from Overstock.com. It was $2.00 less than the same one at Amazon and I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping or state tax.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased! Thank You :)</li>
            <li> Had this for about a month and love it. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.we use this on a daily basis with no issues. Definitely a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this. Received on time and use everyday</li>
            <li> Bottom line on this product is that it is crap!!  We purchased this item and it worked great at first but after just 2 months of use the power shorts out and the lights only sometimes turn on and when they do you can&#x27;t turn it off at that point.  Sometimes it will work and sometimes it wont.  This is a worthless item and I would not purchase it ever again.  I bought it as a birthday present for my wife and the return time was only 30 days which was after her birthday.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, puts out a good strong vapor also. I bought one for my work and home.</li>
            <li> This is the worst diffuser &amp; the cheapest that I have (&amp; I have 5)....it worked a few times &amp; then simply stopped, even tho I cleaned it as directed &amp; have no hard water issues.  Very disappointing &amp;  a waste of money....wish it could be returned!</li>
            <li> So far seems to work ok. Very cheaply made compared to other diffusers I have. Wish it had the delayed use setting so it would be on 39 seconds, off 30 seconds to make it run longer. Will see how well it continues to work.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty and works great for a night light.  However, this diffuser does not work!!! I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these exact same ones now and its the same thing with both of them.  The instructions do not tell you, but i figured out that you have to use warm water for it to work at all and then it still doesn&#x27;t have much output at all.  The second one I bought at Whole foods and I&#x27;ve only had it about a month and it wouldn&#x27;t work at all last night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100+ on the doTerra product, this diffuser is awesome! The colors are really nice too.</li>
            <li> Made for a small room or area but it is wonderful!  Works great and the LED lights are pretty.</li>
            <li> I just received mine yesterday and I am a massage therapist and my clients love it gives off the right amount of mist and essential oil and shuts off completely as well... Amazing purchase I made... Now my boss wants one.. So def a good buy here</li>
            <li> It arrived on time.  It is easy to use.  I have only had it a short time.  I hope it works for a long time.</li>
            <li> When I opened the packaging and read the instructions, it specifically says not to use citrus oils because they are too acidic. So great, there went my dreams of my lemon-fresh smelling home. But, I decided to keep it and use some other blends of oils to diffuse that did not contain citrus. Even they were apparently too powerful (think Lavender) because they discolored the plastic on the inside. Then today, I went to refill it and unplugged it and noticed that the input for the power cord was completely corroded! This totally freaked me out and I immediately threw out this diffuser as it was now most likely a fire hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really shocked that this was the #1 seller for diffusers on Amazon. Spring a few more bucks for a nicer one that won&#x27;t corrode with oils (as it was intended to be used for!) and won&#x27;t run the risk of electrical malfunction!</li>
            <li> Got a second one at my own cost. This didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one. My response from Vicky Morris at New Green Air was...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It looks like you got water inside the diffuser. There is nothing I can do for you. Have a nice day.&amp;#34; See the attached picture of the corrosion on the board. This was caused by a slow leak on a bad seal. Believe the reviews that say there is no Quality Control with these folks...or roll the dice and buy one and hope for the best. (Aren&#x27;t positive reviews so much easier?!)&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because I really liked it at first, when it worked. After about 10 uses it just stopped. Light stays on red, can&#x27;t shut it off, and no vapor action. It just hums (fan?). Like I said, if you get a good one I bet you&#x27;ll love it, but it appears the reviews that criticize the company&#x27;s Quality Control are right on.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and beautiful. in combination with essential oils I am sleeping better! Lasts all night without being refilled.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been my best essential oil diffuser. The Greenair Spa Vapor has great output and disperses well. I use it in both small and larger spaces. The diffuser has the option of running with or without color changing lights. I also like the auto-shutoff when the receptacle is empty. The appearance is subtle, which is nice. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing little diffuser for home. Love the light feature and the ability to turn off the lights while diffuser still runs. Have used it 2 nights in a row w/ lavender oil and very relaxing! Runs while we go to sleep and auto cut off feature is great!</li>
            <li> This diffuser broke after not even 2 months of use! Not a reliable product.</li>
            <li> This is the second one and having two of these things going at the same time fills my whole house with grate smelling aromas.</li>
            <li> Great product! Was there in great timing!!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! We&#x27;ve had it for maybe 5 months now. We use it mostly in our 3 year olds&#x27; room at bedtime to diffuse lavender and cedarwood, but sometimes we&#x27;ll move it to the living room if we have people over or if I&#x27;m concerned about sickness. I&#x27;ve used a wide range of Essential Oils and has no problems. I try and clean it out at least every few days (run some water inside and wipe out with a paper towel). This gets used basically every night and is still running strong. My little guy loves that it has lights on it because he was going through a &amp;#34;scared&amp;#34; phase and we were able to use this as his night light as well as to diffuse. Plan on buying a second one of these soon to put in our bedroom!</li>
            <li> Mine never worked. I thought it felt cheaply made straight out of the box and I was not wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I dealt with Amazon, not the seller, but was able to send it back for a prompt refund.</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve been using it daily and have had no issues with it. It puts out a lot of scent with just a small amount (6-7 drops) of oil.</li>
            <li> These work super well, turn themselves off, and are in expensive. I bought one first and returned to buy 4 more.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is alright. It does what its suppose to. Some times my power button doesn&#x27;t work and some times it takes  a while to get full steam going. I&#x27;d buy it again for an extra, but will probably upgrade to a better diffuser for the main part of the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this vaporizer! It does a great job of diffusing essential oils, is very quiet and the size makes it easy to place in any room.</li>
            <li> I own two of these diffusers and my colleague owns 2 as well and her family all purchased one. You can&#x27;t beat the price. Fill it with doTERRA&#x27;s On Guard or Young Living&#x27;s Thieves and diffuse next to you or your children at night to kill any germs in their bedroom or their body. My son&#x27;t teacher diffused On Guard in her classroom this year and her class was barely sick, especially compared to the other 2 5th grade classes.</li>
            <li> We bought several to go in different rooms in the house. They work well for small to medium areas, but not strong enough for largre rooms.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for any room.  Doesn&#x27;t cause moisture to gather or mold but disperses essential oils in the air.  Plan on purchasing one or two more.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, that I purchased more for family members and friends.  I have three of them in different rooms.</li>
            <li> great diffuser just wish it held more water</li>
            <li> I wish it would hold more water and run for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Pretty lights and works great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful unit....lights are great and works to fill a room with awesome scents! The mood lighting is a big plus!</li>
            <li> Love it and so did my coworkers and we bought two more. Favorite feature is that it automatically turns off when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean! Great defuser!</li>
            <li> Did some research before purchasing this diffuser. It was my first buy and I feel like I got a great deal! Good price and great product, have been using everyday, twice a day, for a few weeks now. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!!! I wish it held more water so it would run all day, but it doesn&#x27;t and that&#x27;s ok. I still love it!</li>
            <li> I have five of these in my home, can&#x27;t get enough of them. They work great at a great price.</li>
            <li> These are a great diffuser for the money!</li>
            <li> Very dependable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Amazing how this works. It&#x27;s super quiet.  Our do terra diffuser wakes up our son every 20 minutes and it is so loud. This one just quietly mists and when it runs out it automatically shuts off. Amazing!!  Our son has sleep maintenance disorder (wakes up all the time at night) and now we all sleep thanks to some lavender and this diffuser.  What a real gift!</li>
            <li> Good diffuser at a very reasonable price. Lasts for several hours and have the option of colors or no light. 2nd one I have purchased to have an extra for another room.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this diffuser! It lasts me well through the night when used on interval setting.</li>
            <li> I liked this diffuser.  I think it works best when filled halfway. I gave it 2 stars because after 5 months it no longer works.  I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great item! Works like a charm, super quiet too. Love that it changes colors or that you can turn light off.</li>
            <li> would like it to last little longer</li>
            <li> This little diffuser has been been great!  Just the right size to use and easy to move from room to room.</li>
            <li> Works great and is affordable! Just was I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is so easy to use, just fill with water, drop some essential oils in and turn it on!  That&#x27;s it and it works all day on one filling. I love it you can rinse out and use a completely different fragrance next time. It&#x27;s so much nicer to use and get the benefits of healing essential oils that you can mix and customize, in an air freshener type product. Beats all those commercial, expensive, single scent products.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy to use.  Love the vapor.</li>
            <li> We use it almost nightly and it works great! I love the light for my tiddler&#x27;s room and that we have the option of rotating colors, one color, or no light.</li>
            <li> I Love my Greenair Spa Vapor 2 and have used it once everyday since I purchased a little over two months ago.  BUT the LED lights are no longer working correctly.  Only the green ones light up and they flash like a disco ball which is horrible.  So I used it last night without the light feature...while you still get the wonderful benefits from the mist and oils the lights just make it over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone replaced the LED lights?  Thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to distribute much fragrance.  Maybe it is the oil I use.  I use the NOW brand.</li>
            <li> Love love love this diffuser lasts several hours.</li>
            <li> I have used this diffuser every day since it arrived. Diffusion is the safest method of essential oil use with very little to no risk for sensitization, it is also the best method for using essential oils (child safe oils only) with children.  I like the price and simplicity of this diffuser, I like the oil reservoir, I like that there is no light on the power button so I can diffuse when I go to bed with no distrubing lights.  I don&#x27;t like that the different components of the unit don&#x27;t attach to each other for a more secure diffuser. I had it running on the kitchen table and a tiny bump from my husband&#x27;s arm sent the whole thing flying apart with water and oil everywhere. I also don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have a timer, I guess you have to get the 2.0 version for that. However I have been able to work around the issue by filling the diffuser with only as much water as I need for the time I wish to diffuse. If I want the full four hours I fill the water  chamber to the fill line. For two hours I I fill halfway to the fill line, and for one hour 1/4 to the fill line. Simple.  Overall this is a nice diffuser for the price.</li>
            <li> Great transaction! Haven&#x27;t used it yet but excited to! Thanks</li>
            <li> I have had three of these diffusers, and 2 of the 3 have been defective. I was super excited to first order this diffused to use with my essential oils and the first one I received sparked A LOT every time I plugged it in. I was scared I was going to get electrocuted or start a fire so I contacted the company who sent me a new one right away. This one lasted a few months until my dog knocked it off the table (BUMMER!) and I then ordered a third. Each diffuser comes with use and cleaning instructions which I followed exactly. The third one worked for a month or so with very infrequent use and now the you can see it diffusing off and on and hear the motor shut on and off every few seconds and the automatic shut off does not work (the last time I used it I had to shut it off myself after 13 hours).  I contacted the company again not asking for a replacement but rather if they could recommend a more reliable model of their diffuser as this one seems to have consistent issues. The person who got back to me was and not helpful at all and told me that they would spark sometimes and didn&#x27;t even try to talk to me about the fact that it worked intermittently and the auto shut off function did not work at all. Are you serious? The only reason I&#x27;m giving this two stars is that I enjoy the diffusers while they work, I just refuse to replace it for not working every two months. Overall - I think these diffusers have some serious functionality and potential safety issues and I cannot recommend them.</li>
            <li> Works great and has lasted for almost a year! Came back and bought two more!</li>
            <li> Tomorrow will be my second call to customer service in about 6 months. Twice in 6 months this has stopped working. I use it maybe 2-3 times a week, but not every week. It&#x27;s been cleaned and re-cleaned and I follow the directions. I received it broken to begin with and now it&#x27;s broken again. It&#x27;s really poor quality. And while customer service is good, it doesn&#x27;t pay to get this diffuser because it&#x27;s really a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Works great with my Young Living Essential Oils.  I will be buying at least one more for my house.</li>
            <li> original review:(one start rating)  I have only been using this for less than three months and it is breaking.  The fan sounds very loud and hardly any vapor is coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: (five stars)&lt;br /&gt;After contacting Greenair I spoke with one of the most friendly customer service agents I have ever spoken to. They gave me advice on how to clean the inside of the diffuser and told me to call back if it didn&#x27;t work. The advice was....hot HOT water in the diffuser (after it is unplugged of course), let it sit for a few minutes and use a q-tip to clean the ceramic disc. This still did not work to get my diffuser to run properly. Without question Greeair took my information and sent out a new base (just the base, not the top part or the plus, which was not defective). The new base worked perfectly and now, months after using it, it is still going strong! Often times a good company isn&#x27;t about nothing EVER going wrong, it is about what they do when something does go wrong. I am compleatly satisfied with my experience and I look forward to my next Greenair Spa Vapor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever have problems with your diffuser, contact them. They will make it right.</li>
            <li> I really love it - I just don&#x27;t think the water last very long - but I need to really time it.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the machine works great!</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job and I use the YL oils with it.  No issues.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. I highly recommend it to others. Very happy with this purchase. Even though the price is low, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Borrowed one from a friend when my daughter was sick. How amazing! The entire house smelled like a spa! Bought 3! One of our other friends had issues with hers, so fingers crossed, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Love my diffuser just wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these.  The first one I got had to be returned right away.  The first night we used it, it stopped working, and water leaked through the bottom. The seal at the bottom where the ultrasonic circle is was not put togetherly properly and it leaked.  I was able to return through the original vendor very easily.  Dissappointed there was an issue right away, but it was solved with a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, here is my advice.  These will work good for you, if you take care of them.  They do not require a lot of maintenance, but clean every few uses.  We will clean with either citric acid, or white vinegar.  Also, when you are filling and dumping water out of it, make sure not to do so near the air intake.  If you get water in there it can cause corosion and other issues.  To get the most out of your diffuser,just use it properly.  Follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights can be turned off, and the vaporizer shuts off automatically when the water runs out, no annoying beap to wake you or your kids up like other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little guys give out just as much, if not more vapor that the more expensive models I have used.</li>
            <li> We use this every night religiously and it gives out the best amount of vapor... we&#x27;re super pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I unfortunately purchased two of these. Initially I was very pleased with the purchase both with cost and with function. However after using it for about a month it no longer works. I do not have hard water issues and I cleaned it as instructed. The lights still work but it will no longer create vapor. This is too bad and I am very surprised that it has such a high rating.</li>
            <li> Bought two so far.  Works great for essential oils.</li>
            <li> Works great and unlike another product this one actually shuts off when you turn it off. I will be purchasing another of my home and one for my classroom.</li>
            <li> I have used these diffusers for years and I love them. They run for 4-6 hours, light can be turned off, great vapor from them. I use my dōTERRA essential oils in them and am very pleased. Arrived in a timely manner and no problems.</li>
            <li> Works good.  The pieces are not attached.  They can be opened and closed easily.  The light is helpful to remember when it is on.</li>
            <li> The best..love this...take care of it and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> great diffuser keeps the house smelling great!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t worrk, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Easy to move to different rooms if need to! Also easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!! The lights are fun, and it diffuses oil great, we use it at night with lavender sometimes ecualyptus.  I am going to get another one for our main living room and get rid of our scentsy candles.</li>
            <li> It broke in a month. Lights work but it wont diffuse</li>
            <li> I love it. It starts off slow at first and then picks up. It lasts a long time and shuts off automatically. I also like the different colors and I use it as a night light. Now my daughter wants one for her apartment.</li>
            <li> As of today it has been 2 months since I emailed my difuser didn&#x27;t work and sent back. Requested a new one and have not gotten it yet.</li>
            <li> Great oil diffuser.  Easy to use.  Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is SO quiet and I love the changing colors.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these and it did not work so I returned it for another one and it does not work either. I would not buy this again. It is not putting out hardly any must or smell and I have it in a very small bathroom. I would not recommend this at all.  Not worth your time or money but it did arrive rather fast so I guess that is worth a star!!</li>
            <li> It works.... but it&#x27;s cheaply made.  The on/off buttons on both (I bought two) are already wearing out and I just purchased it a month ago.  The fill line inside melted off during the first use (the water is not hot).  They are very light weight-- too light weight. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again and I&#x27;m already looking for a nicer one.</li>
            <li> I am only recently into essential oils. I wanted a good diffuser that didn&#x27;t cost $100. I use this one in my son&#x27;s room almost every night with Thieves. I have been very pleased, and have not had any issues. Great diffuser for the money. I plan on getting one for my home office. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and even though there were negative ones, they seemed to be related to a bad batch. Either the bad batch is still being shipped or they have a second one. I ordered 2. One works, but gets hot quickly and the plug shoots sparks (even when it wasn&#x27;t connected to the unit). The other one doesn&#x27;t even turn on. Clearly missing Quality Control somewhere- I will not be using these.</li>
            <li> Only use rap water, won&#x27;t work with distilled. I love it, using it now :-)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in my classroom and it works GREAT!  The Vapor 2 is very efficient and can run all morning before adding more water and oils.</li>
            <li> It works well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it blinks the lights a few times before it shuts off. This can be enough to wake you up if you have it running in your room at night.</li>
            <li> Works well. Fast delivery is</li>
            <li> So far so good.. The power button is sensitive though</li>
            <li> It works fine.  Very easy to set up and plug in.  House smells great now.</li>
            <li> Received on time and as described. Love this type of diffusers.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to fill and easy to clean. No real opinion on the color changing.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my original Greenair Spa.  It puts out a good amount of steam, like a vaporizer.  Be sure to clean it after every use to prolong the life of this unit.  I use Lavender and my husband uses clove essential oils.  We use them at night and they run for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  Be sure to fill the water to the line inside the unit, or it won&#x27;t work.  The price is very affordable but it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; style if you want something to display, in my opinion.  The company does offer designer styles if you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more.  Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Probably will purchase another one for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible diffuser.  Does not work!</li>
            <li> very disappointed since only worked for one time.  would never buy another greenair spa vapor!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these, one for me and one as a gift. I love that it lasts so long and my kids love the color changing night light. Great price and got here pretty quickly. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good diffuser on the cheaper side.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser.  Only thing that would be better is longer run time.</li>
            <li> This is a great little vaporizer!  Using it with my essential oils.  It runs a long time and has the auto shutoff.  The lights are nice for a night light, although it would be nice if you could stop them on only one color.  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Works great.  A must have during flu season using essential oils.  I love the cool colors, and the automatic shut off when out of water.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Very good product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great product..have ordered 2 more for family members.</li>
            <li> I am totally delighted with this product.  My husband recently had an accident and was in the hospital for 3 weeks.  The day he was admitted my son and his wife, Alissa, flew in from Salt Lake City.  Alissa brought her Greenair Spa Vapor with her and wanted to set it up in my husband&#x27;s hospital room.  I thought, \\&quot;what could it hurt\\&quot; and maybe the nurses would make her turn it off.  Oh, what a spectacular surprise when she set it up.  The room developed a welcoming ambiance and everyone who came it commented on how pleasant the room was and what was that wonderful fragrance.  I absolutely believe the Spa Vapor and essential oils contributed to my husband recovery. Alissa had different oils with her and experimented with the uses to get the best results.  I have since purchased 8 as gifts.  How lucky I am to have such a bright daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Would give 5 stars if it would stay on longer.</li>
            <li> This product is very much enjoyed.  My married daughters each have two apiece.  Good product.  I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product for myself. I purchased the second one as a gift to my sister. She loves it! Normally, I will send someone something that I personally like and she fell in love with it! This product is the closet thing to me like being at the spa without getting to go to the spa as much as I would like to. Easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser to have on hand.  I use it in my kitchen with On Guard for a great homeopathic tool in the fight against the flu and other seasonal threats.  Puts out a great amount of steam! The lights on cool too.  Great for a night light!</li>
            <li> Timely and love the product!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly every time! I am a healer and over the past month I have used it all day and night and never had any problem. I&#x27;m planning to buy another for my bedroom so I don&#x27;t have to keep moving it around with me. You should not have any problem if you follow the instructions and cleaning exactly as advised. **note: I use many different blends of essential oils in my diffuser and it has been running in the room with my small pet birds the entire time and they have not been bothered whatsoever. We all actually seems to be thriving in optimum healthy and wellness and loving my homemade floral joyful mood blends, my memory and clarity blends, and my citrus energizing blends to name a few!! I love the colors as well and it reminds me of all levels of the charka and it enhances my meditations perfectly. When I sleep I press the color button once so that it just stays on my chosen red color as the rotation of the other colors are too bright to sleep next to. Love it!! Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having this diffuser for 4 months. It worked great at first. After using is as needed over the 4 months, with proper cleaning, it hardly blows out any mist. It&#x27;s over the time allowed for me to return so I basically lost my money on this item. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use. And cute!</li>
            <li> Great for the kids rooms.  They love them.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this diffuser.  i have one by my bed and one in my study, i have them running all day and night.  very good product, standing up to excessive use</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. Works well. I use it daily with essential oils. Easy to use...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased two and I&#x27;m thinking about a third!!  I love this little machine!!</li>
            <li> Produce works great!  I love it and my kids love it!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great for bathing, sleeping, and meditation!</li>
            <li> I love it, but mine doesn&#x27;t really mist. 😞. I have another that mists a lot. It is the exact same one. I wish I knen why mine that I got for my bedroom doesn&#x27;t. At least I can still smell it a little bit!!</li>
            <li> It is great for my home!!&lt;br /&gt;I am enjoying it every day using different essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter owns one and she recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;So glad she did!</li>
            <li> this item is great we have bought 5 of them and all have arrived really soon and worked great</li>
            <li> Works great.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> i had to send the first one back; it was defective. the buttons wouldn&#x27;t pop back out after they were pressed... anyhow, it was a hassle, but the replacement came and i have been using it for a month or so now with no issues. it is cute and does a good job. :) if you press the button for the lights once, it rotates through the colors. if you press the button for the lights on a certain color, it stops on that color and no longer rotates through the colors. pressing the button a third time turns the lights off. i like to stop it on red when i set it up each night so i can signal to my brain/body that it is bedtime, as circadian rhythms can be affected artificially.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! It is easy to fill and use. It has automatic shut off, which is really nice since I cant remember to check on it. It runs about four hours at a time. It is pretty to look at when the light is on and its running. The only down side is you have to clean it really regularly or it doesn&#x27;t work very well. It comes with a cleaning brush so its easy to get in and clean. Some oils will stain the plastic until you wash it.</li>
            <li> Bought this one after seeing in action at sister&#x27;s house.  She uses do terra oils and it made her living kitchen smell great.  I barely had mine a week and it ran 2 days misting great and slowly was barely anything.  I cleaned with brush and used Edens Garden Peppermint and Four Theives.  .  You had to be close to smell these, even when working. Nothing like my sisters high scent output. My space is larger, so  I have just purchased the Zaq Lotus Diffuser and  Native American Nutritionals oils so hopefully this does the trick.  If updates are possible I will post one -</li>
            <li> Only runs about 2 hours</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  It is so quiet and the amount of fragrant is perfect.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this diffuser to anyone looking for a good diffuser at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser works great with little maintenance.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. I bought 2 additional units.</li>
            <li> Bought 2... 1 for daughter, and her 2 yr old!!!&lt;br /&gt;Like it very much!!! Now I need one!</li>
            <li> This works well!  A low price for a functional diffuser.  I am very pleased.  I was scared because of some of the other reviews I saw, but this is definitely a great starter diffuser!!!</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and packaged carefully. It works great for a small unit which is exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s also pretty to watch the changing colors - very soothing for my oil therapy!</li>
            <li> It works great, but only runs about 2 hrs. on the full setting.  The intermittant setting goes longer, of course, but I find the noise of it going on and off distracting when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> Works great! I like that I can use regular tap water, and I can turn the light off. Mine produces mist for 6-7 hours, but I read in another review that if you turn the light on, it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I never use the light, so I haven&#x27;t tested that. If you&#x27;re not happy with the length of time it runs, you might want to test that theory! I&#x27;ve had mine for several months now, and haven&#x27;t had any problems. The only thing I&#x27;m not particularly fond of, is all the parts to the top. I keep this one on my nightstand, so I end up fumbling with all the pieces when I&#x27;m tired, trying to get in the bed. ;)</li>
            <li> Excellent diffuser.  Easy to use, lightweight.  My kids love the lights, and I love the lights can be optional.</li>
            <li> I was in a rush to get a diffuser so Amazon Prime was my best solution.  The diffuser is definitely not for &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; as it is entirely plastic.  It serves its purpose, although it does not seem to be very sturdy.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but for now it is working fine.  This would be very easy to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> This is my second one to purchase. I have one in the bedroom to use going to sleep. Wanted one in the living room for more fresh smells. It isn&#x27;t great at covering the whole living room but it does work! Better for smaller rooms.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my kids room!  Just enough diffusing, easy to use and clean.  Has a light, but can easily turn off.  Automatic shut off once water runs out, so about a 3 hour run time.  Buying the bigger one for my living room!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 (one got me, one for my son) and so far they work really well, I&#x27;m impressed! However the one in my room is REALLY loud :( I&#x27;ve tried different surfaces, I&#x27;ve cleaned it, I can&#x27;t think of anything else to try. it makes me not want to use it.</li>
            <li> Works great with DoTerra oils. Been using it everyday for 2 weeks and have had no issues. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Works as described! The only issue I have, and it&#x27;s not related to the machine itself, is that after a few hours the EO&#x27;s aren&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> I recommend this diffuser to my Young Living team all the time. Very good product, works great, nice output, solid product</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; works well!</li>
            <li> These are great!! Recommended by Young Living, that and lavender put kids to bed in no time!!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser. Works amazing. The only con about this product is that I didn&#x27;t realize it did not have a timer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but felt strongly that this should not be listed as a Best Seller and is not worth the money. You can only add an inch of water so it doesn&#x27;t run for long. Skip this one! Much better (and prettier) is the NOW Foods Wood Grain diffuser.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of making the room smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser, it works really well. It puts out lots of vapor and aroma into the air, but it does have a little noise, kind of like a computer running.  I don&#x27;t think that it runs for five hours. It is easy to use, you put in 1/3 cup warm water and up to 5 drops of oil, easy to clean and pretty to look at. I would buy it again, but it is the first diffuser I have owned, so don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several months now.  Very pleased with its performance and it works GREAT.  We have 2 which are both located in bedrooms. Going to buy a few more for other rooms in the house as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it in a Great Open Room, which does not allow the smell to be transferred into the entire room, therefore if you are looking to for a larger room this may not be the model for you.  It is perfect for smaller room, although I use it in a large master bedroom and because it is on the nightstand next to the bed it is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;Alternating lights - you can even stop it on a particular color if you like&lt;br /&gt;Relatively  Quiet - soft white noise</li>
            <li> I finally bought this after having it in my cart for month, glad I did, it&#x27;s so nice for making the house smell great. I wanted something that I could use essential oils with. This does an amazing job. I love the lights, my one concern is the 3 separate pieces that you have to take off in order to put water and oil in. That&#x27;s kind of annoying every single time. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these, great for the prices.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product which has done exactly as advertised.  Well worth it and would purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on January 23rd. Initially I was pleased but it died a week ago. It certainly wasn&#x27;t from over use. Terribly disappointing. The NOW brand I bought is still going strong!</li>
            <li> Excellent diffuser!  I have several different kinds and this is by far the best.  Bought more for gifts and so happy the recipients love them.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in recommending these to anyone wanting a quality diffuser!</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser. It lasts ample time for me and what I require and it&#x27;s easy to clean and user friendly</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! Wish you could pick which color was on but overall very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.  I bought 3!</li>
            <li> I love this little guy, nice option to turn the light off since my boyfriend says he can see the lights through his eyelids.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and they both broke. I would suggest any other kind! Wasted a lot of money on garbage.</li>
            <li> A great little diffuser! .....until it stopped working.  Lesson learned. Next time I will invest in a better quality diffuser.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. The recipient totally enjoyed the gift. She said it made her feel like she was in a health spa.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!  The plug sparks when you plug it in, its an older model despite being labeled as new, and the mist is very poor.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser, love that you can run it without the disco colors, although sometimes it is nice.  Also, when it runs out of water, it shuts itself off so it doesn&#x27;t burn out the motor.  I love that it does this WITHOUT making a noise or beep to wake me up at night.  Great product!  Now, it is not nearly as powerful as the Young Living one, but it also comes with a more reasonable price tag.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> This product seem to be miss represented.  My friend bought a similar product at a cheaper amount and we got the same product same box.  There was no were on my box that it said Spa Vapor 2.  Do not pay the extra for this item.  The product does work just fine.</li>
            <li> Worked the first 2 days and then stopped.  Returned and looking for something better.</li>
            <li> Received Greenair Spa Vapor immediately.  Using it everyday and love it</li>
            <li> I have a couple diffusers and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Been using for a month or so. Still works. I hesitated buying any diffuser because so many people complain about them stop working. I have been cleaning it with vinegar &amp; h2o per the instructions.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked great for 3 months then just sputtered and wouldn&#x27;t diffuse. Cleaned it as instructed and went through all the troubleshooting suggestions. Didn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  Works wonderful!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than imagined, also does not put off much vapor like my youngliving diffusers.  Lasts a very long time tho!  Like that it is an option for no light, big plus for the bedroom!</li>
            <li> like product it&#x27;s cheaper made than i expected</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife to difuse her essential oils.  She has used it daily for the past several months and loves it!</li>
            <li> Quit working after a month. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> We have only had this diffuser in use for approximately 1 week. So far, it works well. We use it in the kitchen primarily, so the changing lights are not an issue for us. I like that the unit shuts off once it is empty. I have a purification blend that I like to diffuse to remove odors, but the blend doesn&#x27;t&#x27; smell so great while diffusing. I can use this blend while we are outside or away from the house and it shuts itself off when empty. That way, we can return to a fresh smelling home.</li>
            <li> I had to send it back because it wasn&#x27;t putting out the vapor.  I ordered different Greenair product which seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this diffuser! I was going through a bout of insomnia, and I had come to my breaking point before finding this beauty. I use a Good Night essential oil mix, and I&#x27;ve had no problems since I bought it. I haven&#x27;t had any leaking problems with it like some other reviews have stated. It&#x27;s very quiet, which is a huge plus, since I can&#x27;t sleep with any noises in the room. I love that the light can be turned on and off, and that it automatically turns off after about it runs out of water/oil. I highly recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and never actually worked.  The water level never changed. I&#x27;m very disappointed as I feel I just thru $40 away..Edit to post. Contacted of the company and they sent a replacement has worked for several years no complaints!</li>
            <li> i use this item all the time. great to use before company, after dinner or cleaning. easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 essential oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden and needed a diffuser to disperse it.  I looked at all the reviews and decided on this one.  I am glad I did.  It will run about 3 hours or so and then cut off.  That is good for me because I use a different oil in the morning when Mom gets up, I use another around lunch time and another at bedtime.  Each have a different purpose during the day.  I received the carrier oils today for use on our bodies using the same oils but love the diffuser to use and fill the house with amazing aroma and wellness.  I found no complaints with this unit.  The lights are beautiful and the mist is amazing.  I am glad I made this purchase.  My final choice is a good one.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these&lt;br /&gt;My hubby loves it and so does my daighter and daughter in law&lt;br /&gt;Love that the light is optional&lt;br /&gt;I also love that when it turns off it does not make noise (my 80.00 spaceship looking one beeps when it is out of water and turning off, so it wakes me up)&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;For the money, it is an exceptional atomizer</li>
            <li> Great diffuser!!! Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Works well for small rooms</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase my first diffuser, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money so this seemed like a good choice.  It stopped working after 3-4 weeks (the on/off button also did not work consistently).  I let it sit for a while and cleaned it and tried it a month later.  The on/off situation seemed to have been resolved, but I don&#x27; smell anything when it runs regardless of how much oil I use.  It worked very well when I first used it, and in fact I had to hold back on the number of oil drops I used as the smell was pretty strong.  Now the unit runs and I smell absolutely nothing.  I tried 5 or 6 times and I have now given up.  I was going to try and replace it, but after reading all of the other reviews I decided I&#x27;m going to try another brand.</li>
            <li> Love the changing lights as it serves as a nightlight too.</li>
            <li> Love these diffusers use with young living oils for all health issues or just air freshner</li>
            <li> I have not used it a lot but I am impressed with how quickly the 5 drops of oil in the water diffuses throughout my 1000 sq ft office area. Which is a mostly open area  my only complaint is it is very light weight and can easily be tipped over. The changing light is fun.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these, and neither one worked.  I called the company and they sent me two more (except for the top part).  Of these two, one leaked really bad.  The company is going to send me another one.  Also, this item was supposed to be a newer model and was more expensive than the other one.  The company told me they are the same thing, so I could have gotten the other model (not the new and improved plus one) for a lower price.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly . Great item !</li>
            <li> Doesen&#x27;t rise into the air as much as I would like but still a good product.</li>
            <li> Works well! My whole family lives it!</li>
            <li> Works great so far! Love the soft light.</li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend to anyone that loves a nice scent of your choice in your home</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;SMALL, PRETTY, FUNCTIONAL!</li>
            <li> A great lower-end essential oil diffuser to supplement my more expensive one...this one I can move around the house!</li>
            <li> i RETURN TO SENDER THAT&#x27;S ALL I CAN SAID</li>
            <li> Love this!  Essential Oils smell great and very easy to use.  I am so happy to find an affordable cool mist version to use with my family.</li>
            <li> Bought two and we love it! Works great my kids spilled it over didn&#x27;t get burned and it didn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I like it so much that I bought another one!</li>
            <li> I have three different oil defusers but I like this one the best.  The capacity is pretty large so I am using it in the kitchen/dining area and works great.  I have been using the one I purchased about a year ago and I noticed that the mist was getting less.  I&#x27;m not sure why.... Maybe I need to clean it.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that there is no option to select the color of light.  It just rotates between a few different colors and I don&#x27;t particularly like red or green.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the previous version of this product and it did not emit enough vapor.  This model is much better and&lt;br /&gt;vapor emission is steady and lasts a longer period during operation.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works well and does the job. It appears to be a tad flimsy but I have yet to find one that isn&#x27;t. Good bang for your buck here.</li>
            <li> I love how long it lasts 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> I like my Greenair Spa Vapor and Oil Diffuser.  I wish it would run a little longer but just because I&#x27;m maybe a bit lazy about having to refill it. It works great and have had no problems with it.  Read several reviews and kind of wondered but decided to give it a try. Have had for about 3 months and still going great.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this item.  Bought the first one for my bedroom and bought this one for my kitchen area.  Easy to use and really diffuses my oils nicely.  The color changing lamp is great to light up the room.</li>
            <li> For the price this diffuser works extremely well and my kids love the color changing lights.  We love to diffuse the Breath blend at night when we have the sniffles to keep coughing at bay and these run a good 8+ hours before shutting down.  I don&#x27;t recommend running that long repeatedly on a daily basis because it is a machine that will wear, but when needed it does the trick.  As long as you fill where you&#x27;re supposed to it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these!  Love them!!</li>
            <li> It has helped my husband and I sleep much better at night. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the diffuser so much I bought a second one. Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping my old review up as an FYI.  I was contacted by greenair&#x27;s customer service and was informed that there had been a bad batch from the manufacturer.  The problems had been worked out.  They sent me a new unit. It has worked great!  Liz in customer service has followed up with me twice. Now that manufacturing kinks have been worked out,  this little unit is reliable and affordable.  Plus i can&#x27;t speak highly enough of their customer service!  I love that the light has on on-off switch independent of the unit in-off so it won&#x27;t disturb sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(What follows is my old review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have friends in the essential oil community that swear by these little dudes. They are inexpensive and reliable. After returning my first unit, I thought I would try again, seeing if I just got the odd bum one.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this company has very poor QA/QC.&lt;br /&gt;There are internet sites that show how to take the apart and re-solder faulty connections. I took mine apart, and the connections were sound. However, instead of an appropriately sized resistor, they stacked two resistors. That is common for developing prototypes, but not for a production item.&lt;br /&gt;My first diffuser just quit working all together after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My second diffuser would only run for five minutes and shut off. There was not too much or too little water. It just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser. The lights inside it make a nice addition. I followed the directions and it worked well. One thing I would caution you on is not to add too much essential oil the first time. Use a smaller amount to see how much it mists out. The first time I used the diffuser I put in 5 drops of do Terra Breathe essential oil and it was too much. Now I just use two drops. I can always add additional drops if needed.</li>
            <li> I received my diffuser a month ago and use it every day. It works very well and I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it. It has a separate light button and power button so I can use only the diffuser part, or both the diffuser and the light, or just the light. The light cycles through several colors, or can be stopped on a single color. I love to use it as a nightlight for my grandchildren. Or when my puppy is restless at bedtime I put 5 drops of lavender essential oil in the diffuser and turn it on. My puppy relaxes and goes right to sleep. When the water runs out, the diffuser and light turns off. I love love it. I would give this diffuser more stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive my new greenair spa Diffuser so I could diffuse my favorite essential oils. However, upon receiving it, my excitement was gone the moment I tried to turn it on. The on/off button does not tell you if it is on or off and there is no way of knowing unless you can get on the right angle to see if it is misting or not. Half the time I couldn&#x27;t get the unit to turn on and start misting. This unit has been more of a hassle than anything. The only thing I liked about it was the different colors it changes, but even at that it would rotate through the colors every 5 seconds and you could not set it to one color. It was almost like it was in demo mode that you couldn&#x27;t change. I would not waste your money or time on this over priced-non working product.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I wish it lasted longer, but you get what you pay for. Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Thought it was great at first, but just stopped working after about 10 days.  The lights still worked, but the diffuser no longer did.  I have read that there was a problem with a batch of these at one time...that&#x27;s all I know.  But, I didn&#x27;t open it right away, and by the time it stopped working, it was no longer eligible for return.</li>
            <li> they sent me old model ,it doesnt working with water and picture is different than i got,i give them 0.00 star</li>
            <li> It was great when it worked but stopped working after 2 weeks. I used it properly and cleaned it after each use. I am really disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a really great little diffuser, especially for the price! The top does feel a little cheap, and it is slightly annoying that it comes in 3 parts, but the diffuser runs very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, the lights can be paused on any color of your choosing! Just push the light button when it gets to the color you want and it will stay that color for the remainder of the run time:) it took me over a month to realize this, haha;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I DO agree with some other reviewers, you have to be really careful when cleaning and filling the water tank that you don&#x27;t get water down in the little opening in the side, near the buttons or power jack. So really that only leaves one side that can face the faucet. This is just a slight inconvenience though compared to the value of the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greenair has really wonderful customer service as well! I had an issue with a different model and they sent me a new one, no questions asked! Incredible! :)</li>
            <li> I really do love this.  The only issue I have is that the colors quit changing within one week, so it just stays green, but the vapor part works very well.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this and was so excited to get it. I actually did love it when it worked the first night I used it. It worked great the first three fills, but it hasn&#x27;t worked since. Now I have to return it and I&#x27;m going to get the DoTerra Petal and hope for better luck. I went through all the &amp;#34;troubleshooting&amp;#34; steps with this thing and nothing helped. There is an opening where water can easily get into the motor if you aren&#x27;t careful....I was being careful but maybe that&#x27;s what happened? who knows. Oh, I actually thought I was getting the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version, but that&#x27;s not the one that came in the mail so had it been the right one maybe it would have actually worked. The photo shown is not what you get. I should have listened to the reviews. Thanks to Amazon for the excellent customer service tho!</li>
            <li> Only way to have it last more than 3 hours is to use the intermittent feature, but unfortunately it is quite annoying hearing the fan rev up and down every 3 seconds. Had a hard time falling asleep because of the noise. Wish there was a high/med/low option.  On the 3 hour setting it seemed to be releasing a lot. It&#x27;s been on for hours and I can still smell it which is good, just wish there was a better/quieter way for it to last through the night.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing diffuser! I totally recommend to anyone looking for a good priced diffuser. I use doterra oils and this is a totally quiet machine that has beautiful night color display.</li>
            <li> great price great product</li>
            <li> Orders two of these and returned them. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> God forbid you overfill it (it only needs like 1.5 in of water) or it will just sit there all day not doing anything.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the green air spa diffuser I loved it and used it every day. It stopped working after about six months. I got busy with a move and never called the company. I decided to get a second one after my sister mentioned they were changed a bit and that customer service was really helpful if I had a problem again. So far so good. I love how great and strong it works. I love the color changing too. Makes for a great nightlite. Although some may find the light shines too bright. You can still use the machine with the light off. The package arrived wonderfully with no problems. Oh..I also love the little cleaning brush that comes with it. Makes things much easier. I believe if you are looking to buy a diffuser this is a great one to get. I am already planning on getting another one to have in another room.</li>
            <li> The two major problems I have with this product are: 1)  The website description is deceptive.  It says this diffuser will hold 175ml of water and cover up to 500 sq ft but the actual package on the product that I received said it only holds 150ml of water and covers only 250 sq ft.  Big difference!  The large square footage was one of the main reasons I bought it.  2)  After less than 1 week of use the diffuser does not work anymore.  I have to push the ON button several times to get it to work and then it turns off after 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several diffusers and this is by far the worst.  I&#x27;m definitely disappointed because the price was great and it received good reviews.  Maybe I just got a lemon. Returning it today.</li>
            <li> I received a unit that does not work.  I attempted to contact the seller and have not received a response.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased, will be ordering more for each room!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product as I had read good things about it.  First, You have to add luke-warm water into this diffuser;  that is a royal pain.  Second, the warranty states that you MUST thoroughly clean this diffuser out after EVERY use;  that&#x27;s way too much trouble for me!  I gave this one to my daughter and started using my doTERRA petal diffuser again.  It is far superior to this one!</li>
            <li> amazing mind blowing smell</li>
            <li> It is very finicky......I&#x27;ve followed instructions for use and for cleaning and it keeps stop working.  Very frustrated!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have two.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t release steam on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Greenair Spa Vapor very much!! I leave it on at night on my bedside table and it is very quite. I use the do-Terra essential oils in Serenity and Lavender in it for a peaceful nights rest. A great machine for the money. Easy to clean as well. I would recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  It works great, shuts off automatically when the water runs out and the changing lights are on a separate switch so you can choose to have them on or not.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it at night with some lavender oil and have been sleeping through the night.</li>
            <li> I really like it....  Up date... I bought this item in Aug 2014, didn&#x27;t think once a week use was over using it.. but it&#x27;s died.. What a shame now I have to go find a new one. I haven&#x27;t researched if the company will replace it by that is next on my list..</li>
            <li> i was really hoping this would work and it did for the first hour i used it.  then it just stopped.  it was still misting a teeny bit but you could not smell any of the essential oils i added to the water any longer.  i had to return it.</li>
            <li> received this gift from my son, used it 4-5 times, and it never worked again, tried to contact company, no response, do not waste your money on this item, I am a 72 yr old mother and took care of it the way the directions said, very disapointed in the product. Sad they take your money for a very short used time.  Made very cheap.</li>
            <li> I received this item as a gift and it quit working after 2 days. The on/off switch quit working and the unit wouldn&#x27;t turn off. It also quit emitting vapors. It&#x27;s built cheaply and it&#x27;s not nearly as easy to clean as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic diffuser. I put about 5 drops of essential oil in it, with cool water, and it creates cool vapor by gently vibrating the inside of the diffuser, where the water is held. This is enough to saturate my kitchen with lovely smells, and it&#x27;s enough to get rid of cooking smells. There are 3 different light settings - no light, a solid light, and a mode where the colors fade together. It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean too. Just make sure you don&#x27;t overfill it. I did once and it wouldn&#x27;t vibrate so I poured a little bit out and then it was able to shake and create vapor.</li>
            <li> This is my second one the first one lasted a year, the second one has a noisy motor so I am not sure how I feel about this product. It was my favorite until it died within a year and the second one with a motor I can hear across the room</li>
            <li> It Quit working after 3 uses.  VERY VERY dissatisfied.  Can I return this one for a new one?  Please reply  Thank you  Phone 989 871 9020  lindaeverett745@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I sleep with this on all night. I love it and it helps with head colds.</li>
            <li> Works great. Must is strong and lasts for about 3-3 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice vaporizer to use in the bedroom with scented oils. Using the Breathe oil with the unit really helps with congestion. I recommend this product with the oils!</li>
            <li> Love love love. I used it almost daily. With winter, I having immune strength running in it daily. Love the changing colors too!</li>
            <li> Works great. Of the 4 I have purchased, they each vary on how long they will go until they are empty, but average 8 hours.</li>
            <li> It only lasted about a month before it just stopped and would no longer turn on.</li>
            <li> I bought the diffuser hoping it will work better than the little one I have that uses pads, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to diffuse much in the air. I started by adding the oil in the water, then I watch a you tube video and they were adding it on the plastic piece just above the vapor, it made a little difference. I&#x27;ve tried to follow the directions but it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I expected to at least have smell in the air but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much. I used it in the bedroom, not a very large room. The return process was easy, hence the 3 stars. I am looking for a different one that works better.</li>
            <li> It is a decent diffuser. My first one. The only issues I have with it is that I cannot tell whether the power switch is on or off.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and when used with the thieves oil all sickness was kept at bay this winter with the family..</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I have five of them in my home.</li>
            <li> this diffuser works so great!!! I have 3 different diffusers and this is by far my favorite! good price, and great quality. will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It&#x27;s noisy. Poorly designed. I wish I would have put my money into a better product.The buttons don&#x27;t work half the time. Doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near 4 hours. The two things I do like about it are that the spout for the mist is moveable and the light colors can go on dim.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new diffuser.</li>
            <li> Makes my personal space lovely!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!! It&#x27;s everything they said it would be. I&#x27;m just getting started with using essential oils and love diffusing them!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time. The diffuser runs quietly. Its auto shut off is a great feature for overnight use. However, its max running time is out of your control. It would be nice if this diffuser could run continuously throughout the night (at least 7 hours without the mineral water dependency). Also, there is a minor issue - no light on the power switch, so it is hard to know whether the unit is on or off.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these. First one is still working great. Unfortunately the 2nd one has stopped working after just 2 days!</li>
            <li> I have 4. Best diffusers I have eve had. Very good output, you only need a few drops of oil and it smells wonderful. Use them everyday. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Best one at a great price. Had to order a second one for work</li>
            <li> Best diffuser! I bought 3 more and they work amazing.</li>
            <li> How we are enjoying this product.  Us it every night.  Came within the week in new condition.</li>
            <li> Great product works as described</li>
            <li> Great for the first week or so.  Now it does not work - we have cleaned it- we have tried everything.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that you can not diffuse citrus oils!!!!</li>
            <li> This diffuser works well and I am a fanatic about cleaning it immediately after it finishes. It cleans up easily and completely-never had a problem. I love how it makes the house smell so good with the Thieves Oil I&#x27;ve added. It does what I want it to do and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> i love my diffuser but i too experienced it breaking on me within a few weeks of using. however, i contacted the manufacturer directly via email. i explained the situation and they sent a brand new one in the mail very quickly. although i was disappointed my diffuser broke, i was very surprised and pleased that the company sent a replacement completely complimentary. so far the new diffuser is working well. i hope it continues!</li>
            <li> Best vapor for the price!</li>
            <li> At first I was happy with this product until I went to plug it in the second time. I noticed Sparks coming from the until when  you plug the cord back in it after filling it. I contacted the company and they said unplug it from the wall then connect it to the machine and plug back into the wall. The acted like it was no big deal! Needless to say I returned it and have found a new one I like even better!</li>
            <li> I bought one after reading the description I thought I was getting the new version (since it clearly states in the description as the &amp;#34;new and improved greenspa vapor 2&amp;#34; but I did end up with the silver one.. No big deal! Until I got to only use it 2 times, on the third time it wouldn&#x27;t turn on and the AC adapter just sides in and out of the hole, it doesn&#x27;t click  and stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I tried to find the item and seller under my orders it showed that the seller is gone.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess I wasted $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon and seller :/</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described and what I wanted. Shipping was a breeze. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. I&#x27;ve already &amp;#34;loved one to death&amp;#34;!  I just purchased two (2) more: one for my bed side table to put calming oils in while I sleep and one for my living/kitchen area for pleasant smells, mainly orange oil which I love.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Great diffuser at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I wanted.</li>
            <li> I waited several months before buying a diffuser. After reading several reviews in lots of different places, I decided to give this one a try. I have used it three times now. The first time, it worked great. It stopped diffusing shortly after I turned it on the second time. I cleaned it and on the third try, it would not start. So I cleaned again as the directions said and it did start up for a little while but turned off again. When I plugged the cord in the last time, the lights on the inside of the console flickered. So, I&#x27;m thinking that this is going to be too unreliable and will be on the search for a new one. It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. ...arrived earlier then promised</li>
            <li> Produces good vapor.  Much better than other expensive ones in my home.</li>
            <li> I was sad to find out that my diffuser has stopped working just after 6 months. I have no idea why it won&#x27;t turn on and I have plugged it into multiple power outlets, made sure it was tightly plugged in, and nothing works. Now I am past the return window and fear I have lost my money. Disappointing. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This diffuser broke within weeks of receiving the unit. The fan motor sounds like it quit working. Customer service gave me the run-around and was generally unhelpful. Apparently they&#x27;ll be mailing me a replacement (3 months later). We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it was while it worked, I liked it. I never really used the lights, I preferred to leave them off, so I just went with the diffuser. It was a little louder than my other ultrasonic, but it got the job done. The only annoying thing was the top, it&#x27;s 3 pieces. So instead of picking up the lid and pouring more water in you have to remove 3 separate pieces and replace them all each time.</li>
            <li> Have used this for yrs and had to get a new one. It fills the area with healing scents.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the diffuser a few weeks now and so far am quite pleased with it. It works beautifully putting out a good mist.</li>
            <li> For delivery it was excellent also I like my diffusers.</li>
            <li> This is my third one! Use it everyday. It runs for 4.5 hours and turns off automatically. My child loves the light color changing aspect!</li>
            <li> I like it and it works well. The down falls it drips water everywhere, and if you use it every night it will last about a year if you don&#x27;t clean it really well every day.</li>
            <li> We recieved this and have been using it ever since..love, love love it</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a good diffuser. It has good output and is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> This oil diffuser is the second one of this type I have purchased.  It works great for me so I purchased this one as a gift.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and love the color light show too.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, just wish it lasted longer than 3 hours or so. But easy to clean, colors are soothing and love the way I can use tap water and forget about it as it turns off automatically when empty.</li>
            <li> Great Defuser, I use it for most of my Doterra oils, depending on my mood.</li>
            <li> So far so good, excellent product !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple brands of diffuser, and this one is my favorite.  I knew I wanted a few of them (we have a 3 story house) so I added them to my subscribe and save and getting one each month.  The only thing, though, is that this puts out a pretty substantial cloud.  You can&#x27;t really be sitting right next to it like you can my second favorite one (hint; smile).  So because of that, I don&#x27;t choose this one for my kids rooms.  I use the other for them.  But I will soon have 3 of these, and 2 of the other, and then my life will be complete.  Hehe.</li>
            <li> Works like it says. Runs several hours. I use it a few times a week with essential oil. Very relaxing in the evening.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few Essential oil diffusers.  This is not my favorite but a great option.  I have used it continuously for over a month, cleaned it once, and still going strong.  There is no timer with this one and I do miss that feature but it is not a need.  My first choice is the Samyo.  Though it is smaller.</li>
            <li> affordable and works great, I bought 4.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading a blog about essential oils and this is the diffuser recommended. I am very pleased!  It doesn&#x27;t leave moisture on the counter. It shuts off when empty and the lights are nice especially when dark.  I liked it so much I ordered another and will probably end up with a third!</li>
            <li> I love having a second diffuser in my home. This one is working great for my family.</li>
            <li> Works great, is quiet, and the lights are a neat function! Great product.</li>
            <li> It works well but the plastic cracked on the sides and the plug rusted probably from the water</li>
            <li> Stopped working four mths after I bought it</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  I have bought two of them and they are very quiet and my husband also enjoys them.  I would highly recommend them -- great price and great diffuser!</li>
            <li> I love this product,you can get about 5 hours on the second speed,I don&#x27;t care for the lights,I can&#x27;t sleep with a light on.I have had mine for a month now with no problems,will be ordering another............love,love.............I use with my doTerra oils.</li>
            <li> Quit happy with my little diffuser. The automatic shut off is the absolute best feature. Easy set up and clean up</li>
            <li> 2016:  revised down because this didn&#x27;t last that long... a year and a half?  and it died a suspicious death (the lights were flashing and there was some water near it)... use was sometimes daily but sometimes not for a few days  Hope I don&#x27;t jinx it but so far so good - it&#x27;s been six? months.  I don&#x27;t use it every day but sometimes almost every day - purpose is to freshen the air in a pacific northwest daylight basement apartment shared by a cat.  So far it works as advertised.  Seems well built, except for the cleaning brush.  That fell apart immediately - I can&#x27;t remember if I got to use it once or if I just breathed on it.  I do clean it as recommended, we have hard water; I just use a different brush.  If you&#x27;re really lucky, you can time it just right when you push the button to freeze the lights so that you can get colors between the official ones - such as blue-purple.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the smaller size, but this little guy is a workhorse. So far it&#x27;s working without any issues. It puts out as much vapor as my big MIU 500ml diffuser that I bought for our large open floorplan living area. Granted, it doesn&#x27;t hold that much water, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would run all night (I don&#x27;t use it overnight). I ordered the unit shown, which appears to be the older model, but the seller (Day Dream) sent me an email after ordering that said I&#x27;d be getting the newest model (2.0), so be aware of that if you&#x27;re specifically wanting the older model. I&#x27;m happy with the newer one. The difference is that it has a timer setting for 1, 2, or 3 hours, or a continuous-on setting, and it also has an intermittent setting that does 3 seconds on &amp; 3 seconds off. The description of the model here doesn&#x27;t include these features...it shows the model with only two buttons, but the new model has 3 buttons plus indicator lights as to what setting you have it on (I&#x27;ve added a picture of the one I got, for reference/comparison). I think they really need to update the listing so that it&#x27;s accurate and people know exactly what they&#x27;re buying. There&#x27;s also an on-off setting for the light, but there&#x27;s no control over which color you get; it just switches through each color, a few seconds at a time.</li>
            <li> Saw a patient that had one had to get one for me and my sister and wow these things are amazing use peppermint or lavender in them!! Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I received my green air diffuser about two weeks ago, I must say my family loves it. It fills the room with great aromas. It is very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser and Greenair has the BEST customer service!! So impressed :)</li>
            <li> Good for dispersing oils</li>
            <li> This is an update from a post I submitted on March 23, 2013.  A few days short of 2 years, with consistent usage, and this little guy is still going strong!  I have 3 other different diffusers throughout my home, and this is my favorite thus far.  It&#x27;s quiet, produces a strong mist and never lets me down.  I start this when I go to bed and it&#x27;s still going when I wake up; always lasts 8 hrs (unless I turn it off).  The light control is a great feature and so is the rotating spout.  It&#x27;s also easy to fill, empty (if needed) and clean.  I just love this little thing and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I have done some research, and this item comes highly recommended. I am pleased with it so far ,also am pleased with the price and that it performs just as described.</li>
            <li> very quick delivery.  great product!</li>
            <li> Great Product and Great Service!</li>
            <li> I am SO disgusted.. first of all for being listed Prime it&#x27; took several days because they were slow about shipping.. but okay glad it finally arrived.. I PLUGGED it in after putting the right amount of warm water as it said to do.. nothign complicated here.  turned it on and after a few minutes you have a TEEEEEEEEENIE TINEY bit of vapor tht you can barely notice..  I had to keep putting my hand up to create a backdrop to see if there really was vapor...  about an hour later it stop producing vapor all together.. Can&#x27;t contact the Love 2 Shop people because it diverts you BACk to amazon..  who are refunding my money, but now I need to go to a store and find one.(ALSO*** The buttons are almost like fake buttons.. you press and nothing indicates it&#x27;s on or off..y ou have no way of knowing..  there is no light .. if you have the Lights On.. and you press the power button the lights stay on.. SO WEIRD!! **** Buyer BEWARE. this waiting for it to arrive only for it to be a Defective peace.. the hassle of sending it back.. just makes the idea of shopping online LESS than ideal.  Now when you consider more and more companies can send Amazon defective products for what ever reason.. and you the consumer has to wait only to be dissapointed  it&#x27;s sad.. and If AMAZON does NOT POST THIS because it is Negative then I will go on every Social media and share this review..</li>
            <li> Quiet, started misting as soon as I plugged it in and turned it on.  Gives significant output.  Did not need pad to be placed on wooden dresser.  Very glad I did not purchase the one offered by Young Living.  This is significantly better, at a much lesser cost.</li>
            <li> I wish it could hold more water. We love the colors. All in all, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> After seeing some good reviews on this diffuser, I was very excited to receive it.  However, I found it extremely difficult to use. If the water temperature wasn&#x27;t exactly the correct temperature, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  and if you added the water to the limit line and already added oils only to find it wasn&#x27;t working, well then you were in a dilemma so as not to waste your oils!  It was very frustrating to try and get the machine to the perfect water temperature to have it function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t program it for different time durations.  It&#x27;s an all-or-nothing sort of thing.  It would also be neat if they had a color option for the lights...rather than the rotating light show.  But that&#x27;s just a preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product and hoping my next diffuser will be better.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail on Tuesday. I was super excited while setting it up. Unfortunately the LED light button did not work so the lights were on no matter what if it is plugged in. That didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but no mist came out at all when I set it up. I am definitely returning this product asap.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser! It works great, I love it!</li>
            <li> I seriously loved this little diffuser when I first got it(was a gift). I had been wanting a diffuser, but was balking at the prices of the better rated ones. I was thrilled that I got this and even more thrilled when I first plugged it in and started diffusing my EO&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, about a month later it has puked out. The fan runs but no mist comes out, the motor is dead(except to the fan, which is odd to me).&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had continued to work.</li>
            <li> I got one as a gift for Christmas....not even 3 months later it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple of weeks. Then all of a sudden stopped working.</li>
            <li> Light weight easy to use. Spits out a steady stream of scented vapor with a directional spout. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> After viewing many of the diffusers, I purchased what my daughter had for her 2 year olds room.  It works great and I have ran it through the night.  It shuts off when out of liquid.  Also have used it during the day in the living room.  It is quiet and efficient.</li>
            <li> This is the second of this exact diffuser that I have purchased. It works great and I love the price for a decent diffuser for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> This diffuser emits a spark whenever I plug it in, but worked fine for about six months.  After six months when I plugged it in the whole thing sparked when I plugged in and blew the motor so now it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It is cheap so I guess I didn&#x27;t expect it to last forever but they should really get that spark thing under control, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where people had the same problem.  When it was working I was happy with it, but I would think it should last longer.</li>
