    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Happy Shaving! &lt;</li>
            <li>It provides the best shave I have ever had from an electric.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the 7775X</li>
            <li>This electric razor was awesome in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>So for all those mach 3 and nivea users, this is the perfect replacement.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Mach 3 Turbo with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with the rapid 1 hour charge speed.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST shaver I ever had!!</li>
            <li>Everything about this shaver works GREAT!!</li>
            <li>The directions don&#x27;t do a wonderful job explaining, and I thought I was going to break something (To those who haven&#x27;t figured it out</li>
            <li>Like I said, this is the best shaving electric razor Norelco has ever made.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just so impressive when my boss complimented the closeness of the shave!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>and it still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.   </li>
            <li>so I am quite impressed.    </li>
            <li>It MAY be the best electric shaver on the market</li>
            <li>(yes, I fell for the marketing BS &amp;quot;its as close as a blade&amp;quot; - ARG!), I thought, &amp;quot;Hey, maybe I should try THIS on my head.&amp;quot;  And it is PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>NORELCO IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>It is the razor that is, itself, the best part.</li>
            <li>The 7775X is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>performance of the shaver is very good.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it gives a very good shave and works in the shower.</li>
            <li>Since I suffer from razor burn, I thought an electric razor with built in lotion would be ideal.</li>
            <li>and it works great every day.</li>
            <li>Based on the price and the reviews, I was expecting a really GREAT shaver.  </li>
            <li>My husband is perfectly happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product for the price,</li>
            <li>Plus the battery life is great.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>The lotion felt great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great in the shower and great at the sink.  </li>
            <li>and it is great.  </li>
            <li>Besides the two negatives I mentioned, I think that this is a great product</li>
            <li>Amazon price was great and the delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>All in all a great shaver.</li>
            <li>and it feels great.</li>
            <li>That aside it was a great shave.</li>
            <li>This means no charge-and-forget scenarios; set a timer and unplug everything when it&#x27;s done! &lt;br /&gt;Other than that the unit is great.</li>
            <li>It has been great.</li>
            <li>It is just a great invention.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver works great.</li>
            <li>The lotion/gel dispenser works wonderful and the shaver gives me a great shaver, plus it is very nice to be able to just jump in the shower and shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The good - close shave without the blood.  </li>
            <li>It is particularly good in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the good work, Norelco and thank you.  </li>
            <li>The nivea packs are great idea, if you don&#x27;t like them you can use your own gel/foam.</li>
            <li>A genuinely good shave.   </li>
            <li>The ergonomics are good.  </li>
            <li>Good balance.</li>
            <li>The trimmer angle is good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a remarkably good shave.  </li>
            <li>Really good piece of electronics.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>To get a really good shave with this razor, you have to use it for 21 days, as the manual will tell, to let your skin get used to it.  </li>
            <li>The battery charge is good for 10 days to two weeks, and it gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I must comment you must use the plastic strap and hang it on something, because dropping the shaver in the tub is a good chance that a repair/replacement will be required.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>I have loved this razor even though within one month the blades had problems</li>
            <li>I have used a wet/dry shaver for over 10 years, from Panasonic foil (which cut my face)to Remingtom (no longer available) to Norelco (the best).</li>
            <li>He says it is the best shaver he has ever had and the cool skin additive helps to give him as close a shave as did the razor.</li>
            <li>The nivea packets make this shaver perfect for a quick nonirritating shave.  </li>
            <li>This is the closest and best shave that I have ever gotten with a Norelco Electric Razor in nearly 25 years of shaving!!!!!  </li>
            <li>You need to use the Nevea gel/lotion a bit more and it works great.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for more than a year now and it works great.</li>
            <li>, YOU CANNOT GET A CLOSER SHAVE EVEN WITH A RAZOR&amp;gt; BUY THIS, YOU WILL BE HAPPY AND GLAD THAT</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver, certainly the best electric i have used.</li>
            <li>Hi, &lt;br /&gt;I never used an electric shaver before, but I decided to try this one, and It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This is especially useful</li>
            <li>gel dispenser is kind of a novelty item.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Quality of Shave:  The closeness of the shave is AS GOOD any electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, but not appreciably any BETTER.  </li>
            <li>I used to own the lower model lotion shaver</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you, this is the absolute best Electric Razor Norelco makes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 10 days and am loving it.  </li>
            <li>It is just as effective.</li>
            <li>good product; it gives a pretty close shave, the best i have gotten from an electric razor, and i love being able to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of shaving is great, really clean and close.</li>
            <li>good buy if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, good shave.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver, gets very close to as good a shave as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is very easy</li>
            <li>but it is clearly the best shaver I ever had, and at this price ($99) - a bargain.</li>
            <li>Good fit in my hand.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have a light beard, but I could do this if I did a good job with a razor.</li>
            <li>I own a Spectra 8894XL Top Of The Line  Norelco Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly the best electric/battery operated shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to stand, shivering, in front of the bathroom mirror waiting for the sink water to get warm, you&#x27;re already nice and comfortable in the shower and you just rub the thing over your face while you stand there.</li>
            <li>Its best to use some Edge Shaving Gel with this electric razor to really get a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Norelcos gave a good shave, but they were a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li>Both were good, but they can&#x27;t match the Cool Skin for closeness and speed.</li>
            <li>Very, very comfortable shave,</li>
            <li>My skin felt very smooth after the shave.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>The attachable sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a very good job in my opinion, but I kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but if I had to do it over again I probably wouldn&#x27;t spring for the top of the line model.  </li>
            <li>this seems to have to many flashing lights and settings</li>
            <li>A shaver to be used in and out of the shower should be more durable in my opinion.</li>
            <li>charger could be better but it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Norelco shavers over the years and this one was the best yet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely the best eletric I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>, this used to take the majority of my precious minutes in the morning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, I thought that the Mach 3 may have done a better job in getting a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>He loves the fact that you can use it in the shower, it gives him a really good shave, and he says it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>For me, that says more about the shaver than anything else could.</li>
            <li>This razor is so much better; the heads have much more flexibility and I am able to get a much better, quicker shave.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed how close the shave is, actually, in his case,  better than with the blade.</li>
            <li>Never did that before.  :-)</li>
            <li>I hav oily skin and find I get a better shave before washing my face rather than afterwards.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to do that with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>IT TAKES MORE TIME TO SHAVE WITH THIS PRODUCT VS</li>
            <li>so make sure you slip the wrist strap on while shaving.  </li>
            <li>The shave is as smooth as a razor!</li>
            <li>Fortunately they&#x27;re 5 minutes of standing under the water, kind of spaced out, and shaving.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d pay more than $40 for shaving equipment.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll shave more often.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The shaving head is flexibly designed to be able to shave any face contours.</li>
            <li>It seems to do better with shorter whiskers.  </li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Well, maybe I don&#x27;t LOVE it, but</li>
            <li>I sure like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>For me, the monthly cost of the Braun cleaning solution was more than the cost of the Nivea gel cartridges.</li>
            <li>Everything else is top notch.  </li>
            <li>I am thoroughly enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li>fact, it&#x27;s better than a blade.</li>
            <li>I hope to have this one for many years.    </li>
            <li>I LOVE this shaver for my head.  </li>
            <li>I also find the lotion much better than the gel.  </li>
            <li>Norelco&#x27;s website claims the 7775X to be their \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; lotion-dispensing razor.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is like a blade, but I believe this product shaves faster than the Braun and Panasonic and is more thorough.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li>The charging stand is cheap and you can knock the shaver off of it very easily &lt;</li>
            <li>That said, this one does pretty good.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I find myself shaving more often than I did with a blade just because it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep it in top working order.   </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>shaver really works great and its great to be able to shave daily without irritation instead of skipping days to let my face heal.</li>
            <li>Nivea is fine; the Clearasil works much better for me.   </li>
            <li>I even used it once when my water pump quit on me and without water it worked fine just using more lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was very sweet.</li>
            <li>instead I&#x27;m using a regular shaving gel and the shaving is very good for me.</li>
            <li>The wet shave is totaly the best.</li>
            <li>too\\&quot; to what I consider to be the most important points.    </li>
            <li>the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as close as a Mach 3 when you shave in the direction of the grain, but much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>While it does a great job of cleaning, keep  in mind that the cleaning and drying process takes over an hour, and it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>The shaving gel provided made it a lot more comfortable than I&#x27;ve gotten used to.</li>
            <li>The Nivea gel packs are easy to use and work well</li>
            <li>/rinses easily, so</li>
            <li>The gel and lotion packs are a neat idea and are very convenient, but they are exceptionally pricey.  </li>
            <li>Easy glide over face, neck, chin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a easy 5 star from me.</li>
            <li>Also, I was impressed how it quickly and easily removed the whiskers with minor irritation.</li>
            <li>would recommend that you keep you unit clean and charged as required and most importantly change the shaver heads once a year, as recommended.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try it in shower yet but it will be just fine.  </li>
            <li>Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this was the best thing.</li>
            <li>OK, quick summary -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean, charges fast, and holds a charge for a pretty good length of time (probably about 45 minutes or so of shaving time).    </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more fun than pressing the button and the gel washes off easily from the shaver and skin.</li>
            <li>pricing is a little tricky - i think this shaver has been on the market for some time but your best bet is on amazon trust me..</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I have to say that it shave very well.</li>
            <li>keep away from these machines and have a smooth, healtier face.</li>
            <li>Being a soldier, you must be squared away from head to feet, the mornings are always pressed for time and this shaver has defintely made them run mre smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Hope Norelco is looking at this site for improvements to the follow-on models because with a few tweaks this thing could be just about perfect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He is getting a smooth shave with every use.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels and works cheap.</li>
            <li>The gel packs work, but also seem cheap.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy the display lights that tell you what is going on with the shaver.</li>
            <li>That depends on what&#x27;s important to you.</li>
            <li>Really easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>is more than worth the $100 or so that it costs.</li>
            <li>I use it with  my regular shaving gel, works great.</li>
            <li>Actually, I used it for almost a month before I was happy with the shave.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, you don&#x27;t NEED to use the cleaner after every use (or at all for that metter).</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and neat to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates ease of use and great features.</li>
            <li>It just means that if you have a light beard like me, you will still have to shave every day (when I shaved with a razor I could go a couple of days between shaves)  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, shaves close and comfortable</li>
            <li>The shave in the shower just using regular foam is great.</li>
            <li>But this razor has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use the Nivea, or as I do, use a shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Just a light touch gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li>-- and far superior to the Spectra.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with my new 7775X.</li>
            <li>The shaver rolls around in it and you have to make sure it&#x27;s positioned right so that the connection is made.</li>
            <li>it is very lightweight the charge stays on very long works excellent in the water as you shower.</li>
            <li>The Clearasil is much more slippery and enables the razor to move around easily without pushing and pulling your skin nearly as much as the Nivea.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>Cool Skin is not as comfortable a shave as the Spectra unless I have shaving cream on the area where I am shaving.</li>
            <li>thing I have to add is that, while the little Nivea packs are okay, I&#x27;ve found a product that I greatly prefer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much faster and more comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>Still getting adjusted to the shaver, but so far am very impressed by the close cut and extra smoothness</li>
            <li>I still have it the original \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; model before the cool skin series came out..</li>
            <li>liked the moisturizing lotion better than the extra fresh gel.  </li>
            <li>decided to go all out this time and got the 7775X Cool Skin whateveritscalled.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a week and returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>Its claim of shaving as close as a blade is true.</li>
            <li>At a full charge, it will get me through ONE shave.  </li>
            <li>He has used these razors with the Cool Skin Gel/Lotion for years, and he loves them.</li>
            <li>Spectra 8894XL can&#x27;t even come close to giving me the shave that I get with the Cool Skin Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li>The Spectra takes me 7 or 8 minutes to shave and it&#x27;s still not as close as the Cool Skin</li>
            <li>It leaves your  face feeling smooth and it really gives you a  smooth, close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the dispenser doesn&#x27;t work that good.</li>
            <li>The wife agrees, and if that isn&#x27;t good enough..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>In spite of the people who say this sucks for your face, this is because of the lack of oxygen in the brain from shaveing there head to close, they probably shave their brains out of the head, but the truth is, NORELCO IS THE BEST SHAVIENG SYSTEM YOU CAN PURCHASE</li>
            <li>This is true in all aspects but one: the choice of batteries.</li>
            <li>With shaving cream the Cool Skin just glides.</li>
            <li>(The trimmer on the Cool Skin must be attached.)</li>
            <li>Some people have written that the razor is a bit slippery, which is true, but mine has never fallen out of my hands.</li>
            <li>I also find rotary to be superior to foil for my facial hair, and this shaver meets my needs.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the Norelco 7775 Cool Skin shaver.</li>
            <li>It gives a good overall shave.</li>
            <li>Which is fine if you&#x27;re shaving before showering, but kind of gross when you have your clothes on.</li>
            <li>For example I find myself shaving quickly before my wife comes home.  </li>
            <li>just a quick &amp;quot;going over&amp;quot; all over my head every morning in the shower</li>
            <li>I like the quick 1-hour charge a lot.  </li>
            <li>The shave was quick -- not because I was in a hurry.</li>
            <li>no cuts, irritation from the the very first shave.</li>
            <li>I mostly end up using my normal shaving gel (Edge).</li>
            <li>If I shave at night after shaving in the morning, it is pretty darn smooth.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>The Nivea product is good for my dry face.  </li>
            <li>The zipper case is nice, but kind of small.</li>
            <li>It takes your face a few days to get used to an electric shaver and you might not think it works very well, but after the first week it will give you the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li>He has a very tough beard and was extremely satisfied with and impressed with how easily and thoroughly it worked after a couple of days growth, better than any other shaver he has ever used.  </li>
            <li>I use this shaver everyday and it works great.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and very close.</li>
            <li>Just hang on - don&#x27;t drop it as it&#x27;s kind of fragile.</li>
            <li>message display provides a good status of the shaver to include the battery charge which the old unit did not indicate until it was near depleted.</li>
            <li>then the rinse indicator is useful.</li>
            <li>This shaver is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Even in a combat zone, we must be freshly shaved.  </li>
            <li>I get a better shave with an old Sensor II Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>You will also get a closer shave if you shave more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I apply my old shaving cream instead of the provided gel from the pouches, is more convinient that way.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves it and searches far and wide for the lotion packets it requires,  It gives an awesome shave.  </li>
            <li>He was so happy to find one, and it became an early birthday present for him.  </li>
            <li>but if your looking for a shave on the drive to work this might not be the right one.  </li>
            <li>but that went away once I began using it in the shower where I could rinse right away.  </li>
            <li>Yep, you heard me right... for my head.  </li>
            <li>It is also much easier to clean and the battery charge is longer and quicker to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor if you like the in-shower shave.</li>
            <li>Both still work fine and just need new blade replacements..</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Phillips has produced an absolute gem of a shaver with this Norelco Cool Skin.</li>
            <li>The Cool Skin is much closer.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to it you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s just as good as shaving down or with the grain.</li>
            <li>I typically use this shaver in the shower, and have noticed that if you wash your face first, it takes more of the Cool Skin creme to give a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>Lotion packs last about 2 weeks, yielding a smooth, comfortable shave with no shaver rash.</li>
            <li>The gel packs go pretty quickly, but maybe I&#x27;m using too much.  </li>
            <li>pros of this thing are a very COMFORTABLE and QUIET shave, albeit time consuming.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from an older version of the cool skin models as it would no longer turn off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, quiet and delivers a very close shave that is far more comfortable than any blade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Using it in the shower, I get a very, very close shave with NO irritation and NO razor bumps, no matter how many times I go over the same area  </li>
            <li>Not as thrilled with it as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>This razor makes shaving much easier - shaving in the shower is great - not as close as a regular razor - but close enough.</li>
            <li>Upon impact, the top portion (the grill thing) popped open and a spring popped out.  </li>
            <li>This happened the first week I purchased it.</li>
            <li>This is the first razor I have owned which makes shaving &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; pleasurable.  </li>
            <li>I think all the \\&quot;Pros and Cons\\&quot; guys have covered this shaver pretty thoroughly, and I agree with 90% of them.  </li>
            <li>This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve seen someone using.</li>
            <li>The first shave I had redness around my neck just using the Nivea gel included in the box.  </li>
            <li>but now I upgraded to the higher model lotion shaver called the Norelco 7775XL.</li>
            <li>Overall it works better then</li>
            <li>I personally shave without a mirror most times, and at first I couldn&#x27;t even tell when the gel was coming out</li>
            <li>It takes the same time to shave as with a razor and the experience is much more pleasurable.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what Norelco says it does: It shaves as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t believe the Nivea packs are enough shaving gel for keeping the \\&quot;gliding\\&quot; feeling, the 7775x is simply the overall best, closest shaving electric razor out there.  </li>
            <li>I have also found it does better with regular shaving gel (like Edge) than it does with the Nivea pack</li>
            <li>It could be different for you if you use more lotion though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m a blade guy and this was my first try at electric.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for the first timers.</li>
            <li>so I wet my face and put my own shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li>More than 3 or 4 minutes just wasn&#x27;t necessary for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels nice to use a battery-powered razor on a wet face.</li>
            <li>This is the first rotary shaver that I&#x27;ve owned and</li>
            <li>I enjoyed shaving with the &amp;#34;Cool Skin Lotion&amp;#34; but when I ran out I just continued on using regular shaving cream &amp; it works just as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll round up just because I&#x27;m a good guy.</li>
            <li>in all a good purchase to replace my Norelco 6735X, which lasted over three years before succumbing to dead [Ni-Cad] batteries...</li>
            <li>The Cool Shave seemed like a great product because you can use it in the shower, or out as long as your face is wet.</li>
            <li>For the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles, dimples and Adam&#x27;s apple cleanly with very little drag.</li>
            <li>I use the Nivea cartridges which easily install in the back of the shaver, and the resulting shave leaves my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes shaving easy, convenient, and even fun -- so much so that, for the first time since I started shaving over twenty years ago, I&#x27;m actually shaving every day.  </li>
            <li>The reason I purchased the new 7775X is because after 7 years of use my 6756X will only hold charge for a few shaves, otherwise works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This style is easy to clean daily, just pop open the head and rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>Even with this disadvantage the Cool Skin is hands down better than the Spectra.</li>
            <li>you never will be able to firmly fix again in the original position.</li>
            <li>So I must say it has held up really well for two years with as much as he has used it!</li>
            <li>The 7775x is truly cool - it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn sensitive skin when used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The 21 day adjustment period is true, and my sensitive neck has cleared up since not using a razor.  </li>
            <li>It looks like it could easily be disconnected allowing the unit to fall and possibly break.</li>
            <li>The grooming attachment is easy to use and actually works really well too.</li>
            <li>And because of the gel system, it&#x27;s also waterproof, meaning you can open it and clean it under running hot water every day.  </li>
            <li>Cool clean shave with mimimum effort,charge lasts a long long time, simple operation, easy clean.</li>
            <li>The Nivea lotion doesn&#x27;t help too much.  </li>
            <li>You have every time -really</li>
            <li>The problem is it isn&#x27;t very durable.  </li>
            <li>The lotion helps so damn much.</li>
            <li>: these toys never ever can replace a real razor.</li>
            <li>A real design flaw.   </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really skip a day or your face will feel like asphalt.  </li>
            <li>This Electric Razor really is Blade Close.  </li>
            <li>It does not put out much gel while you are shaving.  </li>
            <li>I went from using a cheap, one foil Braun model - the only way I had ever shaved - to the Norelco 7775x.  </li>
            <li>I could go on and on about what a difference it is to be able to wet shave, shave in the shower,</li>
            <li>If I wait a whole day, it does not feel as close after a shave.  </li>
            <li>You can go through the Nivea packs extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>While the Panasonic is much louder, it shaved much closer than the Norelco in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this model, because it dispenses shaving gel on your face as you shave, for an effortless shave.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I used a cheap trimmer to shave but that was never that close.  </li>
            <li>They all work reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>but amazon did that so fast and without a problem</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Christmas two years ago (2006) and it has worked really well for him.</li>
            <li>Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is to bulky and it doesn&#x27;t outline very well</li>
            <li>I never used the Nivea refills much.</li>
            <li>The shave was fast and very close -- as close as a blade in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the Nivea cartridges from Amazon, and if you purchase enough to receive free shipping, they&#x27;re not very expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is small, light weight, and quite easy to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, the 7775x left my sensitive neck feeling baby smooth and 100% better than my Braun left it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better that the other one that I had which was the entry level one.</li>
            <li>I would rather have seen the permanent trimmer design like most other Norelco&#x27;s have.</li>
            <li>How many other shavers have you seen with a demo mode? &lt;</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a very long time, and the recharge is very quick.</li>
            <li>This is not necessarily bad (they still perform well), but the absence of smart trickle charging forces the user to \\&quot;baby-sit\\&quot; the charging process.</li>
            <li>I called back to complain about the downgrade and they told me that it was an error, that I was supposed to get a new 7775X, but there were none available.</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of time and you really enjoy shaving, I guess you might not mind how long it takes.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I received a Norelco Cool Skin for my Birthday.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several norelco cool skin shavers.  </li>
            <li>I like the shaved head thing (better than a crome dome) and tried shaving my head with a blade a few months ago and it was just too much work to shave my whole melon every morning, so I blew it off.  </li>
            <li>After shaving just once with the Cool Skin, I would not go back to the Spectra.</li>
            <li>with refund in hand, I&#x27;m getting ready to buy a new 7775X from Amazon.</li>
            <li>you primarily use the shaver dry</li>
            <li>He had an older Norelco shaver and I saw this and bought it for him.   </li>
            <li>Facial skin is soft and stubble free.   </li>
            <li>Older style</li>
            <li>Third, the lotion/gel samples make the shave live up to its name of Cool Skin -- no razor burn whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver to everyone.</li>
            <li>I just replaced my 5 year old norelco advantage wet dry with the 7775x bought here at amazon and after using it once (after a good week without shaving) its a keeper..</li>
            <li>(I guess those lotion-retaining, guide rings really work!), and can easily go over a week of daily use on a single charge.</li>
            <li>would not recommend suspending the shaver on the supplied plastic hanger strap which is not near as secure as with my old unit.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin in the neck area and this shaver both shaves well and does not leave much irritation.</li>
            <li>They put the gel device where the trimmer normally goes</li>
            <li>You will waste alot more water in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Now that the whiskers are mostly gray, you can&#x27;t tell for a few days if I shaved or not, so closeness is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li>Doing so should provide the same long live and close shave as I have enjoyed over the years.</li>
            <li>However, my skin is just the opposite - baby face red blush, easy to cut.  </li>
            <li>I was offered a choice of a dry shaver, a set of accessories for the 7735X, or a full refund.</li>
            <li>One day I am shaving fine and the battery is almost full the next day it is dead and won&#x27;t respond to anything.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, a new Norelco 7735X came to my door.</li>
            <li>For me and the ammount of lotion I use it is cheaper to buy lotion cartridges than new mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li>The status lights are a nice touch, but reminders to dispense lotion and rinse afterwards are redundant; especially for users already familiar with these wet razors.</li>
            <li>I like that wet clean shave</li>
            <li>They are relatively expensive in most sources (including here at Amazon) but are available at the world&#x27;s largest retailer in a box of 5 for $4.94.  </li>
            <li>I bought the one with all of the warning lights, like charging, how much time until charging ends, indicators, and how much shave time left.</li>
            <li>They are a good idea, but they run out too fast and are expensive.</li>
            <li>For the past couple of years I used the top of the line Panasonic wet-dry shaver.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t like it at first, give it some time and try different shaving methods.    </li>
            <li>Firstly, I think Nivea is the only shaving gel provided.</li>
            <li>I have mixed feelings about the effectiveness of the dispensible lotion, I use shaving cream and get a close and consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>Its said that the skin needs about three weeks to get use to an electric shanver, but with the Norelco 7775X, it took only the first shave.</li>
            <li>They are pretty equal.</li>
            <li>As with any new shaving technique, you will need to experiment a bit to find out what works at what doesn&#x27;t as far as direction of motion, amount of pressure, and the like.  </li>
            <li>I live near Baton Rouge, LA.  </li>
            <li>I sent it back for a full refund (60 days money back guarantee!).</li>
            <li>Due to the gel/lotion it feels cool and does not cut or irritate.</li>
            <li>I have been a norelco user for 10 years now-- love the wet dry shaving system...</li>
            <li>I just now replaced my old one</li>
            <li>you travel frequently like I do.</li>
            <li>and though I haven&#x27;t thrown my mach 3 away, this is defintely my first choice and will be for a long time.</li>
            <li>Tried this Norelco and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>so well I convinced my 50 year old dad (lifetime blade user) to start using it and he loves it too.</li>
            <li>After about 5 years I decided it was time to upgrade from my old 6756X and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>Shaving near either doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Combined with the short motor run time per charge, that&#x27;s a real issue.  </li>
            <li>WHERE NEAR A CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li>(Some of the foil shavers I use to use took nearly 30 minutes).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The only downside is the shaving cartriges run fast.</li>
            <li>, you press the button to open up the shaver head and then pull straight out away from the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensative skin and when using a regular razor or a mach 3</li>
            <li>it gives me so far.  </li>
            <li>like I had to with my old razor.  </li>
            <li>7775X has a lot more bells and whistles but its motor is not strong enough to completely shave my neck.  </li>
            <li>I got it from QVC for less than $100.00 on special.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and rather quick to use and the charge seems to hold for a long time.</li>
            <li>(I will qualify that by saying that this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in the shower, so as far as that type of shaving goes, my experience is limited.)  </li>
            <li>As a dry shaver, the Norelco works pretty well.</li>
            <li>and I shave with the Cool Skin in half the time.  </li>
            <li>Norelco markets this Cool Skin with the phrase \\&quot;close as a blade with less irritation.\\</li>
            <li>The only mild complaint he has is regarding some missing hairs in the neck (but he points out all shavers have the same problem), but the quality of the shave in general is really amazing!</li>
            <li>I use to have an older model of this same shaver but had to replace it when it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore</li>
            <li>PROS: close shave; less skin irritation and no cut; quick charging;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I have had my new 7775X shaver for a short time, it seems to provide as close a shave as my old unit.</li>
            <li>Yeah, a blade might be closer if I spent half an hr., but this one is quicker and has better aerial coveragee.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems or failures with this or my first Norelco wet shaver I bought.</li>
            <li>When his razor broke, he was devastated, and only Amazon had a new one for us to purchase.  </li>
            <li>Plus it seems to make it easier to find quickly those few whiskers you may have missed.  </li>
            <li>Their is no other shaver.  </li>
            <li>I got the results I was looking for along with major neck irritation.  </li>
            <li>this is the highest model lotion shaver and it is UNBELIEVABLE!! :-)</li>
            <li>First, Norelco still has one of the most inconvenient methods of cleaning I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li>and I could barely see the LED indicators.</li>
            <li>My face, especially my neck, is really sensitive</li>
            <li>I use it as a dry shaver a lot and still get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I actually use a blade to completely remove my beard.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The 7775X has a more secure changing base than the old unit (deeper).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK, definitely not great.</li>
            <li>At the time of this writing, the shaver was so new, the repair center didn&#x27;t have parts, and Norelco completely replaced the one that broke when it fell off the shelf in the shower.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me preface this review by saying I have very curly hair and have been prone to serious pseudofolliculitis barbae or razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>and I often get razor burn if I am not very careful</li>
            <li>I bought a Norelco to my husband after searching online for a several weeks, and after reading some reviews I finally decided for Norelco, altough the price is higher than other brands.</li>
            <li>When I first used this shaver there were a few things I had to learn.  </li>
            <li>The first shave with it was a little different.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more delicate than other regular Norelco electric razors.</li>
            <li>In a pinch, I will still use my Spectra 8894XL, but in the mean time I&#x27;m sticking with my Cool Skin.  </li>
            <li>I shipped it off (at their expense) and used my old Norelco dry shaver while I waited.</li>
            <li>In addition, I have extremely sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I expect it will provide the same long life service and close shave that my old unit did.</li>
            <li>My first was the 6756X Advantage which I still use occasionally, followed a few years later with a Norelco 8894XL Spectra.</li>
            <li>It was time for a change and my skin is too sensitive for regular dry shavers</li>

            <li> Happy Shaving! &lt;</li>
            <li> It provides the best shave I have ever had from an electric.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the 7775X</li>
            <li> This electric razor was awesome in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> So for all those mach 3 and nivea users, this is the perfect replacement.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Mach 3 Turbo with excellent results.  </li>

            <li> This is an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shaver I ever had!!</li>
            <li> Everything about this shaver works GREAT!!</li>
            <li> The directions don&#x27;t do a wonderful job explaining, and I thought I was going to break something (To those who haven&#x27;t figured it out</li>
            <li> Like I said, this is the best shaving electric razor Norelco has ever made.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just so impressive when my boss complimented the closeness of the shave!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> and it still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.   </li>
            <li> so I am quite impressed.    </li>
            <li> It MAY be the best electric shaver on the market</li>
            <li> (yes, I fell for the marketing BS &amp;quot;its as close as a blade&amp;quot; - ARG!), I thought, &amp;quot;Hey, maybe I should try THIS on my head.&amp;quot;  And it is PERFECT.  </li>
            <li> NORELCO IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> It is the razor that is, itself, the best part.</li>
            <li> The 7775X is the best yet.  </li>
            <li> performance of the shaver is very good.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it gives a very good shave and works in the shower.</li>
            <li> Since I suffer from razor burn, I thought an electric razor with built in lotion would be ideal.</li>
            <li> and it works great every day.</li>
            <li> Based on the price and the reviews, I was expecting a really GREAT shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband is perfectly happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Great product for the price,</li>
            <li> Plus the battery life is great.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> The lotion felt great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great in the shower and great at the sink.  </li>
            <li> and it is great.  </li>
            <li> Besides the two negatives I mentioned, I think that this is a great product</li>
            <li> Amazon price was great and the delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> All in all a great shaver.</li>
            <li> and it feels great.</li>
            <li> That aside it was a great shave.</li>
            <li> This means no charge-and-forget scenarios; set a timer and unplug everything when it&#x27;s done! &lt;br /&gt;Other than that the unit is great.</li>
            <li> It has been great.</li>
            <li> It is just a great invention.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver works great.</li>
            <li> The lotion/gel dispenser works wonderful and the shaver gives me a great shaver, plus it is very nice to be able to just jump in the shower and shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The good - close shave without the blood.  </li>
            <li> It is particularly good in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Keep up the good work, Norelco and thank you.  </li>
            <li> The nivea packs are great idea, if you don&#x27;t like them you can use your own gel/foam.</li>
            <li> A genuinely good shave.   </li>
            <li> The ergonomics are good.  </li>
            <li> Good balance.</li>
            <li> The trimmer angle is good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a remarkably good shave.  </li>
            <li> Really good piece of electronics.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> To get a really good shave with this razor, you have to use it for 21 days, as the manual will tell, to let your skin get used to it.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge is good for 10 days to two weeks, and it gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I must comment you must use the plastic strap and hang it on something, because dropping the shaver in the tub is a good chance that a repair/replacement will be required.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> I have loved this razor even though within one month the blades had problems</li>
            <li> I have used a wet/dry shaver for over 10 years, from Panasonic foil (which cut my face)to Remingtom (no longer available) to Norelco (the best).</li>
            <li> He says it is the best shaver he has ever had and the cool skin additive helps to give him as close a shave as did the razor.</li>
            <li> The nivea packets make this shaver perfect for a quick nonirritating shave.  </li>
            <li> This is the closest and best shave that I have ever gotten with a Norelco Electric Razor in nearly 25 years of shaving!!!!!  </li>
            <li> You need to use the Nevea gel/lotion a bit more and it works great.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for more than a year now and it works great.</li>
            <li> , YOU CANNOT GET A CLOSER SHAVE EVEN WITH A RAZOR&amp;gt; BUY THIS, YOU WILL BE HAPPY AND GLAD THAT</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver, certainly the best electric i have used.</li>
            <li> Hi, &lt;br /&gt;I never used an electric shaver before, but I decided to try this one, and It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This is especially useful</li>
            <li> gel dispenser is kind of a novelty item.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Quality of Shave:  The closeness of the shave is AS GOOD any electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, but not appreciably any BETTER.  </li>
            <li> I used to own the lower model lotion shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you, this is the absolute best Electric Razor Norelco makes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 10 days and am loving it.  </li>
            <li> It is just as effective.</li>
            <li> good product; it gives a pretty close shave, the best i have gotten from an electric razor, and i love being able to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of shaving is great, really clean and close.</li>
            <li> good buy if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, good shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, gets very close to as good a shave as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is very easy</li>
            <li> but it is clearly the best shaver I ever had, and at this price ($99) - a bargain.</li>
            <li> Good fit in my hand.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a light beard, but I could do this if I did a good job with a razor.</li>
            <li> I own a Spectra 8894XL Top Of The Line  Norelco Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly the best electric/battery operated shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to stand, shivering, in front of the bathroom mirror waiting for the sink water to get warm, you&#x27;re already nice and comfortable in the shower and you just rub the thing over your face while you stand there.</li>
            <li> Its best to use some Edge Shaving Gel with this electric razor to really get a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Norelcos gave a good shave, but they were a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li> Both were good, but they can&#x27;t match the Cool Skin for closeness and speed.</li>
            <li> Very, very comfortable shave,</li>
            <li> My skin felt very smooth after the shave.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> The attachable sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a very good job in my opinion, but I kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> but if I had to do it over again I probably wouldn&#x27;t spring for the top of the line model.  </li>
            <li> this seems to have to many flashing lights and settings</li>
            <li> A shaver to be used in and out of the shower should be more durable in my opinion.</li>
            <li> charger could be better but it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Norelco shavers over the years and this one was the best yet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely the best eletric I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> , this used to take the majority of my precious minutes in the morning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, I thought that the Mach 3 may have done a better job in getting a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> He loves the fact that you can use it in the shower, it gives him a really good shave, and he says it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> For me, that says more about the shaver than anything else could.</li>
            <li> This razor is so much better; the heads have much more flexibility and I am able to get a much better, quicker shave.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed how close the shave is, actually, in his case,  better than with the blade.</li>
            <li> Never did that before.  :-)</li>
            <li> I hav oily skin and find I get a better shave before washing my face rather than afterwards.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to do that with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> IT TAKES MORE TIME TO SHAVE WITH THIS PRODUCT VS</li>
            <li> so make sure you slip the wrist strap on while shaving.  </li>
            <li> The shave is as smooth as a razor!</li>
            <li> Fortunately they&#x27;re 5 minutes of standing under the water, kind of spaced out, and shaving.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d pay more than $40 for shaving equipment.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll shave more often.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The shaving head is flexibly designed to be able to shave any face contours.</li>
            <li> It seems to do better with shorter whiskers.  </li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> Well, maybe I don&#x27;t LOVE it, but</li>
            <li> I sure like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> For me, the monthly cost of the Braun cleaning solution was more than the cost of the Nivea gel cartridges.</li>
            <li> Everything else is top notch.  </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li> fact, it&#x27;s better than a blade.</li>
            <li> I hope to have this one for many years.    </li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver for my head.  </li>
            <li> I also find the lotion much better than the gel.  </li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s website claims the 7775X to be their \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; lotion-dispensing razor.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is like a blade, but I believe this product shaves faster than the Braun and Panasonic and is more thorough.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li> The charging stand is cheap and you can knock the shaver off of it very easily &lt;</li>
            <li> That said, this one does pretty good.  </li>
            <li> it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I find myself shaving more often than I did with a blade just because it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep it in top working order.   </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> shaver really works great and its great to be able to shave daily without irritation instead of skipping days to let my face heal.</li>
            <li> Nivea is fine; the Clearasil works much better for me.   </li>
            <li> I even used it once when my water pump quit on me and without water it worked fine just using more lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was very sweet.</li>
            <li> instead I&#x27;m using a regular shaving gel and the shaving is very good for me.</li>
            <li> The wet shave is totaly the best.</li>
            <li> too\\&quot; to what I consider to be the most important points.    </li>
            <li> the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as close as a Mach 3 when you shave in the direction of the grain, but much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> While it does a great job of cleaning, keep  in mind that the cleaning and drying process takes over an hour, and it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> The shaving gel provided made it a lot more comfortable than I&#x27;ve gotten used to.</li>
            <li> The Nivea gel packs are easy to use and work well</li>
            <li> /rinses easily, so</li>
            <li> The gel and lotion packs are a neat idea and are very convenient, but they are exceptionally pricey.  </li>
            <li> Easy glide over face, neck, chin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a easy 5 star from me.</li>
            <li> Also, I was impressed how it quickly and easily removed the whiskers with minor irritation.</li>
            <li> would recommend that you keep you unit clean and charged as required and most importantly change the shaver heads once a year, as recommended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try it in shower yet but it will be just fine.  </li>
            <li> Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this was the best thing.</li>
            <li> OK, quick summary -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean, charges fast, and holds a charge for a pretty good length of time (probably about 45 minutes or so of shaving time).    </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more fun than pressing the button and the gel washes off easily from the shaver and skin.</li>
            <li> pricing is a little tricky - i think this shaver has been on the market for some time but your best bet is on amazon trust me..</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I have to say that it shave very well.</li>
            <li> keep away from these machines and have a smooth, healtier face.</li>
            <li> Being a soldier, you must be squared away from head to feet, the mornings are always pressed for time and this shaver has defintely made them run mre smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Hope Norelco is looking at this site for improvements to the follow-on models because with a few tweaks this thing could be just about perfect.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He is getting a smooth shave with every use.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels and works cheap.</li>
            <li> The gel packs work, but also seem cheap.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy the display lights that tell you what is going on with the shaver.</li>
            <li> That depends on what&#x27;s important to you.</li>
            <li> Really easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> is more than worth the $100 or so that it costs.</li>
            <li> I use it with  my regular shaving gel, works great.</li>
            <li> Actually, I used it for almost a month before I was happy with the shave.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, you don&#x27;t NEED to use the cleaner after every use (or at all for that metter).</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and neat to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates ease of use and great features.</li>
            <li> It just means that if you have a light beard like me, you will still have to shave every day (when I shaved with a razor I could go a couple of days between shaves)  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, shaves close and comfortable</li>
            <li> The shave in the shower just using regular foam is great.</li>
            <li> But this razor has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use the Nivea, or as I do, use a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Just a light touch gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li> -- and far superior to the Spectra.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with my new 7775X.</li>
            <li> The shaver rolls around in it and you have to make sure it&#x27;s positioned right so that the connection is made.</li>
            <li> it is very lightweight the charge stays on very long works excellent in the water as you shower.</li>
            <li> The Clearasil is much more slippery and enables the razor to move around easily without pushing and pulling your skin nearly as much as the Nivea.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Cool Skin is not as comfortable a shave as the Spectra unless I have shaving cream on the area where I am shaving.</li>
            <li> thing I have to add is that, while the little Nivea packs are okay, I&#x27;ve found a product that I greatly prefer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much faster and more comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> Still getting adjusted to the shaver, but so far am very impressed by the close cut and extra smoothness</li>
            <li> I still have it the original \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; model before the cool skin series came out..</li>
            <li> liked the moisturizing lotion better than the extra fresh gel.  </li>
            <li> decided to go all out this time and got the 7775X Cool Skin whateveritscalled.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a week and returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Its claim of shaving as close as a blade is true.</li>
            <li> At a full charge, it will get me through ONE shave.  </li>
            <li> He has used these razors with the Cool Skin Gel/Lotion for years, and he loves them.</li>
            <li> Spectra 8894XL can&#x27;t even come close to giving me the shave that I get with the Cool Skin Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li> The Spectra takes me 7 or 8 minutes to shave and it&#x27;s still not as close as the Cool Skin</li>
            <li> It leaves your  face feeling smooth and it really gives you a  smooth, close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the dispenser doesn&#x27;t work that good.</li>
            <li> The wife agrees, and if that isn&#x27;t good enough..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> In spite of the people who say this sucks for your face, this is because of the lack of oxygen in the brain from shaveing there head to close, they probably shave their brains out of the head, but the truth is, NORELCO IS THE BEST SHAVIENG SYSTEM YOU CAN PURCHASE</li>
            <li> This is true in all aspects but one: the choice of batteries.</li>
            <li> With shaving cream the Cool Skin just glides.</li>
            <li> (The trimmer on the Cool Skin must be attached.)</li>
            <li> Some people have written that the razor is a bit slippery, which is true, but mine has never fallen out of my hands.</li>
            <li> I also find rotary to be superior to foil for my facial hair, and this shaver meets my needs.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the Norelco 7775 Cool Skin shaver.</li>
            <li> It gives a good overall shave.</li>
            <li> Which is fine if you&#x27;re shaving before showering, but kind of gross when you have your clothes on.</li>
            <li> For example I find myself shaving quickly before my wife comes home.  </li>
            <li> just a quick &amp;quot;going over&amp;quot; all over my head every morning in the shower</li>
            <li> I like the quick 1-hour charge a lot.  </li>
            <li> The shave was quick -- not because I was in a hurry.</li>
            <li> no cuts, irritation from the the very first shave.</li>
            <li> I mostly end up using my normal shaving gel (Edge).</li>
            <li> If I shave at night after shaving in the morning, it is pretty darn smooth.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaver is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> The Nivea product is good for my dry face.  </li>
            <li> The zipper case is nice, but kind of small.</li>
            <li> It takes your face a few days to get used to an electric shaver and you might not think it works very well, but after the first week it will give you the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li> He has a very tough beard and was extremely satisfied with and impressed with how easily and thoroughly it worked after a couple of days growth, better than any other shaver he has ever used.  </li>
            <li> I use this shaver everyday and it works great.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and very close.</li>
            <li> Just hang on - don&#x27;t drop it as it&#x27;s kind of fragile.</li>
            <li> message display provides a good status of the shaver to include the battery charge which the old unit did not indicate until it was near depleted.</li>
            <li> then the rinse indicator is useful.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Even in a combat zone, we must be freshly shaved.  </li>
            <li> I get a better shave with an old Sensor II Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> You will also get a closer shave if you shave more frequently.  </li>
            <li> I apply my old shaving cream instead of the provided gel from the pouches, is more convinient that way.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves it and searches far and wide for the lotion packets it requires,  It gives an awesome shave.  </li>
            <li> He was so happy to find one, and it became an early birthday present for him.  </li>
            <li> but if your looking for a shave on the drive to work this might not be the right one.  </li>
            <li> but that went away once I began using it in the shower where I could rinse right away.  </li>
            <li> Yep, you heard me right... for my head.  </li>
            <li> It is also much easier to clean and the battery charge is longer and quicker to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor if you like the in-shower shave.</li>
            <li> Both still work fine and just need new blade replacements..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Phillips has produced an absolute gem of a shaver with this Norelco Cool Skin.</li>
            <li> The Cool Skin is much closer.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to it you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s just as good as shaving down or with the grain.</li>
            <li> I typically use this shaver in the shower, and have noticed that if you wash your face first, it takes more of the Cool Skin creme to give a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> Lotion packs last about 2 weeks, yielding a smooth, comfortable shave with no shaver rash.</li>
            <li> The gel packs go pretty quickly, but maybe I&#x27;m using too much.  </li>
            <li> pros of this thing are a very COMFORTABLE and QUIET shave, albeit time consuming.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older version of the cool skin models as it would no longer turn off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, quiet and delivers a very close shave that is far more comfortable than any blade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Using it in the shower, I get a very, very close shave with NO irritation and NO razor bumps, no matter how many times I go over the same area  </li>
            <li> Not as thrilled with it as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor makes shaving much easier - shaving in the shower is great - not as close as a regular razor - but close enough.</li>
            <li> Upon impact, the top portion (the grill thing) popped open and a spring popped out.  </li>
            <li> This happened the first week I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is the first razor I have owned which makes shaving &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; pleasurable.  </li>
            <li> I think all the \\&quot;Pros and Cons\\&quot; guys have covered this shaver pretty thoroughly, and I agree with 90% of them.  </li>
            <li> This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve seen someone using.</li>
            <li> The first shave I had redness around my neck just using the Nivea gel included in the box.  </li>
            <li> but now I upgraded to the higher model lotion shaver called the Norelco 7775XL.</li>
            <li> Overall it works better then</li>
            <li> I personally shave without a mirror most times, and at first I couldn&#x27;t even tell when the gel was coming out</li>
            <li> It takes the same time to shave as with a razor and the experience is much more pleasurable.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what Norelco says it does: It shaves as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t believe the Nivea packs are enough shaving gel for keeping the \\&quot;gliding\\&quot; feeling, the 7775x is simply the overall best, closest shaving electric razor out there.  </li>
            <li> I have also found it does better with regular shaving gel (like Edge) than it does with the Nivea pack</li>
            <li> It could be different for you if you use more lotion though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m a blade guy and this was my first try at electric.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for the first timers.</li>
            <li> so I wet my face and put my own shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li> More than 3 or 4 minutes just wasn&#x27;t necessary for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels nice to use a battery-powered razor on a wet face.</li>
            <li> This is the first rotary shaver that I&#x27;ve owned and</li>
            <li> I enjoyed shaving with the &amp;#34;Cool Skin Lotion&amp;#34; but when I ran out I just continued on using regular shaving cream &amp; it works just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll round up just because I&#x27;m a good guy.</li>
            <li> in all a good purchase to replace my Norelco 6735X, which lasted over three years before succumbing to dead [Ni-Cad] batteries...</li>
            <li> The Cool Shave seemed like a great product because you can use it in the shower, or out as long as your face is wet.</li>
            <li> For the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles, dimples and Adam&#x27;s apple cleanly with very little drag.</li>
            <li> I use the Nivea cartridges which easily install in the back of the shaver, and the resulting shave leaves my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes shaving easy, convenient, and even fun -- so much so that, for the first time since I started shaving over twenty years ago, I&#x27;m actually shaving every day.  </li>
            <li> The reason I purchased the new 7775X is because after 7 years of use my 6756X will only hold charge for a few shaves, otherwise works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This style is easy to clean daily, just pop open the head and rinse clean.  </li>
            <li> Even with this disadvantage the Cool Skin is hands down better than the Spectra.</li>
            <li> you never will be able to firmly fix again in the original position.</li>
            <li> So I must say it has held up really well for two years with as much as he has used it!</li>
            <li> The 7775x is truly cool - it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn sensitive skin when used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The 21 day adjustment period is true, and my sensitive neck has cleared up since not using a razor.  </li>
            <li> It looks like it could easily be disconnected allowing the unit to fall and possibly break.</li>
            <li> The grooming attachment is easy to use and actually works really well too.</li>
            <li> And because of the gel system, it&#x27;s also waterproof, meaning you can open it and clean it under running hot water every day.  </li>
            <li> Cool clean shave with mimimum effort,charge lasts a long long time, simple operation, easy clean.</li>
            <li> The Nivea lotion doesn&#x27;t help too much.  </li>
            <li> You have every time -really</li>
            <li> The problem is it isn&#x27;t very durable.  </li>
            <li> The lotion helps so damn much.</li>
            <li> : these toys never ever can replace a real razor.</li>
            <li> A real design flaw.   </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really skip a day or your face will feel like asphalt.  </li>
            <li> This Electric Razor really is Blade Close.  </li>
            <li> It does not put out much gel while you are shaving.  </li>
            <li> I went from using a cheap, one foil Braun model - the only way I had ever shaved - to the Norelco 7775x.  </li>
            <li> I could go on and on about what a difference it is to be able to wet shave, shave in the shower,</li>
            <li> If I wait a whole day, it does not feel as close after a shave.  </li>
            <li> You can go through the Nivea packs extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> While the Panasonic is much louder, it shaved much closer than the Norelco in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I really like this model, because it dispenses shaving gel on your face as you shave, for an effortless shave.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I used a cheap trimmer to shave but that was never that close.  </li>
            <li> They all work reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> but amazon did that so fast and without a problem</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas two years ago (2006) and it has worked really well for him.</li>
            <li> Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is to bulky and it doesn&#x27;t outline very well</li>
            <li> I never used the Nivea refills much.</li>
            <li> The shave was fast and very close -- as close as a blade in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Nivea cartridges from Amazon, and if you purchase enough to receive free shipping, they&#x27;re not very expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small, light weight, and quite easy to use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, the 7775x left my sensitive neck feeling baby smooth and 100% better than my Braun left it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better that the other one that I had which was the entry level one.</li>
            <li> I would rather have seen the permanent trimmer design like most other Norelco&#x27;s have.</li>
            <li> How many other shavers have you seen with a demo mode? &lt;</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a very long time, and the recharge is very quick.</li>
            <li> This is not necessarily bad (they still perform well), but the absence of smart trickle charging forces the user to \\&quot;baby-sit\\&quot; the charging process.</li>
            <li> I called back to complain about the downgrade and they told me that it was an error, that I was supposed to get a new 7775X, but there were none available.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of time and you really enjoy shaving, I guess you might not mind how long it takes.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I received a Norelco Cool Skin for my Birthday.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several norelco cool skin shavers.  </li>
            <li> I like the shaved head thing (better than a crome dome) and tried shaving my head with a blade a few months ago and it was just too much work to shave my whole melon every morning, so I blew it off.  </li>
            <li> After shaving just once with the Cool Skin, I would not go back to the Spectra.</li>
            <li> with refund in hand, I&#x27;m getting ready to buy a new 7775X from Amazon.</li>
            <li> you primarily use the shaver dry</li>
            <li> He had an older Norelco shaver and I saw this and bought it for him.   </li>
            <li> Facial skin is soft and stubble free.   </li>
            <li> Older style</li>
            <li> Third, the lotion/gel samples make the shave live up to its name of Cool Skin -- no razor burn whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver to everyone.</li>
            <li> I just replaced my 5 year old norelco advantage wet dry with the 7775x bought here at amazon and after using it once (after a good week without shaving) its a keeper..</li>
            <li> (I guess those lotion-retaining, guide rings really work!), and can easily go over a week of daily use on a single charge.</li>
            <li> would not recommend suspending the shaver on the supplied plastic hanger strap which is not near as secure as with my old unit.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin in the neck area and this shaver both shaves well and does not leave much irritation.</li>
            <li> They put the gel device where the trimmer normally goes</li>
            <li> You will waste alot more water in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Now that the whiskers are mostly gray, you can&#x27;t tell for a few days if I shaved or not, so closeness is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> Doing so should provide the same long live and close shave as I have enjoyed over the years.</li>
            <li> However, my skin is just the opposite - baby face red blush, easy to cut.  </li>
            <li> I was offered a choice of a dry shaver, a set of accessories for the 7735X, or a full refund.</li>
            <li> One day I am shaving fine and the battery is almost full the next day it is dead and won&#x27;t respond to anything.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, a new Norelco 7735X came to my door.</li>
            <li> For me and the ammount of lotion I use it is cheaper to buy lotion cartridges than new mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li> The status lights are a nice touch, but reminders to dispense lotion and rinse afterwards are redundant; especially for users already familiar with these wet razors.</li>
            <li> I like that wet clean shave</li>
            <li> They are relatively expensive in most sources (including here at Amazon) but are available at the world&#x27;s largest retailer in a box of 5 for $4.94.  </li>
            <li> I bought the one with all of the warning lights, like charging, how much time until charging ends, indicators, and how much shave time left.</li>
            <li> They are a good idea, but they run out too fast and are expensive.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years I used the top of the line Panasonic wet-dry shaver.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t like it at first, give it some time and try different shaving methods.    </li>
            <li> Firstly, I think Nivea is the only shaving gel provided.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about the effectiveness of the dispensible lotion, I use shaving cream and get a close and consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> Its said that the skin needs about three weeks to get use to an electric shanver, but with the Norelco 7775X, it took only the first shave.</li>
            <li> They are pretty equal.</li>
            <li> As with any new shaving technique, you will need to experiment a bit to find out what works at what doesn&#x27;t as far as direction of motion, amount of pressure, and the like.  </li>
            <li> I live near Baton Rouge, LA.  </li>
            <li> I sent it back for a full refund (60 days money back guarantee!).</li>
            <li> Due to the gel/lotion it feels cool and does not cut or irritate.</li>
            <li> I have been a norelco user for 10 years now-- love the wet dry shaving system...</li>
            <li> I just now replaced my old one</li>
            <li> you travel frequently like I do.</li>
            <li> and though I haven&#x27;t thrown my mach 3 away, this is defintely my first choice and will be for a long time.</li>
            <li> Tried this Norelco and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> so well I convinced my 50 year old dad (lifetime blade user) to start using it and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> After about 5 years I decided it was time to upgrade from my old 6756X and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Shaving near either doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Combined with the short motor run time per charge, that&#x27;s a real issue.  </li>
            <li> WHERE NEAR A CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li> (Some of the foil shavers I use to use took nearly 30 minutes).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The only downside is the shaving cartriges run fast.</li>
            <li> , you press the button to open up the shaver head and then pull straight out away from the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensative skin and when using a regular razor or a mach 3</li>
            <li> it gives me so far.  </li>
            <li> like I had to with my old razor.  </li>
            <li> 7775X has a lot more bells and whistles but its motor is not strong enough to completely shave my neck.  </li>
            <li> I got it from QVC for less than $100.00 on special.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and rather quick to use and the charge seems to hold for a long time.</li>
            <li> (I will qualify that by saying that this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in the shower, so as far as that type of shaving goes, my experience is limited.)  </li>
            <li> As a dry shaver, the Norelco works pretty well.</li>
            <li> and I shave with the Cool Skin in half the time.  </li>
            <li> Norelco markets this Cool Skin with the phrase \\&quot;close as a blade with less irritation.\\</li>
            <li> The only mild complaint he has is regarding some missing hairs in the neck (but he points out all shavers have the same problem), but the quality of the shave in general is really amazing!</li>
            <li> I use to have an older model of this same shaver but had to replace it when it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore</li>
            <li> PROS: close shave; less skin irritation and no cut; quick charging;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have had my new 7775X shaver for a short time, it seems to provide as close a shave as my old unit.</li>
            <li> Yeah, a blade might be closer if I spent half an hr., but this one is quicker and has better aerial coveragee.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems or failures with this or my first Norelco wet shaver I bought.</li>
            <li> When his razor broke, he was devastated, and only Amazon had a new one for us to purchase.  </li>
            <li> Plus it seems to make it easier to find quickly those few whiskers you may have missed.  </li>
            <li> Their is no other shaver.  </li>
            <li> I got the results I was looking for along with major neck irritation.  </li>
            <li> this is the highest model lotion shaver and it is UNBELIEVABLE!! :-)</li>
            <li> First, Norelco still has one of the most inconvenient methods of cleaning I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li> and I could barely see the LED indicators.</li>
            <li> My face, especially my neck, is really sensitive</li>
            <li> I use it as a dry shaver a lot and still get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I actually use a blade to completely remove my beard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 7775X has a more secure changing base than the old unit (deeper).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK, definitely not great.</li>
            <li> At the time of this writing, the shaver was so new, the repair center didn&#x27;t have parts, and Norelco completely replaced the one that broke when it fell off the shelf in the shower.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me preface this review by saying I have very curly hair and have been prone to serious pseudofolliculitis barbae or razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> and I often get razor burn if I am not very careful</li>
            <li> I bought a Norelco to my husband after searching online for a several weeks, and after reading some reviews I finally decided for Norelco, altough the price is higher than other brands.</li>
            <li> When I first used this shaver there were a few things I had to learn.  </li>
            <li> The first shave with it was a little different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more delicate than other regular Norelco electric razors.</li>
            <li> In a pinch, I will still use my Spectra 8894XL, but in the mean time I&#x27;m sticking with my Cool Skin.  </li>
            <li> I shipped it off (at their expense) and used my old Norelco dry shaver while I waited.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have extremely sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I expect it will provide the same long life service and close shave that my old unit did.</li>
            <li> My first was the 6756X Advantage which I still use occasionally, followed a few years later with a Norelco 8894XL Spectra.</li>
            <li> It was time for a change and my skin is too sensitive for regular dry shavers</li>
            <li> It is not to hard to change out with the right tools (a number 7 (I think)</li>
            <li> The fact that I&#x27;ve had bad luck and am still willing to come back to this product may be interpreted as a strong endorsement--with the caveat about using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I also think the shaver is well constructed and should last a long time if properly cared for.</li>
            <li> Using it as a wet shaver, I no longer have trouble shaving my neck, or shaving when it is hot or humid.</li>
            <li> I got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks, but I think I was pressing too hard</li>
            <li> I think its time and with the costly replacement heads getting harder and harder to find I think I will upgrade to the new 8020x model at the end of the year..</li>
            <li> And, the Clearasil covers your entire shaving job in an instant and stays in place (unless your face is directly in the water stream, of course), so you don&#x27;t have to keep pushing the little Nivea button.  </li>
            <li> only one, because I will never do it again- to dismount the heads block and install a strange tools).</li>
            <li> reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a long time user of Norelco shavers, but switched to a blade since I couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> You have to put it on separately (but it is included), which is only a minor pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who says otherwise probably hasn&#x27;t given it the money back guarantee time for the skin to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not quite as close as a blade, but with a beard as heavy as mine (&amp; with sensitive skin to boot), who cares?!</li>
            <li> So, overall, the extra touches don&#x27;t mean much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually dropped mine, so I can&#x27;t confirm or deny whether it breaks as easily as others have said it does, but the shaver does look a little delicate, so being careful is probably prudent.    </li>
            <li> once I tried this Norelco (on my face) and was ready to send it back because it SUCKS</li>
            <li> Actually, I like the trimmer other than the fact that I can&#x27;t trim on the same charge as shaving.</li>
            <li> How about people with a small hot water tank and other people that need the shower in the morining?  </li>
            <li> There is only one weak point to this shaver and it is the little button which holds the flip top down.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco is much quieter but not quite as close a shave at least on my beard.</li>
            <li> Norelco in the long run saves you money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These shavers have come a long way from the ones I used to remember.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the cartridges that you attach in the back of these wet shavers, I use a non-foaming shave gel (e.g. King of Shaves).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this shaver long</li>
            <li> It takes a LONG time to shave your face with this thing.  </li>
            <li> Some minor design flaws.  </li>
            <li> I have to let it sit on the battery charger for a long time for it to even recognize it.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take too long...</li>
            <li> I can personally attest that the blades are as sharp, if not sharper, than a razor blade.</li>
            <li> Also the recharger is pretty weak.  </li>
            <li> I can only shave every other day or my face is a wreck.  </li>
            <li> at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy or Walmart gives you the same quality  as little five Nivea 0.4 oz.</li>
            <li> well it does not look to be as durable as my older advantage -- the advantage was hard non slip plastic</li>
            <li> You can go dry or use the gel it comes with.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this shaver for dry shaving except in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower with shaving cream and never use it dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a single compaint about this shaver.</li>
            <li> The shave is about as close as a single blade not at all as close as Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to be a die hard mach 3 user, but the 7775X is my new goto.  </li>
            <li> caution new users to watch out for the blades around the mustache area as they will pierce the lip if you press to hard.  </li>
            <li> The only down side of this razor is the trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> However, the next day proved that not to be the case as I had much less hair growth.  </li>
            <li> The bigggest disappointment is the EXTREMELY short duration of motor run time per full charge.</li>
            <li> It is actually costing me less to use this shaver than the Braun.</li>
            <li> Norelco does admit that you&#x27;ll get a closer shave using it as a wet shaver; I haven&#x27;t tried it as a dry shaver</li>
            <li> I need 2-3 days growth to get a good clean face without cutting the crap out of it.    </li>
            <li> It just seems to provide a little extra lubrication).  </li>
            <li> Second, you don&#x27;t have to press hard to get it to work -- just keep passing it over any area of your skin requiring extra attention</li>
            <li> The plastic and general building feel cheaper rather than the past.</li>
            <li> My purchasing in/out of shower shavers is to have the ability to always use it wet and with some type of cream or gel.</li>
            <li> But, my hand was wet and it slipped out of my hand dropping about 8\\&quot; onto my counter.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that over the next few days my skin will adjust.   </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use it wet.</li>
            <li> Pressing the button does release a pea sized drop of gel, but you&#x27;re already all wet, so who needs it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten, with absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> The noise is noticeable but minimal</li>
            <li> I put it all over my face and wet the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using the gel - it&#x27;s expensive and doesn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver to anyone who uses a shaver instead of blades and recommend anyone having even the least trouble using a dry shaver to try this wet shaver.</li>
            <li> It is flimsy and I am never certain the razor will stay in the holder.  </li>
            <li> It charges in less than an hour, yet I found I could shave for a month on a single charge.</li>
            <li> It does shave as close a a regular razor but with very little irratation.</li>
            <li> Left uncut, I have a beard that would make the Taliban religious police jealous - thick, full, and hard to cut - no wimpy peach fuzz here.  </li>
            <li> ,I use it every other day in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had used a Norelco in the past with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first, but now am a believer.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have covered just about everything that I would have to say, so let me just add a \\&quot;me,</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all other reviewers who helped me to go with Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other shavers that would get me through three shaves</li>
            <li> any other I have tryed.</li>
            <li> For lather, I simply used a small amount of hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I had only minor irritation around the neck area and few nicks because of the small hair bumps on my lower neck.</li>
            <li> I have used the Panasonic on one side of my face and the Norelco on the other.</li>
            <li> , it is heavy and bigger than the past models (About 5 years ago models).</li>
            <li> I loosened the screws on the back and let the water drain out, but it was already too late, the insides were rusted to bits.</li>
            <li> It takes approximately 50% longer to shave my face with this shaver than it did with my old Braun.</li>
            <li> But the motor starts slowing down before I finish.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some Neutragena shaving creme that prevents afterburn, and applied heavily in the shower I have very minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> It was an upgrade to replace his previous Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am using this shaver the time is cut in half</li>
            <li> and it takes less then 10 minutes for both.</li>
            <li> I personally would waste 5 minutes standing under the water being spaced out and trying to wake up anyways, so at least now I&#x27;m being productive.</li>
            <li> a refurbished one for about half price at Goodman&#x27;s - also through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first about this razor since past experiences have taught me about electric razors.</li>
            <li> I have never really enjoyed a wet shave until I got this Razor.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that little compartment that fills up</li>
            <li> I had to settle using the Andis T-Outliner clipper to get a \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with little irritation.  </li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t last very long and they&#x27;re expensive.  </li>
            <li> If you shave in the shower, that&#x27;s a lot of wasted water just standing there shaving.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the shaver at $120 is not cheap.  </li>
            <li> It sounds good but is really annoying and difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I tried using single and triple blade razors but that led to serious irritation and razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a much less irritating shave than the dry one.</li>
            <li> You need to use it almost everyday, otherwise its bit tough for long beards.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy, thick, dark beard and unlike with the Spectra, I don&#x27;t even get a shadow in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin raw or irritated if used in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I no longer breakout from irritation and no longer have a raw neck.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco in the past.  </li>
            <li> (The sideburns tools is not in the rear of the razor as usual in the Norelco/Philips, because there is the cream dispenser instead.</li>
            <li> I have been an exclusive Norelco shaver user for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> No more worries about having my shaving cream confiscated.</li>
            <li> The process includes a faucet wash of the razor after every use and I usually have to rinse my face off, but there is no issue with that for me because I have to go brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to buy this shaver or any electric shaver for that matter, as I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the shaver but the battery is the worst I have ever dealt with.</li>
            <li> When I shave at home, I just use regular shave gel with it to preserve the expensive cartridge-based lubricants.</li>
            <li> usually using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the &#x27;stash &amp; sideburns while showering.</li>
            <li> Small complaint that doesn&#x27;t remove any ratings stars.</li>
            <li> and now I hardly use any at all.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t drop it on a hard surface and let it hit on this one piece.  </li>
            <li> , I had a hard time seeing around it to shape my mustache and goatee.</li>
            <li> I hardly look at any of them except the shave time and charging time.</li>
            <li> have a tough beard and it grows in different directions making it difficult even with a blade.  </li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer who complained about the recharger.  </li>
            <li> adds at least 5 minutes to the act of showering.  </li>
            <li> Now in within 7 months I have had the battery die twice when it had at least 75 % battery indicator.  </li>
            <li> I find they last about 10 days if you don&#x27;t go crazy pressing the button for lotion.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t have the closeness of a blade, at least go for the fastest shaver.  </li>
            <li> (2) the trimmer works extremely well, but it&#x27;s annoying that you need to switch the trimmer head with the regular head (and carry it around separately as well).</li>
            <li> you fully dismount the head (kept in position with 2 very small clips on the side)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and hate shaving.</li>
            <li> but I was little skeptical about the \\&quot;close-as-a-blade\\&quot; claim.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a problem as the Norelco had a difficult time shaving small hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I usually pump the gel out onto my fingertips and spread it on my face that way because it&#x27;s too time consuming and uncomfortable to spread it with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> but hopefully no one is THAT naive!   </li>
            <li> However, I have grown tired of purchasing the expensive blades and of the irritation of using blades.  </li>
            <li> Game over!  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a Panasonic Vortex and the results were terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is really difficult to shave my lower neck area without the razor pinching me and (2)</li>
            <li> , the refills are difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I found the Nivea dispenser on the shaver difficult to use</li>
            <li> three major annoyances: (1) you can&#x27;t plug the shaver in without the base, which means you gotta carry around the base and cord with you everywhere.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a bit of a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> ;  He doesn&#x27;t know what he will do if and when this one goes bad.  </li>
            <li> I bought a can of Nivea for Men and just lather up my face and forget about the stupid on board gel release.  </li>
            <li> The gel packs are stupid.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the trimmer, either, but I can see how having to change the attachment would be annoying, as others have reported.    </li>
            <li> I hate when electric razors tout they give shaves as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who is used to a Mach3 or Quatro &amp;quot;blade&amp;quot; shave is going to HATE this shaver...</li>
            <li> THIS IS A HORRIBLE EXAMPLE OF AN ELECTRIC SHAVER.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS DEFINITELY A HORRIBLE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I had to return it once for the blades sticking and making an awful noise</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using mine for about two weeks.  It is the closest shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor.  You have to use it with the gell or shaving cream to get a close shave.  It is quiet and rather quick to use and the charge seems to hold for a long time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get under the chin well at all even with shaving cream or gell.  I shave my cheeks with the electric and use a regular razor to finish under my chin.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been one of life&#x27;s unpleasantries for me.  Left uncut, I have a beard that would make the Taliban religious police jealous - thick, full, and hard to cut - no wimpy peach fuzz here.  However, my skin is just the opposite - baby face red blush, easy to cut.  Shaving hasd always been a battle between the bloodbath (blade) and the sandpaper mask (electric razor). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I decided to go all out this time and got the 7775X Cool Skin whateveritscalled.  OK, quick summary - it works!  Especially in the shower.  Yeah, a blade might be closer if I spent half an hr., but this one is quicker and has better aerial coveragee. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good - close shave without the blood.  It is particularly good in the shower.  Just hang on - don&#x27;t drop it as it&#x27;s kind of fragile. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bad - it&#x27;s a gadget, you have to read the instructions.  The Nivea lotion doesn&#x27;t help too much.  It&#x27;s more delicate than other regular Norelco electric razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a gift for my son.  He absolutely love it.  He says it is the best shaver he has ever had and the cool skin additive helps to give him as close a shave as did the razor. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> As a dry shaver, the Norelco works pretty well. Not as thrilled with it as a wet shaver. Uses too much gel and has problems missing stray hairs.</li>
            <li> This razor makes shaving much easier - shaving in the shower is great - not as close as a regular razor - but close enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco 7775X Shaver for my son for a Christmas present.  It was an upgrade to replace his previous Norelco.  He has a very tough beard and was extremely satisfied with and impressed with how easily and thoroughly it worked after a couple of days growth, better than any other shaver he has ever used.  He also enjoys the in/out of shower feature offered with this product.  My father, my husband and now my son have all used Norelco shavers and the name and reputation have withstood the test of time.  Keep up the good work, Norelco and thank you.  Barbara S. of Wilmington, De</li>
            <li> I have been using this type razor for about 6 years now.  I just now replaced my old one but even it was still working.  I highly recommend this razor but if I had to do it over again I probably wouldn&#x27;t spring for the top of the line model.  It doesn&#x27;t work any better that the other one that I had which was the entry level one.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco in the past.  Their is no other shaver.  The wet shave is totaly the best. Norelco in the long run saves you money.  It lasts longer and replacemint blades etc. last longer.  Just total QUALITY.</li>
            <li> My opinion is no-it-again models with cream dispenser. I sent it back for a full refund (60 days money back guarantee!). &lt;br /&gt;When you fully dismount the head (kept in position with 2 very small clips on the side) you never will be able to firmly fix again in the original position. Try to install the tools for sideburns and then to re-install the head block, you will see! (The sideburns tools is not in the rear of the razor as usual in the Norelco/Philips, because there is the cream dispenser instead. You have every time -really only one, because I will never do it again- to dismount the heads block and install a strange tools). &lt;br /&gt;Also, it is heavy and bigger than the past models (About 5 years ago models). The plastic and general building feel cheaper rather than the past. &lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I have to say that it shave very well. But I think it is not enough for $119,99 at the time of writing!!!</li>
            <li> performance of the shaver is very good. three major annoyances: (1) you can&#x27;t plug the shaver in without the base, which means you gotta carry around the base and cord with you everywhere. bulkiness makes this a pain. (2) the trimmer works extremely well, but it&#x27;s annoying that you need to switch the trimmer head with the regular head (and carry it around separately as well). (3) The hair falls out of the compartment while you shave, so you end up covered in hair. Which is fine if you&#x27;re shaving before showering, but kind of gross when you have your clothes on.</li>
            <li> I have been a norelco user for 10 years now-- love the wet dry shaving system... I just replaced my 5 year old norelco advantage wet dry with the 7775x bought here at amazon and after using it once (after a good week without shaving) its a keeper.. Beware not all norelcos are the same-- get this one -- the lower models do not offer the same comfort they seem to pull ( i returned the 7715) --now pricing is a little tricky - i think this shaver has been on the market for some time but your best bet is on amazon trust me.. &lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that you dont have to use the norelco shaving cream --using regular gel does the trick. &lt;br /&gt; Thinks I dont like--well it does not look to be as durable as my older advantage -- the advantage was hard non slip plastic this is a cheaper grade--also electronics -- this seems to have to many flashing lights and settings (travel lock?)--time will tell if its built to last.</li>
            <li> I have been an exclusive Norelco shaver user for the past 7 years. My first was the 6756X Advantage which I still use occasionally, followed a few years later with a Norelco 8894XL Spectra. Both of these shaver still work well. The reason I purchased the new 7775X is because after 7 years of use my 6756X will only hold charge for a few shaves, otherwise works perfectly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I have had my new 7775X shaver for a short time, it seems to provide as close a shave as my old unit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 7775X has a more secure changing base than the old unit (deeper). &lt;br /&gt;The message display provides a good status of the shaver to include the battery charge which the old unit did not indicate until it was near depleted. &lt;br /&gt;The unit still maintains the shaving cream/gel dispenser. This is especially useful it you travel frequently like I do. No more worries about having my shaving cream confiscated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you primarily use the shaver dry then the rinse indicator is useful. My purchasing in/out of shower shavers is to have the ability to always use it wet and with some type of cream or gel. I find the closeness of the shave is equal to any bladed razor I have ever used, without the nicks and cuts. &lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend suspending the shaver on the supplied plastic hanger strap which is not near as secure as with my old unit. It looks like it could easily be disconnected allowing the unit to fall and possibly break. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with my new 7775X. I expect it will provide the same long life service and close shave that my old unit did. &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you keep you unit clean and charged as required and most importantly change the shaver heads once a year, as recommended. Doing so should provide the same long live and close shave as I have enjoyed over the years. Happy Shaving! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have owned my shaver for 8 days.  It provides the best shave I have ever had from an electric.  The problem is it isn&#x27;t very durable.  I dropped it coming out of the shower this morning from about 4 Ft to the bathroom carpet below.  Game over!  The head assembly came apart and not longer closes.  A shaver to be used in and out of the shower should be more durable in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine for about the last week. I got it from QVC for less than $100.00 on special. I had a regular(dry) Norelco razor for about 2 yrs or so. Stopped using it about 14 months ago. I would use it driving to work. I work from home now. It started ruffing up my face, so I went back to shaving gel and a razor. But I wasn&#x27;t shaving but twice a week. It&#x27;s a pain for me to shave every day, my face can&#x27;t take it. I need 2-3 days growth to get a good clean face without cutting the crap out of it.    I&#x27;m very happy with the 7775X ,I use it every other day in the shower. It came with a shower mirror. The lotion helps so damn much. Won&#x27;t go back to regular razor. If you can afford it get it.     [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for abt 3 months, and I like it. You need to use the Nevea gel/lotion a bit more and it works great. I didn&#x27;t try it in shower yet but it will be just fine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The quality of shaving is great, really clean and close. Due to the gel/lotion it feels cool and does not cut or irritate. You need to use it almost everyday, otherwise its bit tough for long beards. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The charger could be better but it works. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps!</li>
            <li> This electric razor was awesome in the beginning.  But, my hand was wet and it slipped out of my hand dropping about 8\\&quot; onto my counter.  Upon impact, the top portion (the grill thing) popped open and a spring popped out.  This happened the first week I purchased it. [...]</li>
            <li> i bought this from amazon 2 months ago and now it suddenly stopped charging. i dont know what the problem is, and i need to figure out, but besides that i want to say sth: these toys never ever can replace a real razor. after this problem occurred, i switched back to my gillette mac3 and thank God I did. keep away from these machines and have a smooth, healtier face. even if i can repair this one, i will not use it again.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This razor does all that is promised.  It does shave as close a a regular razor but with very little irratation.</li>
            <li> Es una buena afeitadora, yo utilizo un gel diferente al suministrado, me parece mas comodo que el aplicador de la maquina. Pense que mejoraria la calidad de la afeitada respecto a la serie 4000 que yo utilizaba anteriormente. Sin embargo estoy conforme com este nuevo modelo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Norelco shavers over the years and this one was the best yet. It charges in less than an hour, yet I found I could shave for a month on a single charge. Lotion packs last about 2 weeks, yielding a smooth, comfortable shave with no shaver rash. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After using it in the shower for 6 months, I began to notice that it was filling up with water. The display window showed a water line across the middle. I loosened the screws on the back and let the water drain out, but it was already too late, the insides were rusted to bits. The display window turned muddy brown and I could barely see the LED indicators. I charged it one last time and used kept using it. After that, when the charge indicator glowed red the shaver would no longer charge. The shaver was finished. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I called Norelco and they told me it would be covered under warranty. I shipped it off (at their expense) and used my old Norelco dry shaver while I waited. Eventually, a new Norelco 7735X came to my door. I called back to complain about the downgrade and they told me that it was an error, that I was supposed to get a new 7775X, but there were none available. I was offered a choice of a dry shaver, a set of accessories for the 7735X, or a full refund. I chose the refund.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now with refund in hand, I&#x27;m getting ready to buy a new 7775X from Amazon. I&#x27;ll just not use it in the shower. The fact that I&#x27;ve had bad luck and am still willing to come back to this product may be interpreted as a strong endorsement--with the caveat about using it in the shower. That&#x27;s the only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Since I suffer from razor burn, I thought an electric razor with built in lotion would be ideal. I found that it did not give me a close shave and the odor of the lotion was very sweet. I used it for a week and returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  This is the first razor I have owned which makes shaving &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; pleasurable.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shaving gel release button idea.  It sounds good but is really annoying and difficult to use.  I bought a can of Nivea for Men and just lather up my face and forget about the stupid on board gel release.  They put the gel device where the trimmer normally goes so you have to manually put on and take of a detachable trimmer.  A real design flaw.   I would rather have seen the permanent trimmer design like most other Norelco&#x27;s have. Still, no matter, it is the #1 electric razor. It has no competition.</li>
            <li> I have to second the opinion of the below - it&#x27;s definitely the best eletric I&#x27;ve ever used. Its claim of shaving as close as a blade is true. It&#x27;s much faster and more comfortable as well. The Nivea gel packs are easy to use and work well w/ the shaver. &lt;br /&gt;These shavers have come a long way from the ones I used to remember. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This shaver is well worth the money. For the past couple of years I used the top of the line Panasonic wet-dry shaver. It was time for a change and my skin is too sensitive for regular dry shavers so I got norelco 7775x. This thing rocks, no cuts, irritation from the the very first shave. The nivea packs are great idea, if you don&#x27;t like them you can use your own gel/foam. I used it in as well as out of the shower and it works great every day. I highly recommend this shaver to everyone.</li>
            <li> Being a soldier, you must be squared away from head to feet, the mornings are always pressed for time and this shaver has defintely made them run mre smoothly.  Even in a combat zone, we must be freshly shaved.  I used to be a die hard mach 3 user, but the 7775X is my new goto.  My face, especially my neck, is really sensitive and I often get razor burn if I am not very careful, this used to take the majority of my precious minutes in the morning.  Now that I am using this shaver the time is cut in half and I have seen no razor bumbs in weeks.  So for all those mach 3 and nivea users, this is the perfect replacement.  The nivea packets make this shaver perfect for a quick nonirritating shave.  The process includes a faucet wash of the razor after every use and I usually have to rinse my face off, but there is no issue with that for me because I have to go brush my teeth anyway but if your looking for a shave on the drive to work this might not be the right one.  I have had this product for a couple weeks and though I haven&#x27;t thrown my mach 3 away, this is defintely my first choice and will be for a long time.</li>
            <li> I think all the \\&quot;Pros and Cons\\&quot; guys have covered this shaver pretty thoroughly, and I agree with 90% of them.  Hope Norelco is looking at this site for improvements to the follow-on models because with a few tweaks this thing could be just about perfect.  A genuinely good shave.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only thing I have to add is that, while the little Nivea packs are okay, I&#x27;ve found a product that I greatly prefer.  Lather up your face and neck using a pea-sized blob of Clearasil&#x27;s oil-free Daily Face Wash, and then have at it with the Norelco.  The Clearasil is much more slippery and enables the razor to move around easily without pushing and pulling your skin nearly as much as the Nivea.  Plus it seems to make it easier to find quickly those few whiskers you may have missed.  And, the Clearasil covers your entire shaving job in an instant and stays in place (unless your face is directly in the water stream, of course), so you don&#x27;t have to keep pushing the little Nivea button.  Cleans/rinses easily, so no problems with the razor heads. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Nivea is fine; the Clearasil works much better for me.   I use it  to wash my face instead of soap anyway, so it&#x27;s already in the shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco 7775X for my husband.  He had an older Norelco shaver and I saw this and bought it for him.   &lt;br /&gt;He loves it.   &lt;br /&gt;He is getting a smooth shave with every use. Facial skin is soft and stubble free.   &lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend Norelco&#x27;s 7775X for the man in your life.</li>
            <li> I had used a Norelco in the past with mixed results.  I have been using Mach 3 Turbo with excellent results.  However, I have grown tired of purchasing the expensive blades and of the irritation of using blades.  I was encouraged by the reviews and advancements made so I thought to give it another try.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard and it grows in different directions making it difficult even with a blade.  In addition, I have extremely sensitive and dry skin.  I was impressed with the rapid 1 hour charge speed.  Also, I was impressed how it quickly and easily removed the whiskers with minor irritation. &lt;br /&gt;Although, I thought that the Mach 3 may have done a better job in getting a closer shave.  However, the next day proved that not to be the case as I had much less hair growth.  This turned out to be a problem as the Norelco had a difficult time shaving small hair growth.  I persisted and shave again.  I got the results I was looking for along with major neck irritation.  I am hoping that over the next few days my skin will adjust.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I caution new users to watch out for the blades around the mustache area as they will pierce the lip if you press to hard.  I can personally attest that the blades are as sharp, if not sharper, than a razor blade.</li>
            <li> good product; it gives a pretty close shave, the best i have gotten from an electric razor, and i love being able to use it in the shower.  shave lotion packets are a hassle, they don&#x27;t last very long and they&#x27;re expensive.  good buy if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, good shave.</li>
            <li> Still getting adjusted to the shaver, but so far am very impressed by the close cut and extra smoothness you get with the gel. Was skeptical at first, but now am a believer.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver. I don&#x27;t use the cartridges that you attach in the back of these wet shavers, I use a non-foaming shave gel (e.g. King of Shaves). I just put a bit of water and this gel on my skin and start shaving. That&#x27;s more fun than pressing the button and the gel washes off easily from the shaver and skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he LOVES it.  He loves the fact that you can use it in the shower, it gives him a really good shave, and he says it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this shaver long but it is clearly the best shaver I ever had, and at this price ($99) - a bargain. I have sensitive skin in the neck area and this shaver both shaves well and does not leave much irritation. I recently bought a Panasonic Vortex and the results were terrible. I found the various product features to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have covered just about everything that I would have to say, so let me just add a \\&quot;me, too\\&quot; to what I consider to be the most important points.    1)  Very, very comfortable shave, the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever had.  (I will qualify that by saying that this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in the shower, so as far as that type of shaving goes, my experience is limited.)  It&#x27;s not as close as a blade -- almost, but not quite.    2)  It&#x27;s very easy to clean, charges fast, and holds a charge for a pretty good length of time (probably about 45 minutes or so of shaving time).    3)  The gel and lotion packs are a neat idea and are very convenient, but they are exceptionally pricey.  They&#x27;re about $1.25 each, and they last only about a week.  I do use them when I travel for the convenience, but at home, I use regular shaving gel, and I encourage you to try the same.  It saves a lot of money.    4)  As with any new shaving technique, you will need to experiment a bit to find out what works at what doesn&#x27;t as far as direction of motion, amount of pressure, and the like.  They do say in the manual that you should give it three weeks, so if you don&#x27;t like it at first, give it some time and try different shaving methods.    5)  I&#x27;ve never actually dropped mine, so I can&#x27;t confirm or deny whether it breaks as easily as others have said it does, but the shaver does look a little delicate, so being careful is probably prudent.    6)  I don&#x27;t use the trimmer, either, but I can see how having to change the attachment would be annoying, as others have reported.    All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the shaver.  It makes shaving easy, convenient, and even fun -- so much so that, for the first time since I started shaving over twenty years ago, I&#x27;m actually shaving every day.  For me, that says more about the shaver than anything else could.</li>
            <li> I was a blade user that wanted a quicker shave. Tried this Norelco and was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve used this for more than a year now and it works great. I use it as a dry shaver a lot and still get a decent shave. It works so well I convinced my 50 year old dad (lifetime blade user) to start using it and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> After about 5 years I decided it was time to upgrade from my old 6756X and decided to give this one a try. This razor is so much better; the heads have much more flexibility and I am able to get a much better, quicker shave. It is also much easier to clean and the battery charge is longer and quicker to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor if you like the in-shower shave.</li>
            <li> I bought a Norelco to my husband after searching online for a several weeks, and after reading some reviews I finally decided for Norelco, altough the price is higher than other brands. This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve seen someone using. &lt;br /&gt;It is small, light weight, and quite easy to use. You can go dry or use the gel it comes with. I am really impressed how close the shave is, actually, in his case,  better than with the blade. The only mild complaint he has is regarding some missing hairs in the neck (but he points out all shavers have the same problem), but the quality of the shave in general is really amazing! &lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all other reviewers who helped me to go with Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and here is my take on it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:  &lt;br /&gt;1. I get a better shave with an old Sensor II Gillette razor. &lt;br /&gt;2. I agree with another reviewer who complained about the recharger.  It is flimsy and I am never certain the razor will stay in the holder.  It looks and feels and works cheap. &lt;br /&gt;3. I have a handlebar moustache and sideburns.  Shaving near either doesn&#x27;t work.  Nor does the trimmer attachment work for me.  I end up cleaning up with my trusty blade. &lt;br /&gt;4. The gel packs work, but also seem cheap.  I mostly end up using my normal shaving gel (Edge). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;1. I like the fact that I can use it wet. &lt;br /&gt;2. The charge lasts a very long time, and the recharge is very quick. &lt;br /&gt;3. It is very convenient to use.  I find myself shaving more often than I did with a blade just because it is easy to use.  For example I find myself shaving quickly before my wife comes home.  Never did that before.  :-) &lt;br /&gt;4. The ergonomics are good.  Good fit in my hand. Good balance. Easy glide over face, neck, chin. &lt;br /&gt;5. I hav oily skin and find I get a better shave before washing my face rather than afterwards. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  I like the thing and decided to keep it, but I will be darned if I know why.  Oh, and I just truned 67 and haven&#x27;t had an electric razor since the 60&#x27;s. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This shaver is a bit of a disappointment.  Based on the price and the reviews, I was expecting a really GREAT shaver.  I give it three stars for \\&quot;mediocre.\\&quot; It&#x27;s just OK, definitely not great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charging:  At a full charge, it will get me through ONE shave.  But the motor starts slowing down before I finish.  I&#x27;ve had other shavers that would get me through three shaves so I could leave my charger at home for short weekend trips.  I won&#x27;t be able to do that with this shaver.  I can&#x27;t even use the trimmer on the same charge as shaving.  The bigggest disappointment is the EXTREMELY short duration of motor run time per full charge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving:  It takes a LONG time to shave your face with this thing.  Combined with the short motor run time per charge, that&#x27;s a real issue.  If you have a lot of time and you really enjoy shaving, I guess you might not mind how long it takes.  I&#x27;m usually in a hurry.  It takes approximately 50% longer to shave my face with this shaver than it did with my old Braun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The gel dispenser is kind of a novelty item.  I usually pump the gel out onto my fingertips and spread it on my face that way because it&#x27;s too time consuming and uncomfortable to spread it with the shaver.  When I use up the gel that came with it, I&#x27;ll probably just use something else after that.  Don&#x27;t buy it based on the gel pump.  It&#x27;s no biggie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pros of this thing are a very COMFORTABLE and QUIET shave, albeit time consuming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quality of Shave:  The closeness of the shave is AS GOOD any electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, but not appreciably any BETTER.  Definitely not as close as a blade, but hopefully no one is THAT naive!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:  The trimmer angle is good.  Actually, I like the trimmer other than the fact that I can&#x27;t trim on the same charge as shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably keep using this thing since I&#x27;ve already bought it.  But if I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d choose something else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My husband is perfectly happy with this product.  He has used these razors with the Cool Skin Gel/Lotion for years, and he loves them.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A HORRIBLE EXAMPLE OF AN ELECTRIC SHAVER.  IT HAS TORN MY FACE APART AND LEAVES ME WITH A\\&quot;5 O CLOCK\\&quot; SHADOW BY LUNCH.  NO WHERE NEAR A CLOSE SHAVE. IT TAKES MORE TIME TO SHAVE WITH THIS PRODUCT VS A MANUAL SHAVER, I.E.  ANY GILLETTE PRODUCT.  I AM PROBABLY GOING TO SEND IT BACK TO NORELCO, PROBABLY WON&#x27;T GET MY MONEY BACK, BUT THEY NEED TO KNOW THIS IS DEFINITELY A HORRIBLE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I was afraid to buy this shaver or any electric shaver for that matter, as I have extremely sensitive skin.  The first shave I had redness around my neck just using the Nivea gel included in the box.  I purchased some Neutragena shaving creme that prevents afterburn, and applied heavily in the shower I have very minimal irritation.  Great product for the price, yet I&#x27;ve heard that it doesn&#x27;t handle impacts well so make sure you slip the wrist strap on while shaving.  I&#x27;ve had no issues to date with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver everyday and it works great. The lotion/gel dispenser works wonderful and the shaver gives me a great shaver, plus it is very nice to be able to just jump in the shower and shave. I also enjoy the display lights that tell you what is going on with the shaver. I use to have an older model of this same shaver but had to replace it when it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore and as you can see I bought the same brand of shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shaver I ever had!! Everything about this shaver works GREAT!! I don&#x27;t have a single compaint about this shaver. I used to own the lower model lotion shaver but now I upgraded to the higher model lotion shaver called the Norelco 7775XL. this is the highest model lotion shaver and it is UNBELIEVABLE!! :-)</li>
            <li> Overall it works better then any other I have tryed. I do my face as well as head and it takes less then 10 minutes for both. (Some of the foil shavers I use to use took nearly 30 minutes).&lt;br /&gt; There is no irritation at all. The shave is as smooth as a razor! Very low noise as well!!&lt;br /&gt; The only downside is the shaving cartriges run fast. 1 only lasts me for 2 days which is about $4 a week. BUT..... you can use any shaving cream you want. (Dosen&#x27;t have to be norelco&#x27;s brand).&lt;br /&gt; Overall it&#x27;s a easy 5 star from me. Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> That depends on what&#x27;s important to you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;1. You can&#x27;t really skip a day or your face will feel like asphalt.  Maybe I have a light beard, but I could do this if I did a good job with a razor. &lt;br /&gt;2. You will waste alot more water in the shower.  Any environmentalists out there?  How about people with a small hot water tank and other people that need the shower in the morining?  I&#x27;d say using this adds at least 5 minutes to the act of showering.  Fortunately they&#x27;re 5 minutes of standing under the water, kind of spaced out, and shaving.  I personally would waste 5 minutes standing under the water being spaced out and trying to wake up anyways, so at least now I&#x27;m being productive. &lt;br /&gt;3. The gel packs are stupid.  Pressing the button does release a pea sized drop of gel, but you&#x27;re already all wet, so who needs it.  I personally shave without a mirror most times, and at first I couldn&#x27;t even tell when the gel was coming out (you don&#x27;t get the sensation of, \\&quot;ooh, that gel feels so good.\\&quot;  It just seems to provide a little extra lubrication).  I went through one of the packets in about two weeks and now I hardly use any at all. &lt;br /&gt;4. Some minor design flaws.  I for one could not figure out how to get the clipper attachment on.  The directions don&#x27;t do a wonderful job explaining, and I thought I was going to break something (To those who haven&#x27;t figured it out, you press the button to open up the shaver head and then pull straight out away from the shaver.  After this you&#x27;ll see how to put the clipper in the same way.).  Also the recharger is pretty weak.  The shaver rolls around in it and you have to make sure it&#x27;s positioned right so that the connection is made. &lt;br /&gt;4. You have to get used to it.  I used it for about a month before I stopped giving myself wicked razor burn on my neck.  Now I&#x27;m as proficient as I ever was with a blade. &lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s never as close as shaving up or against the grain with a blade.  That is definately theclosest shave, but I for one could never do that two days in a row without being in severe pain. &lt;br /&gt;6. It&#x27;s expensive.  I never thought I&#x27;d pay more than $40 for shaving equipment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That might seem like alot of cons, but now for the &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;1. It takes the same time to shave as with a razor and the experience is much more pleasurable.  You don&#x27;t have to stand, shivering, in front of the bathroom mirror waiting for the sink water to get warm, you&#x27;re already nice and comfortable in the shower and you just rub the thing over your face while you stand there. &lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s a remarkably good shave.  Once you get used to it you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s just as good as shaving down or with the grain. &lt;br /&gt;3. You&#x27;ll shave more often.  I for one always skipped days.  Now there&#x27;s no point.  Whenever I shower the thing is staring me in the face so almost always use it. &lt;br /&gt;4. Really good piece of electronics.  This thing has a demo mode and about 12 different signals it can tell you.  How many other shavers have you seen with a demo mode? &lt;br /&gt;5. Really easy to clean.  All you do is rinse it out under the water ever time you use it.  It doesn&#x27;t have that little compartment that fills up and you have to dump it out (this is open and the water rinses it out.  It doesn&#x27;t get all gummed up with hair and shaving cream like razors do.  It always looks pristine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s it, aside from not being as close as shaving up this thing is more than worth the $100 or so that it costs.</li>
            <li> My name is Michael.  I live near Baton Rouge, LA.  I&#x27;m 42 and  I have shaved with Norelco Electric Razors on and off for the last 25 years or so.  I also wrote a review on Norelco Spectra Razors.  Recently, I received a Norelco Cool Skin for my Birthday.  I have never really enjoyed a wet shave until I got this Razor.  Guys, you have got to try this Razor.  I&#x27;m telling you, this is the absolute best Electric Razor Norelco makes.  It does exactly what Norelco says it does: It shaves as close as a blade.  This is the closest and best shave that I have ever gotten with a Norelco Electric Razor in nearly 25 years of shaving!!!!!  I have a heavy, thick, dark beard and unlike with the Spectra, I don&#x27;t even get a shadow in the afternoon.  I own a Spectra 8894XL Top Of The Line  Norelco Electric Razor.  Spectra 8894XL can&#x27;t even come close to giving me the shave that I get with the Cool Skin Electric Razor.  The Spectra takes me 7 or 8 minutes to shave and it&#x27;s still not as close as the Cool Skin and I shave with the Cool Skin in half the time.  This Electric Razor really is Blade Close.  It does have one con and that is the lotion dispensing system.  It does not put out much gel while you are shaving.  Its best to use some Edge Shaving Gel with this electric razor to really get a close comfortable shave.  I would like to say congatulations to Norelco: You Guys have finally made an electric razor that shaves as close as a blade.  In a pinch, I will still use my Spectra 8894XL, but in the mean time I&#x27;m sticking with my Cool Skin.  It leaves your  face feeling smooth and it really gives you a  smooth, close, comfortable shave.  Like I said, this is the best shaving electric razor Norelco has ever made.  [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now.  It&#x27;s as close as a Mach 3 when you shave in the direction of the grain, but much more comfortable.  No cuts and almost no skin irritation.  I use it with  my regular shaving gel, works great.</li>
            <li> I went from using a cheap, one foil Braun model - the only way I had ever shaved - to the Norelco 7775x.  The Braun had to be retired after the foil began rusting and essentially burned my face, caught hairs, etc.  Well! I must say that research paid off in my case as I ran across this top-of-the-line Norelco.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  While I don&#x27;t believe the Nivea packs are enough shaving gel for keeping the \\&quot;gliding\\&quot; feeling, the 7775x is simply the overall best, closest shaving electric razor out there.  I could go on and on about what a difference it is to be able to wet shave, shave in the shower, etc. but it&#x27;s just so impressive when my boss complimented the closeness of the shave! Highly recommended, the 7775x left my sensitive neck feeling baby smooth and 100% better than my Braun left it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it gives a very good shave and works in the shower. Plus the battery life is great. It lasted for atleast 10-12 shaves. It is very easy to use and clean. The shaving head is flexibly designed to be able to shave any face contours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the shower gel. Firstly, I think Nivea is the only shaving gel provided. I like Nivea so its not a problem for me but it could be for someone who likes using something else. Secondly, the dispenser doesn&#x27;t work that good. You have to press the dispenser multiple times for the gel to come out properly. Finally, I felt that the dispenser doesn&#x27;t work properly when the gel pouch is nearing its end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product. I am happy with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I hate when electric razors tout they give shaves as close as a blade.  They don&#x27;t... ever.  That said, this one does pretty good.  I&#x27;d say at the time I shave, it feels almost as close as a blade, but I get a shadow around 1pm as opposed to 6 or 7pm.  To get a really good shave with this razor, you have to use it for 21 days, as the manual will tell, to let your skin get used to it.  Actually, I used it for almost a month before I was happy with the shave.  I have also found it does better with regular shaving gel (like Edge) than it does with the Nivea pack it comes with.  You will also get a closer shave if you shave more frequently.  It seems to do better with shorter whiskers.  If I shave at night after shaving in the morning, it is pretty darn smooth.  If I wait a whole day, it does not feel as close after a shave.  Couldn&#x27;t give it a 5, but I would go 4.5.</li>
            <li> I tried this shaver every day for three weeks.  My biggest problem with it is that to get a close shave across your entire face, it takes between 10 and 15 minutes.  If you shave in the shower, that&#x27;s a lot of wasted water just standing there shaving.  It literally takes a dozen passes to get all the stubble.    Pros:  * Extremely quiet (almost a whisper)    Cons:  * You can go through the Nivea packs extremely fast.  I was averaging 1 every 4 days.  * Perhaps my unit was defective, but every time I started to use the shaver, the Nivea pump wouldn&#x27;t work even after a dozen presses.  I had to flip up the lid to expose the pack, and squeeze it to start the flow, at which point the pump worked. (For those of you who think the Nivea pump is an electronic gadget, think again.  It is a manual pump.)  * As stated before, it takes FOREVER to get a close shave.  * Trimmer is a separate attachment    I am returning the Norelco to get my money back.  Just a couple of days ago, I started using the Panasonic ES8077S.    While the Panasonic is much louder, it shaved much closer than the Norelco in under 5 minutes.  For lather, I simply used a small amount of hand soap.  The Panasonic also has a built-in trimmer.  The Panasonic&#x27;s gimmick is the cleaning system that comes with it.  While it does a great job of cleaning, keep  in mind that the cleaning and drying process takes over an hour, and it&#x27;s loud.  The cleaning process could wake your spouse.  Fortunately, you don&#x27;t NEED to use the cleaner after every use (or at all for that metter).</li>
            <li> After trying the Braun and the Panasonic shavers, I went back to Norelco.  It&#x27;s a solid product.  The battery charge is good for 10 days to two weeks, and it gives a close shave.  Charges in about one hour.  I really like this model, because it dispenses shaving gel on your face as you shave, for an effortless shave.  And because of the gel system, it&#x27;s also waterproof, meaning you can open it and clean it under running hot water every day.  Older style Norelcos gave a good shave, but they were a pain to clean.  This style is easy to clean daily, just pop open the head and rinse clean.  It&#x27;s easy to keep it in top working order.   &lt;br /&gt;I love it.  Well, maybe I don&#x27;t LOVE it, but I sure like it a lot.  It&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Oh, yes it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who says otherwise probably hasn&#x27;t given it the money back guarantee time for the skin to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not quite as close as a blade, but with a beard as heavy as mine (&amp; with sensitive skin to boot), who cares?! The wife agrees, and if that isn&#x27;t good enough..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a refurbished one for about half price at Goodman&#x27;s - also through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensative skin and when using a regular razor or a mach 3 I can only shave every other day or my face is a wreck.  With this shaver I can shave every day or twice a day if I need to with no irritation.  The shave is about as close as a single blade not at all as close as Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the moisturizing lotion better than the extra fresh gel.  The gel has menthol and burned my face so if you have sensative skin I would avoid ever using it.  The lotion felt great.  For me and the ammount of lotion I use it is cheaper to buy lotion cartridges than new mach 3 blades.  It could be different for you if you use more lotion though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great in the shower and great at the sink.  I even used it once when my water pump quit on me and without water it worked fine just using more lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver really works great and its great to be able to shave daily without irritation instead of skipping days to let my face heal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as a replacement for my Braun Synchro. This is a fabulous shaver. It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten, with absolutely no irritation. In fact, I look forward to shaving now. I use the Nivea cartridges which easily install in the back of the shaver, and the resulting shave leaves my skin very soft and smooth. I have found that each cartridge lasts over a week. Cleaning the shaver is fast and easy. It is actually costing me less to use this shaver than the Braun. For me, the monthly cost of the Braun cleaning solution was more than the cost of the Nivea gel cartridges. I&#x27;ve purchased the Nivea cartridges from Amazon, and if you purchase enough to receive free shipping, they&#x27;re not very expensive. I also think the shaver is well constructed and should last a long time if properly cared for.</li>
            <li> The 7775x is truly cool - it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn sensitive skin when used in the shower.  I have mixed feelings about the effectiveness of the dispensible lotion, I use shaving cream and get a close and consistent shave.  The 21 day adjustment period is true, and my sensitive neck has cleared up since not using a razor.  At the time of this writing, the shaver was so new, the repair center didn&#x27;t have parts, and Norelco completely replaced the one that broke when it fell off the shelf in the shower.  I must comment you must use the plastic strap and hang it on something, because dropping the shaver in the tub is a good chance that a repair/replacement will be required.</li>
            <li> First off, let me preface this review by saying I have very curly hair and have been prone to serious pseudofolliculitis barbae or razor bumps.  Initially, I used a cheap trimmer to shave but that was never that close.  I tried using single and triple blade razors but that led to serious irritation and razor bumps.  I had to settle using the Andis T-Outliner clipper to get a \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with little irritation.  Still, that isn&#x27;t made for the face so I could never get rid of the stubble.  On to the review... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- It is lightweight and ergonomically fitted for the hand &lt;br /&gt;- The noise is noticeable but minimal &lt;br /&gt;- Using it in the shower, I get a very, very close shave with NO irritation and NO razor bumps, no matter how many times I go over the same area  &lt;br /&gt;- Norelco does admit that you&#x27;ll get a closer shave using it as a wet shaver; I haven&#x27;t tried it as a dry shaver &lt;br /&gt;- I prefer Aveeno&#x27;s shaving gel but the Nivea packs are alright &lt;br /&gt;- The heads do move according to your skin&#x27;s surface so it doesn&#x27;t require pinpoint precision to shave the chin and neckline &lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning is very easy &lt;br /&gt;- The charging stand is cheap and you can knock the shaver off of it very easily &lt;br /&gt;- Lastly, search online because I bought mine refurbished for $62 including shipping.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I get a razor-like close shave with no irritation.  Ultimately, that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, gets very close to as good a shave as a blade.  Easy to clean and neat to use in the shower.  There is only one weak point to this shaver and it is the little button which holds the flip top down.  It can be replaced rather inexpensively by ordering another gear cover for about 11 dollars including shipping.  It is not to hard to change out with the right tools (a number 7 (I think) torque. &lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t drop it on a hard surface and let it hit on this one piece.  Everything else is top notch.  The nivea cartridges last about two weeks, and the charge lasts about two weeks.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly enjoying this product.  It&#x27;s clearly the best electric/battery operated shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates ease of use and great features.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about a year and three months and it is great.  I have dropped it a couple of times and it has completly disassembled itself, but I just put it back together and it still works perfectly.  The Nivea product is good for my dry face.  In my opinion there are two negatives to this product. (1) It is really difficult to shave my lower neck area without the razor pinching me and (2) The shave that you get is NOT as close as a blade... I don&#x27;t care if it IS Norelco&#x27;s slogan for this product.  However, the shave is close enough for me.  It just means that if you have a light beard like me, you will still have to shave every day (when I shaved with a razor I could go a couple of days between shaves)  Besides the two negatives I mentioned, I think that this is a great product and I would recommend it if you are in the market for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have owned several norelco cool skin shavers.  They all work reasonably well.  They lifespan though is very short.  Maybe 1 year. 7775X has a lot more bells and whistles but its motor is not strong enough to completely shave my neck.  I actually use a blade to completely remove my beard.  However, the gel eliminates irritation.</li>
            <li> Norelco markets this Cool Skin with the phrase \\&quot;close as a blade with less irritation.\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt;I had read several favorable reviews on this razor but I was little skeptical about the \\&quot;close-as-a-blade\\&quot; claim. &lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver daily for a month, I&#x27;m amazed. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true. This thing is as close as a blade. &lt;br /&gt;In fact, it&#x27;s better than a blade. It&#x27;s quick, quiet and delivers a very close shave that is far more comfortable than any blade I&#x27;ve used. No nicks. No cuts. No irritation.  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used Remington and Panasonic electric shavers. Both were good, but they can&#x27;t match the Cool Skin for closeness and speed. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 40 years and I&#x27;m getting the best shave of my life. &lt;br /&gt;Phillips has produced an absolute gem of a shaver with this Norelco Cool Skin. It&#x27;s so good I actually enjoy shaving now. &lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price was great and the delivery was prompt. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older version of the cool skin models as it would no longer turn off.  I hope I don&#x27;t have a problem with this one.  I like that wet clean shave it gives me so far.  I had to return it once for the blades sticking and making an awful noise but amazon did that so fast and without a problem so I am quite impressed.    I like the stand it comes in and the look and feel.  I hope to have this one for many years.    Update: 1/30/2008    I have loved this razor even though within one month the blades had problems and I had to return it.  Now in within 7 months I have had the battery die twice when it had at least 75 % battery indicator.  One day I am shaving fine and the battery is almost full the next day it is dead and won&#x27;t respond to anything.  I have to let it sit on the battery charger for a long time for it to even recognize it.  I wish I could return it and get another battery.  I love the shaver but the battery is the worst I have ever dealt with.</li>
            <li> I actually get a closer shave with this than with a blade.  I did get an alergic reaction on my skin when I used the lotion but that went away once I began using it in the shower where I could rinse right away.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas from my Amazon Wishlist. I wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a long time user of Norelco shavers, but switched to a blade since I couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave. Now that the whiskers are mostly gray, you can&#x27;t tell for a few days if I shaved or not, so closeness is no longer an issue. I typically use this shaver in the shower, and have noticed that if you wash your face first, it takes more of the Cool Skin creme to give a smooth, close shave. Just a hint, guys. For the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles, dimples and Adam&#x27;s apple cleanly with very little drag. My only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the &#x27;stash &amp; sideburns while showering. Small complaint that doesn&#x27;t remove any ratings stars. All in all a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas two years ago (2006) and it has worked really well for him. He likes it and uses it about 5 times a week. So I must say it has held up really well for two years with as much as he has used it!</li>
            <li> Anyone who is used to a Mach3 or Quatro &amp;quot;blade&amp;quot; shave is going to HATE this shaver... I repeat... IT DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS A BLADE... Don&#x27;t fall for the marketing BS... It just doesn&#x27;t.. it can&#x27;t... it&#x27;s electric... period.  It MAY be the best electric shaver on the market, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m a blade guy and this was my first try at electric.  However, I will say this... I LOVE this shaver for my head.  Yep, you heard me right... for my head.  I like the shaved head thing (better than a crome dome) and tried shaving my head with a blade a few months ago and it was just too much work to shave my whole melon every morning, so I blew it off.  &lt;br /&gt;But once I tried this Norelco (on my face) and was ready to send it back because it SUCKS (yes, I fell for the marketing BS &amp;quot;its as close as a blade&amp;quot; - ARG!), I thought, &amp;quot;Hey, maybe I should try THIS on my head.&amp;quot;  And it is PERFECT.  No, it still doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but it shaves close enough for my head... and it doesn&#x27;t take too long... just a quick &amp;quot;going over&amp;quot; all over my head every morning in the shower and I&#x27;m done.  So now I shave my face with a Quatro and my head with this handy-dandy Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;So for a face shaver... I give it 0 stars.  But for a head shaver... I give it 5.  I&#x27;ll round up just because I&#x27;m a good guy.</li>
            <li> In spite of the people who say this sucks for your face, this is because of the lack of oxygen in the brain from shaveing there head to close, they probably shave their brains out of the head, but the truth is, NORELCO IS THE BEST SHAVIENG SYSTEM YOU CAN PURCHASE THIS IS MY 3RD NORELCO SHAVER, YOU CANNOT GET A CLOSER SHAVE EVEN WITH A RAZOR&amp;gt; BUY THIS, YOU WILL BE HAPPY AND GLAD THAT YOU DID. NORELCO IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> PROS: close shave; less skin irritation and no cut; quick charging; convenient LED displays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: pricy; pricy cartridges; fragile looking body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 10 days and am loving it.  It only took me several days to get used to it.  It is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric.  Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this was the best thing. I like the quick 1-hour charge a lot.  The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower.  Nevertheless, the shaver at $120 is not cheap.  Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast.  But I found a remedy- Nivea \\&quot;after shave balm\\&quot; 3.3 oz. at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy or Walmart gives you the same quality  as little five Nivea 0.4 oz. cartridges(total 2 oz.) at $5 do.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver, certainly the best electric i have used. gives a close shave but not as close as gillete mach 3. I apply my old shaving cream instead of the provided gel from the pouches, is more convinient that way.</li>
            <li> Hi, &lt;br /&gt;I never used an electric shaver before, but I decided to try this one, and It&#x27;s amazing. Its said that the skin needs about three weeks to get use to an electric shanver, but with the Norelco 7775X, it took only the first shave. It&#x27;s awesome. I recommend it for the first timers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first about this razor since past experiences have taught me about electric razors. I&#x27;ll have to say this is the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had and it feels great. The first shave with it was a little different. I had only minor irritation around the neck area and few nicks because of the small hair bumps on my lower neck. That aside it was a great shave. The shaving gel provided made it a lot more comfortable than I&#x27;ve gotten used to. The only down side of this razor is the trimmer attachment. The trimmer is to bulky and it doesn&#x27;t outline very well, I had a hard time seeing around it to shape my mustache and goatee. This is a definite buy.</li>
            <li> When I first used this shaver there were a few things I had to learn.  It&#x27;s quiet -- so quiet, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working properly.  Second, you don&#x27;t have to press hard to get it to work -- just keep passing it over any area of your skin requiring extra attention and it will do the job.  Third, the lotion/gel samples make the shave live up to its name of Cool Skin -- no razor burn whatsoever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have two issues with the shaver.  First, Norelco still has one of the most inconvenient methods of cleaning I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Every few days you need to disassemble the blades from the discs holding them and using a brush (I use an old toothbrush) to get the old hair out of there.  Rinsing it under water doesn&#x27;t do anything but remove the stray hair stubble in the head itself.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second, the refills are difficult to find.  They are relatively expensive in most sources (including here at Amazon) but are available at the world&#x27;s largest retailer in a box of 5 for $4.94.  I find they last about 10 days if you don&#x27;t go crazy pressing the button for lotion.  I also find the lotion much better than the gel.  When I shave at home, I just use regular shave gel with it to preserve the expensive cartridge-based lubricants.</li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s website claims the 7775X to be their \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; lotion-dispensing razor. This is true in all aspects but one: the choice of batteries. The manufacturer has opted to stick with Ni-Cad batteries. This is not necessarily bad (they still perform well), but the absence of smart trickle charging forces the user to \\&quot;baby-sit\\&quot; the charging process. This means no charge-and-forget scenarios; set a timer and unplug everything when it&#x27;s done! &lt;br /&gt;Other than that the unit is great. It&#x27;s light, shaves close and comfortable (I guess those lotion-retaining, guide rings really work!), and can easily go over a week of daily use on a single charge. The status lights are a nice touch, but reminders to dispense lotion and rinse afterwards are redundant; especially for users already familiar with these wet razors. &lt;br /&gt;All in all a good purchase to replace my Norelco 6735X, which lasted over three years before succumbing to dead [Ni-Cad] batteries... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Cool clean shave with mimimum effort,charge lasts a long long time, simple operation, easy clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame Norelco no longer makes this razor.  My husband absolutely loves it and searches far and wide for the lotion packets it requires,  It gives an awesome shave.  When his razor broke, he was devastated, and only Amazon had a new one for us to purchase.  He was so happy to find one, and it became an early birthday present for him.  He says to Phillips Norelco, &amp;#34;Bring this model back as part of your line of shavers.&amp;#34;  He doesn&#x27;t know what he will do if and when this one goes bad.  He has tried others and nothing compares.</li>
            <li> I have had this 7775x Norelco for atleast 4 years now..It has been great. The shave in the shower just using regular foam is great. I never used the Nivea refills much. I have had no problems or failures with this or my first Norelco wet shaver I bought. I still have it the original \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; model before the cool skin series came out..Both still work fine and just need new blade replacements..Which leads me to my next purchase. The Norelco 8020x will be my next razor. I think its time and with the costly replacement heads getting harder and harder to find I think I will upgrade to the new 8020x model at the end of the year.. But this razor has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> I found the Nivea dispenser on the shaver difficult to use so I wet my face and put my own shaving cream on my face. The shave was fast and very close -- as close as a blade in my opinion. -- and far superior to the Spectra. My skin felt very smooth after the shave. The shave was quick -- not because I was in a hurry. More than 3 or 4 minutes just wasn&#x27;t necessary for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool Skin is not as comfortable a shave as the Spectra unless I have shaving cream on the area where I am shaving. It&#x27;s important to use the Nivea, or as I do, use a shaving cream. With shaving cream the Cool Skin just glides. Without shaving cream, I can feel the pull.  I would not recommend this shaver for dry shaving except in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss having an an board trimmer.  (The trimmer on the Cool Skin must be attached.) Even with this disadvantage the Cool Skin is hands down better than the Spectra. After shaving just once with the Cool Skin, I would not go back to the Spectra. The Cool Skin is much closer.</li>
            <li> I owned a Norelco 6826 razor before this, and wanted to upgrade. The Cool Shave seemed like a great product because you can use it in the shower, or out as long as your face is wet. This razor is a big step up. It gives me a much less irritating shave than the dry one. I bought the one with all of the warning lights, like charging, how much time until charging ends, indicators, and how much shave time left. I hardly look at any of them except the shave time and charging time. Also, I don&#x27;t use the Nivea pouches anymore. They are a good idea, but they run out too fast and are expensive. I use the Gilette blue shaving lotion. I put it all over my face and wet the razor. It is just as effective. Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t come with a sideburn function attached. You have to put it on separately (but it is included), which is only a minor pain. I can deal with it. Some people have written that the razor is a bit slippery, which is true, but mine has never fallen out of my hands. The zipper case is nice, but kind of small. So, overall, the extra touches don&#x27;t mean much. It is the razor that is, itself, the best part. The shave is smooth and very close. It feels nice to use a battery-powered razor on a wet face. It is just a great invention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using the gel - it&#x27;s expensive and doesn&#x27;t worth it. instead I&#x27;m using a regular shaving gel and the shaving is very good for me. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> (....).  It takes some getting used to, but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave.  I got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks, but I think I was pressing too hard like I had to with my old razor.  Just a light touch gives a close shave.  The attachable sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a very good job in my opinion, but I kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose.  The gel packs go pretty quickly, but maybe I&#x27;m using too much.  I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it.  It&#x27;s a different experience than your basic razor.</li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower and have tried the linear foil wet-to-dry shavers (Braun and Panasonic).  This is the first rotary shaver that I&#x27;ve owned and it is pretty good.  Nothing is like a blade, but I believe this product shaves faster than the Braun and Panasonic and is more thorough.  If you can&#x27;t have the closeness of a blade, at least go for the fastest shaver.  And don&#x27;t believe the hype - none of them shave \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;p.s. the built in lubricating lotion is a plus when you don&#x27;t want to pack shaving cream for those weekend trips - it does the trick. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> it is very lightweight the charge stays on very long works excellent in the water as you shower. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for many years.  The 7775X is the best yet.  The jet cream allows me to get a non-irritating shave on any part of my face. ++++++++</li>
            <li> This shaver is terrific and provides a close shave- but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin raw or irritated if used in the shower with shaving cream. I have used a wet/dry shaver for over 10 years, from Panasonic foil (which cut my face)to Remingtom (no longer available) to Norelco (the best). I shave in the shower with shaving cream and never use it dry. Using it as a wet shaver, I no longer have trouble shaving my neck, or shaving when it is hot or humid. I no longer breakout from irritation and no longer have a raw neck. I also find rotary to be superior to foil for my facial hair, and this shaver meets my needs. I highly recommend this shaver to anyone who uses a shaver instead of blades and recommend anyone having even the least trouble using a dry shaver to try this wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic wet\dry shaver for several years and had touble with it keeping the charge so I decided to try the Norelco 7775 Cool Skin shaver. It gives a good overall shave. I have used the Panasonic on one side of my face and the Norelco on the other. They are pretty equal. The Norelco is much quieter but not quite as close a shave at least on my beard.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and hate shaving. It tears my neck up. I would only shave once every 2 or 3 days because of this, but a recent job change meant every day shaving. This electric shaver works great. It takes your face a few days to get used to an electric shaver and you might not think it works very well, but after the first week it will give you the best shave of your life. I enjoyed shaving with the &amp;#34;Cool Skin Lotion&amp;#34; but when I ran out I just continued on using regular shaving cream &amp; it works just as well. The grooming attachment is easy to use and actually works really well too.</li>
