            <li>I am happy with this product  Reasonably priced good quality</li>
            <li>Love it ! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never worn extensions before, so I decided to buy these because they were cheap and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>Does not shed like most glue in hair.</li>
            <li>but it okay there</li>
            <li>but yes i love it</li>
            <li>These were better quality of feeling real than the ones my sister bought for over $100!!!</li>
            <li>but I purchased two bundles of hair so they&#x27;re fine for my hair thickness.</li>
            <li>however this was simple and easy to put in and it looks great.</li>
            <li>i have medium texture but little of it so this pack was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>But nothing to make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>There were huge gaps in all pcs.</li>
            <li>extensions were cheap looking.</li>
            <li>They came much sooner than expected (almost a month sooner) and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>think they can be useful for some.</li>
            <li>May actually buy more,</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>this was more than enough hair for me.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should laugh or be mad lol.</li>
            <li>and they blended in nicely with my black hair looking like highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they won&#x27;t make much difference&lt;</li>
            <li>but then again I didn&#x27;t use the whole pack</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love my hair is redish black but more black</li>
            <li>Very thin, you will for sure need more than one pack for any type of fullness.  </li>
            <li>the clips are strong and they hold a good curl with out hair spray there a little thin</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The only thing is was they smelled funny.</li>
            <li>They are soft and they can be curled.</li>
            <li>cause it looked small buuh after washing it and blow drying it and installing it into my real hair, it looked natural asl its more fuller when u have really long hair with 2 packs</li>
            <li>The only problem is that I have really straight hair and the clips won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>Super super thin.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really like them!</li>
            <li>The clips looked poorly made and the hair was not one bit cute.</li>
            <li>That said, the hair is really soft, does not shed and has sturdy clips, I flat ironed it with no problems.</li>
            <li>They appear to be a little thicker on top, but get super thin and stringy further down.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting thick full long luscious hair these aren&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These extension are super thin</li>
            <li> However they don&#x27;t clip in very well at least not in thinner hair.</li>
            <li> Then I lookd at it closely as there was some little white-ish things stuck to the strands of the hair that looked like lice eggs but bigger!</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Not really an issue tho...</li>
            <li> Because of how thin they are, they don&#x27;t offer MUCH volume....</li>
            <li> got the package quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> but the only thing is when u recieve the hair in the mail, it comes in small bondles</li>
            <li> I also thought I was getting  black</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t listen to all the bad reviews!</li>
            <li> Maybe a little too sturdy, takes a lot of force to snap and unsnap them.</li>
            <li> Maybe a LITTLE bit.</li>
            <li> The only thing was that they are a bit thin</li>
            <li> blow dried</li>
            <li> but anyways yea when it dried it had a curl pattern</li>
            <li> It is natural but very thin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;.I guess it was expected after reading the comments, just didn&#x27;t think it would be THAT thin.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear weave</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews commenting on how thin they were</li>
            <li> No shedding, but they were a little thin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting at least two packs to get some semblance of fullness.</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> Definitely not good for length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t thick is relaxed but this extensions are really thin is</li>
            <li> They are on the thin sidea</li>
            <li> not as thin as everyone&#x27;s saying</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are thin...</li>
            <li> ... looked too thin at the bottom.</li>
            <li> but these are REALLY THIN.</li>
            <li> if you have very thick hair just but two packs!</li>
            <li> Unless, if you have very thin hair than this is for&lt;br /&gt;you.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed and money wasted!! 0 for rating</li>
            <li> I was kinda mad a lil bit</li>
            <li> Also bad customer service !</li>
            <li> I was disgusted!</li>
            <li> Awful awful awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love them!!! May actually buy more, just incase I wear the ones I bought out! These were better quality of feeling real than the ones my sister bought for over $100!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn extensions before, so I decided to buy these because they were cheap and had good reviews. I must say that these are AMAZING! No shedding, but they were a little thin. They blend in with my hair so well! I&#x27;m definitely buying these again.</li>
            <li> They are perfect! Exactly what I ordered. They came much sooner than expected (almost a month sooner) and they fit perfectly. The only thing was that they are a bit thin but I purchased two bundles of hair so they&#x27;re fine for my hair thickness. Truly a bargain!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! So glad I didn&#x27;t listen to all the bad reviews! I straightened them and they did fine!!! They are on the thin sidea so yes get 2 packs!</li>
            <li> Very thin, you will for sure need more than one pack for any type of fullness.  It is natural but very thin.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product  Reasonably priced good quality</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected. Beautiful hair. Perfect color blend. Does not shed like most glue in hair. Very pleased. Can&#x27;t tell I have extentions. Curls great. Never used clips before, but I will from now on.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love my hair is redish black but more black but it still blends we&#x27;ll the clips are strong and they hold a good curl with out hair spray there a little thin but it okay there not as thin as everyone&#x27;s saying</li>
            <li> I mean... You definitely get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clips are sturdy. Maybe a little too sturdy, takes a lot of force to snap and unsnap them. Not really an issue tho...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are thin... I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should laugh or be mad lol. They appear to be a little thicker on top, but get super thin and stringy further down. Because of how thin they are, they don&#x27;t offer MUCH volume.... Maybe a LITTLE bit. But nothing to make a huge difference. Definitely not good for length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.I guess it was expected after reading the comments, just didn&#x27;t think it would be THAT thin. I also thought I was getting  black but they came in brown.&lt;br /&gt;But I wore them anyways and they blended in nicely with my black hair looking like highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft and silky. But I don&#x27;t think all strands are 100% Remy hair as some strands did not take to Curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they can be useful for some. Not for others. If you&#x27;re expecting thick full long luscious hair these aren&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the package quicker than expected. Good price otherwise</li>
            <li> No shedding , adds volume , blends and can be curled .... Love it ! :)</li>
            <li> Super super thin. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> This hair  is nice the hair clips are strong and of good quality  ...I wished it was a longer length</li>
            <li> This did not come as expected!&lt;br /&gt;The extensions were cheap looking. The clips looked poorly made and the hair was not one bit cute. Also bad customer service ! I contacted seller for a refund and did not receive one. Would not reccomend</li>
            <li> The hair was pretty, the color matched perfectly. I didn&#x27;t like how thinned out it look at the bottom... looked too thin at the bottom. Then I lookd at it closely as there was some little white-ish things stuck to the strands of the hair that looked like lice eggs but bigger! I threw it in the trash outside! I was disgusted!</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews commenting on how thin they were but these are REALLY THIN. I would recommend getting at least two packs to get some semblance of fullness. That said, the hair is really soft, does not shed and has sturdy clips, I flat ironed it with no problems.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear weave but I saw this and wanted to it.  I can not do hair however this was simple and easy to put in and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Awful awful awful. I know its only 70g. But what I got was not even close to that. There were huge gaps in all pcs. Extremely disappointed and money wasted!! 0 for rating</li>
            <li> My extensions came in the mail yesterday! They are soft and they can be curled. The only thing is was they smelled funny. Other than that I really like them!</li>
            <li> These look beautiful and curl beautifully.  However they don&#x27;t clip in very well at least not in thinner hair.</li>
            <li> These extension are super thin they won&#x27;t make much difference&lt;br /&gt;when you wear it. Unless, if you have very thin hair than this is for&lt;br /&gt;you. My hair isn&#x27;t thick is relaxed but this extensions are really thin is&lt;br /&gt;like the hair of asian people(I am not stereotyping just giving you guys&lt;br /&gt;a example so you can visualize) The hair is 100% human hair so that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;why I gave it five stars even though it didn&#x27;t work for me. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Update: Still looking good. Looks like great quality</li>
            <li> The hair that i order was simpleyourstyle and i conditioner and washed the hair then blow dried it cause it had a weave smell which I&#x27;m used to but anyways yea when it dried it had a curl pattern I was like omgg this is real human hair brruh 100% but yes i love it but the only thing is when u recieve the hair in the mail, it comes in small bondles I was kinda mad a lil bit cause it looked small buuh after washing it and blow drying it and installing it into my real hair, it looked natural asl its more fuller when u have really long hair with 2 packs but then again I didn&#x27;t use the whole pack so yes remember this is: Simpleyourstyles hair I&#x27;m reviewing on cause thats the hair I order💯😘</li>
            <li> this was more than enough hair for me. if you have very thick hair just but two packs! i have medium texture but little of it so this pack was perfect for me. i curled the hair and had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I have really straight hair and the clips won&#x27;t stay on. It just slides off my hair.</li>
            <li> It took forever to come and it wasn&#x27;t enough hair.</li>
