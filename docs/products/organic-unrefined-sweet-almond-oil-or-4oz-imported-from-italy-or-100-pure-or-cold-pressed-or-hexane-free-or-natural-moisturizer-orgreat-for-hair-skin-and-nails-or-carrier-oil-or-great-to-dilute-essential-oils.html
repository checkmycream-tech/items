            <li> Update 2016: USDA organic label has been removed. So no way to know if it is indeed what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic Sweet Almond Oil. I have another brand that is not organic and may be questionable in product. That one is very oily and leaves a residue I have to pat off after applying. This Sweet almond oil is so much better! not only is it organic but it is not oily, applies easily, no smell that I can tell (I have a good nose!) and does not require a pat dry after applying. I have found my new Sweet almond.</li>

            <li> This is great organic cold-pressed almond oil. I like that the bottle is dark amber (so light doesn&#x27;t penetrate) and that the lid allows for just putting a drop into my palm. I use almond oil on my eyelids and cuticles so don&#x27;t want a bottle that forces me to pour out more than I need. I&#x27;ll buy this one again!</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin. I&#x27;m using as emollient, it works wonderful better than expensive products I used before.</li>
