    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My skin feels great when I use this soap!</li>
            <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, however.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
            <li>This is honestly the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Does a great job.</li>
            <li>Still, good price.</li>
            <li>Good bar.</li>
            <li>It lathers right up and cleans beautifully.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s one of the best performing soaps I&#x27;ve used so far regardless.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, great product..lasts for a long time and very mild.  </li>
            <li>I have used Savon de Marseille as a shampoo for decades (it&#x27;s legendary in France for making your hair shiny) and am so grateful that now that I no longer live in Europe it is still easy to find on line and affordable.  </li>
            <li>I love using this soap.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it&#x27;s made with olive oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a tiny bit drying and doesn&#x27;t smell the best.</li>
            <li>The cube is huge, but no worries, it&#x27;s very easy to just cut off a more manageable slice with a kitchen knife and use that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying another , this soap is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural soap.</li>
            <li>Looks like I missed the fine print in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>A great product and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a soap box in the world in which this cube would fit.</li>
            <li>Very mild and bubbles up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is creamy and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin fresh and cleanses it from oil.</li>
            <li>Wonderful soap overall, not as drying as other castile soaps and helps get rid of body pimples.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasing, fresh scent and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth but not overly moisturized.</li>
            <li>Remarkable long lasting and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love the over all cleanliness feeling you get after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>but as long as it is the original centuries old variety</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Probably removes new stains completely.</li>
            <li>It has a very neutral smell and such a large bar will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Does not have strong fake smells like other cheap soaps.</li>
            <li>My skin does not dry up with this soap.  </li>

            <li> My skin does not dry up with this soap.  </li>
            <li> My skin did not feel soft; I felt that it dried it out.</li>
            <li> This soap lasts a long time and I like no ring around the tub ...</li>
            <li> The dry version lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> The soap was very dry and crumbly.</li>
            <li> Not dry and tight like other soaps.</li>
            <li> Does remove old stains somewhat from cotton fabric - at least that&#x27;s what I used it on.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this I expected Savon de Marseille made with &amp;#34;traditional, old-world methods&amp;#34; as described, not modern day preservatives like TETRASODIUM EDTA (a preservative made from formaldehyde and sodium cyanide) and TETRASODIUM ETIDRONATE, both of which are carcinogens.</li>
            <li> I work construction and bring home tons of dirt and like the fact that 90% goes down the drain with the soap and water..</li>
            <li> so none is wasted.</li>
            <li> Was not pleased at all</li>
            <li> No more leaky plastic things with molding brushes at the end!</li>
            <li> I have allergies due to soaps which contain chemicals which are dangerous to everybody.</li>
            <li> Not a great scent - i would NEVER bathe with this soap.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Although I usually like Marseille Soap, this one is awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying another , this soap is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this soap. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Does remove old stains somewhat from cotton fabric - at least that&#x27;s what I used it on.  Probably removes new stains completely. This is NOT a miracle product. Lasts forever.  Not a great scent - i would NEVER bathe with this soap.  Still, good price.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product. The soap was very dry and crumbly. I&#x27;ve bought this soap numerous times before and I could cut it into sections but this one just crumbled into pieces. Was not pleased at all</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It lathers right up and cleans beautifully. Has a pleasing, fresh scent and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth but not overly moisturized. I have sensitive/product reactive skin (oily/combination) but have had no problems at all with this soap. The cube is huge, but no worries, it&#x27;s very easy to just cut off a more manageable slice with a kitchen knife and use that. Remarkable long lasting and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good bar. Love the fact it&#x27;s made with olive oil. leaves your skin fresh and cleanses it from oil. Likey!</li>
            <li> My skin feels great when I use this soap! Not dry and tight like other soaps. It has a very neutral smell and such a large bar will last a long time. It does crumble a bit if you try to cut it into smaller slices, but just add some water to the crumbles and they&#x27;ll stick to a larger slice of soap so none is wasted. A great product and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very mild and bubbles up quickly.  My skin does not dry up with this soap.  Does not have strong fake smells like other cheap soaps.</li>
            <li> I have allergies due to soaps which contain chemicals which are dangerous to everybody. This is a great natural soap.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I expected Savon de Marseille made with &amp;#34;traditional, old-world methods&amp;#34; as described, not modern day preservatives like TETRASODIUM EDTA (a preservative made from formaldehyde and sodium cyanide) and TETRASODIUM ETIDRONATE, both of which are carcinogens. Looks like I missed the fine print in the ingredients. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap overall, not as drying as other castile soaps and helps get rid of body pimples. Not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, however. It&#x27;s still a tiny bit drying and doesn&#x27;t smell the best. However, it&#x27;s one of the best performing soaps I&#x27;ve used so far regardless.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, great product..lasts for a long time and very mild.  I&#x27;ve had a larger size in my kitchen for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Although I usually like Marseille Soap, this one is awful. My skin did not feel soft; I felt that it dried it out. And, the shape is unwieldy. It is totally unsuitable for travel. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a soap box in the world in which this cube would fit. I, who cannot part with anything, heaved it in the trash.</li>
            <li> It works on everything - dishes, clothing stains - and lasts forever. No more leaky plastic things with molding brushes at the end!</li>
            <li> The Marseille is a work horse! Can&#x27;t live without it. I gave one to each daughter and granddaughter for Xmas!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use on my skin. It is creamy and rinses clean. I keep a block at the kitchen sink and one in the shower. Also cleans my hands and arms after hours in the garden. Not drying, gritty or greasy. I have been using this soap for years.</li>
            <li> I love the over all cleanliness feeling you get after a long day at work. This soap lasts a long time and I like no ring around the tub ... I work construction and bring home tons of dirt and like the fact that 90% goes down the drain with the soap and water..</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my makeup brushes. Does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have used Savon de Marseille as a shampoo for decades (it&#x27;s legendary in France for making your hair shiny) and am so grateful that now that I no longer live in Europe it is still easy to find on line and affordable.  The dry version lasts a very long time and I prefer it but as long as it is the original centuries old variety (I don&#x27;t use the newer scented varieties) I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
