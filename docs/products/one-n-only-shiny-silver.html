            <li> This gel holds nicely, but no more shine than other products I use, not worth the additional cost if shine is the main need.</li>
            <li> First I used it to style curls, and it dried naturally, big mistake.  </li>
            <li> Tried it again but this time I used it (as I would my regular styling gel) to blow dry my curly hair into a straightened style.  </li>
            <li> There was an overall dullness to my hair, the texture became dry and course.  </li>
            <li> But for a fancy dress evening it will hold your hair all night long.</li>
            <li> I find that other gels yellow my hair when used.  </li>
            <li> but I only use less than a dime size dot and mix it with clear gel or mousse to remove any brassiness and put a little shape to my hair.</li>
            <li> It as directed &amp; my hair felt dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Slight blue,</li>
            <li> and I need a few curves in it because of how short I wear it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Too stiff and no apparent improvement of silver.</li>
            <li> BUMMER; so I must go check out other locals to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> and it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> This gel was no better than the $4 and $5 gels purchased through local chain stores.  </li>
            <li> It was tough using a round brush during the blow dry because the sections would not separate normally.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair too dry and stiff regardless of coloring.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and come to just under my jaw line, I use about a quarter size dollop on my DAMP hair and, starting at the ROOTS, work it into my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to keep grey or white hair from developing yellowish tinges (beware of hair products with yellow dyes in them!!!)  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I put in a little baby powder and work it through.  </li>
            <li> It is a little drying though, but I use coconut oil with it, and that helps.  </li>
            <li> I round brush my hair a lot</li>
            <li> What a waste</li>
            <li> It is shiny but maybe a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> At bit too heavy for my  taste.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky or over heavy product in the hair.</li>
            <li> We are very disappointed that it is not readily available  any more.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> The ends of the curls were stiff, my hair was dull &amp; looked like a powder coating.  </li>
            <li> The gel made it difficult to comb or brush during styling as well as after my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> but without this it tends to look dull and yellowing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 5 year and buying it from Sally&#x27;s who no longer carrier.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or have that dirty look.  </li>
            <li> not make your hair feel dirty, greasy etc</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>

            <li> I have gray hair that is colored blonde and this product works better than others that I&#x27;ve paid hundreds of dollars for.  My hair is thick and come to just under my jaw line, I use about a quarter size dollop on my DAMP hair and, starting at the ROOTS, work it into my hair.  When I style my hair it&#x27;s never looked more luscious, manageable and shiny.  I round brush my hair a lot and this helps me get that fullness while also giving it a glow.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This gel works very well on my hair which is fine and straight.  Ever since using this product, I have had many, many compliments on how shiny and white the color is.  Historically, I have found that some hair products turn my hair yellow as soon as I put a curling iron to it.  However, this is not the case with this product.  I will definitely buy it again through Amazon.com because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in town.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It holds well, does put a gloss in my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or have that dirty look.  I can go between two and three days before shampooing, depending on the weather.  Sometimes I put in a little baby powder and work it through.  this is great stuff!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  My hair is naturally curly and shoulder length.  It is medium blonde with white coming into the arena ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used It as directed &amp; my hair felt dry and brittle.  The gel made it difficult to comb or brush during styling as well as after my hair was dry.  First I used it to style curls, and it dried naturally, big mistake.  The ends of the curls were stiff, my hair was dull &amp; looked like a powder coating.  Tried it again but this time I used it (as I would my regular styling gel) to blow dry my curly hair into a straightened style.  That was also a mistake.  There was an overall dullness to my hair, the texture became dry and course.  It was tough using a round brush during the blow dry because the sections would not separate normally.  There was a great deal more hair loss during both styling sessions and frankly I cannot afford that!&lt;br /&gt;I have tossed this into the &amp;#34;does not work&amp;#34; product drawer.  What a waste</li>
            <li> A great product for silver hair!!</li>
            <li> This gel has good hold, but more importantly, it helps keep my white hair a beautiful, bright white.  It is very difficult to keep grey or white hair from developing yellowish tinges (beware of hair products with yellow dyes in them!!!)  I have eliminated all hair products with yellow dyes from my regime, including shampoo, oil treatments, etc. and only use white, clear or blue&#x27;ing products, and have used the One &#x27;n Only shampoos and conditioners for years with good results.  Since adding this product to my lineup my hair has become an even brighter white - about the color of a sheet of white paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the One &#x27;n Only products on my daughter&#x27;s blonde hair, making it just a bit brighter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great addition to the battle against the yellowing of grey or white hair.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A 90 year old nun. My two sisters  one 89  one 82and myself.  73 years young  have used this product for years. We are very disappointed that it is not readily available  any more.  Now we are going to be old ladies with yellow hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is shiny but maybe a bit heavy. Use sparingly</li>
            <li> Do not like this product.  Too stiff and no apparent improvement of silver.</li>
            <li> Having silver/blonde hair I love this product.  It works great and I love the scent.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years, and Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying it. No other gel was as good</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Very good product</li>
            <li> great for silver/gray hair</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE SHE LOVES IT ...BUT MUST BE APPLIED TO CLEAN WET OR DAMP HAIR !!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves de hair with body and a nice shine. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Nice product. Definitely lived to expectations. Not heavy and keeps hair soft.</li>
            <li> When I could find this brand at my local beauty supply I looked on Amazon and found this product at a lower price.  It is great for my silver hair, and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to be honest. Didn&#x27;t really notice any different than a regular/cheaper gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 5 year and buying it from Sally&#x27;s who no longer carrier.  I am so glad to find it on Amazon and with the pricing only a few cents more.  I find that other gels yellow my hair when used.  And the Shiny Silver keeps is bright.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this gel!  It&#x27;s terrific because it helps to keep the yellow out of my gray hair and gives my hair the EXTRA body that I need because my hair is so straight and I need a few curves in it because of how short I wear it.  It&#x27;s not available locally any more so I knew to go onto Amazon to find it.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I only use less than a dime size dot and mix it with clear gel or mousse to remove any brassiness and put a little shape to my hair. This way I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Nice gel EXCEPT be prepared for blue tint to your hair. Slight blue, but I didn&#x27;t like that part.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair too dry and stiff regardless of coloring.</li>
            <li> Great product.  All was fine.</li>
            <li> wife liked it very much</li>
            <li> Great item so glad I could get it online</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good gel, makes styling my hair easier.  It is a little drying though, but I use coconut oil with it, and that helps.  I will continue to use this product.  It also makes my highlights last, keeps the brass out.</li>
            <li> I love, love the One  \\&quot;n only silver gel. It makes my hair look so shiny and bright.  It also makes my hair soft to the touch. Would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Love this gel.  Works great on my silver hair.</li>
            <li> At bit too heavy for my  taste.  But for a fancy dress evening it will hold your hair all night long.</li>
            <li> This gel holds nicely, but no more shine than other products I use, not worth the additional cost if shine is the main need.</li>
            <li> Received promptly. This is my favorite gel.</li>
            <li> I do love it. just surprised by the texture which is runny - not like a gel.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great hold and does not yellow your grey hair.</li>
            <li> I love this and it is no longer available in stores...hope it will be here when I need more!</li>
            <li> This product falls short of expectations.  Far too much of a pasted feel and look.  Even using just a miniminal amount of the product the produces a plastic look and feel.</li>
            <li> Sticky, yucky stuff that left blue streaks in my hair.  And I didn&#x27;t even use a lot.</li>
            <li> I really love this get.  BUT now the beauty supply stores says they have discontinued the items.  BUMMER; so I must go check out other locals to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Does not make your hair feel dirty, greasy etc</li>
            <li> Product is great  cannot by it at Sally any more.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look fuller and more manageable, and keeps it in place.I really like this product and it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for those of us that have grey hair.  It assists in holding your style and puts a shine in your hair.  Not sticky or over heavy product in the hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, he swears by it. He had asked me to order it for him, I guess he was having a problem finding it in the stores. He has very white hair but without this it tends to look dull and yellowing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years but can no longer find it in local &amp;#34;beauty supply&amp;#34; stores (Sally&#x27;s). It does NOT turn your hair purple! It performs exactly as stated on the label. If you are a &amp;#34;boomer&amp;#34; lucky enough to have a full head of hair (gray or white) you will find this product indispensable.</li>
            <li> I have used hair gels for years.  This gel was no better than the $4 and $5 gels purchased through local chain stores.  The &amp;#34;Shiny Silver Gel&amp;#34; did not increase the shine, silver, or whiteness of my hair.  I would have been happy to purchase more if it performed as advertised.  Not worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> No effect on brassiness, decent hold as a gel though. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> great product  - I get lots of compliments on my shiny gray hair - Shiny Silver - quality product</li>
