            <li>it does everything to make your hair look smooth, fresh, glittering, soft.. and regarding the smell..</li>
            <li>Good product and the price is less than salons.</li>
            <li>It is great on hard to brush or tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>i absolutely LOOOOOOVE this product!</li>
            <li>The better product (plus shampoo of same line) for my hair in all the times!</li>
            <li>This really does what it says!</li>
            <li>They pretty much stand alone on that opinion.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz in rain very manageable</li>
            <li>it is MUCH CHEAPER than in Brazil.</li>
            <li>I expected more smoothness &amp; shine, though.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great for thin hair!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the spray nozzle gets clogged because the product can be really thick; I find this happens more in the winter months and wish that they would change the bottle somewhat, but it hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, managable</li>
            <li>this stuff, my hair feels so soft and silky, and I get almost no frizz at all.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m running late I&#x27;ll just unscrew the top and put some in my hands the old-fashioned way.</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soo soft.</li>

            <li> I really recommend you going to see the different and the same day</li>
            <li> Helps eliminate breakage from blow drying, flat iron, or curling irons.  </li>
            <li> that makes you want to touch it all day long</li>
            <li> Usually I shower at night, put this on my wet hair and let it dry naturally overnight</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it in her blowouts, and I always thought that it was one of those &amp;#34;only sold in salons&amp;#34; products that are super expensive</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it on me - just a couple of spritzes - absolutely no tangles.</li>
            <li> Brushing or combing it after shampooing, I would always have knots (even with using other conditioners) that I would wind up pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is pin-straight, so I often worry about product weighing it down, but it&#x27;s never too bulky.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, so I dilute it down with at least 25% water which obviously makes it last longer.</li>
            <li> just a few drops sprayed through my hair will help get rid of the fizz and easier to style....</li>
            <li> It made my hair kind of sticky, and the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> Comes out just as slick as can be once this has been sprayed on.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount which adds body to my hair.</li>
            <li> A few spray each morning do the job!</li>
            <li> but I have thin wavy hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I cannot live with out this product!  I love how it makes my hair soft and manageable.  It also keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product but for my hair it works better in the summer but I have thin wavy hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for thin hair!</li>
            <li> Received correctly, as agreed. I recommend !!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Great for detangling.  Got many compliments on my hair looking shiny and healthy</li>
            <li> This product makes my tangle-prone hair easy to comb when wet. It also protects my color. If I don&#x27;t use it, my color doesn&#x27;t last a week. With it, even my stylist is surprised by how long the color stays vibrant.</li>
            <li> These products magnifica I love it its make my hair very soft and healthy I really recommend you going to see the different and the same day and you smell very good</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for my daughter, she has used it with great satisfaction.  She said, &amp;#34;this product gives my hair great shine and manageability&amp;#34;!  Her hair even looks thicker.</li>
            <li> This is so amazing! My hair is so pretty, shine and soft! For sure I&#x27;ll buy more!</li>
            <li> My looks and feel more health</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small spray on your hair after washing it to have it smelling delicious and so easy to brush.  It is great on hard to brush or tangled hair.  It is a must to have it.</li>
            <li> I read a customer review that they couldn&#x27;t stand the stench of this product. They pretty much stand alone on that opinion. Revlon Uniq One has a light scent that everyone compliments me on. It makes your hair soft, managable and it&#x27;s a leave in conditioner. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using UniqOne for almost two years now (which is probably the longest amount of time I&#x27;ve ever consistently used a hair product!). My hairdresser used it in her blowouts, and I always thought that it was one of those &amp;#34;only sold in salons&amp;#34; products that are super expensive so I never asked about it. I then won a gift basket from my salon, which had a bottle included in it -- I used it every day and was hooked! When I ran out, I googled it and found it on Amazon, and two years later I&#x27;m finally getting around to writing this review. Jeez!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this stuff, my hair feels so soft and silky, and I get almost no frizz at all. My hair is pin-straight, so I often worry about product weighing it down, but it&#x27;s never too bulky. I&#x27;ve found that I get much more benefit out of it when I blow-dry my hair rather than air-dry (but I think that&#x27;s the case with most hair products). Sometimes, the spray nozzle gets clogged because the product can be really thick; I find this happens more in the winter months and wish that they would change the bottle somewhat, but it hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem. If I&#x27;m running late I&#x27;ll just unscrew the top and put some in my hands the old-fashioned way.</li>
            <li> Detangles and conditions.  I would never be able to get a brush through my hair without Uniq One.</li>
            <li> excellent price for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it mostly in the summer when the heat and humidity make my curly hair difficult to manage. A few spray each morning do the job!</li>
            <li> I received the products on time, and everythings is ok. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is great! My hair is so shiny and soft. And also protected from the dryer heat. I really recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff in my hair!  Miracle stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product, make my hair so nice and soft like silk, my daughter loves it too. I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product is great - my shoulder length hair is fine and knots very easily. Brushing or combing it after shampooing, I would always have knots (even with using other conditioners) that I would wind up pulling out hair. My hairdresser used it on me - just a couple of spritzes - absolutely no tangles. The comb went right through. I purchased one bottle originally, 5 months ago and used it almost every day. It&#x27;s now just about gone. When I saw the dual package for sale, I just had to replenish my supply.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent conditioner. You spray it on after the shower, it moisturizes your hair and smells great! This was an incredible buy considering you get 2 bottles for the price of one!</li>
            <li> This is a great, no hassle conditioner for my very long and colored hair. I will certainly be back.</li>
            <li> It made my hair kind of sticky, and the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> The better product (plus shampoo of same line) for my hair in all the times!</li>
            <li> Very Nice product!! Delivery on time</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soo soft. Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The smell is too overwhelming. Imagine that and a perfume together... Yes, wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! This really does what it says!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I love it</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great to protect hair from heat. Leaves it shining and also for living in conditioning.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my hair easier to comb and also eliminates flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> everything went as expected, great seller</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it makes your hair so soft and smell good that makes you want to touch it all day long</li>
            <li> Underfull ! My hair love it !</li>
            <li> Love this leave in conditioner.  Helps eliminate breakage from blow drying, flat iron, or curling irons.  Feels like a lotion in your hair and makes hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a bottle of this product to try and it is amazing. It is very thick, so I dilute it down with at least 25% water which obviously makes it last longer. My stylist says my hair has never felt better or looked healthier. Usually I shower at night, put this on my wet hair and let it dry naturally overnight but it works great if I shower in the morning and blow dry my hair, too. I gave a bottle to my daughter-in-law to use on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair. She has a very tender head, and this product works like a dream to remove tangles without pain to her scalp.</li>
            <li> Great seller and awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff if u have dry hair or if u have hair with bleach fir highlights.</li>
