            <li>Packaging is super cute and perfect for a gift.</li>
            <li>think if you were to soak once a week, you&#x27;d have amazing skin.  </li>
            <li>I received these as a gift and they are amazing.</li>
            <li>and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>AmaZing product and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>The scents are so amazing and make me feel so relaxed.</li>
            <li>The smell of these kind of fuse together for me and are on the perfume side of scent.</li>
            <li>It was so nice and calming.</li>
            <li>They smell really nice and my skin feels like silk after the bath.</li>
            <li>They smell wonderful and really do help me relax.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m so happy to have found an organic product that has a beautiful natural scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had a strong but pleasant eucalyptus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made me smile at colors changing while beautiful fragrance was released.</li>
            <li>I love, love this product!</li>
            <li>but im sure they all will be amazing.</li>
            <li>The presentation was superb and I can tell they are natural.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love these!</li>
            <li>I could easily see myself gifting these to others, it would make a great gift for someone who loves to take a bath, and all the products are advertised as all natural ingredients, which is also great to know.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, smells great and was relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging for these bath bombs is really good looking, it comes in an earthy, cool looking box.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed he slept better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I love this company.  </li>
            <li>; are sure to help the days when lupus decides to flare.  </li>
            <li>If I had to pick a favorite (and trust me</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>BUT, I thought I would give this set a try in hopes that it&#x27;d sway me to love bath bombs once again.</li>
            <li>in, a potent smell start caressing your nose.</li>
            <li>The essential oils used are of top quality, making these bath bombs one of the best.</li>
            <li>regret purchasing these :)</li>
            <li>Love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>I can only RAVE about these wonderful bombs!</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the cheapest bombs out there, but for the quality of product you get, they&#x27;re awesome... definitely better than paying $24 for ONE chemical filled Lush bath bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And i love the fact that it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li>He also enjoyed watching the ball fizz in the water.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>have to get more.</li>
            <li>Something I love about this company is they always ship my order</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>these bath bombs are fantastic!</li>
            <li>The air jets released more of the lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the bath time ritual one.</li>
            <li>Maybe I can buy just my favorite ones in a six pack.</li>
            <li>Great package, natural scented bombs.. a ONEderful bath experience!!</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel super soft and smell delicious.</li>
            <li>They fizz beautifully and dissolve completely.</li>
            <li>Have tried other brands, but love these best.</li>
            <li>Well, these bath bombs took my bath to a whole new level of exquisite.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about them!</li>
            <li>I was so impressed by the other products from Beauty by Earth, that I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>Surely they make a great present</li>
            <li>These would also make really great presents for Christmas time or birthdays, they are very luxurious and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.. definitely going good to repurchase.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Plus we don&#x27;t take a bath every day, so it just makes it that much more special.</li>
            <li>What a nice soothing soak it was thanks to Beauty by Earth!</li>
            <li>packaging is also super cute</li>
            <li>The packaging is super cute and they smell divine.</li>
            <li>Just a couple of quick points about why THESE bath bombs are SO MUCH BETTER than anything else out there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scents are very strong comping out of the box, but in a good way- I cannot stand artificial fragrances etc, but these are just perfect once they make it into the water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazingly smooth and I felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li>nice smells!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My husband and I both enjoy these bath bombs from Beauty by Earth.  </li>
            <li>These bath bombs smell so good and make you feel so soft after soaking.</li>
            <li>I use almost zero scented products and I could tell right from opening it that this was not some yucky chemicals covered up with more yucky scented chemicals.</li>
            <li>They fizz up the bathtub very nicely, and I could smell the essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I received this very fast and have totally enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to try the others.</li>
            <li>Having never used bath bombs, I was excited to try them.</li>
            <li>Each bomb is about the size of a small apple, which I think is just the perfect size for a regular-sized bath tub.  </li>
            <li>I am 6 months pregnant and really enjoy a bath.</li>
            <li>The best part of my day is soaking in a bath after a hard day&#x27;s work and relaxing with my bath bomb.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing (for those who like the natural aromatherapy type smells).</li>
            <li>They smell great and left my body feeling relaxed and soft. :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re packaged very securely and were completely damage free when they arrived.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are a variety and after a hard day&#x27;s work in the garden, the &amp;#34;muscle relief&amp;#34; one will be a welcome addition to the bath.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, Beauty by Earth has yet again done an excellent job of keeping harmful chemicals away from my hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly, they are individually wrapped in plastic so they keep the wonderful fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oils don&#x27;t really soften my skin, either, and for the ring many of them leave, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really did relax me and left me smelling great too.</li>
            <li>They have been a huge hit with the whole family!</li>
            <li>They are wonderfully fizzy and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>The oils in the bath bombs made my skin feel silky smooth and the epsom salts were very relaxing.</li>
            <li>have used 2 of these bombs so far and been quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>Everything you expect from a bath bomb and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and it makes my skin so soft by the time I get out of the bath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 2 of the bath bombs so far and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>Nice packaging, affordable enough, and</li>
            <li>but these things are worth buying just to watch them dissolve.</li>
            <li>so I can let my 3 year old use one as well &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>They are not so good as I expected.</li>
            <li>It may seem like a lot to pay for a bath, but I say it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>Each Of them have left my skin soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li>The size of these bombs are great - but in comparison to Rejuvelle (which are significantly smaller) they seem to fizz for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>Very aromatherapeutic, and when I&#x27;m not using them, I actually store them in my closet, and they leave my clothes and towels nicely fragranced.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>:) I will definitely be reordering!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural which is always important to me.</li>
            <li>so my first experience was to see them use it.</li>
            <li>but I suggest gifting YOURSELF with them first.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>I got them yesterday and just gave the first one a try.</li>
            <li>in all, these are just okay, but I don&#x27;t love them enough to repurchase (hey, bath bombs are expensive - you should LOVE them, not just be okay with them).</li>
            <li>I just tried my first one yesterday which was &amp;#34;Just Relax&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils.</li>
            <li>Nothing broke in shipping and they are all so pretty in their box.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I had to turn most of them to read the labels and the wrappings were not secure to each bomb, as if they were quickly thrown in the box.</li>
            <li>Love the scents, not overwhelming but just right!</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t lose with this as a gift for your wife/gf.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying the rest in the box.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really differentiate one from another by smell</li>
            <li>I used the one called &amp;#34;bedtime ritual&amp;#34; with my 11 mo son and he slept very well afterwards.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>They also left my skin really smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They are very fun and relaxing to jse, especially aftter working 12 hour shifts!</li>
            <li>When they came in the mail I was so excited to open them because the box had their sent in them.</li>
            <li>had originally bought these to use as a present, but I ended up using them myself!</li>
            <li>There are several different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of bath bomb in here and they all smell different, and really good.  </li>
            <li>Scents are nice but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I normally buy bath bombs from Lush but decided to give these a try after seeing all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Strong,  but not overwhelming scent,  leaves my skin super soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a ton of residue in the tub.</li>
            <li>The packaging is simple yet intriguing, and the box smells divine.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a de-stresser on those very stressful days!</li>
            <li>Even my young girls want to use them!  </li>
            <li>Of course these are natural AND luxurious, the trademark of all Beauty by Earth products!</li>
            <li>I noticed that I barely even needed to use lotion as I normally do as my skin was so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>These make my skin so soft and I feel relaxed afterward.</li>
            <li>My husband even mentioned how soft</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried the Relaxing one and it was heavenly.  </li>
            <li>Everything from the packaging to the product itself feels (and smells) natural and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>also gave my 3 year old a bath with the Get</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a busy mom and don&#x27;t have time to go to a spa to unwind.</li>
            <li>put the rest of the bombs in various drawers in my bedroom and my linen closet until I&#x27;m ready for another bath.</li>
            <li>And - I can always trust Beauty by Earth to be organic and natural</li>
            <li>I called my husband in and we both sat there mesmerized followed by my 4 year old and 11 month old.</li>
            <li>I have used two of these bath bombs so far and all I can say is &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>my skin felt all soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Also, compared to bath bombs that you buy at Lush, these are a steal for $26.  </li>
            <li>If you buy bath bombs at Lush, you&#x27;ll pay $7-12 PER ONE bomb.  </li>
            <li>And the quality here is on par with Lush.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not a sissy but lives a hot bath after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>The oils left my skin feeling soft and NO RESIDUE in my bathtub!</li>
            <li>They work so well, that last night I had my 6 year old son who was complaining of</li>
            <li>Only tried one so far</li>
            <li>The fragrance is really nice and leaves your skin not only soft but with a faint scent of the fragrance from the bomb.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, my experience with other brands bath bombs have not been pleasant nor relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have only used one so far, but it left my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Anyways, the scent was just right and not overwhelming.</li>

            <li> The water, and room, smelled great, but if you&#x27;re a bubble bath person and not a Calgon person, these may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> The packaging is gorgeous, as always with this company.</li>
            <li> The ball was wrapped in plastic inside, which is a good thing so they don&#x27;t just fall apart.</li>
            <li> but my boyfriend loved them.</li>
            <li> These are great smelling and so nice in the bath.</li>

            <li> I received these as a gift and they are amazing.</li>
            <li> and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> AmaZing product and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The scents are so amazing and make me feel so relaxed.</li>
            <li> The smell of these kind of fuse together for me and are on the perfume side of scent.</li>
            <li> It was so nice and calming.</li>
            <li> They smell really nice and my skin feels like silk after the bath.</li>
            <li> They smell wonderful and really do help me relax.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m so happy to have found an organic product that has a beautiful natural scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had a strong but pleasant eucalyptus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made me smile at colors changing while beautiful fragrance was released.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product!</li>
            <li> but im sure they all will be amazing.</li>
            <li> The presentation was superb and I can tell they are natural.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these!</li>
            <li> I could easily see myself gifting these to others, it would make a great gift for someone who loves to take a bath, and all the products are advertised as all natural ingredients, which is also great to know.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, smells great and was relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging for these bath bombs is really good looking, it comes in an earthy, cool looking box.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed he slept better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I love this company.  </li>
            <li> ; are sure to help the days when lupus decides to flare.  </li>
            <li> If I had to pick a favorite (and trust me</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> BUT, I thought I would give this set a try in hopes that it&#x27;d sway me to love bath bombs once again.</li>
            <li> in, a potent smell start caressing your nose.</li>
            <li> The essential oils used are of top quality, making these bath bombs one of the best.</li>
            <li> regret purchasing these :)</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product.</li>
            <li> I can only RAVE about these wonderful bombs!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the cheapest bombs out there, but for the quality of product you get, they&#x27;re awesome... definitely better than paying $24 for ONE chemical filled Lush bath bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And i love the fact that it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li> He also enjoyed watching the ball fizz in the water.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> have to get more.</li>
            <li> Something I love about this company is they always ship my order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> these bath bombs are fantastic!</li>
            <li> The air jets released more of the lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the bath time ritual one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can buy just my favorite ones in a six pack.</li>
            <li> Great package, natural scented bombs.. a ONEderful bath experience!!</li>
            <li> They make your skin feel super soft and smell delicious.</li>
            <li> They fizz beautifully and dissolve completely.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands, but love these best.</li>
            <li> Well, these bath bombs took my bath to a whole new level of exquisite.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about them!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by the other products from Beauty by Earth, that I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li> Surely they make a great present</li>
            <li> These would also make really great presents for Christmas time or birthdays, they are very luxurious and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.. definitely going good to repurchase.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Plus we don&#x27;t take a bath every day, so it just makes it that much more special.</li>
            <li> What a nice soothing soak it was thanks to Beauty by Earth!</li>
            <li> packaging is also super cute</li>
            <li> The packaging is super cute and they smell divine.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of quick points about why THESE bath bombs are SO MUCH BETTER than anything else out there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scents are very strong comping out of the box, but in a good way- I cannot stand artificial fragrances etc, but these are just perfect once they make it into the water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin felt amazingly smooth and I felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li> nice smells!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both enjoy these bath bombs from Beauty by Earth.  </li>
            <li> These bath bombs smell so good and make you feel so soft after soaking.</li>
            <li> I use almost zero scented products and I could tell right from opening it that this was not some yucky chemicals covered up with more yucky scented chemicals.</li>
            <li> They fizz up the bathtub very nicely, and I could smell the essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I received this very fast and have totally enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to try the others.</li>
            <li> Having never used bath bombs, I was excited to try them.</li>
            <li> Each bomb is about the size of a small apple, which I think is just the perfect size for a regular-sized bath tub.  </li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and really enjoy a bath.</li>
            <li> The best part of my day is soaking in a bath after a hard day&#x27;s work and relaxing with my bath bomb.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing (for those who like the natural aromatherapy type smells).</li>
            <li> They smell great and left my body feeling relaxed and soft. :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re packaged very securely and were completely damage free when they arrived.  </li>
            <li> I love that there are a variety and after a hard day&#x27;s work in the garden, the &amp;#34;muscle relief&amp;#34; one will be a welcome addition to the bath.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, Beauty by Earth has yet again done an excellent job of keeping harmful chemicals away from my hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, they are individually wrapped in plastic so they keep the wonderful fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oils don&#x27;t really soften my skin, either, and for the ring many of them leave, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really did relax me and left me smelling great too.</li>
            <li> They have been a huge hit with the whole family!</li>
            <li> They are wonderfully fizzy and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The oils in the bath bombs made my skin feel silky smooth and the epsom salts were very relaxing.</li>
            <li> have used 2 of these bombs so far and been quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> Everything you expect from a bath bomb and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and it makes my skin so soft by the time I get out of the bath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 of the bath bombs so far and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> Nice packaging, affordable enough, and</li>
            <li> but these things are worth buying just to watch them dissolve.</li>
            <li> so I can let my 3 year old use one as well &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> They are not so good as I expected.</li>
            <li> It may seem like a lot to pay for a bath, but I say it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> Each Of them have left my skin soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li> The size of these bombs are great - but in comparison to Rejuvelle (which are significantly smaller) they seem to fizz for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> Very aromatherapeutic, and when I&#x27;m not using them, I actually store them in my closet, and they leave my clothes and towels nicely fragranced.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> :) I will definitely be reordering!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural which is always important to me.</li>
            <li> so my first experience was to see them use it.</li>
            <li> but I suggest gifting YOURSELF with them first.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> I got them yesterday and just gave the first one a try.</li>
            <li> in all, these are just okay, but I don&#x27;t love them enough to repurchase (hey, bath bombs are expensive - you should LOVE them, not just be okay with them).</li>
            <li> I just tried my first one yesterday which was &amp;#34;Just Relax&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils.</li>
            <li> Nothing broke in shipping and they are all so pretty in their box.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I had to turn most of them to read the labels and the wrappings were not secure to each bomb, as if they were quickly thrown in the box.</li>
            <li> Love the scents, not overwhelming but just right!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t lose with this as a gift for your wife/gf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying the rest in the box.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really differentiate one from another by smell</li>
            <li> I used the one called &amp;#34;bedtime ritual&amp;#34; with my 11 mo son and he slept very well afterwards.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> They also left my skin really smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They are very fun and relaxing to jse, especially aftter working 12 hour shifts!</li>
            <li> When they came in the mail I was so excited to open them because the box had their sent in them.</li>
            <li> had originally bought these to use as a present, but I ended up using them myself!</li>
            <li> There are several different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of bath bomb in here and they all smell different, and really good.  </li>
            <li> Scents are nice but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I normally buy bath bombs from Lush but decided to give these a try after seeing all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Strong,  but not overwhelming scent,  leaves my skin super soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a ton of residue in the tub.</li>
            <li> The packaging is simple yet intriguing, and the box smells divine.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a de-stresser on those very stressful days!</li>
            <li> Even my young girls want to use them!  </li>
            <li> Of course these are natural AND luxurious, the trademark of all Beauty by Earth products!</li>
            <li> I noticed that I barely even needed to use lotion as I normally do as my skin was so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> These make my skin so soft and I feel relaxed afterward.</li>
            <li> My husband even mentioned how soft</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried the Relaxing one and it was heavenly.  </li>
            <li> Everything from the packaging to the product itself feels (and smells) natural and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> also gave my 3 year old a bath with the Get</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a busy mom and don&#x27;t have time to go to a spa to unwind.</li>
            <li> put the rest of the bombs in various drawers in my bedroom and my linen closet until I&#x27;m ready for another bath.</li>
            <li> And - I can always trust Beauty by Earth to be organic and natural</li>
            <li> I called my husband in and we both sat there mesmerized followed by my 4 year old and 11 month old.</li>
            <li> I have used two of these bath bombs so far and all I can say is &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> my skin felt all soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Also, compared to bath bombs that you buy at Lush, these are a steal for $26.  </li>
            <li> If you buy bath bombs at Lush, you&#x27;ll pay $7-12 PER ONE bomb.  </li>
            <li> And the quality here is on par with Lush.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not a sissy but lives a hot bath after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> The oils left my skin feeling soft and NO RESIDUE in my bathtub!</li>
            <li> They work so well, that last night I had my 6 year old son who was complaining of</li>
            <li> Only tried one so far</li>
            <li> The fragrance is really nice and leaves your skin not only soft but with a faint scent of the fragrance from the bomb.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my experience with other brands bath bombs have not been pleasant nor relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have only used one so far, but it left my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Anyways, the scent was just right and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> As with all other Beauty by Earth products, these suckers aren&#x27;t made with cheap chemical substitutes, or over-perfumed junk.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than some of the ones in big department stores, so you can use the entire thing without feeling like you are wasting this huge and expensive bath bomb.  </li>
            <li> prefer Rejuvelle, where they may be smaller (but still fizz just as long</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really an avid bath bomb lover due to my past experiences with other brands bath bomb products.</li>
            <li> when I started using &amp;#34;Bath Bomb&amp;#34; my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and was noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a real &amp;#34;bath person&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li> But again, I&#x27;m not a real bath person.  </li>
            <li> I think expected fizz and bubbles, but with these (and all?)</li>
            <li> bigger issues here are that some of these contain dried herbs of sorts that leave a residue in the tub that then looks like dirt.</li>
            <li> Other bath bombs I&#x27;ve tried in the past have left me sneezing and scrubbing a film off of my tub.</li>
            <li> Not exactly relaxing.</li>
            <li> and I usually get it the next day.  </li>
            <li> They fizz and dissolve immediately and don&#x27;t leave sand like particles like other bath bombs I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Each bath bomb comes separately wrapped, and they look like an ultra expensive set you would find in an upscale boutique, but they are completely affordable.  </li>
            <li> The other brands I&#x27;ve tried before crumbled almost immediately and made a nasty fluorescent-colored mess in the tub &amp; the scent was almost unbearably powerful.</li>
            <li> A real hidden treasure.</li>
            <li> Well Soon ball since he&#x27;s got a small cough</li>
            <li> I like to send my boyfriend small random gifts since we are stationed in different countries</li>
            <li> knowing they only use organic ingredients, and there&#x27;s not any artificial coloring used.</li>
            <li> it to have high quality ingredients and no chemical crap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to pick just 1!)</li>
            <li> Anxious to try the others!!</li>
            <li> In addition the everything positive, it DID NOT leave a nasty residue behind!  </li>
            <li> The tough decision for me will be whether to share (or not to share!)</li>
            <li> When I did, I was s bit disappointed as the &amp;#34;bombs&amp;#34; were sloppily wrapped and placed in the box.</li>
            <li> I also like that these products are earth-friendly and do not contain artificial dyes or any ingredients that I would not want on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed by a product</li>
            <li> I am someone who enjoys taking baths but hate the feeling of my skin when I use bath products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really loved this product. I am 6 months pregnant and really enjoy a bath. These make my skin so soft and I feel relaxed afterward. They work so well, that last night I had my 6 year old son who was complaining of lag pain use one. He loved it and I noticed he slept better. Now my only problem is him not using them all!</li>
            <li> So a friend of mine gave me one of these.  I&#x27;m not a real &amp;#34;bath person&amp;#34; but I thought,&amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; and used it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It felt awesome soaking in it.  Real refreshing.  But again, I&#x27;m not a real bath person.  The real great thing on this was afterwards.  My skin felt amazingly smooth and I felt cleaner.  My husband even mentioned how soft my skin was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you were to soak once a week, you&#x27;d have amazing skin.  On any future baths, I&#x27;d definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> Great for relaxing!! Love the scents, not overwhelming but just right! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Fizzys are MARVELOUS! Made me smile at colors changing while beautiful fragrance was released. I used the &amp;#34;Get Well Soon&amp;#34;. Anxious to try the others!!</li>
            <li> Awesome soaps! Would be excellent as a gift too. Great packing and presentation.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice smells!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried the Relaxing one and it was heavenly.  Actually felt relaxed afterwards.  Beautiful packaging too, would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> I decided to soak in the tub this morning using one of the amazing bath bombs! What a nice soothing soak it was thanks to Beauty by Earth!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I love this company.  I have yet to be disappointed by a product &amp; I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;I have used 2 of these bombs so far and been quite pleased.  Strong,  but not overwhelming scent,  leaves my skin super soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a ton of residue in the tub. Everything you expect from a bath bomb and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Oh, what a treat this will be!  Everything from the packaging to the product itself feels (and smells) natural and luxurious.  I love that there are a variety and after a hard day&#x27;s work in the garden, the &amp;#34;muscle relief&amp;#34; one will be a welcome addition to the bath.  &amp;#34;Joint relief&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Get well soon&amp;#34; are sure to help the days when lupus decides to flare.  The tough decision for me will be whether to share (or not to share!) my find with my besties.</li>
            <li> Let me just say how much I love these!! I cannot say enough good things about them! :) I will definitely be reordering! I feel so great knowing they only use organic ingredients, and there&#x27;s not any artificial coloring used. They fizz up perfectly and the smell is absolutely wonderful!!! If I had to pick a favorite (and trust me it&#x27;s so hard to pick just 1!) I&#x27;d pick the &amp;#34;just relax&amp;#34;. I love how it smells and it makes my skin so soft by the time I get out of the bath. Definitely a de-stresser on those very stressful days! :) LOVE this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried this bath bomb gift set I wasn&#x27;t really an avid bath bomb lover due to my past experiences with other brands bath bomb products. The other brands I&#x27;ve tried before crumbled almost immediately and made a nasty fluorescent-colored mess in the tub &amp; the scent was almost unbearably powerful. Needless to say, my experience with other brands bath bombs have not been pleasant nor relaxing. BUT, I thought I would give this set a try in hopes that it&#x27;d sway me to love bath bombs once again. &amp; I am happy to say I AM A BATH BOMB LOVER ONCE AGAIN! :)</li>
            <li> I received these as a gift and they are amazing. They make your skin feel super soft and smell delicious. If you like aromatherapy and baths these bath bombs are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also super cute so they make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Beauty by Earth bath bombs are pleasureful. The minute you crack open the sumptuous package it arrives  in, a potent smell start caressing your nose. The essential oils used are of top quality, making these bath bombs one of the best. A real hidden treasure. GET THESE!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivered on time</li>
            <li> Love these! I just used the Bedtime Ritual ball and it was amazing. Exactly what I needed, smells great and was relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also gave my 3 year old a bath with the Get Well Soon ball since he&#x27;s got a small cough and he played with it as it fizzed and dissolved and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy these again and I&#x27;m excited to try the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 of the bath bombs so far and absolutely love them.  They fizz and dissolve immediately and don&#x27;t leave sand like particles like other bath bombs I&#x27;ve used in the past. The fragrance is really nice and leaves your skin not only soft but with a faint scent of the fragrance from the bomb. The ingredients are all natural which is always important to me. Lastly, they are individually wrapped in plastic so they keep the wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t regret purchasing these :)</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t lose with this as a gift for your wife/gf. Nice packaging, affordable enough, and with 6 of &#x27;em you get some mileage out of the experience you&#x27;re proffering.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a housewarming gift. The packaging is super cute and they smell divine. They have been a huge hit with the whole family! I am now ordering them for myself. This is the perfect gift, I am also ordering them for myself!</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product. From the box, to the packaging, the smell and the way it leaves you feeling after a bath. AmaZing product and would recommend to anyone. Great gifts for coworkers, family and friends. Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li> I received this very fast and have totally enjoyed using it.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> These Bath Bombs are the Bomb! No chemicals, natrially scented and so luxurious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a busy mom and don&#x27;t have time to go to a spa to unwind. With these amazing bath bombs I can have my own organic spa in my very own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most bath products are over purfumed and have a ton of chemicals in them. So I&#x27;m so happy to have found an organic product that has a beautiful natural scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is gorgeous. I&#x27;ll definitely be giving these away to my fellow mommy friends. Love, love, love these!</li>
            <li> I can only RAVE about these wonderful bombs! Immediately after getting them the wonderful smell hit me and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get in the bath with them. Of course before I could do that, my kids demanded that I give them one (I shouldn&#x27;t have let them smell the package!!!) so my first experience was to see them use it. They now want one every day... But finally my time came later in the evening and I thoroughly enjoyed it! We tried the relaxing ones and I can&#x27;t wait to try all of them! Surely they make a great present but I suggest gifting YOURSELF with them first.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of quick points about why THESE bath bombs are SO MUCH BETTER than anything else out there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They&#x27;re chemical-free. As with all other Beauty by Earth products, these suckers aren&#x27;t made with cheap chemical substitutes, or over-perfumed junk. Seriously, Beauty by Earth has yet again done an excellent job of keeping harmful chemicals away from my hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They&#x27;re affordable. These aren&#x27;t the cheapest bombs out there, but for the quality of product you get, they&#x27;re awesome... definitely better than paying $24 for ONE chemical filled Lush bath bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They work. No, these aren&#x27;t bubble bath, and they&#x27;re not a salt either. They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to. I get out of my bath feeling relaxed and revived, every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are the best! Once again, GREAT JOB Beauty by Earth!</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the box itself smelled heavenly! I couldn&#x27;t wait to open the box! When I did, I was s bit disappointed as the &amp;#34;bombs&amp;#34; were sloppily wrapped and placed in the box. I had to turn most of them to read the labels and the wrappings were not secure to each bomb, as if they were quickly thrown in the box. But they still smelled wonderful! Having never used bath bombs, I was excited to try them. This is where expectations don&#x27;t meet reality. I think expected fizz and bubbles, but with these (and all?) bath bombs you get neither. The best way I can describe them is Calgon in a ball. The water, and room, smelled great, but if you&#x27;re a bubble bath person and not a Calgon person, these may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;I put the rest of the bombs in various drawers in my bedroom and my linen closet until I&#x27;m ready for another bath. They smell great!</li>
            <li> This is a great gift.  Comes beautifully packaged with each bath bomb wrapped and labeled.  Each one has a different aroma and different healing properties!  And - I can always trust Beauty by Earth to be organic and natural so I am not putting petroleum products in my body!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where to start!  The packaging is simple yet intriguing, and the box smells divine.  Each bath bomb comes separately wrapped, and they look like an ultra expensive set you would find in an upscale boutique, but they are completely affordable.  They are wonderfully fizzy and long lasting.  Even my young girls want to use them!  I&#x27;ll definitely be making my next purchase soon.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! They smell great and left my body feeling relaxed and soft. :)</li>
            <li> Love these and they smell soooo good!</li>
            <li> Great package, natural scented bombs.. a ONEderful bath experience!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I have never been a big fan of bath bombs. I was so impressed by the other products from Beauty by Earth, that I decided to give them a try. I got them yesterday and just gave the first one a try. I was starting to get a bit of the sniffles and so used the Get Well Soon eucalyptus one. The packaging is gorgeous, as always with this company. The ball was wrapped in plastic inside, which is a good thing so they don&#x27;t just fall apart. I use almost zero scented products and I could tell right from opening it that this was not some yucky chemicals covered up with more yucky scented chemicals. It had a strong but pleasant eucalyptus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s totally beside the point but these things are worth buying just to watch them dissolve. I called my husband in and we both sat there mesmerized followed by my 4 year old and 11 month old. We decided it looks like a comet if you shish it around. Anyways, the scent was just right and not overwhelming. The oils left my skin feeling soft and NO RESIDUE in my bathtub! Other bath bombs I&#x27;ve tried in the past have left me sneezing and scrubbing a film off of my tub. Not exactly relaxing. I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying the rest in the box. These would also make really great presents for Christmas time or birthdays, they are very luxurious and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am someone who enjoys taking baths but hate the feeling of my skin when I use bath products. when I started using &amp;#34;Bath Bomb&amp;#34; my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and was noticeably softer. I love the way my bath smells! In addition the everything positive, it DID NOT leave a nasty residue behind!  This is a must try!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and i love it! Only tried one so far but im sure they all will be amazing. Packaging is super cute and perfect for a gift. The smell is amazing (for those who like the natural aromatherapy type smells). And i love the fact that it&#x27;s organic so I can let my 3 year old use one as well &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.. definitely going good to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Bought as gifts. Recipients loved it! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much! These are the BOMB!</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I like to send my boyfriend small random gifts since we are stationed in different countries so I personally didn&#x27;t get to try these but my boyfriend loved them. They are relaxing, don&#x27;t have a feminine smell and don&#x27;t leave the tub stained.</li>
            <li> They are not so good as I expected. The smell is not so nature, some smell like a soap or cleaner.</li>
            <li> The size of these bombs are great - but in comparison to Rejuvelle (which are significantly smaller) they seem to fizz for the same amount of time. The smell of these kind of fuse together for me and are on the perfume side of scent. I couldn&#x27;t really differentiate one from another by smell (maybe the Get Well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bigger issues here are that some of these contain dried herbs of sorts that leave a residue in the tub that then looks like dirt. The oils don&#x27;t really soften my skin, either, and for the ring many of them leave, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Rejuvelle, where they may be smaller (but still fizz just as long it seems) but they have no color and each smells completely different and like essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these are just okay, but I don&#x27;t love them enough to repurchase (hey, bath bombs are expensive - you should LOVE them, not just be okay with them).</li>
            <li> Baths are always wonderful, and we all need more.  Well, these bath bombs took my bath to a whole new level of exquisite.  The scents are soothing and delicious.  Of course these are natural AND luxurious, the trademark of all Beauty by Earth products!</li>
            <li> I have used two of these bath bombs so far and all I can say is &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34;. The oils in the bath bombs made my skin feel silky smooth and the epsom salts were very relaxing. I used the one called &amp;#34;bedtime ritual&amp;#34; with my 11 mo son and he slept very well afterwards. He also enjoyed watching the ball fizz in the water. It may seem like a lot to pay for a bath, but I say it&#x27;s well worth it to have high quality ingredients and no chemical crap. Plus we don&#x27;t take a bath every day, so it just makes it that much more special.</li>
            <li> These bath bombs smell amazing! When they came in the mail I was so excited to open them because the box had their sent in them. I just tried my first one yesterday which was &amp;#34;Just Relax&amp;#34;. It was so nice and calming. I love essential oils. I personally use DoTerra oils all the time so when I saw that these bombs were made with essential oils I wanted them. They are also made with organic ingredients. When I got out of the bath my skin felt all soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Yes yes yes. Love these. The scents are very strong comping out of the box, but in a good way- I cannot stand artificial fragrances etc, but these are just perfect once they make it into the water.&lt;br /&gt;I had originally bought these to use as a present, but I ended up using them myself! haha&lt;br /&gt;Will have to get more.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product! I ordered them and got them the next day. Something I love about this company is they always ship my order asap and I usually get it the next day.  The packaging for these bath bombs is really good looking, it comes in an earthy, cool looking box.  The weight of the box was substantial, and each bath bomb feels substantial in the hand.  They&#x27;re packaged very securely and were completely damage free when they arrived.  I have been using them every day to relax, and am very pleased.  There are several different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of bath bomb in here and they all smell different, and really good.  They fizz up the bathtub very nicely, and I could smell the essential oils.  They also left my skin really smooth.  I could easily see myself gifting these to others, it would make a great gift for someone who loves to take a bath, and all the products are advertised as all natural ingredients, which is also great to know.  I can also see myself ordering these for myself in the future.  Also, compared to bath bombs that you buy at Lush, these are a steal for $26.  You get 6 bath bombs for $26, which basically comes out to $4 each. If you buy bath bombs at Lush, you&#x27;ll pay $7-12 PER ONE bomb.  And the quality here is on par with Lush.  All in all, I give this product 5/5 stars and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these bath bombs! The scents are so amazing and make me feel so relaxed. I love the muscle relaxing one the best. It really did relax me and left me smelling great too. And they all come. Individually wrapped in plastic and then in paper. Nothing broke in shipping and they are all so pretty in their box. I almost didn&#x27;t want to use them. Lol.</li>
            <li> Great smelling bath bombs in a cute package.  I have only used one so far, but it left my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;Does not create bubbles, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> These are great smelling and so nice in the bath. I thought they&#x27;d be a great Fathers Day gift so I got some for the hubby. He&#x27;s not a sissy but lives a hot bath after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> I normally buy bath bombs from Lush but decided to give these a try after seeing all the positive reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad I did-- these bath bombs are fantastic! Each is individually beautifully wrapped, and they are very strongly scented and soothing.  Very aromatherapeutic, and when I&#x27;m not using them, I actually store them in my closet, and they leave my clothes and towels nicely fragranced.  Each bomb is about the size of a small apple, which I think is just the perfect size for a regular-sized bath tub.  I also like that these products are earth-friendly and do not contain artificial dyes or any ingredients that I would not want on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this for myself time and again.  This will also be my go-to present when the holidays this year come around!  Treat yourself to a bath with these-- you won&#x27;t want to get out of the tub!</li>
            <li> I really love these! They are very fun and relaxing to jse, especially aftter working 12 hour shifts! These bath bombs smell so good and make you feel so soft after soaking. Will definitly be buying more when mine run out!</li>
            <li> Great Gift Item for Men and Women! Scents are great and packaging is A+.</li>
            <li> Got these for my husband and he loves them!  They are smaller than some of the ones in big department stores, so you can use the entire thing without feeling like you are wasting this huge and expensive bath bomb.  Scents are nice but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> These bath bombs are the bomb! Each Of them have left my skin soft and smelling great. I noticed that I barely even needed to use lotion as I normally do as my skin was so soft and moisturized. They were so relaxing and I will definitely continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged!  They smell really nice and my skin feels like silk after the bath. Love them!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both enjoy these bath bombs from Beauty by Earth.  They fizz beautifully and dissolve completely. The fragrance reminds me of a  mixture of flowers, soap and essential oils. The box warns not to use with jacuzzi jets on, but we have an air jet tub and decided to try it. The air jets released more of the lovely fragrance. Overall a great product and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product! Great ingredients, lovely and luxurious. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> The bath bombs make me feel like I am at the spa. They smell wonderful and really do help me relax. When I get out of the tub my skin is so soft. This makes a great gift!!!</li>
            <li> This set of Bath Bombs is a great buy. They are as described and do as what I thought they would do. Very pleased with them. Have tried other brands, but love these best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with these. The presentation was superb and I can tell they are natural. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong. My favorite is the bath time ritual one. The best part of my day is soaking in a bath after a hard day&#x27;s work and relaxing with my bath bomb. I recommend trying these. Maybe I can buy just my favorite ones in a six pack. Thanks.</li>
