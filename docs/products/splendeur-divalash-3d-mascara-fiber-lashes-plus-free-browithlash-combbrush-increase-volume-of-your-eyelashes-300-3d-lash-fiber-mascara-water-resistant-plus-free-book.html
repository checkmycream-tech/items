            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>And as a doctor,always making sure ingredients are safe,yep,they are!</li>
            <li>glad i found it!</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing and enhances the eyes in a way that it makes your eyes &#x27;pop&#x27; and be highlighted on your face.  </li>
            <li>so well it is just amazing.</li>
            <li>My own eyelashes fell out in clumps.</li>
            <li>I applied the DivaLash gel and fibers directly to my own lashes.</li>
            <li>I showed my boyfriend and he liked how my eyes looked.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product and liked it.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it looks perfectly natural.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says I have beautiful  lashes now way better than YOUNIQUE  Mascara.  </li>
            <li>Once on, it lasts all day :)</li>
            <li>In all my years searching for the perfect mascara to lengthen the look of my lashes such that I would look like the ads they show in the magazines...to this day I have never found a Mascara alone to lengthen my lashes the way this product does.  </li>
            <li>You really notice the results immediately and even though the video for Splendeur is great...</li>
            <li>love it telling all my friends</li>
            <li>For sure.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look fuller and longer and overall beautiful!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the perfect mascara, it&#x27;s definitely this one!</li>
            <li>I thought after reading the reviews this product would be better than it is.</li>
            <li>i just LOVE LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>Long &amp; beautiful lashes!!!  </li>
            <li>But we both found it super easy to apply and you can control the length and fullness depending on how many coats.</li>
            <li>The fiber is feather light and sticks to the gel without clumping like mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much:).</li>
            <li>I ordered  two more since my first order.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>a little practice, it is easy to get good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very please!!</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>A 4th swipe is only to be sure that it all came off in 3!  </li>
            <li>After trying this product, all I can say is WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Its nice to use even if your in a hurry because it takes only seconds to apply!</li>
            <li>I used my normal eye make-up remover to remove it and it came off easily.</li>
            <li>My husband noticed the volume and length increase right away.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t find that any mascara alone can ever do the eyes justice compared to what I have seen this full lash lengthening product to do in a way that is simple and elegant.  </li>
            <li>Have used 3 different kinds, but this mascara seems to work the best and be less clumpy</li>
            <li>it is well worth the extra time and attention (and only maybe a minute or two more added to the process)as well as minimal cost for achieving the most Spectacular Results I have ever seen with any product on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>and I called my sister who always wear fake lashes to tell her how amazing my lashes look!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and enhances the lashes big time.  </li>
            <li>Customer service ie very polite and have friendly voice when i called for item mixed up!!i highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Women of all ages will absolutely adore the results from Splendeur.</li>
            <li>It was simple to apply and the length and volume of my lashes increased tremendously.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my eyelashes have almost disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>It took a little bit more time to apply than my normal mascara</li>
            <li>In the evening when I washed my face, the DivaLash took just a little bit more time to remove than my normal mascara.</li>
            <li>It make my lashes full &amp; long!!</li>
            <li>comparison I got a similar darkening/thickening effect with my now 2nd favorite mascara using several coats.  </li>
            <li>As someone who is making Youtube videos and webinars my lashes sure looked &amp;#34;lame&amp;#34; on camera and falsies were out due not only to damage to existing eyelashes but due to toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I wear it every day now and it makes my eyes really stand out with minimal make up.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any mascara, I just put the gel on my bare lashes and that alone made my thin lashes look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>If you want the really dramatic look your gunna have to apply more than one layer of the gel and fibers.</li>
            <li>The price compared to other similar products is decent!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fibers wash away with only a little more effort than the usual eye</li>

            <li> … Really takes very little time to apply the layers, and sometimes I don’t use my mascara 1st</li>
            <li> Splendeur DivaLash 3D is a good alternative to false eyelashes, which can be bothersome to apply and even worse to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looking around, everyone has long lashes, it&#x27;s the craze now.  </li>
            <li> I already had long lashes but this product made my lashes fuller.</li>
            <li> I returned this item, it was not what I expected it was flaky and left residue on my face.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how my thin little lashes became thick, full and natural looking.  </li>
            <li> but you need to do it a few times to actually see a difference.</li>
            <li> I wish I could take a picture, but is unable right now.</li>
            <li> He said my eyes looked natural, not that heavy dark look of false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of mascara, but its messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two tubes and applicators:  one of a wax-based gel adhesive and another with green tea fibers.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not sure if it&#x27;s just the tube I received</li>
            <li> But I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do the false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It hurts so bad and ruins my makeup.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I could not wear fake lashes because the glue irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> No need for false eyelashes, 3D fiber mascara is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Makes putting fake eye lashes on look tedious!</li>
            <li> you will not be unhappy if you buy this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate that I trusted in a product I never heard of.</li>
            <li> but after applying the product it will clump horribly and flake off into my eye!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product is good but you need to do it a few times to actually see a difference. Once on, it lasts all day :)&lt;br /&gt;I did not have a problem with flaking or pieces.</li>
            <li> My own eyelashes fell out in clumps. I absolutely hate that I trusted in a product I never heard of.</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed with this product. In all my years searching for the perfect mascara to lengthen the look of my lashes such that I would look like the ads they show in the magazines...to this day I have never found a Mascara alone to lengthen my lashes the way this product does.  And the Mascaras that are marketed with the supposed ability to lengthen and elongate the lashes as this product does...either are too clumpy on the eyes or simply don&#x27;t get the results they profess to have the ability to achieve.  Even though it is a three step process with your mascara and both of these tubes in the Splendeur Case...it is well worth the extra time and attention (and only maybe a minute or two more added to the process)as well as minimal cost for achieving the most Spectacular Results I have ever seen with any product on my lashes.  You really notice the results immediately and even though the video for Splendeur is great...any photography can never do it justice to witness what the results look like in person.  It is truly amazing and enhances the eyes in a way that it makes your eyes &#x27;pop&#x27; and be highlighted on your face.  I just don&#x27;t find that any mascara alone can ever do the eyes justice compared to what I have seen this full lash lengthening product to do in a way that is simple and elegant.  Splendeur is Nothing Short of A-maz-ing!!! Women of all ages will absolutely adore the results from Splendeur.</li>
            <li> When I received my DivaLash I was anxious to use it so I applied it the next morning. It took a little bit more time to apply than my normal mascara but it was well worth it. It was simple to apply and the length and volume of my lashes increased tremendously. I applied the DivaLash gel and fibers directly to my own lashes. The best part is that it looks perfectly natural. My husband noticed the volume and length increase right away. In the evening when I washed my face, the DivaLash took just a little bit more time to remove than my normal mascara. I used my normal eye make-up remover to remove it and it came off easily. I love this product!</li>
            <li> love it telling all my friends</li>
            <li> I really like this product! Makes putting fake eye lashes on look tedious! If you want the really dramatic look your gunna have to apply more than one layer of the gel and fibers. Its nice to use even if your in a hurry because it takes only seconds to apply! Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This stuff is FABULOUS!!!! Long &amp; beautiful lashes!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Easy to use and enhances the lashes big time.  Highly recommend.  If you follow the instructions you don&#x27;t get tarantula eyes.  If you want a mascara that kicks the eyes up - get this one!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara! I have tried many different brands. DivaLash will add both volume and great length. I will order again!</li>
            <li> As someone who is making Youtube videos and webinars my lashes sure looked &amp;#34;lame&amp;#34; on camera and falsies were out due not only to damage to existing eyelashes but due to toxic ingredients. This product works and works so well it is just amazing. And as a doctor,always making sure ingredients are safe,yep,they are! Whoopee! drkimsagewellsolutions</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and a friend to try. I am a make up person she isn&#x27; t. But we both found it super easy to apply and you can control the length and fullness depending on how many coats. I will definitely order again. I wear it every day now and it makes my eyes really stand out with minimal make up. The price compared to other similar products is decent!</li>
            <li> Great company very true to your satisfaction</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME! I ordered  two more since my first order.  It does exactly what it says I have beautiful  lashes now way better than YOUNIQUE  Mascara.  For sure.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my eyelashes have almost disappeared.  I have given up and just accepted this as an aging thing that my eyelashes have thinned out.  Looking around, everyone has long lashes, it&#x27;s the craze now.  But I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do the false eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve tried all types of mascara, but its messy. So I heard about this 3D fiber mascara and it sounded different than regular mascara.  I was skeptical, but gave it a try.  WOW!!  I was amazed how my thin little lashes became thick, full and natural looking.  I didn&#x27;t use any mascara, I just put the gel on my bare lashes and that alone made my thin lashes look healthy and shiny. Then I brushed the fiber over the gel which added texture making my lashes longer and fuller.  AMAZING!!  I showed my boyfriend and he liked how my eyes looked.  He said my eyes looked natural, not that heavy dark look of false eyelashes.  The fiber is feather light and sticks to the gel without clumping like mascara.  Each lash is plumped up not clumped up!  I wear contacts so I was worried that the fiber would get in my eyes. AMAZING again!! The fiber sticks to the gel, there&#x27;s no residue floating on my contact lenses.  My boyfriend is happy with how my eyes look and I am very happy how my eyes look.  No need for false eyelashes, 3D fiber mascara is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! It makes my lashes look fuller and longer and overall beautiful! If you are looking for the perfect mascara, it&#x27;s definitely this one!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and liked it. I already had long lashes but this product made my lashes fuller.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much:). Cannot leave the house without this product on my eyelashes!! It make my lashes full &amp; long!! I am very please!! Customer service ie very polite and have friendly voice when i called for item mixed up!!i highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I thought after reading the reviews this product would be better than it is. I&#x27;m Not sure if it&#x27;s just the tube I received but after applying the product it will clump horribly and flake off into my eye! It hurts so bad and ruins my makeup. Almost like expired mascara. Oh and it&#x27;s definitely not waterproof..</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are almost nonexistent and I had no luck with lengthening mascaras. I could not wear fake lashes because the glue irritated my eyes. After trying this product, all I can say is WOW!!!!! I have lashes again!!!! I wish I could take a picture, but is unable right now. I was so excited and I called my sister who always wear fake lashes to tell her how amazing my lashes look!! Now, she want to place an order. It only takes a couple of minutes to apply it, along with one coat of your regular mascara. Also, it washes off with no problem. Later, I will post a picture, but in the meantime, I&#x27;m putting this on my list!</li>
            <li> Have used 3 different kinds, but this mascara seems to work the best and be less clumpy</li>
            <li> I returned this item, it was not what I expected it was flaky and left residue on my face.</li>
            <li> i just LOVE LOVE this mascara. you will not be unhappy if you buy this product. it does work like it says!! i will always purchase this product from now on. glad i found it! thanks!!</li>

They are applied after applying regular mascara and waiting for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little practice, it is easy to get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fibers wash away with only a little more effort than the usual eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tubes come in a gift and storage box with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NFW provided a set for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> ~Splendeur Diva Lash mascara comes off in 3 swipes! - 2 for the lashes and one to collect any stray fibers.  A 4th swipe is only to be sure that it all came off in 3!  No racoon eyes the next morning!  ~For comparison I got a similar darkening/thickening effect with my now 2nd favorite mascara using several coats.  At the end of the day I used eye make up remover and a cotton pad like I did with Divalash &amp; ended up wiping over and over again using both sides of the pad.  In the morning I still saw faded “racoon eyes” looking at me in the mirror!  psst… Really takes very little time to apply the layers, and sometimes I don’t use my mascara 1st &amp; it still looks amazing!</li>
