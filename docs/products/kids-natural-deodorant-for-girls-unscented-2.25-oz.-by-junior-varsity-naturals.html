            <li> This deodorant did hold off the body order for a while (hence the other star)</li>

            <li> and it won&#x27;t hurt your body whith harmful chemicals like other deodorants</li>
            <li> The turning mechanism at the bottom is way too tight.</li>

            <li> My daughter has been using for a few days</li>
            <li> but the only problem with this product is that toward the end it tends to break apart from the base .I have been using this deodorant for a long time and this is the only problem I have with it</li>
            <li> Little one loves this!  </li>
            <li> I works have thought it would at least help a little.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure she needs it now.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product did not work.  </li>
            <li> but this did nothing, for as expensive as it is</li>
            <li> She unfortunately has had very bad body odor under her armpits for about a year and half</li>
            <li> She smelled just as bad using it as she did before.  </li>

            <li> My 9-year old likes it.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT...IT DOES THE JOB FOR MY 8 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER</li>
            <li> Helps a little but not completely.</li>
            <li> Very good. but the only problem with this product is that toward the end it tends to break apart from the base .I have been using this deodorant for a long time and this is the only problem I have with it otherwise it deserves 5 star.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to finally find something that works for my 8 year old daughter. She unfortunately has had very bad body odor under her armpits for about a year and half and we started trying the regular deodorants, but we found out that every one she used she gets a horrible itching hurting rash. we have tried so many different kinds for sensitive skin. and the doctor had even prescribed some but was allergic to that too. this one is the only one I have seen with out those same chemicals other then the rock stick type thing in stores. Which didn&#x27;t work at all. I decided to try this out and she has used it for a week and it works perfectly. it has no smell as indicated but are very happy with having no smell deodorant verses a gorgeous little girl with horrible BO. Extremely happy!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was concerned having my 10 year old using this, however it was time she needed it. I wasn&#x27;t going to let her use a harmful product so my doctor recommended this. It works, and I trust it</li>
            <li> Our nine-year-old daughter is very active dancer and involved with all sorts of other activities, and recently began the stinky pre-pre-teen phase.  Didn&#x27;t want any chemicals, so this one came up after our search.  It works well.  No scent, so no one knows she&#x27;s wearing anything.  Keeps her dry and non-stinky.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s for kids, but it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> This deodorant did not live up to expectations.  The good thing is it is mild and good for sensitive skin.  My daughter has eczema and most chemicals new to her skin cause a rash. I was worried about deodorant because the skin of the under arm is super sensitive.  I gave 2 stars for that.  Unfortunately, the product did not work.  She smelled just as bad using it as she did before.  This deodorant did hold off the body order for a while (hence the other star) so if I had the time or inclination to re-apply, perhaps it would have worked. My daughter is too busy running around to catch her for a deodorant re-application.  She is 3 by the way and has a metabolic disorder that causes her to have BO.  I have found other products that do work so I know that its not just her.</li>
            <li> I put the deodorant on in the morning and for the whole day. I was sweating too and I wasn&#x27;t smelly. But at the end of the day I still had a little smell under my underarms. I would highly recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t really have any chemicals and it won&#x27;t hurt your body whith harmful chemicals like other deodorants have. I like it very much!!!:)</li>
            <li> 7 year old loves this</li>
            <li> Grrrrrrrreat!! my girls are 5 and started to have an offensive smell from their underarms.  Well, thanks to Kids Natural Deodorant, the smell is there no more :) Amen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy girls, even happier mother.. getting ready to order some more..</li>
            <li> My daughter armpits has a really smelly strong odor and unfortunately this deodorant does not work for her, if your kids arms are really smelly I recommend Truly&#x27;s all natural kids deodorant it keeps her fresh all day!</li>
            <li> This is very difficulty to roll up even for an adult. The turning mechanism at the bottom is way too tight.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has been using this for awhile now.  This has been the first and only deodorant she has used.  We chose unscented and are happy with our choice.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> I received my order before the scheduled delivery date and it as exactly as described.  My daughter has been using for a few days and I have not noticed any odor.  If consistent I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Little one loves this!  We found out that the odor was actually provoloe cheese as it is processed by the body and comes through the pores!&lt;br /&gt;This makes our little one feel like she is a bigger girl but I&#x27;m not sure she needs it now.  We will continue to use it &amp;#34; just in case&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s mild and does not cause any irritation on the five year old&#x27;s skin.  It has not odor of it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> My daughter sweats quite alot as she plays soccer and volleyball games almost back to back on the weekends.  This deodorant works well with keeping her from having armpit odor.</li>
            <li> Was a gift to my friend&#x27;s daughter and she is happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Worked well,  no scent, and my daughter did not break out from using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter hoping to find a deodorant that didn&#x27;t make her itch and help with the smell she is starting to have but this did nothing, for as expensive as it is I works have thought it would at least help a little. It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Daughter said it was &amp;#34;gross!&amp;#34;</li>
