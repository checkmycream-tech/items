            <li>The topcoat is great initially, goes on smooth, dries fast.</li>
            <li>It dries really really fast and lasts for more than a week if you apply it every two or three days.  </li>
            <li>This is such a good product, that my manicurist has asked me to order it for her.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as seche, but it&#x27;s pretty glossy, has no shrinkage, and after a week (using cheap non-name brand polish) has yet to chip!!</li>
            <li>It stays nice and shiny for a long time also.</li>
            <li>or you can let it dry on it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>next to try will be gel top coat and see if my polish lasts longer with that.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this polish!</li>

            <li>It does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>I have not so pretty nails and like to keep them polished.  </li>
            <li>then i&#x27;d recommend otherwise any top coat will do as they are all the same fast drying</li>
            <li>I want to try the mega huge bottle of this stuff in the future if that&#x27;s any indication of how much I like it.</li>
            <li>Makes painting your nails so much quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>It really protects the polish for a longer time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast drying.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>

            <li>some other* quick dry top coats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I like everything about this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Dry&#x27;s super fast.  </li>
            <li>After I use 3/4 of the bottle it starts to gunk up a bit and become hard to use - but that&#x27;s a lot better than *</li>
            <li>and although it&#x27;s rather thick, it goes on smoothly and dries to a very shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>My manicurist uses this item and my nail polish stayed on much longer than had with other topcoats, so I ordered a supply for myself to use to sustain the new look to my manicures.  </li>
            <li>This Topcoat does dry fast.  </li>
            <li>It also lasts a really long time because the bottle is a decent size.  </li>
            <li>While you can not IMMEDIATELY walk out the door after it is applied, this topcoat really does cut down on drying time ALOT!</li>

            <li> Other products that I have used have dulled the shine--but not this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and usually get it at Sally Beauty Supply, although the last two times I tried to buy it, they were out of stock.  </li>
            <li> but I still feel like nothing can top Seche Vite. :(</li>
            <li> If this stuff is ever retired, I will have to hunt someone down &amp; have a talk with them.</li>
            <li> I used to use seche vite which is super glossy and dries incredibly fast, however it chips within the same day, smells bad, and has bad shrinkage.  </li>
            <li> I use it over gel nail polish (no light needed) and it stays on up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This feels no more than vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> I recommend Sally Hansen Hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hard to chip</li>
            <li> Well I tried this &amp; waited at least 3 minutes to see if polish was still tacky feeling...</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>

            <li> This is an excellent fast drying top coat. Have bought several bottles of this over time. Keeps the polish underneath looking great!</li>
            <li> if u can get it cheap then i&#x27;d recommend otherwise any top coat will do as they are all the same fast drying but you will still get chipping on the nail edge after 3 days. next to try will be gel top coat and see if my polish lasts longer with that.</li>
            <li> The topcoat is great initially, goes on smooth, dries fast. (Except it smudges) But once you take a shower, swim or have your hands in water in 10+ minutes or so, it chips! Right away! And then it starts peeling off. I really don&#x27;t like this polish! Don&#x27;t get it! I recommend Sally Hansen Hard As Nails instead.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Makes painting your nails so much quicker and easier. Other products that I have used have dulled the shine--but not this one.  I can got to bed within minutes after painting nails and my nails will not get &amp;#34;sheet marks&amp;#34; and will be perfectly shiny in the morning. Love it!</li>
            <li> Good, reasonably priced top coat. I would purchase again.  Dries quickly. Good shine. Better than drugstore brands that I&#x27;ve tried previously.</li>
            <li> My manicurist uses this item and my nail polish stayed on much longer than had with other topcoats, so I ordered a supply for myself to use to sustain the new look to my manicures.  I have recommended this product to others and they have also been pleased with it.  It really protects the polish for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I had read lots of reviews that this was as titled \\&quot;Out The Door\\&quot;. Well I tried this &amp; waited at least 3 minutes to see if polish was still tacky feeling... I ruined my nail as this left my polish smudge &amp; it had to be redone. This feels no more than vegetable oil. I&#x27;ll stick with Rapidry by OPI.</li>
            <li> This Topcoat does dry fast.  I used this Topcoat years ago, and didn&#x27;t look for it until recently.  Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> A co worker recommended this for us because everytime I did my own manicure it will ruin some how! This drys it quickly and lets the polish last longer!</li>
            <li> This topcoat is great!  It dries really really fast and lasts for more than a week if you apply it every two or three days.  It&#x27;s extremely hard to chip and although it&#x27;s rather thick, it goes on smoothly and dries to a very shiny finish.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and usually get it at Sally Beauty Supply, although the last two times I tried to buy it, they were out of stock.  I&#x27;ll buy it on Amazon instead.  It also lasts a really long time because the bottle is a decent size.  I like everything about this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product but I still feel like nothing can top Seche Vite. :( I still love this product though. The awesome thing about it is that it does not thicken too fast.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy another brand or type of top coat ever again. If this stuff is ever retired, I will have to hunt someone down &amp; have a talk with them. I cannot live without this product! Seriously!</li>
            <li> Great having it delivered instead of having to cross town to get it.  I use it over gel nail polish (no light needed) and it stays on up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s the 3rd bottle I am buying.It really works! My manicure lasts around 5-6 days now  .</li>
            <li> Works great and looks great over a finished manicure! It stays nice and shiny for a long time also. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love Inm Out The Door Fast!!  It does exactly what it says it will.  I have not so pretty nails and like to keep them polished.  My manicure lasts over a week and still looks good since I started using Inm.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop manufacturing it!!</li>
            <li> This is such a good product, that my manicurist has asked me to order it for her.  Wonder when my order will arrive, as it&#x27;s not here yet.,</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  I&#x27;ve bought it for 10 years now and it works the best!  Dry&#x27;s super fast.  Great price.</li>
            <li> You are practically out the door as soon as you put this product on. It is Great!!!  You can put it under the uv lamp for a min or you can let it dry on it&#x27;s own and you are all set after a min or so. I do recommend this product. Buy it now. LOL&lt;br /&gt;D. Woods.</li>
            <li> After I use 3/4 of the bottle it starts to gunk up a bit and become hard to use - but that&#x27;s a lot better than *some other* quick dry top coats I&#x27;ve used. For the price I think this stuff is great and does what it says. I want to try the mega huge bottle of this stuff in the future if that&#x27;s any indication of how much I like it.</li>
            <li> Saw this when I had a manicure in Moscow! While you can not IMMEDIATELY walk out the door after it is applied, this topcoat really does cut down on drying time ALOT! And it has a really nice shiny finish!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the everyday coat! That&#x27;s how my manicure lasts through the entire week. It&#x27;s fast drying. I&#x27;ve purchased some for my daughter too. She loves it also.</li>
            <li> I used to use seche vite which is super glossy and dries incredibly fast, however it chips within the same day, smells bad, and has bad shrinkage.  I love love love this top coat! It doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as seche, but it&#x27;s pretty glossy, has no shrinkage, and after a week (using cheap non-name brand polish) has yet to chip!! I highly recommend it!</li>
