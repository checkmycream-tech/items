            <li>My husband hasn&#x27;t found anything he likes better</li>
            <li>my favorite after shave</li>
            <li>Royal Copenhagen aftershave and cologne have to be among the very best male scents on the market, ever.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li>My office staff gave RC as a gift many years ago.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li>This after shave scent has always pleased my nose..not unisex at all</li>
            <li>The product ordered is Royal Copenhagen, an after shave that is much better than any I have used.</li>
            <li>I am 85 years of age and have used it for as many years as I can remember.</li>
            <li>My husband has used this aftershave for years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>so she could smell it better.</li>
            <li>I picked this out for my husband and it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance that he uses.  </li>
            <li>Both Receiver and I were pleased.  </li>
            <li>All was OK.</li>
            <li>My favorite men&#x27;s fragrance since 1974.</li>
            <li>my husband&#x27;s favorite -</li>
            <li>then i thought, &#x27;well, maybe it will smell better once it&#x27;s on my face.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Whenever I use it I get many complements .</li>
            <li>Great product -- very efficient delivery.</li>
            <li>It smells great and I highly recommend it with the cologne as well!</li>
            <li>My choice for many years.  </li>
            <li>Royal Copenhagen by Royal Copenhagen for Men, Aftersave Lotion has been a favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li>but I sure would recommend Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It mixes well with many colognes.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Purchased it first time by looking at so many good reviews</li>
            <li>The fragrance is superb and not only do I enjoy it</li>
            <li>glad so many people enjoy it, but for me this one purchase i&#x27;ve come come to regret.</li>
            <li>Well after getting it I asked several people I know with very good sense of smell about it</li>
            <li>A bonus to the light scent is that it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze, as so many scents do.  </li>
            <li>What a Great masculine scent this after shave has.</li>
            <li>Good Price and Fast</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing clean scent.</li>
            <li>So strong it constricted my nasal passage and initiated the gag reflex.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t ask strong.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll leave it on the bathroom counter because it&#x27;s a pretty color and presents nicely, but i won&#x27;t be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But smells fine</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>It smells mildly of baby powder, lilac, and a sophisticated Swedish aromatherapy spa.</li>
            <li>so Amazon is great, especially since I have free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>If you want a cheap aftershave get some witch hazel or Pinaud.</li>
            <li>Most of it is the alcohol solvent and the scent isn&#x27;t really anything memorable, kinda something like baby powder</li>
            <li>Its not an overpowering fragrance ,just enough scent that lets you feel confident and feeling good.</li>
            <li>This is my dad&#x27;s favorite and Father&#x27;s Day is right around the corner.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, great price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Will keep using it except for special occasions</li>
            <li>This Royal Copenhagen Aftershave does not have a strong scent to it, but is subtle and has a very pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I will be nice since this is a rating, but I could eat him alive when he is wearing this.</li>
            <li>But, it gave me pimples afterwards which means this product is essentially only good for the burning part of the skin at the cost of being a pimple face freak.</li>
            <li>A true classic scent that women love.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick, too.</li>
            <li>This is an older scent but one that I love on my husband.  </li>
            <li>The good smell stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>My Dad&#x27;s favorite and no stores where we live carry it.....</li>
            <li>it makes it so easy for me to get and very convenient.</li>
            <li>Ladies will love it, you will love it, and it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i can&#x27;t really put my finger on the smell, but it kind of like baby powder mixed with a cheap, drugstore cologne.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and most adult males</li>
            <li>Royal Copenhagen was introduced in the early 1970&#x27;s and ever since it has been one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely, Nancy Johnson P.S. also thank you for providing the public with a fantastic source of shopping for all kinds of products.</li>
            <li>com is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It sure beats Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have it yet, but this is by far my favorite fragrance for my husband.</li>
            <li>:) So far after all these years, haven&#x27;t met anyone that has smelled</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but scent from old time.</li>
            <li>and it quickly subsides to a gentle clean scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>and they were right....</li>
            <li>Larger than the standard Department store size of 4 oz at a great price.</li>
            <li>Tried many others but goes back.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>We talked some more and the next thing I knew we were both in the lavatory together...and you can guess the rest.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered...</li>
            <li>I have chosen this product many times, from various places including Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The box and,bottle are exactly the&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent of this after shave lasts whole day!</li>
            <li>My husband has worn this since we have been married and doesn&#x27;t like anything else.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this for him 30 years ago</li>
            <li>And thank you for making it in the first place.</li>
            <li>It does a great job and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>it out ranks any other kind.  </li>
            <li>Young and old females love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Brings back good memories of my younger days.</li>
            <li>Your site is the only place i can reasonably and easily find it.</li>
            <li>thanks so much for having Royal Copanhagen on your site............</li>
            <li>He has been using this for years and really like it.</li>
            <li>She asked about the cologne/aftershave and got very close</li>
            <li>I have used Royal Copenhagen for about 20 years &amp; everyone always asks me what it is as they really like the scent.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed.</li>
            <li>but thanks to a store clerk who recommended I go to Amazon to look for it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>He really likes this group of products and so do I.</li>
            <li>A real hit in our household.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh scent for the mature male, and sold at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Have tried other aftershaves, but I receive more compliments on this product.</li>
            <li>The other three reviewers to date seem to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent that is manly and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for my husband, He has used this same aftershave ever since we were married, 40 years ago.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after using several expensive after shave and it impressed me!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Just enough to fresh up.&lt;br /&gt;I walked back to the lounge area of the aircraft to stretch my legs and got into a conversation with a very pretty flight attendent lady.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mature, simple, clean, unoffensive scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using Light Blue for several years at a very high price in a 4oz bottle.</li>
            <li>I HAVE SEEN SOME BAD REVIEWS, BUT THIS PRODUCT HAS EXCELLENT QUALITY</li>
            <li>Met expectations for a Normal purchase.</li>
            <li>My wife found this for me and she really loves this Aftershave better than any I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Nothing broken just not sealed good.  </li>
            <li>I boxed it right back up and gave it to my daughter to give away.</li>
            <li>My favorite for years not a strong sent</li>
            <li>I own at least 30 aftershaves from the cheap drugstore variety to the more expensive imports.</li>
            <li>Considering I like this, and could not find it in stores, I can live with it.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price, smell doesnt last as long as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all man..but not excessively odiferous..</li>
            <li>Despite the packaging this aftershave is pretty low quality.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered it on Amazon and will do so in the future.</li>
            <li>Not at all subtle or masculine which is key to a good aftershave splash.</li>
            <li>I get numerous compliments and people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing on a positive note.</li>
            <li>Women, young and old always ask what I am wearing, so that they can buy it for their husbands.</li>
            <li>Completely meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>Mellow &amp; masculine.</li>
            <li>repeat business replacing Old Spice</li>
            <li>So masculine but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Maybe not for young people.</li>
            <li>This is the 8 oz bottle that is completely unsatisfactory....  </li>
            <li>Though it seemed at first like it would dry my skin out, it didn&#x27;t, and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily like an \\&quot;aftershave balm.\\</li>
            <li>It is clean, fresh, serious, but sporty at the same time.</li>
            <li>The small bottle lasted me a while; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be set through next year with this one.</li>
            <li>If you like a unique smelling aftershave or cologne, it&#x27;s Royal Copenhagen guys, this is the scent that I get more compliments on than any other besides Geoffrey Beene, or commonly called Grey Flannel.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the fragrance is a bit sweeter  or more flowery than I prefer, but that is a matter of taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using both for a very long time, and always get compliments from women -- young, old, and in-between!  </li>
            <li>It is a very dark, dark Blue instead of a light blue and has an extemely unpleasent odor....  </li>
            <li>However if you like a little bit more to your shave then upgrade to at least Pinaud...</li>

            <li> Outstanding purchase price and prompt delivery...</li>
            <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t found anything he likes better</li>
            <li> my favorite after shave</li>
            <li> Royal Copenhagen aftershave and cologne have to be among the very best male scents on the market, ever.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li> My office staff gave RC as a gift many years ago.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li> This after shave scent has always pleased my nose..not unisex at all</li>
            <li> The product ordered is Royal Copenhagen, an after shave that is much better than any I have used.</li>
            <li> I am 85 years of age and have used it for as many years as I can remember.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this aftershave for years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> so she could smell it better.</li>
            <li> I picked this out for my husband and it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance that he uses.  </li>
            <li> Both Receiver and I were pleased.  </li>
            <li> All was OK.</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s fragrance since 1974.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s favorite -</li>
            <li> then i thought, &#x27;well, maybe it will smell better once it&#x27;s on my face.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Whenever I use it I get many complements .</li>
            <li> Great product -- very efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> It smells great and I highly recommend it with the cologne as well!</li>
            <li> My choice for many years.  </li>
            <li> Royal Copenhagen by Royal Copenhagen for Men, Aftersave Lotion has been a favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li> but I sure would recommend Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
            <li> It mixes well with many colognes.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Purchased it first time by looking at so many good reviews</li>
            <li> The fragrance is superb and not only do I enjoy it</li>
            <li> glad so many people enjoy it, but for me this one purchase i&#x27;ve come come to regret.</li>
            <li> Well after getting it I asked several people I know with very good sense of smell about it</li>
            <li> A bonus to the light scent is that it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze, as so many scents do.  </li>
            <li> What a Great masculine scent this after shave has.</li>
            <li> Good Price and Fast</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing clean scent.</li>
            <li> So strong it constricted my nasal passage and initiated the gag reflex.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t ask strong.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll leave it on the bathroom counter because it&#x27;s a pretty color and presents nicely, but i won&#x27;t be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But smells fine</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> It smells mildly of baby powder, lilac, and a sophisticated Swedish aromatherapy spa.</li>
            <li> so Amazon is great, especially since I have free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> If you want a cheap aftershave get some witch hazel or Pinaud.</li>
            <li> Most of it is the alcohol solvent and the scent isn&#x27;t really anything memorable, kinda something like baby powder</li>
            <li> Its not an overpowering fragrance ,just enough scent that lets you feel confident and feeling good.</li>
            <li> This is my dad&#x27;s favorite and Father&#x27;s Day is right around the corner.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, great price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Will keep using it except for special occasions</li>
            <li> This Royal Copenhagen Aftershave does not have a strong scent to it, but is subtle and has a very pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I will be nice since this is a rating, but I could eat him alive when he is wearing this.</li>
            <li> But, it gave me pimples afterwards which means this product is essentially only good for the burning part of the skin at the cost of being a pimple face freak.</li>
            <li> A true classic scent that women love.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick, too.</li>
            <li> This is an older scent but one that I love on my husband.  </li>
            <li> The good smell stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> My Dad&#x27;s favorite and no stores where we live carry it.....</li>
            <li> it makes it so easy for me to get and very convenient.</li>
            <li> Ladies will love it, you will love it, and it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i can&#x27;t really put my finger on the smell, but it kind of like baby powder mixed with a cheap, drugstore cologne.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and most adult males</li>
            <li> Royal Copenhagen was introduced in the early 1970&#x27;s and ever since it has been one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely, Nancy Johnson P.S. also thank you for providing the public with a fantastic source of shopping for all kinds of products.</li>
            <li> com is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It sure beats Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have it yet, but this is by far my favorite fragrance for my husband.</li>
            <li> :) So far after all these years, haven&#x27;t met anyone that has smelled</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but scent from old time.</li>
            <li> and it quickly subsides to a gentle clean scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> and they were right....</li>
            <li> Larger than the standard Department store size of 4 oz at a great price.</li>
            <li> Tried many others but goes back.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> We talked some more and the next thing I knew we were both in the lavatory together...and you can guess the rest.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered...</li>
            <li> I have chosen this product many times, from various places including Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The box and,bottle are exactly the&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent of this after shave lasts whole day!</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this since we have been married and doesn&#x27;t like anything else.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this for him 30 years ago</li>
            <li> And thank you for making it in the first place.</li>
            <li> It does a great job and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> it out ranks any other kind.  </li>
            <li> Young and old females love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Brings back good memories of my younger days.</li>
            <li> Your site is the only place i can reasonably and easily find it.</li>
            <li> thanks so much for having Royal Copanhagen on your site............</li>
            <li> He has been using this for years and really like it.</li>
            <li> She asked about the cologne/aftershave and got very close</li>
            <li> I have used Royal Copenhagen for about 20 years &amp; everyone always asks me what it is as they really like the scent.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> but thanks to a store clerk who recommended I go to Amazon to look for it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> He really likes this group of products and so do I.</li>
            <li> A real hit in our household.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent for the mature male, and sold at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have tried other aftershaves, but I receive more compliments on this product.</li>
            <li> The other three reviewers to date seem to love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent that is manly and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my husband, He has used this same aftershave ever since we were married, 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after using several expensive after shave and it impressed me!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Just enough to fresh up.&lt;br /&gt;I walked back to the lounge area of the aircraft to stretch my legs and got into a conversation with a very pretty flight attendent lady.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mature, simple, clean, unoffensive scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Light Blue for several years at a very high price in a 4oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SEEN SOME BAD REVIEWS, BUT THIS PRODUCT HAS EXCELLENT QUALITY</li>
            <li> Met expectations for a Normal purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife found this for me and she really loves this Aftershave better than any I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Nothing broken just not sealed good.  </li>
            <li> I boxed it right back up and gave it to my daughter to give away.</li>
            <li> My favorite for years not a strong sent</li>
            <li> I own at least 30 aftershaves from the cheap drugstore variety to the more expensive imports.</li>
            <li> Considering I like this, and could not find it in stores, I can live with it.  </li>
            <li> Good for the price, smell doesnt last as long as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all man..but not excessively odiferous..</li>
            <li> Despite the packaging this aftershave is pretty low quality.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered it on Amazon and will do so in the future.</li>
            <li> Not at all subtle or masculine which is key to a good aftershave splash.</li>
            <li> I get numerous compliments and people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing on a positive note.</li>
            <li> Women, young and old always ask what I am wearing, so that they can buy it for their husbands.</li>
            <li> Completely meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Mellow &amp; masculine.</li>
            <li> repeat business replacing Old Spice</li>
            <li> So masculine but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Maybe not for young people.</li>
            <li> This is the 8 oz bottle that is completely unsatisfactory....  </li>
            <li> Though it seemed at first like it would dry my skin out, it didn&#x27;t, and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily like an \\&quot;aftershave balm.\\</li>
            <li> It is clean, fresh, serious, but sporty at the same time.</li>
            <li> The small bottle lasted me a while; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be set through next year with this one.</li>
            <li> If you like a unique smelling aftershave or cologne, it&#x27;s Royal Copenhagen guys, this is the scent that I get more compliments on than any other besides Geoffrey Beene, or commonly called Grey Flannel.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the fragrance is a bit sweeter  or more flowery than I prefer, but that is a matter of taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both for a very long time, and always get compliments from women -- young, old, and in-between!  </li>
            <li> It is a very dark, dark Blue instead of a light blue and has an extemely unpleasent odor....  </li>
            <li> However if you like a little bit more to your shave then upgrade to at least Pinaud...</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years,this lotion has very little smell to it.i was very disappointed.who ever mixed up this batch did not use enough perfume or smell to it.</li>
            <li> It last just as long as the french stuff.</li>
            <li> this new shipment is missing any zing to it.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find the large size</li>
            <li> anytime I need to so long as the company doesn&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and like it but in recent years find it harder to find.  </li>
            <li> A little will last your entire outing.</li>
            <li> It arrived with the cap loose and 1/3 of the content gone.  </li>
            <li> Received product was dark blue not a light blue.</li>
            <li> The bottle was open a little in the sealed package.</li>
            <li> strong and unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> it has been virtually non-existent to find in stores anymore as i usually did for the last 30 years................</li>
            <li> but I think this had to due with shipping.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;nt buy any other Aftershave for my husband.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t  worn any other aftershave for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> and this is the first and only time it has been bad.</li>
            <li> I remember back in the late 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Have been using Copenhagen for years, its never let me down..  </li>
            <li> I sprinkled a little in the palm of my hand and applied to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it at stores.  </li>
            <li> I found that Amazon is one of the few places I can find this aftershave.</li>
            <li> i stocked up in quite a few bottles</li>
            <li> It stinks of a heavy perfume worn by an old lady.</li>
            <li> Usually buy the cologne.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is</li>
            <li> Hubby could put it on in the past and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this product for at least 30 years and</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 15 years now myself.  </li>
            <li> the package arrived, i quickly opened it, twisted off the cap, gave it a whiff and thought, &#x27;man, this stinks!&#x27;  </li>
            <li> What i mean is that if you use this aftershave lotion and you have cuts on your face it going to burn a lot.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a very expensive french aftershave.</li>
            <li> he loves this stuff but doesn&#x27;t buy it for himself, says it is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Failed to have any scents to it.</li>
            <li> FAIL,</li>
            <li> Starts to smell stale after time on.</li>
            <li> Very poor product.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find in a retail store anymore, just browsed amazon, found it, ordered and it was at my door in the blink of an eye.  </li>
            <li> It has been almost impossible to find it</li>
            <li> maybe it was just a bad combination with my skin type, but like another reviewer, after about twenty minutes, i had to go wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my husband, He has used this same aftershave ever since we were married, 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this Aftershave.</li>
            <li> Outstanding purchase price and prompt delivery...packaging lacked a bit in protection for item, but did come thru the mails without breakage..same product as sold in department stores for 3x the price..allover great purchase</li>
            <li> Purchased it first time by looking at so many good reviews but I have to say this product is not my type of aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;Very strong and unpleasant odor. My wife hates it. Received product was dark blue not a light blue.</li>
            <li> Been using this product since the mid 70&#x27;s. Have tried other aftershaves, but I receive more compliments on this product. Women, young and old always ask what I am wearing, so that they can buy it for their husbands.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find in a retail store anymore, just browsed amazon, found it, ordered and it was at my door in the blink of an eye.  Love the fragrance, great price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I had a considerably smaller bottle that I had gotten for Christmas one year and had lasted me a while.  I liked everything about it--the smell, the feel.  Though it seemed at first like it would dry my skin out, it didn&#x27;t, and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily like an \\&quot;aftershave balm.\\&quot;  I like it a lot.  And for the price Amazon had for 8 ounces, it was quite a steal.  The small bottle lasted me a while; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be set through next year with this one.</li>
            <li> Hubby has been wearing it for years. Tried many others but goes back.</li>
            <li> Completely meet my expectations. I&#x27;m going to use this product all the time</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and most adult males I know have asked me about it wanting the same for themselves. Young and old females love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Happy with both the product and the speedy delivery for a special occasion makes for smiley faces!  You will hear from me again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful masculine fragrance. My husband hasn&#x27;t found anything he likes better &amp; I have to agree with him.</li>
            <li> my favorite after shave</li>
            <li> Royal Copenhagen aftershave and cologne have to be among the very best male scents on the market, ever.  I&#x27;ve been using both for a very long time, and always get compliments from women -- young, old, and in-between!  Even perfect strangers have offered up compliments!</li>
            <li> Royal Copenhagen was introduced in the early 1970&#x27;s and ever since it has been one of my favorite products.  The fragrance is superb and not only do I enjoy it but I am constantly getting compliments whenever I use it.  But the best thing is the price. For some reason, I have seen Royal Copenhagen offered at some exceptionally low prices.  So you can get the best of all worlds for a remarkable price!  I cannot recommend this fragrance enough.  You cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> I used to use this brand over 20 yrs ago. Nice to know you can still find it around.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Your site is the only place i can reasonably and easily find it. It is THE ONLY after shave that my husband likes and wears. it has been virtually non-existent to find in stores anymore as i usually did for the last 30 years................thanks so much for having Royal Copanhagen on your site............it makes it so easy for me to get and very convenient. wish i didn&#x27;t have to pay tax/shipping handling as i didn&#x27;t have to in stores, but i do understand the reason for it.  thanx again for providing me with an easy way to continue to keep my husband happy and smelling fabulous!  I love it too!!  Sincerely, Nancy Johnson P.S. also thank you for providing the public with a fantastic source of shopping for all kinds of products.</li>
            <li> This after shave I really enjoy using, it is very good smelling without being an after shave where you smell like you just walked off the perfume counter. I get numerous compliments and people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing on a positive note.</li>
            <li> Have been using Copenhagen for years, its never let me down..  Hope to continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I was thilled to order this for a Christmas present for my husband. I can&#x27;t find it in any local stores anymore. It was delivered fast and in great condition. The price was an exceptional bargain also.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li> The other three reviewers to date seem to love this stuff. I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. It stinks of a heavy perfume worn by an old lady. Not at all subtle or masculine which is key to a good aftershave splash. I own at least 30 aftershaves from the cheap drugstore variety to the more expensive imports. This is one of the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried. Had to shower after about 20 mins. to remove the stench from my skin. So strong it constricted my nasal passage and initiated the gag reflex. My wife got the same reaction. I boxed it right back up and gave it to my daughter to give away. Pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.....I always get compliments when I wear this scent.  Not fruity or in any way mistaken for a woman&#x27;s perfume</li>
            <li> My office staff gave RC as a gift many years ago. I am pleased with the scent. It has a refreshing clean scent. Mellow &amp; masculine. Continue to reorder it.</li>
            <li> Smells incredibly manly, makes my skin feel great after shaving</li>
            <li> If you like a unique smelling aftershave or cologne, it&#x27;s Royal Copenhagen guys, this is the scent that I get more compliments on than any other besides Geoffrey Beene, or commonly called Grey Flannel.  Ladies will love it, you will love it, and it lasts all day long.  great scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father-in-law.  He has been using this for years and really like it. It has a nice scent that is manly and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Larger than the standard Department store size of 4 oz at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good I am happy with it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and I always get asked what aftershave are you using by both men and women.  It has a pleasant manly aroma and all three of my daughters for once in their life agree on something, that dad smells nice.</li>
            <li> This after shave scent has always pleased my nose..not unisex at all..it&#x27;s all man..but not excessively odiferous..you can hg who you want with this on and know you are going to score...every time...</li>
            <li> Usually buy the cologne. Never tried the after shave. The scent isn&#x27;t ask strong.</li>
            <li> The product ordered is Royal Copenhagen, an after shave that is much better than any I have used. I am 85 years of age and have used it for as many years as I can remember. If you have never used it and don&#x27;t want to change, don&#x27;t try it as you will get hooked on it.  Jim</li>
            <li> My husband uses it all the time. It&#x27;s the very best after shave on the market today. He has been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 40 yrs</li>
            <li> Husband loved it, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used.  I ordered based on others reviews and they were right....Excellent in every way.  I have been using Light Blue for several years at a very high price in a 4oz bottle. Royal Copenhagen is twice the size and 1/2+ the price.  Thank you Amazon for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this aftershave for years, and I love it.  A bonus to the light scent is that it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze, as so many scents do.  Delivery was quick, too.</li>
            <li> Great Value. Love the product. I have used this for years. Hope it is in production forever. Nothing but compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> I remember back in the late 90&#x27;s I was on a flight back from Singapore and I had some of this in my  carry on. I sprinkled a little in the palm of my hand and applied to my face. Just enough to fresh up.&lt;br /&gt;I walked back to the lounge area of the aircraft to stretch my legs and got into a conversation with a very pretty flight attendent lady. She asked about the cologne/aftershave and got very close so she could smell it better. We talked some more and the next thing I knew we were both in the lavatory together...and you can guess the rest.</li>
            <li> Best source for Royal Copenhagen. My husband has been wearing this for 25 years. It can be hard to find the large size so Amazon is great, especially since I have free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> good stuff at a good price</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price</li>
            <li> I picked this out for my husband and it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance that he uses.  He gets lots of compliments when he wears it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years,this lotion has very little smell to it.i was very disappointed.who ever mixed up this batch did not use enough perfume or smell to it.</li>
            <li> The bottle was open a little in the sealed package. Some leaked out but I think this had to due with shipping. Would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SEEN SOME BAD REVIEWS, BUT THIS PRODUCT HAS EXCELLENT QUALITY</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Both Receiver and I were pleased.  Arrived on time.  All was OK. Met expectations for a Normal purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and this is the best price in town</li>
            <li> Despite the packaging this aftershave is pretty low quality. Most of it is the alcohol solvent and the scent isn&#x27;t really anything memorable, kinda something like baby powder I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s good. If you are just looking to buy an aftershave for the sake of having an aftershave (if you shave with a cartridge, basically) I would suggest this. However if you like a little bit more to your shave then upgrade to at least Pinaud... actually I retract my last statement. If you want a cheap aftershave get some witch hazel or Pinaud. Don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> I love Royal Copenhagen! It&#x27;s the only Aftershave I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered...Loved it!!!</li>
            <li> An Oldie, but Goodie. Used it back when and is still holds up. Brings back good memories of my younger days.</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s fragrance since 1974.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s favorite -</li>
            <li> Just what we expected....very nice value</li>
            <li> My Dad&#x27;s favorite and no stores where we live carry it.....so instead of driving 160 miles roundtrip to find it at a Department store in the closest big city, I let my fingers do my shopping and the after shave arrived in time for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, price was great!</li>
            <li> repeat business replacing Old Spice</li>
            <li> This is what I meant to order bit ordered cologne instead.  I have used this product for several years and money saved by purchasing at Amazon . com is well worth it.</li>
            <li> bought this for my dad.  he loves this stuff but doesn&#x27;t buy it for himself, says it is too expensive.  the price is good for the amount of aftershave you get.  great product</li>
            <li> This Royal Copenhagen Aftershave does not have a strong scent to it, but is subtle and has a very pleasant scent.  It gives one a sense of confidence when out among friends and/or business colleagues, but is not overpowering.  My wife found this for me and she really loves this Aftershave better than any I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Good Price and Fast Service - THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> My favorite for years not a strong sent</li>
            <li> Very poor product. Failed to have any scents to it. I&#x27;ve used Royal Copenhagen after shave lotion for about 30 years. this new shipment is missing any zing to it.</li>
            <li> BEEN USEING THIS SINCE I WAS 20 NOW 70PLUS ,   MEN EVER TIME WITH OUT FAIL, A WOMAN PASSING ALWAYS SAID, QUOT GOD YOU SMELL GOOD,  ..NOT STRONG EATHER JUST REAL PLEASANT ANS SEEMS THE WOMEN CARE FOR IT AS WELL....</li>
            <li> I have used Royal Copenhagen for about 20 years &amp; everyone always asks me what it is as they really like the scent. I was unsure about buying this as several reviews stated that it didn&#x27;t smell the same as before. Well after getting it I asked several people I know with very good sense of smell about it &amp; they all agreed it was the same scent as before. Great stuff at a really great price!</li>
            <li> with so many great reviews, i was fairly certain i&#x27;d be happy with this purchase.  i had been using proraso (which i like), but i just wanted to try something else.  the 8 oz bottle for $18 seemed like a nice deal, so i pulled the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when the package arrived, i quickly opened it, twisted off the cap, gave it a whiff and thought, &#x27;man, this stinks!&#x27;  then i thought, &#x27;well, maybe it will smell better once it&#x27;s on my face.&#x27;  so the next morning i shaved, gave my face a splash, and yep, it still stunk. bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t really put my finger on the smell, but it kind of like baby powder mixed with a cheap, drugstore cologne.  maybe it was just a bad combination with my skin type, but like another reviewer, after about twenty minutes, i had to go wash it off. i&#x27;ll leave it on the bathroom counter because it&#x27;s a pretty color and presents nicely, but i won&#x27;t be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m glad so many people enjoy it, but for me this one purchase i&#x27;ve come come to regret. oh, well.  can&#x27;t win &#x27;em all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on to the next one...</li>
            <li> What a Great masculine scent this after shave has. Whenever I use it I get many complements . Its not an overpowering fragrance ,just enough scent that lets you feel confident and feeling good. Besides you don&#x27;t have to splash a lot on. A little will last your entire outing.</li>
            <li> Low price!  Good quality!  Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> My favorite aftershave @ a fair price</li>
            <li> Great product -- very efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> It was a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this scent on my husband for 30 years.  Now he prefers the aftershave to cologne.  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it at stores.  Good service, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, quality product and service!</li>
            <li> It arrived with the cap loose and 1/3 of the content gone.  Nothing broken just not sealed good.  Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this product for at least 30 years and it out ranks any other kind.  The good smell stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Royal Copenhagen is one of my all time favorites.  I have never been disappointed with it. Now I know where to get it when no store within 100 miles of me carries it.</li>
            <li> I found that Amazon is one of the few places I can find this aftershave. It smells great and I highly recommend it with the cologne as well!</li>
            <li> My choice for many years.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Phenominal and long-lasting fragrance-the cologne is stronger.  The only thing is there was some, but not a lot of leakage when delivered.  Considering I like this, and could not find it in stores, I can live with it.  Maybe the leakage was an anomoly.  Give the vendor the benefit of the doubt.&lt;br /&gt;James Dunleavy-Hammondsport, NY</li>
            <li> Royal Copenhagen by Royal Copenhagen for Men, Aftersave Lotion has been a favorite for many years.  A change from it is never made.</li>
            <li> I have chosen this product many times, from various places including Amazon.  The box and,bottle are exactly the&lt;br /&gt;same, the scent is not.  It is completely different.  Be very careful.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, smell doesnt last as long as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after using several expensive after shave and it impressed me! The scent of this after shave lasts whole day!</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;nt buy any other Aftershave for my husband. I have purchased this scent for the last 10 years. It sure beats Old Spice.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this since we have been married and doesn&#x27;t like anything else.  It has been almost impossible to find it but thanks to a store clerk who recommended I go to Amazon to look for it.  i stocked up in quite a few bottles so I will have Christmas presents for the next several years.  Don&#x27;t know if I would recommend the Royal Copenhagen to any man but I sure would recommend Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t  worn any other aftershave for over 30 years. Enuff said.</li>
            <li> This is my dad&#x27;s favorite and Father&#x27;s Day is right around the corner. Yay presents for dad!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have it yet, but this is by far my favorite fragrance for my husband. I will be nice since this is a rating, but I could eat him alive when he is wearing this. Not sure what it is and I know everyone is different, but I could bathe with him in this. It just meshes perfectly with him and I will continue to get it for him anytime I need to so long as the company doesn&#x27;t stop making it. I first bought this for him 30 years ago so it has been around for awhile. Companies for some reason like to change and I pray they never change this one. It is perfect just the way it is. It smells awesome in the bottle but incredibly good on my man. Love it, love it, love it. Please do not stop making it. And thank you for making it in the first place. :) So far after all these years, haven&#x27;t met anyone that has smelled it say they didn&#x27;t like it by the way.</li>
            <li> Love this.So masculine but not overpowering.My dad wore it and it is timeless.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a very expensive french aftershave. It does a great job and is long lasting. It last just as long as the french stuff. My only complaint is that the fragrance is a bit sweeter  or more flowery than I prefer, but that is a matter of taste.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite the same smell as it used to be. Starts to smell stale after time on. Hubby could put it on in the past and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent for the mature male, and sold at a reasonable price. A true classic scent that women love.</li>
            <li> A Christmas Present for my Husband. He loves this Scent and so do I !!! He already has Cologne so this is perfect to go with it!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent. This is the first time I have ordered it on Amazon and will do so in the future. He really likes this group of products and so do I. A real hit in our household.</li>
            <li> My father has used this brand since I can remember. I am 36 and have had this smell around all my life. I have been using it for at least 15 years now myself.  It is clean, fresh, serious, but sporty at the same time.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the musk fragrance however this was a great change up and my wife likes this one too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but scent from old time. Maybe not for young people. But smells fine and it&#x27;s good aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle of Royal Copenhagen. It smells mildly of baby powder, lilac, and a sophisticated Swedish aromatherapy spa. You can slather this all over after a shower  and shave and it quickly subsides to a gentle clean scent that lasts all day. It&#x27;s a mature, simple, clean, unoffensive scent. It mixes well with many colognes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and like it but in recent years find it harder to find.  The price on this site was fair and I will continue to use it as my supply source.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> It has a stronger smell than I like, but I have been using it for a week now. Will keep using it except for special occasions</li>
            <li> This is the 8 oz bottle that is completely unsatisfactory....  It is obviously a different product than what is in the 2 oz bottle....  It is a very dark, dark Blue instead of a light blue and has an extemely unpleasent odor....  How do we go about returning it for a refund? My husband has been using Royal Copenhagen for years and this is the first and only time it has been bad.</li>
            <li> Been using for years and your price was best.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Feels great on the face and smells awesome. Would highly recommend to others. Great guy for a great price!</li>
            <li> This aftershave lotion burns but, it works. What i mean is that if you use this aftershave lotion and you have cuts on your face it going to burn a lot. This product will help with the shaving sensation after you shave. But, it gave me pimples afterwards which means this product is essentially only good for the burning part of the skin at the cost of being a pimple face freak.</li>
            <li> I been using this product Royal Copenhagen for twenty years. I find this purchase of aftershave Lotion to&lt;br /&gt;be in good standings of a four star. Thank you Norman</li>
            <li> Great after shave. Nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Great price and wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> Thank Heaven we found this on Amazon! It&#x27;s the only aftershave my husband will use.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this aftershave balm.  He has used it for years.  I see adds for the cologne but not balm,  anyone know where I can locate the balm?</li>
            <li> Every thing arrive on time, I am very happy with the products and the process</li>
            <li> This is an older scent but one that I love on my husband.  For his body chemistry it blends so well.</li>
