            <li>Hope you enjoy this product like I do!</li>
            <li>I love this glue.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s better</li>
            <li>I LOVE this glue.</li>
            <li>Many people have sensitivities to latex and that may be why some peoples eyes are burning..</li>
            <li>i love this and for the price it is most definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>This is definitely for the experienced lash user because if you slip or don&#x27;t put it where it needs to be</li>
            <li>Fortunate to have found it here on amazon.</li>
            <li>It goes on great and it hold for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Holds like it is supposed to has a funny smell but overall great buy.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put it on right the first time because it dries quickly</li>
            <li>I love using this particular glue.</li>
            <li>After wasting money on many other glues, I stumbled upon Kiss glue and fell in love!  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>The black is just what I needed and looks so much more real and elegant.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more inthe future.</li>
            <li>I wear them daily because I love the way they enhance the eyes.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how strong this glue is with the double bond method.</li>
            <li>I love how black it is its like liquid eyeliner and the tiny brush is better than squirting out of a tube.</li>
            <li>Great came in unexpected and a little early</li>
            <li>This glue worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Just be sure to shake the glue bottle upside down before each use as I found it separates a bit.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the hold and that it is jet black.</li>
            <li>Most glues come out gray then turns black but not this one.</li>
            <li>As long as you apply it in the right spot you are goes to go!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and comes out black.</li>
            <li>but I finally found a different brand (the one I was originally looking for) in the store.</li>
            <li>I usually use adhesive from Walmart but decided to try something better and after reading the reviews, I thought this was it.</li>
            <li>It lasts long and it glues right away after waiting for it ti get tacky</li>
            <li>I use the neutragena remover and hold there for a few seconds and it comes off easy.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not easy to apply as it comes out very quickly and a lot when you squeeze it.</li>
            <li>It truly is jet black when it&#x27;s wet or dry, and also sticks very well, better than DUO.</li>
            <li>I really like the black lash glue.</li>
            <li>it would be very embarrassing to have half of your lashes falling off your face in public!</li>
            <li>With DUO clear the glue would turn white with the shower steam (or with tears) then come loose.</li>

            <li> With DUO clear the glue would turn white with the shower steam (or with tears) then come loose.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the DUO dark either as this was a gray color, not black.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing lashes for a very long time...</li>
            <li> The Dual leaves sticky residue behind where this one comes off much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day without lifting, and stays on also if it gets wet.</li>
            <li> I also find it irritating and did not hold very well..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> It holds the lashes in place and does not take off your lashes like other glues.</li>
            <li> It also does not have that chunky look like some other glues.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it being black is that if you mess up and have to reapply the lashes you&#x27;ll have black smudges around your eye.</li>
            <li> The lash was coming loose in a matter of a few minutes...</li>
            <li> It seems hard to find an eyelash adhesive that doesn&#x27;t either contain rubber latex or formaldehyde and that actually works.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got black lines on your lid.</li>
            <li> and you half to remove the excess with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Also, I thought that by it being black it&#x27;ll match my eyeliner however if I miss my lastline</li>
            <li> the black shows up on my lids</li>
            <li> I wear my lashes to bed and in the shower (trying not to soak them in the shower) and they stay in tact and the glue remains jet black in color.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I was on the hunt for a lash glue that was Black, and also provided the wearer with the ease of knowing their lashes wouldn&#x27;t come off until THEY took them off.</li>
            <li> Though I do like how black it is, almost like wearing eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It was a nightmare to find black eyelash adhesive tried a few stores and didn&#x27;t have any luck</li>
            <li> With this glue I have worn my lashes for about two weeks with little to no glue touch up.</li>
            <li> It stay on all day and it is very black.  </li>
            <li> It holds well, but it&#x27;s very messy</li>
            <li> The glue is extremely weak and does not hold the lash.</li>
            <li> So if you are desperate to find black then give this brand a shot.</li>
            <li> Does make it a lil tough to remove though.</li>
            <li> The color is a game changer.</li>
            <li> Really not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Well, I thought wrong.</li>
            <li> so it becomes messy and annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend using an oil base eye makeup remover to get these off.</li>
            <li> Bad glue burns the eyes!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> but this was terrible</li>
            <li> Try it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product Great hold!</li>
            <li> I love using this particular glue. I like to add a thin strip of glue to my last line prior to applying the lashes and that keeps the lashes secure throughout the day. Does make it a lil tough to remove though. That&#x27;s how strong this glue is with the double bond method.</li>
            <li> This glue worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS EYELASH GLUE. The black is just what I needed and looks so much more real and elegant.</li>
            <li> This is not the product I ordered or saw on the website. This has aloe in it. The one that I ordered was the PREMIMUM strip eyelash adhesive.  I&#x27;m totally dissatisfied  because this product doesn&#x27;t work well...I know, I&#x27;ve bought this before.  Really not happy at all!</li>
            <li> I got a different one instead. I ordered a waterproof one and I got an aloe Vera glue instead.</li>
            <li> This item was ideal, it was exactly what i was looking for. Made my make up look great! Thank you</li>
            <li> My mom bought this product and she really liked it!!! It lasts long and it glues right away after waiting for it ti get tacky she recomends it :-)</li>
            <li> It was a nightmare to find black eyelash adhesive tried a few stores and didn&#x27;t have any luck so I hit amazon.com. This worked in a pinch but I finally found a different brand (the one I was originally looking for) in the store. So if you are desperate to find black then give this brand a shot.</li>
            <li> Holds like it is supposed to has a funny smell but overall great buy. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I really like the black lash glue. I will be ordering more inthe future. My daughter loves them also. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really love this glue.  It stay on all day and it is very black.  I&#x27;ve been using the Dual for years and this is way better.  The Dual leaves sticky residue behind where this one comes off much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the hold and that it is jet black. The color is a game changer. I am a novice and I can use this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this. I love how black it is its like liquid eyeliner and the tiny brush is better than squirting out of a tube. Give it about 30 seconds and its good to go. I fell asleep with my lashes on and they were still there! I&#x27;d recommend using an oil base eye makeup remover to get these off. I use the neutragena remover and hold there for a few seconds and it comes off easy. I wouldn&#x27;t try pulling them off at all but I&#x27;ve been known to do it with the duo brand no problem. This is definitely for the experienced lash user because if you slip or don&#x27;t put it where it needs to be you&#x27;ve got black lines on your lid. Hope you enjoy this product like I do!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. Easy to apply and comes out black. Most glues come out gray then turns black but not this one. Stays on all day without lifting, and stays on also if it gets wet. Make sure you put it on right the first time because it dries quickly and you half to remove the excess with makeup remover. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Good glue.....keeps lashes in place all day.....not too gummy</li>
            <li> great product and transaction  happy with product</li>
            <li> I love this glue. It goes on great and it hold for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I usually use adhesive from Walmart but decided to try something better and after reading the reviews, I thought this was it. Well, I thought wrong. I rarely write reviews but this was terrible and I hope I can stop others from waisting their money. The glue is extremely weak and does not hold the lash. The lash was coming loose in a matter of a few minutes...it would be very embarrassing to have half of your lashes falling off your face in public! I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I don&#x27;t have to worry about my lashes coming unglued when using it. Fortunate to have found it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply it in the right spot you are goes to go! This was a great product. It holds the lashes in place and does not take off your lashes like other glues. It also does not have that chunky look like some other glues. i love this and for the price it is most definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> It holds well, but it&#x27;s very messy</li>
            <li> Great came in unexpected and a little early but that&#x27;s better and I cant wait to start using this!</li>
            <li> I thought buying this was a brush application. Also, I thought that by it being black it&#x27;ll match my eyeliner however if I miss my lastline the black shows up on my lids so it becomes messy and annoying.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done. However, it&#x27;s not easy to apply as it comes out very quickly and a lot when you squeeze it. The only problem with it being black is that if you mess up and have to reapply the lashes you&#x27;ll have black smudges around your eye.</li>
            <li> Bad glue burns the eyes!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this glue. It truly is jet black when it&#x27;s wet or dry, and also sticks very well, better than DUO. Just be sure to shake the glue bottle upside down before each use as I found it separates a bit. I wear my lashes to bed and in the shower (trying not to soak them in the shower) and they stay in tact and the glue remains jet black in color. With DUO clear the glue would turn white with the shower steam (or with tears) then come loose. I didn&#x27;t like the DUO dark either as this was a gray color, not black. With this glue I have worn my lashes for about two weeks with little to no glue touch up. This is a great find.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing lashes for a very long time...I wear them daily because I love the way they enhance the eyes. With that being said, I was on the hunt for a lash glue that was Black, and also provided the wearer with the ease of knowing their lashes wouldn&#x27;t come off until THEY took them off. After wasting money on many other glues, I stumbled upon Kiss glue and fell in love!  There have been times I&#x27;ve run out, and the stores in my area wouldn&#x27;t have it, so I would buy another brand...will never bother doing that again because I always end up having to reapply during the day. I&#x27;m an esthetician, I&#x27;m waxing, doing facials, and make up, all day...I can&#x27;t worry about my lashes coming off. With this glue, I don&#x27;t have to!  I also teach esthetics and Make Up, and show my students the difference in the glues. This glue is amazing!!! Try it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> beware if you need to avoid latex!  1st ingredient is  RUBBER LATEX..  Many people have sensitivities to latex and that may be why some peoples eyes are burning.. I also find it irritating and did not hold very well.. Though I do like how black it is, almost like wearing eyeliner. It seems hard to find an eyelash adhesive that doesn&#x27;t either contain rubber latex or formaldehyde and that actually works.</li>
