            <li> My sister has this product which she bought new from a store overseas and it works great, is several years old and looks and feels brand new which is why I sought this out on Amazon and purchased it. Unfortunately, I purchased from a seller who had mediocre customer reviews and received a product that appeared used, dirty (with one side being discolored and sticky), and with rusted surfaces. I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed as it is not worth the cost or hassle to return. I have posted photos for reference. I&#x27;m sure as long as you buy from a trusted seller you are OK so just be cautious so you don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
