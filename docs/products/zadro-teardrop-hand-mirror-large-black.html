            <li>and it still looks nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror for my husband who cuts his own hair.</li>
            <li>Ok, I admit this is my own fault.</li>

            <li>my clients love that they can see all of their hair in it.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t even fit in the vanity storage area underneath the sink!</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>It is not the most conveniently shaped mirror to store, although I manage, and a hole is provided if you want to hang it on a wall.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, don&#x27;t expect the heft of the ones your hairdresser puts in your hand.</li>
            <li>Love love this mirror.</li>
            <li>I wanted her to be reminded of the beautiful young lady that she has became.</li>
            <li>Great quality mirror, very clear, no distortion.</li>
            <li>It is large with a goofy shape (much like my head) and is ideal for watching your hairline recede and your bald spot grow over time  :)</li>
            <li>This product is well built but not what my wife calls, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Huge.  </li>
            <li>(dimensions in product description are accurate).</li>
            <li>This mirror is HUGE.</li>
            <li>I liked the mirror so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is light and well made.</li>
            <li>Fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li>Oval shape is great for viewing all of the back of your hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, good price, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>#34;choke-up&amp;#34; on the handle to feel confident it won&#x27;t tip over and break off right</li>
            <li>It would be better served hanging on the wall, its really large.  </li>
            <li>But this Dali-inspired design is true artisanry.</li>
            <li>True image.</li>
            <li>It could practically hang on the wall and be a full length mirror.  </li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Perfect for cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li>Good size mirror for the price, very sturdy and clear and</li>
            <li>It looks great on the new white vanity area.</li>
            <li>The size is large for a hand mirror, but the plastic frame keeps it light weight.</li>
            <li>too large and cheap mirror</li>
            <li>other than that arrived quickly and is a good mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The plastic around the mirror does not feel cheap and the mirror is made out of real glass.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>viewing area is quite large and you can easily see your whole head/face in this mirror</li>
            <li>High quality, huge mirror.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t plan to place this one in your drawer unless its very large.  </li>
            <li>A nice large mirror to hold and see the back of your hairdo which is what I needed</li>
            <li>The construction of this mirror is fine, and the mirror is clear with&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of the type of mirror you see at a salon when they are showing you the back of your hair.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the second mirror is working fine for me - much better than the smaller mirrors that I was using - so I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>of the hand mirror is good enough to view the whole back of your head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not sure what else to say about a good barber mirror</li>
            <li>Much bigger than I expected, but for the money, real nice as far as hand mirrors go..</li>
            <li>I sell jewelry at craft shows and needed a large handheld yet lightweight mirror.  </li>
            <li>And I did want a large hand held mirror.</li>
            <li>It is large.</li>
            <li>and it is large as advertised..  </li>
            <li>when they say large they aren&#x27;t joking.</li>
            <li>turns out that large means gigantic.  </li>
            <li>Mirror was loose at the bottom by the handle and that is not shocking considering the weight of the mirror.</li>
            <li>May fine for a bigger guy or</li>
            <li>Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>Its so big that it won&#x27;t fit in the bathroom vanity drawer where I wanted to store it.</li>
            <li>Too big to fit in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>A real dissapointment.</li>
            <li>Handle and frame are dense synthetic&lt;br /&gt;(?plastic) but is very sturdy feeling.  </li>
            <li>and kind of heavy for my taste.</li>
            <li>We had one of these mirrors and after many years of traveling with it the mirror came apart from the black case.</li>
            <li>Far more than expected.</li>
            <li>High cost but product seems durable.</li>
            <li>I like this mirror a lot, it&#x27;s more interesting than just a typical round mirror.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the handle feels a little bit flimsy, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I actually see pretty clear in the mirrow with low light.</li>
            <li>I had to apply duct tape to mine because the mirror portion was separating from the frame due to the cheap glue used to seal the two parts together.</li>
            <li>This allows you to pick it up right off a flat surface.  </li>
            <li>I bought exactly the same one.</li>
            <li>Also, FWIW I had to send the first one back because there was &amp;#34;splotching&amp;#34; between the mirror and backing that could not be cleaned.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty big.</li>
            <li>This mirror is large enough for me to easily see the back of my head reflected in the mirror behind me and make sure that everything is the way I like it.  </li>
            <li>The glass is clear.</li>
            <li>The product dimensions are clearly stated.</li>
            <li>I move the cabinet door that it&#x27;s fixed too.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Large enough to see what areas need to be trimmed next.</li>
            <li>Okay mirror not very impressed.</li>
            <li>, I expected to be able to hang it on the opposite wall however the back is slightly rounded</li>
            <li>This is very lightweight,First one arrived broken and it was quickly replaced, given the quality</li>

            <li> Large enough to see what areas need to be trimmed next.</li>
            <li> Okay mirror not very impressed.</li>
            <li> , I expected to be able to hang it on the opposite wall however the back is slightly rounded</li>
            <li> This is very lightweight,First one arrived broken and it was quickly replaced, given the quality</li>
            <li> The back of the mirror is rounded to that it doesn&#x27;t lay flat.  </li>
            <li> If you are a frail little old lady with weak wrists this might be too much mirror to handle, otherwise highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t lie flat</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t imagine this will last long.</li>
            <li> Real glass and the rest of the plastic around and behind the mirror feels solid enough.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it&#x27;s bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I imagine you will have this problem with other mirrors of similar glass sizes, though.</li>
            <li> BUT, it is way too big for me to hold it up with one&lt;br /&gt;hand and do my hair with the other hand.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not a really high quality mirror with fancy handles and whatnot.</li>
            <li> than the horrible handle, it is great.  </li>
            <li> It is big, awkward, and might need to hands to hold, but that&#x27;s why you want it right?</li>
            <li> Believe me and all the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, and I might have just not read carefully enough in the description, but the back of it is not completely flat like the mirror side, its a bit rounded, and therefore if I hang it on the wall mirror side out, it looks a little weird because the sides don&#x27;t tough the wall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little substantial in weight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> It feels a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> it is a little over 18 inches in length and 10 inches</li>
            <li> I got it specifically because it has a little opening on the handle so that I can hang it on the wall.</li>
            <li> and I get a little tired for using it to check the back of my hair during prolonged periods.</li>
            <li> This mirror is poorly made, glue in seems shows on back of mirror.  </li>
            <li> The handle is not comfortable to hold either.</li>
            <li> very smart handle design ,, well deserved five star to  ,,,too bad i can&#x27;t give it 10 ...</li>
            <li> and you might struggle to store it in a small drawer or cabinet.</li>
            <li> I, therefore, usually leave it hanging with the mirror side against the wall</li>
            <li> The other reviewers that are complaining about this being too big, or awkward and bulky, are Whiners!  </li>
            <li> Seriously, what can you say about a mirror.</li>
            <li> Big hump-a-lot mirror, low-priced so you don&#x27;t feel bad when you smash it into the floor.</li>
            <li> Not that difficult!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The handle is terrible</li>

            <li> Hello, This met my expectations. It looks great on the new white vanity area. I have nothing else to say</li>
            <li> As ordered, I am happy !!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Love it.</li>
            <li> Big hump-a-lot mirror, low-priced so you don&#x27;t feel bad when you smash it into the floor.</li>
            <li> We had one of these mirrors and after many years of traveling with it the mirror came apart from the black case. I liked the mirror so much I bought exactly the same one.</li>
            <li> High cost but product seems durable.</li>
            <li> Terrific mirror...my clients love that they can see all of their hair in it.</li>
            <li> I sell jewelry at craft shows and needed a large handheld yet lightweight mirror.  This fits the bill,  great size mirror</li>
            <li> Huge.  Great quality mirror, very clear, no distortion.</li>
            <li> I too did not expect this mirror to be so big. It&#x27;s slightly smaller than a tennis racket and you might struggle to store it in a small drawer or cabinet. But I like its unique design, and the handle&#x27;s shape gives you a good grip. The glass is clear. It&#x27;s a little substantial in weight and I get a little tired for using it to check the back of my hair during prolonged periods. I imagine you will have this problem with other mirrors of similar glass sizes, though. It&#x27;s a little pricey but if you&#x27;re looking for a large-ish mirror, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li> High quality, huge mirror. Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Ok, I admit this is my own fault. The product dimensions are clearly stated. And I did want a large hand held mirror. But yikes, this thing is huge! Its so big that it won&#x27;t fit in the bathroom vanity drawer where I wanted to store it. It won&#x27;t even fit in the vanity storage area underneath the sink! It&#x27;s tennis racket size! It&#x27;s snowshoe size! (Sorry for all the exclamation points) If you order this beast, make sure you have a place in the bathroom to store it. I gave it a 5 star review because ordering this thing is my own fault.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Needed a mirror to see the back side and this definitely works. Good quality, good price, not too heavy. It is large.</li>
            <li> Far more than expected. This product is well built but not what my wife calls, easy to use.  It would be better served hanging on the wall, its really large.  Don&#x27;t plan to place this one in your drawer unless its very large.  Otherwise excellent quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too big to be a hand mirror--picture holding a racquetball racket. But this Dali-inspired design is true artisanry.</li>
            <li> A nice large mirror to hold and see the back of your hairdo which is what I needed, I expected to be able to hang it on the opposite wall however the back is slightly rounded so it doesn&#x27;t lie flat it wobbles. Hand held is good and more flexible.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cutting your own hair. Large enough to see what areas need to be trimmed next. I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, what can you say about a mirror. It is large with a goofy shape (much like my head) and is ideal for watching your hairline recede and your bald spot grow over time  :)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Size of the hand mirror is good enough to view the whole back of your head.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic around the mirror does not feel cheap and the mirror is made out of real glass.&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The handle is terrible</li>
            <li> The other reviewers that are complaining about this being too big, or awkward and bulky, are Whiners!  It&#x27;s a $4 mirror, the handle made of plastic and it is large as advertised..  Not that difficult!  I bought this for me esthetician wife to use with her clients and she and her clients LOVE the mirror!  It is big, awkward, and might need to hands to hold, but that&#x27;s why you want it right? cause it&#x27;s a big mirror!  I have nothing to complain about and my wife and her clients, love it! That&#x27;s what matters most!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  The size is large for a hand mirror, but the plastic frame keeps it light weight.</li>
            <li> The mirror is made of glass not plastic like on cheaper products, so no warping/distortions.&lt;br /&gt;The viewing area is quite large and you can easily see your whole head/face in this mirror (dimensions in product description are accurate). My only gripe is that the handle feels a little bit flimsy, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This mirror is definitely BIG.  Too big to fit in a drawer.  However, I wanted big like what I see at the barber shop.  It is that size but it is not quite that quality.  My only gripe about this mirror is the handle.  It feels a little flimsy.  I have to &amp;#34;choke-up&amp;#34; on the handle to feel confident it won&#x27;t tip over and break off right were the handle meets the oval part of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the horrible handle, it is great.  Real glass and the rest of the plastic around and behind the mirror feels solid enough.</li>
            <li> not sure what else to say about a good barber mirror but this does the trick if you need one</li>
            <li> when they say large they aren&#x27;t joking. I didn&#x27;t read the product dimensions when I bought it and it is big. other than that arrived quickly and is a good mirror.</li>
            <li> This identical mirror sells under different brands, so I imagine it is all the same manufacture.  It is the same mirror that barbers use to show a customer the back of their head.  It is nicer than retail, handheld mirrors that you find in department stores.  The teardrop design is practical, and pleasing to the eye when hanging and not in use.</li>
            <li> This mirror is poorly made, glue in seems shows on back of mirror.  A real dissapointment. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Yes...this thing is huge! I had to apply duct tape to mine because the mirror portion was separating from the frame due to the cheap glue used to seal the two parts together. The handle is not comfortable to hold either.</li>
            <li> This mirror is large enough for me to easily see the back of my head reflected in the mirror behind me and make sure that everything is the way I like it.  It is not the most conveniently shaped mirror to store, although I manage, and a hole is provided if you want to hang it on a wall.  Also, FWIW I had to send the first one back because there was &amp;#34;splotching&amp;#34; between the mirror and backing that could not be cleaned.  Nevertheless, the second mirror is working fine for me - much better than the smaller mirrors that I was using - so I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Much bigger than I expected, but for the money, real nice as far as hand mirrors go..great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Okay mirror not very impressed. Has a lot of blindspots.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror! I thought it was a hand held smaller mirror and when it came I realized it is HUGE! I do love it though!</li>
            <li> This mirror is huge! Handle and all it is a little over 18 inches in length and 10 inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;it is light and well made. True image. If I had to choose I would rather larger than smaller.  This may be too big for some.</li>
            <li> It has a rounded back and it&#x27;s pretty big. I bought it thinking it was great to hang on the wall since my partner and I figure over sink space. But they back of it is rounded so it rocks everytime I move the cabinet door that it&#x27;s fixed too. It&#x27;s more of the type of mirror you see at a salon when they are showing you the back of your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, don&#x27;t expect the heft of the ones your hairdresser puts in your hand. This is very lightweight,First one arrived broken and it was quickly replaced, given the quality, I don&#x27;t imagine this will last long.</li>
            <li> It is a Mirror, and it does what it does. Not bad I guess for a mirror, since thats what I want.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to give as a gift for valentines day for my duaghter who is away from home finishing up her last year of college.  I wanted her to be reminded of the beautiful young lady that she has became.</li>
            <li> It works well. Good mirror for the price. Gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not a really high quality mirror with fancy handles and whatnot.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mirror. Oval shape is great for viewing all of the back of your hairstyle.  Handle and frame are dense synthetic&lt;br /&gt;(?plastic) but is very sturdy feeling.  If you are a frail little old lady with weak wrists this might be too much mirror to handle, otherwise highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that say how big the mirror was !!!  and man they were not kidding !! ,,,  big big big ,,, but i love it ,, this mirror is perfect for those guys that  like me ,,  we have the do it yourself hair trimmer ! ! ,,and i have to say this mirror was made for people like us !!  very smart handle design ,, well deserved five star to  ,,,too bad i can&#x27;t give it 10 ...</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I like this mirror a lot, it&#x27;s more interesting than just a typical round mirror. I got it specifically because it has a little opening on the handle so that I can hang it on the wall. The only thing is, and I might have just not read carefully enough in the description, but the back of it is not completely flat like the mirror side, its a bit rounded, and therefore if I hang it on the wall mirror side out, it looks a little weird because the sides don&#x27;t tough the wall. I, therefore, usually leave it hanging with the mirror side against the wall and it still looks nice.</li>
            <li> The back of the mirror is rounded to that it doesn&#x27;t lay flat.  This allows you to pick it up right off a flat surface.  The size is big enough to see my entire noggin while I&#x27;m trimming my hair.</li>
            <li> The construction of this mirror is fine, and the mirror is clear with&lt;br /&gt;no distortion. BUT, it is way too big for me to hold it up with one&lt;br /&gt;hand and do my hair with the other hand. The mirror is just too&lt;br /&gt;big and kind of heavy for my taste. May fine for a bigger guy or&lt;br /&gt;gal.</li>
            <li> This mirror is HUGE. Believe me and all the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Good mirror, not too clunky and no image distortion.&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a pleasant ergo feeling and its not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> too large and cheap mirror</li>
            <li> Great sized mirror. The handle feels flimsy and that is because the mirror is big. The plastic handle and overall plastic cover should have been stronger material. Mirror was loose at the bottom by the handle and that is not shocking considering the weight of the mirror. I took it apart and used gorilla glue to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my husband who cuts his own hair. He loves the big size AND uses it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> turns out that large means gigantic.  It could practically hang on the wall and be a full length mirror.  otherwise, great</li>
            <li> Good size mirror for the price, very sturdy and clear and well put togeather. I like the fact that I actually see pretty clear in the mirrow with low light.</li>
            <li> Love love this mirror. Like others have said, it&#x27;s bigger than I expected. No complaints. Very happy with this purchase</li>
