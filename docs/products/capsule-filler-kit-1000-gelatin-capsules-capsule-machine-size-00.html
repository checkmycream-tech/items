            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>

            <li>seller shipped very timely capsule filler works great</li>
            <li>Love these thank You.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Works well for many applications.</li>
            <li>The most time consuming part has always been filling the capsules.</li>
            <li>there is a better way but</li>
            <li>for now, THIS WORKS OK</li>
            <li>but I havent been able to use it because i had to order in 1000 capsules of &amp;#34;00&amp;#34</li>
            <li>These caps are made of gelatin, an animal product, so I was reassured my dog would be able to digest it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use the flat-bottomed dish or bowl as recommended because there was quite a bit more powder residue on this surface than I</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the machine is okay, once you catch on to how to do it.</li>
            <li>Well pleased.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s why I bought the combo kit - to be sure).</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and they also love it..</li>
            <li>So glad I have this; will recommend it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>make sure you pay attention to the size you need versus the capsules (extras) that you buy and you&#x27;ll be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better if it makes more than 24 a time.  </li>
            <li>Still better than tasting the supplements.</li>
            <li>_ join the caps together, then eject them from the top into a bowl.  </li>
            <li>so I would press the caps together real quick before I eject them from the capsule machine.  </li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>Im sure it would have gotten 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Love that I can use it over and over again.</li>
            <li>What is more, the amount of force varied from hole to hole.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to keep them stored at a warmer tempature</li>
            <li>One bag probably makes something closer to 600 or more capsules.</li>
            <li>Love both items.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Saving me many dollars.  </li>
            <li>, what more could I ask for.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t number how many pills I made by hand before getting one of these.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with fitting 24 capsules at a time, this will work for you as well.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>With the Capsule Machine I can insert the tops of the capsules in the top of the device as I am placing the bottoms of the capsules in the bottom part of the device.</li>
            <li>(Watch the video, it shows a better demo than I can explain).  </li>
            <li>Thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this as my hands&lt;br /&gt;aren&#x27;t</li>
            <li>You can always add more but it can get wasteful if you spill a ton of powder everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>We are able to put in the gel caps and he takes like a champ.</li>
            <li>try it for yourself you will love it.</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to make coconut oil supplements.</li>
            <li>FOR THE MOST PART HELD UP.</li>
            <li>But for the reason i ordered it, there were too many capsules.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I was not to sure about it, but took a gamble.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>When I was doing each capsule by hand, I was able to also fill in the top section.  </li>
            <li>Could not ask  for more.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where this capsule machine saves the day, it saves me from having to taste the most vile powdered supplements known to mankind.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It was very easy and very quick to fill the capsules and put them together.</li>
            <li>I do my own non-GMO Vitamin C, Matcha, fiber, and am searching for other great bulk supplement powders that DON&#x27;T COME FROM CHINA!</li>
            <li>I fill my own capsules with dietary supplements, saving significant $.  </li>
            <li>sure makes life easier if you have to full your own ......</li>
            <li>This is a great capsule-making system, easy to use and much easier than making capsules by hand.</li>
            <li>Was even kinda fun!!</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants to fill their own capsules, either to insure the purity of the contents or to save money by buying in bulk, this machine is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, already used up all capsules and buying more to use with this filler.</li>
            <li>and it will work perfectly every single time.</li>
            <li>Used for herbal powders, this handy dandy filler and the capsules make dosing our herbs quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>but I guess that&#x27;s what makes the kit so cheap :)</li>
            <li>Some of the capsules fit more snug than others.</li>
            <li>This works great for people wanting to add natural substance a Passion Flower Leaf, Ginger, or Turmeric Powder to their regiments without having to suffer through tasting them.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good value</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome, I filled about 200 caps with cayenne pepper last night while I watched a movie, easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I found this capsule machine easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The capsule machine made it SOOO easy to encapsulate.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really easy and within a couple of batches you earn your PhD in it.</li>
            <li>you can easily fill 100 capsules in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It was easy to understand.</li>
            <li>The package arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these capsule machines before they are easy to operate</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I would easily buy again these items.</li>
            <li>easy....</li>
            <li>Easy to fill,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy just to take a pen and \\&quot;roll\\</li>
            <li>It was so easy (I was 3 days postpartum</li>
            <li>so I NEEDED easy).</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to do after awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ts extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use and inexpensive product.  </li>
            <li>these are great my only problem is that sometimes when I put the caps on they dont fill up all the way but its ok.</li>
            <li>easy to get used to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instructions were also easily understandable, including pictures at each step.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just read directions.</li>
            <li>It cleans up quite easily too.</li>
            <li>Easy to load</li>
            <li>Using this product it was really easy to fill capsules.</li>
            <li>If you want to make your life easy then get this product.</li>
            <li>I strongly advise getting and using the tamper tool.</li>
            <li>If you follow the easy to understand instructions, you will find this to be a quality product that will suit your needs just fine.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in making your own vitamins or supplements, this practically pays for itself.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using a product of this kind</li>
            <li>The first batch I was kind of wondering how the world it was going to all work</li>
            <li>It is a major time saver and sure beats filling them by hand!!</li>
            <li>It worked good with the capsules that came with the machine but as soon as i bought some new ones</li>
            <li>I like it just fine now.</li>
            <li>works fine,  will recomend</li>
            <li>THE DEVICE IS FINE</li>
            <li>Quality seems fine and no problems with the plastic.</li>
            <li>Capsules went together smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>I like Cap M Quick better.</li>
            <li>If the price point is too high for a better quality machine they can offer one with the better materials as an &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; for people like myself who would shell out the money if it was more well made.</li>
            <li>Instructions could have been more clear, but after the first success&lt;br /&gt;it was a great discovery to know I can &amp;#34;roll my own&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
            <li>easy to seal, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to clean, so get</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34; works pretty well, but the caps aren&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>Not having to put the tops of the caps on myself is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for one day and made about 200 capsules filled with Turmeric, Cayenne and Cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Since I have had my machine I have filled over 8,000 capsules with herbs that I take 2 times a day.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed at the lack of wasted powder when filling the capsules.</li>
            <li>Cheap product that works well.  </li>
            <li>I filled them with my fiber powder to make it easier to take.  </li>
            <li>I have tried using the provided desiccant bag for over a week without improved fit.  </li>
            <li>She filled a 6 month supply in about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>so I put baking pan on the table, then parchment to collect excess that falls off for easy clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>One thing I have noticed that capsule does not get fully filled, maybe 85-90%</li>
            <li>I use this to make pills filled with turmeric, cinnamon, mustard seeds, etc...</li>
            <li>Basically any spice that provides fantastic health benefits but don&#x27;t like the spicy tastes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took another randon capsule out of the bag; it didn&#x27;t fit either.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I had some &amp;#34;00&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Includes tamper to obtain consistently filled caps.  </li>
            <li>Well made, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It has great ease of use and looks to be durable enough.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>directions were vague....and the capsules once filled would not release from the machine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving three stars because though the machine works great, there is an obvious lack of quality control coming from the factory if a size &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; machine gets put in a &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; box. .</li>
            <li>Then I filled Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>Cuts the cost of pre filled supplements like Camu Camu, Fenugreek and Corydalis.</li>
            <li>works very well for packing our own vitamin C and herbs</li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to be and worked smoothly</li>
            <li>Perhaps I simply got a superior capsule machine compared to most.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfectly, though I have to say I was very glad for the website to the demonstration video - I found the instructions a bit confusing as I was using a capsule machine for the first time.  </li>
            <li>so much so my daughter VOLUNTEERS to make them for me as she thinks its &#x27;fun&#x27;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the right size capsules for the machine</li>
            <li>The tolerances and effect of the entire machine design are very effective.</li>
            <li>very useful.</li>
            <li>but once you get it, it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li>This makes it super easy to make capsules.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scary how easy this thing is to use and make my own perfect supplement mixture.</li>
            <li>overall good value, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does take more than two minutes to load all the gelatin capsules into the holders, but once this is done, the rest is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>my hubby is quite a calm guy, but there were &amp;^%$!</li>
            <li>Really fun and money saving device!</li>
            <li>: Be aware that many powders can cause you to make gas and fart.</li>
            <li>He tells me that because it makes much more at a time that it really is a time saver too!</li>
            <li>The free capsules is a sweet plus to the deal.  </li>
            <li>It comes with everything you need and the capsules that are included are good for general use.</li>
            <li>works good if you are pilling up a fine powder you have to clean out occasionally</li>
            <li>For once, filling my capsules was actually fun and easy.  </li>
            <li>The process was fun and everything was easy to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li>Capsules are good quality, I&#x27;ve been able to fit nearly a gram into one, impressive, though a tad difficult to swallow if your not a pill person.</li>
            <li>Most people won&#x27;t need to fill that many pills as frequently.</li>
            <li>Easier to grasp gel caps with clean</li>
            <li>nothing special just as they should be.</li>
            <li>Besides the price is really right!</li>
            <li>Buying it bundled with the empty capsules was a great bargain.</li>
            <li>A full 5.</li>
            <li>which was way cool.</li>
            <li>Material is inferior and thus does not stand up to many real world conditions.</li>
            <li>Whole sold 100 for 6 bucks, I got 1000 for 10 buck should I say more</li>
            <li>Love this product, makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>Each capsule should fill in full by now.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more caps real soon.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is so cool.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of product to fill because I was having such a good time doing it.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and the accompanying instructions are very clear.  </li>
            <li>So far so good + super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge money saver for me as well, since the powdered herbs I use these for are much cheaper when bought in bulk, then processed into gelatin capsules for easy consumption.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how easily I was able to use this product.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised, simple to use and effective to push out 24 capsuls at a time, once you get used to it you can pop them out very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Its pretty easy to use (it seems)</li>
            <li>Was pretty darn easy to use and came with plenty of capsules.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty easy once you get a hang of it.</li>
            <li>Given that the other \\&quot;machines\\&quot; in this price range require you to install the tops by hand, this is a great time-saving device.  </li>
            <li>it becomes stained quickly.</li>
            <li>Fills 24 caps quickly.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and with no damage.</li>
            <li>This item works well for the most part, but occasionally the capsules hang up in the top portion</li>
            <li>Every so often, a capsule won&#x27;t fill right or the end will squish, but for the most part it works well and the job is much easier to get done with the machine, rather than by hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>For instance I filled Quercetin first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li>I do not regret buying this at all and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make their own capsules.</li>
            <li>Well I found this product to be verry fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and really works to make the capsules.</li>
            <li>It is so easy and fast</li>
            <li>Capsule machine is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Filling capsules has become incredibly easy and fast.</li>
            <li>We needed this for a very fine powdery supplement that doesn&#x27;t mix well in liquid and is only available in bulk powder.</li>
            <li>That was when i noticed that the holes in the machine are not even consistent circles!</li>
            <li>Luckily I had a Tupperware container the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little device that will save you money AND allow you to know exactly what is in your supplements!</li>
            <li>The little machine serves a great purpose.</li>
            <li>Great little machine that works well.  </li>
            <li>Great little kit.  </li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use just make sure you always buy the right size capsules for the filler kit.</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for a few months and it works great.</li>
            <li>Then repeat this whole process until you&#x27;ve filled 1000 capsules.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a desiccant to keep the gel caps fresh which is a necessity.</li>
            <li>I know that the product I am using is fresh and organic</li>
            <li>Once that was done the machine and caps worked great, and far faster than individual filling.</li>
            <li>Totally worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>this really is worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to get started packing up your own supplements, look no further.  </li>
            <li>The box was labeled as a 00 sized machine; what was actually inside would fit 0 size capsules but had no chance of fitting the 00 capsules that came with it.</li>
            <li>This is DEFINITELY worth the money.</li>
            <li>I used it twice effectively, however I wasted 3 times as many gelcaps as I created.</li>
            <li>And with practice that rarely happens.</li>
            <li>Be sure to place the included desiccant packing with the capsules into an airtight container, otherwise the capsules will swell and will no longer fit properly into the filler.</li>
            <li>But it is still worth to get it.</li>
            <li>that makes more pills at one time, but the tops have to be individually placed on the filled bottoms one by one.  </li>
            <li>So I am pretty new to this whole filling your own capsules thing</li>
            <li>Excellent capsule filler at a very competitive price,  Works well, instructions are clear and the kit includes desiccant to prevent swelling of capsules due to humidity.  </li>
            <li>First off, this is a great little machine.</li>
            <li>Its sturdy plastic, takes some practice to get right but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(yes they were the right size i checked twice)</li>
            <li>Although I myself do not use the capsule filler, I bought it for my son to fill and make capsules for me since I have use of just my right hand.</li>
            <li>Yes, we bought the right size capsules,</li>
            <li>If you are making a lot, stop and clean a little bit before continuing, that will make sure you don&#x27;t get jam easily.</li>
            <li>the capsules are easy to fill (watch the video on the comments and you will see how easy) and they are easy to get the pills down my dog too!..</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I crush his 3 tablets into a fine powder with a pill crusher, then fill as many capsules as it takes to contain all the crushed med.</li>
            <li>Other than some of the capsules being very brittle, everything else was very satisfactory, the 24 cap filler kit is just right for the number of caps to make at a time and the ease of loading and closing the caps is just great.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions and easy to wipe down or clean when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought another in a different size because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>I made 72 capsules in about 20 minutes and now I can make them super fast...</li>
            <li>to use, easy to clean, a big money saver.</li>
            <li>works great and makes what would have been a tedious chore quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li>It also disassembles completely for easy cleaning when you are done.  </li>
            <li>I was missing my greens powder and figured the next best thing was to get it into capsules.</li>
            <li>The kit is easy to use and completely meets my requirements.  </li>
            <li>you very much in advance</li>
            <li>They went a bit more than half way in easily</li>
            <li>This is a very neat little machine and I could not be more pleased with its purchase.</li>
            <li>Took about 5 minutes for 24 capsules the first try.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love my machine and would recommend this size capsule machine to anyone for personal use.</li>
            <li>This is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I suspect however, that they most likely come from China.  </li>
            <li>I just finished filling my first batch of capsules</li>
            <li>Expect a bent capsule or two at first - but its the mistakes in loading you make that make you an expert in record time.</li>
            <li>This thing does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I have just used this tonight for the first time.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more gel caps when I run out.</li>
            <li>Product worked exactly how it was represented.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great set, worth the money and seems very well</li>
            <li>I made 96 caps of Piracetam within 10 minutes and this was my first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper than having the pharmacist do it!</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm the first time, it worked even better the second time,third time I was a champ.</li>
            <li>This was an excellent purchase and Ill be using this capsule filler for years to come.</li>
            <li>This is the first capsule filling machine I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews I wasnt sure if this thing was actually gonna work.</li>
            <li>Way too much work!</li>
            <li>exactly what advertised, etc.</li>
            <li>I used this capsule filler for my first time placenta encapsulation.</li>
            <li>however I need to purchase a big one for what I&#x27;m making, but this will do for now :)</li>
            <li>On my first trial it took me 11 minutes to do the load of 24 capsules.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever purchased a product like this.</li>
            <li>i plan on recommending this to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that is bigger and can do more capsules at a time than 24.</li>
            <li>Honestly there&#x27;s not much to say about this capsule filler.</li>
            <li>gelatin pills arent exactly candy flavored</li>
            <li>they should higher someone at the factory that can read and count.......</li>
            <li>Jamming is not a problem with it, because the system works differently, although a bit more manually, but that&#x27;s the price</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy the little capsule machine, it&#x27;s quick easy and convenient.  </li>
            <li>I mix my own supplements in order to make sure I am only getting what I need and to cut down on the cost.</li>
            <li>Many inexpensive empty gelatin capsules are manufactured with significant variations in size, plus all of them will swell in high humidity.  </li>
            <li>Know what you are really getting, deal with reputable companies that provide proper information or keep looking elsewhere!</li>
            <li>I leave the extra on the foil until i have a good amount then dump excess back</li>
            <li>This capsule machine should last forever, good quality and simple to use.</li>
            <li>This Capsule Filler Kit works pretty much as described, with 24 capsules taking about five minutes to fill.  </li>
            <li>Goes pretty fast once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>You get pretty fast at using this.</li>
            <li>Made my first few batches of herbal remedies and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>To clean just dry dust with a clean cloth or paper towel.</li>
            <li>the encapsulator worked flawlessly right out of the box, and I have used it many times by now with no problems to speak of (other than once, which was user error) ...</li>
            <li>very easy to use, and can save you quite a bit of money if you buy bulk herbs, or other supplements.</li>
            <li>This capsule filler is easy to use and seems like it is made to last.</li>
            <li>The capsules are easy to work with and, since it comes in a pkg of 1,000 my learning curve was no big loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, 10/10 for experience including easy ordering, delivery as promised, working device, working capsule.</li>
            <li>Very quick, not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>You just have to make certain you press about 3x and ALL capsules release</li>
            <li>The large capsules get stuck in the holes.</li>
            <li>#34;00&amp;#34;, however the &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; capsules are too large for the machine.</li>
            <li>These work just fine and the capsule machine makes it very simple to load the caps.</li>
            <li>I found that if I match the tops and bottoms of the capsules when inserting them, so the each top goes back on the same bottom it came from, I can pretty much get a 100% success rate.</li>
            <li>I also used it to make individual capsules and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>This little contraption and the capsules that come with it work amazingly well together.</li>
            <li>This little machine allowed me to purchase bulk herbs and create my own capsules.  </li>
            <li>Watch a YouTube video on this handy little device.  </li>
            <li>The result was success - the new 00 machine is the right size and fits the &#x27;old&#x27; 00</li>
            <li>I fixed the capsule but on closer inspection it was clear that there was no way it was going to fit into the machine.</li>
            <li>Anyway, she buys bulk items and had been trying to take them straight and on occasion filling capsules by hand.  </li>
            <li>This saves me so much time.</li>
            <li>Very grateful.</li>
            <li>I had been filling capsules by hand one by one on an as needed basis, this is much easier.</li>
            <li>I have filled several thousand capsules with this filler, and have no complaints.</li>
            <li>If you ever capsule powders by hand, this will make your life much easier.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was reasonable as well, get this is you need to get your supplements into a capsule.</li>
            <li>Now when I ordered one for my brother I told him what mistakes I made and he never did it and really loves his machine.</li>
            <li>I make up a whole lot of capsules at one time.</li>
            <li>We really like this combo.</li>
            <li>They include the desiccant bag to keep them from sticking together until ready to be used.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied with both the pill machine and the empty capsules.  </li>
            <li>Watched a video on you tube on this very product.....  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure the dosages vary widely between caps.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially when I filled capsules with turmeric.  </li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So got it, and it was much easier to use then</li>
            <li>The capsule machine is nifty &amp; really speeds up the process.</li>
            <li>how much each one can hold.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>4.2: If fully filled, give yourself a pat in the back and help others.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>Whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>Whole grain breads&lt;br /&gt;VEGETABLES&lt;br</li>
            <li>I fill capsules with virgin coconut oil, and it is so much quicker to fill the capsules with this kit.</li>
            <li>It did the job very well</li>
            <li>There is a lot of manual work filling capsules with this type of machine, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this filler if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of ongoing capsules to fill.</li>
            <li>I find it much faster to fill each capsule by hand</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Then gently push them out onto another piece of aluminium foil or container to hold them.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Capsule Machine&amp;#34; makes it so much easier and faster</li>
            <li>Saves so much time.</li>
            <li>This capsule filling machine works very well for that.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This machine works really well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain about it for the price.</li>
            <li>In my case I had Pramiracetam, Centrophenoxine, and Vinpocetine all in one pill in reasonable doses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This capsule filler makes it so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, it worked very well.</li>
            <li>It makes filling the capsules so much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li>words coming out of him during the whole time we were doing this.</li>
            <li>I just set by the Tv in my off time and fill capsules as buying herbs are much cheaper this way.</li>
            <li>Figured cheaper making your own turmeric or green tea pills</li>
            <li>I had never filled my own caps before -</li>
            <li>You are near there my friend; ideally, we love to have all possible sizes</li>
            <li>5: Keep total weigh of ADDED EXTRA powder, and you have your own formula for your batch of 24 capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It took me the first 100 grams to get my rhythm down :)</li>
            <li>I have used 500 of the caps thus far and have had maybe 5 that did not cap right.</li>
            <li>The kit is easy to use, just stick the large end of the capsule into the top and pull the smaller end out, though filling will take a little longer.  </li>
            <li>Works much better with new and/or dry caps.</li>
            <li>The capsule machine is super easy to use but bit messy</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described, comes with clear instructions and buying the capsules with it, just makes it all the easier!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, straightforward product that does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>If you try to partially fill capsules with this device, you will end up with some capsules that have significantly more powder than others - this is highly unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The process of making capsules is a bit messy, and hopefully as I become more adept there will be less of this granular powder all over the place.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use,  following the clear, simple instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I am now able to incorporate Turmeric into my daily routine and am reaping the health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>The machine makes capsule assembly MUCH more efficient than my previous method (assembly by hand).  </li>
            <li>Also the machine is dishwasher safe and doesnt stain like previous reviews have stated.</li>
            <li>but I think the reason you get less into the capsule in the end is because you can&#x27;t fill the top portion as well.  </li>
            <li>Must be messy and wasteful, not being able to get as much into the capsules as you can.</li>
            <li>This product does a decent job filling capsules.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to load and quick.</li>
            <li>capsule filler kit works very well, a bit messy as expected; I would have liked this same style kit but with the capacity to fill more than 24 capsules at a time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is only a suitable filler if you are going to be filling the larger part of each capsule *completely</li>
            <li>If still partial filled, shake out those existing powder, weigh 10 grams more (and write down#, add to existing powder andmix well, fill capsule again and look:</li>
            <li>did notice that the top does not always join the capsules tightly to the bottom</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone else</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>i dont know how this item was so highly rated.</li>
            <li>The machine itself works fine, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the capsules getting jammed.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing</li>
            <li>the capsules are easy to use and can use for other ingredients as well as Nopal Powder.</li>
            <li>I just spent about 2 hours making 300 filled capsules.</li>
            <li>The product is a great idea and if it wasnt flawed</li>
            <li>Do you see the capsule fully filled or partial fill?&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>Do you see the capsule fully filled or partially filled?&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>But if you are making capsules that you will only be taking one or two pills a day, it is worth having.</li>
            <li>We thought we could save money putting pills together ourselves, but I&#x27;m finding that its worth paying extra to avoid the stress that comes along with using this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Good idea, poor execution.</li>
            <li>Use an large piece that goes over the edge so you can use it to funnel extra material back into original bag.</li>
            <li>They have to be tamped several times and therefore it&#x27;s a lot more work than if you had a dry</li>
            <li>Prepare to store the capsules in a cool DRY place.</li>
            <li>I managed to pack 2 large capsule halves together in the same hole, which threw the whole thing off.</li>
            <li>Then simply add your powder, spread it with the card, tamp it down, spread some more, then push down to cause the bottoms of the capsules to raise, put the top over the bottom to _automatically</li>
            <li>I have filled hundreds of gelcaps with cinnamon, caffeine and other powdered supplements and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>This little thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problem with humidity, and I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>I live in Louisiana</li>
            <li>but I could easily fill 24 capsules in less than three minutes.</li>
            <li>With the tamper I&#x27;m sure that all the caps are roughly the same dose.  </li>
            <li>Perfect caps, even with my thick and clumsy fingers.  </li>
            <li>Works well, the only thing I noticed is I thought the capsules were longer than others I had used (pills I bought already filled), but come to find out they just needed to be pushed together further.</li>
            <li>I filled several hundred capsules the same day I received product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and makes a nice tight capsule filled with all my crazy herbal concoctions.</li>
            <li>plastic kit is quite sturdy and well made, and the instructions were very clear.  </li>
            <li>Took a little time at first to figure it out, but after that, it was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>gripe is that my second batch always has a little supplement residue after I pressed the caps which doesn&#x27;t look as nice as a professional companies supplement.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t quite fill to capacity due to the top needing to close properly</li>
            <li>(so he doesn&#x27;t break open the nastiness inside the capsules ;)</li>
            <li>As I enjoy gourmet  foods I am sensitive to foreign tastes in my food and drink.</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviews said they received the wrong sized capsules, but mine were perfect.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and is pretty simple to use.</li>
            <li>Because of some of the other comments on Amazon I knew that it may be a tight fit, but these capsules were never going to fit into this</li>
            <li>I realize it is not meant for liquids, but as long as you take them right away, it works.  </li>
            <li>The capsules stay stuck in the holes once filled and half fall apart.</li>
            <li>Especially the healthy ones i cant choke down.</li>
            <li>The capsules seem perfectly fine (I prefer the animal gelatin as these have to the vegicaps), but I&#x27;m not really excited about paying another $15-20 for an additional capsule machine.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I can do all the above mentioned, fill the capsules, pack em&#x27;, add more filling, pack, etc in just over 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>No mess!  </li>
            <li>The kit comes with one large silica gel packet in a large zip-lock plastic back, for drying and shrinking an entire batch of capsules at at time.  </li>
            <li>&quot; it around in the capsule hole to clear it out.</li>
            <li>For simple humidity protection, I would much rather have tiny silica packets that I would store with each individual batch of filled packets, such as one would find in a store-purchased jar of vitamins.  </li>
            <li>Clearly there is variability with the manufacturing of this contraption. 00</li>
            <li>I was filling psyllium husk, but it did not fill the capsule completely.  </li>
            <li>I have used this machine to make 1000+ capsules so far.</li>
            <li>Without a funnel to directly place the material in the capsule, I was getting weights between 140mg and 240 mg.  </li>
            <li>This machine has completely demystified capsule-making.</li>
            <li>issues at all so far.  </li>
            <li>Work perfectly so far</li>
            <li>For design and ease of use, he gave this device a 9/10 quality compared to his professional tools.</li>
            <li>Sealing the capsules has worked perfectly so far.</li>
            <li>This is so much nicer than trying to do all of these individually.</li>
            <li>The packet tells not only how to keep this from happening, but also how to make the packet reusable by gently reheating it in the oven</li>
            <li>So now i have to return the whole thing to get my credit back</li>
            <li>Yes, I got fewer capsules, but at least I know they are safe for me to consume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to encapsulate herbs and spices to take as natural remedies.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter makes them in her spare time.  </li>
            <li>It is simple to use, of hardy construction that will last forever and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Surely this is complicated, right?</li>
            <li>I make my capsules while watching tv , its easy repetitive work.</li>
            <li>The directions are easy and after the second try, they looked as professional as the ones I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li>My first one was the single &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>I also make customized mixed tablets for my particular needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that big of a deal, they still work fine, your just swallowing a slightly (like maybe a millimeter) longer pill, or squeezing them together by hand.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them getting stuck stuck, but just dry them out a little more in a container of sorts.</li>
            <li>recommend putting only a little bit of your powder or herbs on the top of the filler, so you don&#x27;t need to try and scrape up excess and put it back in the bag.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t tamper too much you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>My only observation/critique is that there isn&#x27;t really a method for getting exact dosages into the capsules unless you are just filling the bottom half of the capsule to capacity.  </li>
            <li>Abit on the messy side, but it gets the job done and fairly quick.</li>
            <li>However, a bit of a mess is created when using this (unless you&#x27;re very careful), so make sure to use it in a bowl or pan.</li>
            <li>* Broad beans&lt;</li>
            <li>i bought this machine to fill my own herbal supplements and was extremely disappointed by how much work it really was.</li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to tamp down very fine powders like activated charcoal, as it could get messy.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to use for small quantities.</li>
            <li>The only way I see in which jamming can be prevented is if the plastic parts which rub against the capsule are washed cleanly with water and dried - before each time they&#x27;re used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another solution is to compute and use a large amount of filler powder such as microcrystalline cellulose in order to standardize the dose volume to the capsule size - this is mathematically involved and potentially error-prone.</li>
            <li>With reasonable care it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I really like using it on the Epsom Salts because the taste is so bitter without the capsule.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s it apparently.</li>
            <li>so we do not partial fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the actual filling of the capsules</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t do the drinks very well, so the capsules are a great way to get these things down without having to suffer unpleasant taste.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to fill all 1000 capsules in a little less than 3 hours.</li>
            <li>i messed up the first time by not shoving the pills all away down</li>
            <li>Lay a towel down first.</li>
            <li>Any apprehension that I had from negative reviews that I had read was immediately washed away when the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li>this little gadget is super easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had a broken cap yet.</li>
            <li>It only takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, and once you do you can be making capsules quickly.</li>
            <li>they did not fit into the machine right.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep your empty capsules in an airtight container because the moisture in the air can affect the capsules making the device a little more difficult to use.</li>
            <li>A few just do not want to fit into the holes, while others will be loose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard plastic that is sure to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>You will also need a large glass container to store the empty capsules in for future use.  </li>
            <li>if you have something like tea to take from a Chinese Medical Doctor that is too bitter (check with Doctor first).  </li>
            <li>It is fun filling capsules, takes little time, and can be done while watching TV!</li>
            <li>It gets old separating the capsules, place one half in the bottom of the machine, place the other half in the top of the machine, repeat 24 times...  </li>
            <li>Still, you have to be a little bit nimble to pull the empty capsules apart and fit them in their respective slots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to keep all the pills the same quantity of stuff, and with the powder smasher you can pack it down and then put smaller doses of other substances in the same pill.  </li>
            <li>Seems solidly built and should last a long time with normal use.</li>
            <li>- A COPY OF CAPSULE FILLER FOR DUMMIES COULD BE HELPFUL AND THE PROCESS IS PRETTY MESSY.</li>
            <li>Its worth it if you are going to make small batches.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product based on my initial reaction and as there are really no parts to break off</li>
            <li>By my 3rd round of pills, all but 1 came out and the tops of the pills were securely on (one end locks into the other).</li>
            <li>this is only for a small number tho, overall, this item is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The casings were the right moisture, not to big or small for the machine.</li>
            <li>, if you are worried about waste, make sure to put the platform on a paper plate and, if you are very worried about waste, you can shake the capsules in a bag with a small hole in the bottom to get the excess powder off of them.</li>
            <li>A little messy and cumbersome , but works fine.</li>
            <li>I re-read the instructions and realized that I was supposed to use the moisture absorbing packet to shrink the little buggers.</li>
            <li>This little capsule machine makes filling capsules MUCH easier and quicker.  </li>
            <li>I use it for a particular herb that is like saw dust going down.</li>
            <li>Capsule filler works better than I expected, with less mess!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d rather have to take one additional capsule in order to get the full amount than do it by hand with the mess and fuss and take one less.  </li>

            <li> seller shipped very timely capsule filler works great</li>
            <li> Love these thank You.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well for many applications.</li>
            <li> The most time consuming part has always been filling the capsules.</li>
            <li> there is a better way but</li>
            <li> for now, THIS WORKS OK</li>
            <li> but I havent been able to use it because i had to order in 1000 capsules of &amp;#34;00&amp;#34</li>
            <li> These caps are made of gelatin, an animal product, so I was reassured my dog would be able to digest it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use the flat-bottomed dish or bowl as recommended because there was quite a bit more powder residue on this surface than I</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the machine is okay, once you catch on to how to do it.</li>
            <li> Well pleased.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s why I bought the combo kit - to be sure).</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and they also love it..</li>
            <li> So glad I have this; will recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> make sure you pay attention to the size you need versus the capsules (extras) that you buy and you&#x27;ll be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better if it makes more than 24 a time.  </li>
            <li> Still better than tasting the supplements.</li>
            <li> _ join the caps together, then eject them from the top into a bowl.  </li>
            <li> so I would press the caps together real quick before I eject them from the capsule machine.  </li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> Im sure it would have gotten 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love that I can use it over and over again.</li>
            <li> What is more, the amount of force varied from hole to hole.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to keep them stored at a warmer tempature</li>
            <li> One bag probably makes something closer to 600 or more capsules.</li>
            <li> Love both items.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Saving me many dollars.  </li>
            <li> , what more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t number how many pills I made by hand before getting one of these.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re okay with fitting 24 capsules at a time, this will work for you as well.</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> With the Capsule Machine I can insert the tops of the capsules in the top of the device as I am placing the bottoms of the capsules in the bottom part of the device.</li>
            <li> (Watch the video, it shows a better demo than I can explain).  </li>
            <li> Thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this as my hands&lt;br /&gt;aren&#x27;t</li>
            <li> You can always add more but it can get wasteful if you spill a ton of powder everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> We are able to put in the gel caps and he takes like a champ.</li>
            <li> try it for yourself you will love it.</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to make coconut oil supplements.</li>
            <li> FOR THE MOST PART HELD UP.</li>
            <li> But for the reason i ordered it, there were too many capsules.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> I was not to sure about it, but took a gamble.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> When I was doing each capsule by hand, I was able to also fill in the top section.  </li>
            <li> Could not ask  for more.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where this capsule machine saves the day, it saves me from having to taste the most vile powdered supplements known to mankind.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It was very easy and very quick to fill the capsules and put them together.</li>
            <li> I do my own non-GMO Vitamin C, Matcha, fiber, and am searching for other great bulk supplement powders that DON&#x27;T COME FROM CHINA!</li>
            <li> I fill my own capsules with dietary supplements, saving significant $.  </li>
            <li> sure makes life easier if you have to full your own ......</li>
            <li> This is a great capsule-making system, easy to use and much easier than making capsules by hand.</li>
            <li> Was even kinda fun!!</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants to fill their own capsules, either to insure the purity of the contents or to save money by buying in bulk, this machine is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, already used up all capsules and buying more to use with this filler.</li>
            <li> and it will work perfectly every single time.</li>
            <li> Used for herbal powders, this handy dandy filler and the capsules make dosing our herbs quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s what makes the kit so cheap :)</li>
            <li> Some of the capsules fit more snug than others.</li>
            <li> This works great for people wanting to add natural substance a Passion Flower Leaf, Ginger, or Turmeric Powder to their regiments without having to suffer through tasting them.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good value</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, I filled about 200 caps with cayenne pepper last night while I watched a movie, easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I found this capsule machine easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The capsule machine made it SOOO easy to encapsulate.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really easy and within a couple of batches you earn your PhD in it.</li>
            <li> you can easily fill 100 capsules in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was easy to understand.</li>
            <li> The package arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these capsule machines before they are easy to operate</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I would easily buy again these items.</li>
            <li> easy....</li>
            <li> Easy to fill,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy just to take a pen and \\&quot;roll\\</li>
            <li> It was so easy (I was 3 days postpartum</li>
            <li> so I NEEDED easy).</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to do after awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and inexpensive product.  </li>
            <li> these are great my only problem is that sometimes when I put the caps on they dont fill up all the way but its ok.</li>
            <li> easy to get used to</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instructions were also easily understandable, including pictures at each step.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just read directions.</li>
            <li> It cleans up quite easily too.</li>
            <li> Easy to load</li>
            <li> Using this product it was really easy to fill capsules.</li>
            <li> If you want to make your life easy then get this product.</li>
            <li> I strongly advise getting and using the tamper tool.</li>
            <li> If you follow the easy to understand instructions, you will find this to be a quality product that will suit your needs just fine.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in making your own vitamins or supplements, this practically pays for itself.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using a product of this kind</li>
            <li> The first batch I was kind of wondering how the world it was going to all work</li>
            <li> It is a major time saver and sure beats filling them by hand!!</li>
            <li> It worked good with the capsules that came with the machine but as soon as i bought some new ones</li>
            <li> I like it just fine now.</li>
            <li> works fine,  will recomend</li>
            <li> THE DEVICE IS FINE</li>
            <li> Quality seems fine and no problems with the plastic.</li>
            <li> Capsules went together smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> I like Cap M Quick better.</li>
            <li> If the price point is too high for a better quality machine they can offer one with the better materials as an &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; for people like myself who would shell out the money if it was more well made.</li>
            <li> Instructions could have been more clear, but after the first success&lt;br /&gt;it was a great discovery to know I can &amp;#34;roll my own&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
            <li> easy to seal, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to clean, so get</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34; works pretty well, but the caps aren&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> Not having to put the tops of the caps on myself is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for one day and made about 200 capsules filled with Turmeric, Cayenne and Cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Since I have had my machine I have filled over 8,000 capsules with herbs that I take 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed at the lack of wasted powder when filling the capsules.</li>
            <li> Cheap product that works well.  </li>
            <li> I filled them with my fiber powder to make it easier to take.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using the provided desiccant bag for over a week without improved fit.  </li>
            <li> She filled a 6 month supply in about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> so I put baking pan on the table, then parchment to collect excess that falls off for easy clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> One thing I have noticed that capsule does not get fully filled, maybe 85-90%</li>
            <li> I use this to make pills filled with turmeric, cinnamon, mustard seeds, etc...</li>
            <li> Basically any spice that provides fantastic health benefits but don&#x27;t like the spicy tastes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took another randon capsule out of the bag; it didn&#x27;t fit either.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I had some &amp;#34;00&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Includes tamper to obtain consistently filled caps.  </li>
            <li> Well made, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It has great ease of use and looks to be durable enough.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> directions were vague....and the capsules once filled would not release from the machine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving three stars because though the machine works great, there is an obvious lack of quality control coming from the factory if a size &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; machine gets put in a &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; box. .</li>
            <li> Then I filled Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Cuts the cost of pre filled supplements like Camu Camu, Fenugreek and Corydalis.</li>
            <li> works very well for packing our own vitamin C and herbs</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to be and worked smoothly</li>
            <li> Perhaps I simply got a superior capsule machine compared to most.  </li>
            <li> Worked perfectly, though I have to say I was very glad for the website to the demonstration video - I found the instructions a bit confusing as I was using a capsule machine for the first time.  </li>
            <li> so much so my daughter VOLUNTEERS to make them for me as she thinks its &#x27;fun&#x27;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the right size capsules for the machine</li>
            <li> The tolerances and effect of the entire machine design are very effective.</li>
            <li> very useful.</li>
            <li> but once you get it, it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> This makes it super easy to make capsules.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary how easy this thing is to use and make my own perfect supplement mixture.</li>
            <li> overall good value, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does take more than two minutes to load all the gelatin capsules into the holders, but once this is done, the rest is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> my hubby is quite a calm guy, but there were &amp;^%$!</li>
            <li> Really fun and money saving device!</li>
            <li> : Be aware that many powders can cause you to make gas and fart.</li>
            <li> He tells me that because it makes much more at a time that it really is a time saver too!</li>
            <li> The free capsules is a sweet plus to the deal.  </li>
            <li> It comes with everything you need and the capsules that are included are good for general use.</li>
            <li> works good if you are pilling up a fine powder you have to clean out occasionally</li>
            <li> For once, filling my capsules was actually fun and easy.  </li>
            <li> The process was fun and everything was easy to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> Capsules are good quality, I&#x27;ve been able to fit nearly a gram into one, impressive, though a tad difficult to swallow if your not a pill person.</li>
            <li> Most people won&#x27;t need to fill that many pills as frequently.</li>
            <li> Easier to grasp gel caps with clean</li>
            <li> nothing special just as they should be.</li>
            <li> Besides the price is really right!</li>
            <li> Buying it bundled with the empty capsules was a great bargain.</li>
            <li> A full 5.</li>
            <li> which was way cool.</li>
            <li> Material is inferior and thus does not stand up to many real world conditions.</li>
            <li> Whole sold 100 for 6 bucks, I got 1000 for 10 buck should I say more</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Each capsule should fill in full by now.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more caps real soon.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is so cool.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of product to fill because I was having such a good time doing it.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, and the accompanying instructions are very clear.  </li>
            <li> So far so good + super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge money saver for me as well, since the powdered herbs I use these for are much cheaper when bought in bulk, then processed into gelatin capsules for easy consumption.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how easily I was able to use this product.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, simple to use and effective to push out 24 capsuls at a time, once you get used to it you can pop them out very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Its pretty easy to use (it seems)</li>
            <li> Was pretty darn easy to use and came with plenty of capsules.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty easy once you get a hang of it.</li>
            <li> Given that the other \\&quot;machines\\&quot; in this price range require you to install the tops by hand, this is a great time-saving device.  </li>
            <li> it becomes stained quickly.</li>
            <li> Fills 24 caps quickly.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and with no damage.</li>
            <li> This item works well for the most part, but occasionally the capsules hang up in the top portion</li>
            <li> Every so often, a capsule won&#x27;t fill right or the end will squish, but for the most part it works well and the job is much easier to get done with the machine, rather than by hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> For instance I filled Quercetin first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li> I do not regret buying this at all and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make their own capsules.</li>
            <li> Well I found this product to be verry fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and really works to make the capsules.</li>
            <li> It is so easy and fast</li>
            <li> Capsule machine is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Filling capsules has become incredibly easy and fast.</li>
            <li> We needed this for a very fine powdery supplement that doesn&#x27;t mix well in liquid and is only available in bulk powder.</li>
            <li> That was when i noticed that the holes in the machine are not even consistent circles!</li>
            <li> Luckily I had a Tupperware container the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little device that will save you money AND allow you to know exactly what is in your supplements!</li>
            <li> The little machine serves a great purpose.</li>
            <li> Great little machine that works well.  </li>
            <li> Great little kit.  </li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use just make sure you always buy the right size capsules for the filler kit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a few months and it works great.</li>
            <li> Then repeat this whole process until you&#x27;ve filled 1000 capsules.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a desiccant to keep the gel caps fresh which is a necessity.</li>
            <li> I know that the product I am using is fresh and organic</li>
            <li> Once that was done the machine and caps worked great, and far faster than individual filling.</li>
            <li> Totally worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> this really is worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get started packing up your own supplements, look no further.  </li>
            <li> The box was labeled as a 00 sized machine; what was actually inside would fit 0 size capsules but had no chance of fitting the 00 capsules that came with it.</li>
            <li> This is DEFINITELY worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used it twice effectively, however I wasted 3 times as many gelcaps as I created.</li>
            <li> And with practice that rarely happens.</li>
            <li> Be sure to place the included desiccant packing with the capsules into an airtight container, otherwise the capsules will swell and will no longer fit properly into the filler.</li>
            <li> But it is still worth to get it.</li>
            <li> that makes more pills at one time, but the tops have to be individually placed on the filled bottoms one by one.  </li>
            <li> So I am pretty new to this whole filling your own capsules thing</li>
            <li> Excellent capsule filler at a very competitive price,  Works well, instructions are clear and the kit includes desiccant to prevent swelling of capsules due to humidity.  </li>
            <li> First off, this is a great little machine.</li>
            <li> Its sturdy plastic, takes some practice to get right but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (yes they were the right size i checked twice)</li>
            <li> Although I myself do not use the capsule filler, I bought it for my son to fill and make capsules for me since I have use of just my right hand.</li>
            <li> Yes, we bought the right size capsules,</li>
            <li> If you are making a lot, stop and clean a little bit before continuing, that will make sure you don&#x27;t get jam easily.</li>
            <li> the capsules are easy to fill (watch the video on the comments and you will see how easy) and they are easy to get the pills down my dog too!..</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I crush his 3 tablets into a fine powder with a pill crusher, then fill as many capsules as it takes to contain all the crushed med.</li>
            <li> Other than some of the capsules being very brittle, everything else was very satisfactory, the 24 cap filler kit is just right for the number of caps to make at a time and the ease of loading and closing the caps is just great.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow directions and easy to wipe down or clean when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought another in a different size because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> I made 72 capsules in about 20 minutes and now I can make them super fast...</li>
            <li> to use, easy to clean, a big money saver.</li>
            <li> works great and makes what would have been a tedious chore quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li> It also disassembles completely for easy cleaning when you are done.  </li>
            <li> I was missing my greens powder and figured the next best thing was to get it into capsules.</li>
            <li> The kit is easy to use and completely meets my requirements.  </li>
            <li> you very much in advance</li>
            <li> They went a bit more than half way in easily</li>
            <li> This is a very neat little machine and I could not be more pleased with its purchase.</li>
            <li> Took about 5 minutes for 24 capsules the first try.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love my machine and would recommend this size capsule machine to anyone for personal use.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I suspect however, that they most likely come from China.  </li>
            <li> I just finished filling my first batch of capsules</li>
            <li> Expect a bent capsule or two at first - but its the mistakes in loading you make that make you an expert in record time.</li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have just used this tonight for the first time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more gel caps when I run out.</li>
            <li> Product worked exactly how it was represented.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great set, worth the money and seems very well</li>
            <li> I made 96 caps of Piracetam within 10 minutes and this was my first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper than having the pharmacist do it!</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm the first time, it worked even better the second time,third time I was a champ.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase and Ill be using this capsule filler for years to come.</li>
            <li> This is the first capsule filling machine I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I wasnt sure if this thing was actually gonna work.</li>
            <li> Way too much work!</li>
            <li> exactly what advertised, etc.</li>
            <li> I used this capsule filler for my first time placenta encapsulation.</li>
            <li> however I need to purchase a big one for what I&#x27;m making, but this will do for now :)</li>
            <li> On my first trial it took me 11 minutes to do the load of 24 capsules.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever purchased a product like this.</li>
            <li> i plan on recommending this to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that is bigger and can do more capsules at a time than 24.</li>
            <li> Honestly there&#x27;s not much to say about this capsule filler.</li>
            <li> gelatin pills arent exactly candy flavored</li>
            <li> they should higher someone at the factory that can read and count.......</li>
            <li> Jamming is not a problem with it, because the system works differently, although a bit more manually, but that&#x27;s the price</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy the little capsule machine, it&#x27;s quick easy and convenient.  </li>
            <li> I mix my own supplements in order to make sure I am only getting what I need and to cut down on the cost.</li>
            <li> Many inexpensive empty gelatin capsules are manufactured with significant variations in size, plus all of them will swell in high humidity.  </li>
            <li> Know what you are really getting, deal with reputable companies that provide proper information or keep looking elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I leave the extra on the foil until i have a good amount then dump excess back</li>
            <li> This capsule machine should last forever, good quality and simple to use.</li>
            <li> This Capsule Filler Kit works pretty much as described, with 24 capsules taking about five minutes to fill.  </li>
            <li> Goes pretty fast once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> You get pretty fast at using this.</li>
            <li> Made my first few batches of herbal remedies and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> To clean just dry dust with a clean cloth or paper towel.</li>
            <li> the encapsulator worked flawlessly right out of the box, and I have used it many times by now with no problems to speak of (other than once, which was user error) ...</li>
            <li> very easy to use, and can save you quite a bit of money if you buy bulk herbs, or other supplements.</li>
            <li> This capsule filler is easy to use and seems like it is made to last.</li>
            <li> The capsules are easy to work with and, since it comes in a pkg of 1,000 my learning curve was no big loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, 10/10 for experience including easy ordering, delivery as promised, working device, working capsule.</li>
            <li> Very quick, not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> You just have to make certain you press about 3x and ALL capsules release</li>
            <li> The large capsules get stuck in the holes.</li>
            <li> #34;00&amp;#34;, however the &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; capsules are too large for the machine.</li>
            <li> These work just fine and the capsule machine makes it very simple to load the caps.</li>
            <li> I found that if I match the tops and bottoms of the capsules when inserting them, so the each top goes back on the same bottom it came from, I can pretty much get a 100% success rate.</li>
            <li> I also used it to make individual capsules and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> This little contraption and the capsules that come with it work amazingly well together.</li>
            <li> This little machine allowed me to purchase bulk herbs and create my own capsules.  </li>
            <li> Watch a YouTube video on this handy little device.  </li>
            <li> The result was success - the new 00 machine is the right size and fits the &#x27;old&#x27; 00</li>
            <li> I fixed the capsule but on closer inspection it was clear that there was no way it was going to fit into the machine.</li>
            <li> Anyway, she buys bulk items and had been trying to take them straight and on occasion filling capsules by hand.  </li>
            <li> This saves me so much time.</li>
            <li> Very grateful.</li>
            <li> I had been filling capsules by hand one by one on an as needed basis, this is much easier.</li>
            <li> I have filled several thousand capsules with this filler, and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> If you ever capsule powders by hand, this will make your life much easier.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was reasonable as well, get this is you need to get your supplements into a capsule.</li>
            <li> Now when I ordered one for my brother I told him what mistakes I made and he never did it and really loves his machine.</li>
            <li> I make up a whole lot of capsules at one time.</li>
            <li> We really like this combo.</li>
            <li> They include the desiccant bag to keep them from sticking together until ready to be used.  </li>
            <li> I was satisfied with both the pill machine and the empty capsules.  </li>
            <li> Watched a video on you tube on this very product.....  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure the dosages vary widely between caps.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially when I filled capsules with turmeric.  </li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So got it, and it was much easier to use then</li>
            <li> The capsule machine is nifty &amp; really speeds up the process.</li>
            <li> how much each one can hold.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> 4.2: If fully filled, give yourself a pat in the back and help others.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Whole wheat flour</li>
            <li> Whole grain breads&lt;br /&gt;VEGETABLES&lt;br</li>
            <li> I fill capsules with virgin coconut oil, and it is so much quicker to fill the capsules with this kit.</li>
            <li> It did the job very well</li>
            <li> There is a lot of manual work filling capsules with this type of machine, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this filler if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of ongoing capsules to fill.</li>
            <li> I find it much faster to fill each capsule by hand</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Then gently push them out onto another piece of aluminium foil or container to hold them.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Capsule Machine&amp;#34; makes it so much easier and faster</li>
            <li> Saves so much time.</li>
            <li> This capsule filling machine works very well for that.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This machine works really well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain about it for the price.</li>
            <li> In my case I had Pramiracetam, Centrophenoxine, and Vinpocetine all in one pill in reasonable doses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This capsule filler makes it so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> It makes filling the capsules so much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li> words coming out of him during the whole time we were doing this.</li>
            <li> I just set by the Tv in my off time and fill capsules as buying herbs are much cheaper this way.</li>
            <li> Figured cheaper making your own turmeric or green tea pills</li>
            <li> I had never filled my own caps before -</li>
            <li> You are near there my friend; ideally, we love to have all possible sizes</li>
            <li> 5: Keep total weigh of ADDED EXTRA powder, and you have your own formula for your batch of 24 capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It took me the first 100 grams to get my rhythm down :)</li>
            <li> I have used 500 of the caps thus far and have had maybe 5 that did not cap right.</li>
            <li> The kit is easy to use, just stick the large end of the capsule into the top and pull the smaller end out, though filling will take a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Works much better with new and/or dry caps.</li>
            <li> The capsule machine is super easy to use but bit messy</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described, comes with clear instructions and buying the capsules with it, just makes it all the easier!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, straightforward product that does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> If you try to partially fill capsules with this device, you will end up with some capsules that have significantly more powder than others - this is highly unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The process of making capsules is a bit messy, and hopefully as I become more adept there will be less of this granular powder all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use,  following the clear, simple instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I am now able to incorporate Turmeric into my daily routine and am reaping the health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> The machine makes capsule assembly MUCH more efficient than my previous method (assembly by hand).  </li>
            <li> Also the machine is dishwasher safe and doesnt stain like previous reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> but I think the reason you get less into the capsule in the end is because you can&#x27;t fill the top portion as well.  </li>
            <li> Must be messy and wasteful, not being able to get as much into the capsules as you can.</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job filling capsules.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to load and quick.</li>
            <li> capsule filler kit works very well, a bit messy as expected; I would have liked this same style kit but with the capacity to fill more than 24 capsules at a time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is only a suitable filler if you are going to be filling the larger part of each capsule *completely</li>
            <li> If still partial filled, shake out those existing powder, weigh 10 grams more (and write down#, add to existing powder andmix well, fill capsule again and look:</li>
            <li> did notice that the top does not always join the capsules tightly to the bottom</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone else</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> i dont know how this item was so highly rated.</li>
            <li> The machine itself works fine, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the capsules getting jammed.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing</li>
            <li> the capsules are easy to use and can use for other ingredients as well as Nopal Powder.</li>
            <li> I just spent about 2 hours making 300 filled capsules.</li>
            <li> The product is a great idea and if it wasnt flawed</li>
            <li> Do you see the capsule fully filled or partial fill?&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Do you see the capsule fully filled or partially filled?&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> But if you are making capsules that you will only be taking one or two pills a day, it is worth having.</li>
            <li> We thought we could save money putting pills together ourselves, but I&#x27;m finding that its worth paying extra to avoid the stress that comes along with using this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Good idea, poor execution.</li>
            <li> Use an large piece that goes over the edge so you can use it to funnel extra material back into original bag.</li>
            <li> They have to be tamped several times and therefore it&#x27;s a lot more work than if you had a dry</li>
            <li> Prepare to store the capsules in a cool DRY place.</li>
            <li> I managed to pack 2 large capsule halves together in the same hole, which threw the whole thing off.</li>
            <li> Then simply add your powder, spread it with the card, tamp it down, spread some more, then push down to cause the bottoms of the capsules to raise, put the top over the bottom to _automatically</li>
            <li> I have filled hundreds of gelcaps with cinnamon, caffeine and other powdered supplements and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> This little thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problem with humidity, and I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana</li>
            <li> but I could easily fill 24 capsules in less than three minutes.</li>
            <li> With the tamper I&#x27;m sure that all the caps are roughly the same dose.  </li>
            <li> Perfect caps, even with my thick and clumsy fingers.  </li>
            <li> Works well, the only thing I noticed is I thought the capsules were longer than others I had used (pills I bought already filled), but come to find out they just needed to be pushed together further.</li>
            <li> I filled several hundred capsules the same day I received product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and makes a nice tight capsule filled with all my crazy herbal concoctions.</li>
            <li> plastic kit is quite sturdy and well made, and the instructions were very clear.  </li>
            <li> Took a little time at first to figure it out, but after that, it was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> gripe is that my second batch always has a little supplement residue after I pressed the caps which doesn&#x27;t look as nice as a professional companies supplement.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t quite fill to capacity due to the top needing to close properly</li>
            <li> (so he doesn&#x27;t break open the nastiness inside the capsules ;)</li>
            <li> As I enjoy gourmet  foods I am sensitive to foreign tastes in my food and drink.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews said they received the wrong sized capsules, but mine were perfect.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and is pretty simple to use.</li>
            <li> Because of some of the other comments on Amazon I knew that it may be a tight fit, but these capsules were never going to fit into this</li>
            <li> I realize it is not meant for liquids, but as long as you take them right away, it works.  </li>
            <li> The capsules stay stuck in the holes once filled and half fall apart.</li>
            <li> Especially the healthy ones i cant choke down.</li>
            <li> The capsules seem perfectly fine (I prefer the animal gelatin as these have to the vegicaps), but I&#x27;m not really excited about paying another $15-20 for an additional capsule machine.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I can do all the above mentioned, fill the capsules, pack em&#x27;, add more filling, pack, etc in just over 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> No mess!  </li>
            <li> The kit comes with one large silica gel packet in a large zip-lock plastic back, for drying and shrinking an entire batch of capsules at at time.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it around in the capsule hole to clear it out.</li>
            <li> For simple humidity protection, I would much rather have tiny silica packets that I would store with each individual batch of filled packets, such as one would find in a store-purchased jar of vitamins.  </li>
            <li> Clearly there is variability with the manufacturing of this contraption. 00</li>
            <li> I was filling psyllium husk, but it did not fill the capsule completely.  </li>
            <li> I have used this machine to make 1000+ capsules so far.</li>
            <li> Without a funnel to directly place the material in the capsule, I was getting weights between 140mg and 240 mg.  </li>
            <li> This machine has completely demystified capsule-making.</li>
            <li> issues at all so far.  </li>
            <li> Work perfectly so far</li>
            <li> For design and ease of use, he gave this device a 9/10 quality compared to his professional tools.</li>
            <li> Sealing the capsules has worked perfectly so far.</li>
            <li> This is so much nicer than trying to do all of these individually.</li>
            <li> The packet tells not only how to keep this from happening, but also how to make the packet reusable by gently reheating it in the oven</li>
            <li> So now i have to return the whole thing to get my credit back</li>
            <li> Yes, I got fewer capsules, but at least I know they are safe for me to consume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to encapsulate herbs and spices to take as natural remedies.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter makes them in her spare time.  </li>
            <li> It is simple to use, of hardy construction that will last forever and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> Surely this is complicated, right?</li>
            <li> I make my capsules while watching tv , its easy repetitive work.</li>
            <li> The directions are easy and after the second try, they looked as professional as the ones I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> My first one was the single &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> I also make customized mixed tablets for my particular needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that big of a deal, they still work fine, your just swallowing a slightly (like maybe a millimeter) longer pill, or squeezing them together by hand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them getting stuck stuck, but just dry them out a little more in a container of sorts.</li>
            <li> recommend putting only a little bit of your powder or herbs on the top of the filler, so you don&#x27;t need to try and scrape up excess and put it back in the bag.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t tamper too much you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> My only observation/critique is that there isn&#x27;t really a method for getting exact dosages into the capsules unless you are just filling the bottom half of the capsule to capacity.  </li>
            <li> Abit on the messy side, but it gets the job done and fairly quick.</li>
            <li> However, a bit of a mess is created when using this (unless you&#x27;re very careful), so make sure to use it in a bowl or pan.</li>
            <li> * Broad beans&lt;</li>
            <li> i bought this machine to fill my own herbal supplements and was extremely disappointed by how much work it really was.</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to tamp down very fine powders like activated charcoal, as it could get messy.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to use for small quantities.</li>
            <li> The only way I see in which jamming can be prevented is if the plastic parts which rub against the capsule are washed cleanly with water and dried - before each time they&#x27;re used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another solution is to compute and use a large amount of filler powder such as microcrystalline cellulose in order to standardize the dose volume to the capsule size - this is mathematically involved and potentially error-prone.</li>
            <li> With reasonable care it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like using it on the Epsom Salts because the taste is so bitter without the capsule.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s it apparently.</li>
            <li> so we do not partial fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the actual filling of the capsules</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t do the drinks very well, so the capsules are a great way to get these things down without having to suffer unpleasant taste.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to fill all 1000 capsules in a little less than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> i messed up the first time by not shoving the pills all away down</li>
            <li> Lay a towel down first.</li>
            <li> Any apprehension that I had from negative reviews that I had read was immediately washed away when the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li> this little gadget is super easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had a broken cap yet.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, and once you do you can be making capsules quickly.</li>
            <li> they did not fit into the machine right.</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep your empty capsules in an airtight container because the moisture in the air can affect the capsules making the device a little more difficult to use.</li>
            <li> A few just do not want to fit into the holes, while others will be loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard plastic that is sure to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> You will also need a large glass container to store the empty capsules in for future use.  </li>
            <li> if you have something like tea to take from a Chinese Medical Doctor that is too bitter (check with Doctor first).  </li>
            <li> It is fun filling capsules, takes little time, and can be done while watching TV!</li>
            <li> It gets old separating the capsules, place one half in the bottom of the machine, place the other half in the top of the machine, repeat 24 times...  </li>
            <li> Still, you have to be a little bit nimble to pull the empty capsules apart and fit them in their respective slots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to keep all the pills the same quantity of stuff, and with the powder smasher you can pack it down and then put smaller doses of other substances in the same pill.  </li>
            <li> Seems solidly built and should last a long time with normal use.</li>
            <li> - A COPY OF CAPSULE FILLER FOR DUMMIES COULD BE HELPFUL AND THE PROCESS IS PRETTY MESSY.</li>
            <li> Its worth it if you are going to make small batches.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product based on my initial reaction and as there are really no parts to break off</li>
            <li> By my 3rd round of pills, all but 1 came out and the tops of the pills were securely on (one end locks into the other).</li>
            <li> this is only for a small number tho, overall, this item is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The casings were the right moisture, not to big or small for the machine.</li>
            <li> , if you are worried about waste, make sure to put the platform on a paper plate and, if you are very worried about waste, you can shake the capsules in a bag with a small hole in the bottom to get the excess powder off of them.</li>
            <li> A little messy and cumbersome , but works fine.</li>
            <li> I re-read the instructions and realized that I was supposed to use the moisture absorbing packet to shrink the little buggers.</li>
            <li> This little capsule machine makes filling capsules MUCH easier and quicker.  </li>
            <li> I use it for a particular herb that is like saw dust going down.</li>
            <li> Capsule filler works better than I expected, with less mess!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d rather have to take one additional capsule in order to get the full amount than do it by hand with the mess and fuss and take one less.  </li>
            <li> Capsule/pill injectors are sold under pet supplies, normally used to push medication down a dog&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> I took apart the first capsule but after attempting to insert the smaller half into the machine, the capsule got slighly crushed.</li>
            <li> The construction of the machine appears to be fairly solid and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is not too large nor costly for the relatively small amounts I make from time to time.</li>
            <li> trick him into getting his very important meds down each morning, so he can get on the mend from his very serious and stubborn infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to give my dog a yucky antibiotic powder, and although she took it readily wrapped in a piece of turkey, it was messy and giving it twice a day used up a lot of turkey!  </li>
            <li> Put a piece of aluminium foil over a plate, but don&#x27;t fold over, leave it flat.</li>
            <li> I think it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and in less than an hour you can make hundreds of capsules.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to give the capsules extra time to dry since it is so humid here</li>
            <li> They can be affected enough by humid or dry conditions to warp.</li>
            <li> She actually gave me the link to buy it from another site, but I found this one for far less money--yay!  </li>
            <li> It takes only a few minutes to place the capsules in the machine and then depending on how fluffy and in need of compacting the supplement you are using is, it can take take only a few seconds or a few more minutes to fill the capsules and only seconds to seal them using the machine.</li>
            <li> I will likely be buying ones for other sizes of capsules in the future.</li>
            <li> It increased how much I could get in the capsules by at least 80%.</li>
            <li> For almost all applications, only partial filling by weight is desirable, irrespective of the capsule size.</li>
            <li> Out of a batch, we got 3 to stay together the first time, 7 to stay together the second time, and it was just frustrating.</li>
            <li> When I got this product the bottom half of the capsule machine had bits of plastic left over from manufacturing in several of the holes.</li>
            <li> your powder to not fill evenly in all capsule because total volume of powder is less then total volume of 24 capsules, read below:&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I wanted bigger capsules I did not even look at other brands.</li>
            <li> Other times I feel like a scientist, back in science lab or compounding pharmacist, but every way, every day....</li>
            <li> She is always having to try something new in the fight since it is so difficult to get help properly curing it in it&#x27;s early stages.  </li>
            <li> Although it is not of much concern to me, I seriously doubt that the caps are either Halal or Kosher.</li>
            <li> I have to dry my hands off on towel after each batch.</li>
            <li> Just rinse it off with water and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I started out having trouble getting my pills to come out of the machine, but I had read another reviewer day that they had to scrape some of the extra plastic left over from manufacturing out of the holes.</li>
            <li> Both the upper and/or the lower half of the capsule can independently get jammed.</li>
            <li> AND THEY WON&#x27;T COME LOOSE</li>
            <li> thing that caused a little grief but super easy fix was some of the holes had a tiny bit of plastic still around the inside rings causing it to be hard to press in the capsules.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a very clever device, but my copy was poorly executed.</li>
            <li> I would like a little larger unit but believe it would be messier</li>
            <li> Why oh why didn&#x27;t I think to look on Amazon sooner for this simple little device.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is difficult is to determine how much product goes in each pill.</li>
            <li> the tops are harder to place.</li>
            <li> No real use for it yet</li>
            <li> This is not really the fault of the machine</li>
            <li> I wish I would have saved an empty vitamin bottle to put the capsules in for storage.  </li>
            <li> Amazon will be picking up the item in the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easier than expected.  </li>
            <li> Nor will he be fooled by slipping pill portions into a hotdog (&amp;#34;yuck, these hotdogs have pits inside!&amp;#34; He says)</li>
            <li> gave away the empty capsules that came with the tool because they are made with beef gelatin.  </li>
            <li> it just crushed them.</li>
            <li> works as expected.</li>
            <li> The only time I had any trouble with it was a user error.</li>
            <li> IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES TO MAKE&lt;br /&gt;24 CAPSULES.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple tries to get the hang of it, but works well.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is that capsules get jammed a lot.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a piece that would keep it closed while you are filling the capsules.</li>
            <li> It takes time to separate the capsules and put the long half in one side and the short half in the other side.</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because when fully loaded it usually wont press all the capsules.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine filling capsules any other way.</li>
            <li> Works well with kratom and other herbs.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to get you going, other then the supplement of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other capsule filling trays, but this one is an engineering masterpiece.  </li>
            <li> I tried putting the MSM crystals in orange and other fruit juices</li>
            <li> AGAIN (see some of my other reviews)...</li>
            <li> Mix that creatine with other vitamines and minerals into the capsules.  </li>
            <li> Before I got it I took the time to look at a couple of videos on YouTube to watch other people use it.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!  </li>
            <li> AND SOMETIMES THEY GET RUINED, OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> I buy alot of items based on the quantity and quality of rating by other customers.</li>
            <li> A little messy, but starting to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have a Corgi that takes a powdered medication that is very bitter.</li>
            <li> used to taste bad, now easy.</li>
            <li> One approximate solution is to use different size capsules and Filler-Kits for different products.</li>
            <li> Because we will need to shake out the powder in a few minutes, fill loosely your capsule WITHOUT PUSHING POWDER DOWN.</li>
            <li> The downside that I think some other reviews have mentioned is that you get less into each capsule.  </li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the gelatin capsules but 1000 of them is hard to beat for the deal I got.  </li>
            <li> , this should last me for at least a year or two because you get a lot</li>
            <li> Takes a few tries to get used to</li>
            <li> By the 4th try, had it down to about 2 minutes for 24 capsules.</li>
            <li> He can, however, let these capsules slide down the gullet with some tasty goo (ham salad, egg salad, ground beef &amp; cheese... that he doesn&#x27;t need to chew</li>
            <li> Use the reaming tool, if desired, to pack down all 24 capsules at once, in order to make room for additional herbs or nutrients.  </li>
            <li> Weigh and write down 10 grams of powder you like, add to the existing powder, mix well.</li>
            <li> .it also seems like the majority of complaints about this product come down to lack of quality control from the factory.</li>
            <li> Once I got my rhythm down I could do 100 grams in around 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> So that slows things down some.</li>
            <li> Plus, the waste and mess is minimal.  </li>
            <li> Folks using a personal machine need one that is small enough to keep filling because when you first start filling capsules you can make stupid mistakes.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I do not think that the capsules need to be dried and sealed.  </li>
            <li> After you press down on the unit wiggle a little, then you will have to push slightly down on the caps to fully seal them together.</li>
            <li> I fill my capsules with turmeric, cinnamon, and black pepper, for joint inflammation in my hands.</li>
            <li> I was shooting for a 200 milligram dosage on a supplement, which was about half of the 00 capacity (it varies from ingredient to ingredient).  </li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive, as some of the reviews were slightly unfavorable.</li>
            <li> B0070FKL3Y 100 1/2 (Half)</li>
            <li> That means you now have half of volume of capsule.</li>
            <li> If not, use less capsules, maybe use 8 capsules?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went to PCC and bought 200 vegetarian capsules and a capsule loader for less than this set.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so tedious to actually put 24 capsules in the machine (not the machines fault).  </li>
            <li> The holes in the machine are not cut right and the capsules jammed so bad</li>
            <li> This was pretty disappointing since that&#x27;s part of the reason I chose this package deal.</li>
            <li> By tapping the side of bottom half I got a little settling of about 5%.</li>
            <li> It does however take a few trials to get the process down pat.  </li>
            <li> This cuts down on cleaning and waste.</li>
            <li> The powder substance I was using caused my fingertips to get dry and slippery which made it hard not to drop the capsules, and not wanting to moisten my fingertips, I had some fumbling issues but that was all.</li>
            <li> I thought I can save little bit of money by filling pyllium husk myself.  </li>
            <li> Works just as described, might take a little longer to use than they advertise but saves a lot of time regardless.</li>
            <li> A little bit of a learning curve</li>
            <li> WE FIND THIS LITTLE CAPSULE MAKER TO BE FASTER THAN MAKING THEM BY HAND.</li>
            <li> It got a little messy</li>
            <li> A bit messy</li>
            <li> green label instructions that come with the dessicant packet state you need to store the capsules with the dessicant in an air-tight container.  </li>
            <li> The capsules do not fit in the machine.</li>
            <li> Both are labeled 00, but they clearly do not fit.  </li>
            <li> If you need to take some powdered herbs for even a few weeks, you&#x27;ll appreciate the convenience of capsules over measuring out 1/2 teaspoons for each dose.</li>
            <li> Use the green card to spread the herbs or nutrients into the lower parts of the capsules.</li>
            <li> They are firmly pressed together by the tool.  </li>
            <li> It is cumbersome, time consuming, seems to waste product.  </li>
            <li> Makes quite a few capsules in no time at all</li>
            <li> capsules do not fit.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like making smoothies everyday to hide the taste.</li>
            <li> AND AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF USE IT HAS</li>
            <li> I used this to fill over 500 capsules in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> it took me a half hour to do about 15!  </li>
            <li> I got this because I have a greens powder that I cannot drink in plain water</li>
            <li> know of no good solution to the partial filling problem.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is still a tedious process, but a process where you do not loose any of your product.</li>
            <li> This little unit is a breeze to use!</li>
            <li> This little &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; contraption makes filling the capsules a breeze!  </li>
            <li> two of the holes are tight and the capsules are hard to load, but that doesnt stop the machine from functioning correctly.</li>
            <li> The capsules go in flush with the holder, which I can see the benefit when filling them with powder so you can scrape the extra into the capsule, however this makes it difficult to fill capsules with oils</li>
            <li> unfortunate part is that the seller provided the larger sized capsule machine (&#x27;00&#x27;)</li>
            <li> However, I was sent 0 sized capsules which doesn&#x27;t work since they are too small.</li>
            <li> When you buy it they warn you of gelcap expansion, however fail to realize that it is actually the device which expands.</li>
            <li> Some of my supplements require small doses.</li>
            <li> I say Almost because occasionally a poorly inserted capsule will get crushed.</li>
            <li> We chose this product because our dog is ill and one of his meds only comes in a power, to be sprinkled on his food; once we do that, he won&#x27;t eat his food.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve made a few hundred capsules already!</li>
            <li> Not sure what everyone is talking about in some of these reviews.  </li>
            <li> Buy a small kitchen weighing scale on Amazon for 10 dollars or at Target or Walmart....</li>
            <li> DO NOT PUT THE SMALL CAP ON YET.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I think with a bit of practice and improvement of technique I could probably do a load in 8 to 9 minutes if not better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for the past four months</li>
            <li> I buy bulk powders on Amazon and usually try to just scoop the powder into a drink.</li>
            <li> I was very eager to capsulize some ill tasting herbal mixtures I blended up and have been unable to get the capsules into the &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I use the tamper provided, I tamp twice, if you tamp too hard</li>
            <li> In order to avoid getting another wrong sized machine possibly from a bad lot number, I reordered a 00 machine alone (without the capsules, in hopes of assuring I would get a completely different lot#).</li>
            <li> dog has to take 7 huge nasty tasting horse pills every morning.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that were negative.</li>
            <li> Remove the base and press in the clips on the bottom, and, voila!, all 24 filled capsules</li>
            <li> Read other reviews about how this was complicated, and that the pill maker didn&#x27;t do all the pills.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit and capsules only to receive the wrong size capsule kit!  </li>
            <li> After getting sick and tired of always waiting for a GNC sale (you know, where they reduce their prices to a normal level and portray is as a mind blowing deal)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find a single capsule that was broken or the wrong size.</li>
            <li> but this is a bit ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I had purchased tumeric and decided it would be less expensive to make these capsules rather than buying them.</li>
            <li> It is also less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate filling these for my herbal supplements, and this filler kit makes it far less annoying, with much less mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy and very tedious, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you need to make a lot of capsules.  </li>
            <li> I was filling capsules by hand &amp; it was tedious &amp; messy.  </li>
            <li> Some days I feel weird cuz the items look kinda shady sitting around the kitchen.</li>
            <li> (Again I was post partum and very slow.)</li>
            <li> Makes those horrible tasting powders MUCH easier to handle.  </li>
            <li> Thought it would be annoying but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> This plastic contraption is hard to use and very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it by hand, but it&#x27;s impossible to tamp them down</li>
            <li> I bought it to get down some bad tasting supplements.</li>
            <li> I snapped out the plastic pusher from the bottom of the base and using the tip of a sharp knife</li>
            <li> tho bottom of the capsules does not go into the base at all, not even slightly, after being in a mason jar with the desiccant for over a week.  </li>
            <li> because they gave me the wrong size capsules &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Tedious job but wirth it .use</li>
            <li> machine had some random dust/fiber/hair and needed to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> Whoever put the machine into the box must have grabbed the wrong machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to get into a meditative space though as it can be tedious.</li>
            <li> Also wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive.</li>
            <li> The capsules would not fit into the holes in the base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no capsules fail to fill</li>
            <li> I use a lot of herbs and some are just too expensive to buy in 30 to 60 capsule bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really tedious.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t be fooled by the nasty pills being crushed in anything yummy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any need to wash with water unless it gets very dusty, dirty or sticky.</li>
            <li> The nasty tasting powders, on the other hand, I -cannot- stomach.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t all that inconvenient to make 400 capsules once you get a rhythm going.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem once where my capsules were stored in a spot in my home that was cold</li>
            <li> /&gt;You place the device in the base (the larger part of the base with the flange upward), and fill the base with the longer part of 24 capsules.  </li>
            <li> No more nasty fiber taste.</li>
            <li> The taste of MSM is unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> The problem I had was that at the bottom of 75% of the holes there was flash (excess plastic) which made it impossible to get the capsules all the way in, making it impossible to fill them the way it is suppose to be.</li>
            <li> It can be impossible to seal and remove the capsule then.</li>
            <li> gulp a lot of powder and tastes really bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This review is sent through my mom.  I made the purchase for her but she loves the filler.  My mom has lyme disease and has had it for 20 years now.  She is always having to try something new in the fight since it is so difficult to get help properly curing it in it&#x27;s early stages.  Anyway, she buys bulk items and had been trying to take them straight and on occasion filling capsules by hand.  For the amount of products that she uses, this has been a blessing!  She says it is very easy to use.  She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to save money on supplements. Works much better with new and/or dry caps. It comes with a desiccant to keep the gel caps fresh which is a necessity. Much higher quality than expected for the price. A full 5.</li>
            <li> Ok so these work great.  I love the ease of the capsule machine!  It is so easy to use.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the capsule are gelatin but I guess that&#x27;s what makes the kit so cheap :)</li>
            <li> I found this capsule machine easy to set up and use. I have made over 500 now and have not had one capsule jam or burst. two of the holes are tight and the capsules are hard to load, but that doesnt stop the machine from functioning correctly. I use the tamper provided, I tamp twice, if you tamp too hard the tops are harder to place. I make my capsules while watching tv , its easy repetitive work. I didnt give it a 5 star because I found the machine tends to stick about 100 capsules in and it becomes stained quickly. so good quality and great value$.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift.  Arrived timely.  This is the same lot I&#x27;ve used for a number of years.  Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I am considering to return this product.  I was filling psyllium husk, but it did not fill the capsule completely.  I thought I can save little bit of money by filling pyllium husk myself.  But, since I cannnot fill the capsules fully, I am taking more capsules.  So, I think I will just return this product...  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these for turmeric, red pepper and rosemary capsules and the kit works great!</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised. Came with the correct size capsules. Easy to use. Took about 5 minutes for 24 capsules the first try. By the 4th try, had it down to about 2 minutes for 24 capsules. Seems solidly built and should last a long time with normal use.</li>
            <li> Capsule filler works better than I expected, with less mess! This saves me so much time. I used to hate filling these for my herbal supplements, and this filler kit makes it far less annoying, with much less mess.</li>
            <li> The machine takes getting used to. I like it just fine now. Prepare to store the capsules in a cool DRY place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for one day and made about 200 capsules filled with Turmeric, Cayenne and Cinnamon. So far so good + super fast delivery! Thank you.</li>
            <li> With patients and if you follow the directions for the gell caps (e.g. Storing them with the drying pouch they came with) I did much better than I thought I would. Very impressive!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I only give it 4 stars because when fully loaded it usually wont press all the capsules.  For the money I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Love this machine works great. As long as you don&#x27;t tamper too much you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> works fine,  will recomend</li>
            <li> Easy to use, already used up all capsules and buying more to use with this filler.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problem with humidity, and I live in Florida.  I kept the dehumidifier packet, and put it in a Plastic bag, partially open, and keep the pills in a gallon-sized ziplock.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great, I am saving lots by filling my own capsule, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about fillers. I know that the product I am using is fresh and organic</li>
            <li> Great device and capsules. I can now save huge amounts of money by buying the powders in bulk and making my own tablets. I also make customized mixed tablets for my particular needs.</li>
            <li> seller shipped very timely capsule filler works great</li>
            <li> Great product! Super easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> Love these thank You. Very grateful. LouAnn Singer&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> No real use for it yet</li>
            <li> I had no problem with it at all. I had been filling capsules by hand one by one on an as needed basis, this is much easier.</li>
            <li> So I am pretty new to this whole filling your own capsules thing and i stumbled upon this kit and went for it. This is really a great item in my opinion. I couldn&#x27;t imagine filling capsules any other way. Must be messy and wasteful, not being able to get as much into the capsules as you can. Well I found this product to be verry fast and easy to use. Almost no mess/waste. I love it.</li>
            <li> No problems with this device, it does the job. A bit messy but that&#x27;s part of it when you fill your own capsules! Saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Great product to beat the Sticker Shock of herbal supplements. Just purchase in bulk powders and make your own. Works well for many applications.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. The casings were the right moisture, not to big or small for the machine.</li>
            <li> When I got this product the bottom half of the capsule machine had bits of plastic left over from manufacturing in several of the holes. I had to trim out the holes with a pocket knife so the capsule halves would slide in all the way flush. Once that was done the machine and caps worked great, and far faster than individual filling.</li>
            <li> I mix my own supplements in order to make sure I am only getting what I need and to cut down on the cost. The most time consuming part has always been filling the capsules. This machine is a life saver. It works beautifully and will save me tons of time! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the capsule machine worked great. I didn&#x27;t use the desiccant in the kit and the capsules fit perfectly. I have two complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)the machine only allows filling one end of the capsule. Because of this limitation, I could only load 800 milligrams in the 1000mg (00) capsule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This is not really the fault of the machine but, if your filler is moist it&#x27;s a lot more difficult to load the capsules. They have to be tamped several times and therefore it&#x27;s a lot more work than if you had a dry powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe there is a better way but for now, THIS WORKS OK</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and really works to make the capsules.I have filled several thousand capsules with this filler, and have no complaints.Great item!</li>
            <li> Use it quite often and really happy with it....sure makes life easier if you have to full your own ......I would recommend it for people who fill their own capsules......</li>
            <li> If you ever capsule powders by hand, this will make your life much easier.  My kids like to use it too.</li>
            <li> Great!  If you are interested in making your own vitamins or supplements, this practically pays for itself.  I should have ordered the vegetarian caps.  Not a fan of how the non-vegetarian ones taste, but that was my fault.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quick service.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, I filled about 200 caps with cayenne pepper last night while I watched a movie, easy to use and clean up. Shipping was reasonable as well, get this is you need to get your supplements into a capsule.</li>
            <li> I have used this machine to make 1000+ capsules so far. I have gotten a year&#x27;s supply of vitamin C and magnesium citrate out of these caps (plus the cost of the powder). The machine takes some time to use but it is very easy and the capsules stay together. I consider myself a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Folks using a personal machine need one that is small enough to keep filling because when you first start filling capsules you can make stupid mistakes. (I DID!!!) Now when I ordered one for my brother I told him what mistakes I made and he never did it and really loves his machine. I make up a whole lot of capsules at one time. I love my machine and would recommend this size capsule machine to anyone for personal use. Besides the price is really right! Since I have had my machine I have filled over 8,000 capsules with herbs that I take 2 times a day. I really like using it on the Epsom Salts because the taste is so bitter without the capsule. I use the size OO as it amounts to a 1/4 teaspoon of herbs.</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job filling capsules. It&#x27;s a little messy and very tedious, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you need to make a lot of capsules.  But if you are making capsules that you will only be taking one or two pills a day, it is worth having.</li>
            <li> Its pretty easy to use (it seems) but I havent been able to use it because i had to order in 1000 capsules of &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; sized capsules because they gave me the wrong size capsules &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> THE DEVICE IS FINE IN THAT IT DOES THE JOB, BUT FOR SOMEONE WHO&#x27;S NEVER USED A SIMILAR GADGET - A COPY OF CAPSULE FILLER FOR DUMMIES COULD BE HELPFUL AND THE PROCESS IS PRETTY MESSY.</li>
            <li> The capsule machine worked great! It came in a timely manner also.  I was worried about the capsules getting affected from the trip here but they were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It is fun filling capsules, takes little time, and can be done while watching TV! I fill my capsules with turmeric, cinnamon, and black pepper, for joint inflammation in my hands. (you could add ginger, too) The inflammation is gone! I gave one set to my sister who makes capsules for 5 family members.</li>
            <li> The machine works as advertised. It&#x27;s simple to load and quick. Also, the package was delived on time. I recommend this for anyone wanting to encapsulate stuff.</li>
            <li> I have to give my dog a yucky antibiotic powder, and although she took it readily wrapped in a piece of turkey, it was messy and giving it twice a day used up a lot of turkey!  These caps are made of gelatin, an animal product, so I was reassured my dog would be able to digest it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic kit is quite sturdy and well made, and the instructions were very clear.  The process of making capsules is a bit messy, and hopefully as I become more adept there will be less of this granular powder all over the place.  Use the flat-bottomed dish or bowl as recommended because there was quite a bit more powder residue on this surface than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green label instructions that come with the dessicant packet state you need to store the capsules with the dessicant in an air-tight container.  Luckily I had a Tupperware container the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The capsule filler kit works very well, a bit messy as expected; I would have liked this same style kit but with the capacity to fill more than 24 capsules at a time.  I found that two 00 capsules was equivalent to almost 1/2 tsp of granular powder.</li>
            <li> The capsules go in flush with the holder, which I can see the benefit when filling them with powder so you can scrape the extra into the capsule, however this makes it difficult to fill capsules with oils (I specifically bought for using essential oils).</li>
            <li> I was very impressed at the lack of wasted powder when filling the capsules. The little machine serves a great purpose. I strongly advise getting and using the tamper tool. It increased how much I could get in the capsules by at least 80%.</li>
            <li> This is the machine sold everywhere.  Its sturdy plastic, takes some practice to get right but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unfortunate part is that the seller provided the larger sized capsule machine (&#x27;00&#x27;) but the smaller capsules (&#x27;0&#x27;).  They are not interchangeable.  The smaller capsules simply slide out and wont work in this machine.  The capsules seem perfectly fine (I prefer the animal gelatin as these have to the vegicaps), but I&#x27;m not really excited about paying another $15-20 for an additional capsule machine.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that were negative. When I read and followed the directions I had no problem with jamming or anything. The capsules are susceptible to humidity and can cause jamming, but the kit comes with a dessicant packet to alleviate that problem. I filled 120 capsules and it worked perfectly. The powder substance I was using caused my fingertips to get dry and slippery which made it hard not to drop the capsules, and not wanting to moisten my fingertips, I had some fumbling issues but that was all.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as described. It&#x27;s super easy to use and works really well. It&#x27;s a great value for all you get.</li>
            <li> Awesome Bundle!!! Totally worth purchasing. The capsule machine made it SOOO easy to encapsulate.</li>
            <li> This makes it super easy to make capsules.  I love this!  Cheap product that works well.  I bought another in a different size because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> I was sent the correct machine, for 00 capsules. However, I was sent 0 sized capsules which doesn&#x27;t work since they are too small. This was pretty disappointing since that&#x27;s part of the reason I chose this package deal. I saw this happened to another commenter. Where&#x27;s the customer service?</li>
            <li> Used for herbal powders, this handy dandy filler and the capsules make dosing our herbs quick and easy.  We really like this combo.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into filling your own gel caps than this contraption is for you. It needs some getting used to but it&#x27;s really easy and within a couple of batches you earn your PhD in it. Buy it!</li>
            <li> For once, filling my capsules was actually fun and easy.  I filled them with my fiber powder to make it easier to take.  It worked.  No more nasty fiber taste.</li>
            <li> This Capsule Filler Kit works pretty much as described, with 24 capsules taking about five minutes to fill.  My only observation/critique is that there isn&#x27;t really a method for getting exact dosages into the capsules unless you are just filling the bottom half of the capsule to capacity.  I was shooting for a 200 milligram dosage on a supplement, which was about half of the 00 capacity (it varies from ingredient to ingredient).  Without a funnel to directly place the material in the capsule, I was getting weights between 140mg and 240 mg.  The instructions call for just placing a spoonful of your supplement in the capsule holder, spreading it over all the capsule holes and dumping the excess.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with size on mine and it works perfectly makes capping a lot faster and I am pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> Tedious job but wirth it .use it for tumiric&lt;br /&gt;able to custom mix.big money saver.&lt;br /&gt;Good design I like it.</li>
            <li> The capsules I&#x27;ve received we&#x27;re great, the filler kit made it a walk in the park to fill. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent capsule filler at a very competitive price,  Works well, instructions are clear and the kit includes desiccant to prevent swelling of capsules due to humidity.  They lose points as the picture shows that the caps are USA sourced, but the ones I received say Made in India.  I suspect however, that they most likely come from China.  Although it is not of much concern to me, I seriously doubt that the caps are either Halal or Kosher.</li>
            <li> I just finished filling my first batch of capsules and I love it!  The process went very smoothly and the capsules came out perfect.  I wish I would have saved an empty vitamin bottle to put the capsules in for storage.  You will also need a large glass container to store the empty capsules in for future use.  They include the desiccant bag to keep them from sticking together until ready to be used.  Really fun and money saving device!</li>
            <li> this really is worth the money. you can easily fill 100 capsules in under 10 minutes. very easy to use, and can save you quite a bit of money if you buy bulk herbs, or other supplements. please click yes if this review helped</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get started packing up your own supplements, look no further.  This kit has just about everything you need to get started.  I was satisfied with both the pill machine and the empty capsules.  After getting sick and tired of always waiting for a GNC sale (you know, where they reduce their prices to a normal level and portray is as a mind blowing deal) I&#x27;ve found packaging up most if not all of my supplements this way would be a great way to reduce my costs.</li>
            <li> The capsules do not fit in the machine. Both are labeled 00, but they clearly do not fit.  I suspect the machine is incorrect as the capsules are about the height of a quarter which after research is the correct height.  I noticed that others have experienced this as well.  This is going back...</li>
            <li> I was very eager to capsulize some ill tasting herbal mixtures I blended up and have been unable to get the capsules into the &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34;.  I have tried using the provided desiccant bag for over a week without improved fit.  It almost appears as if I received a size 0 machine in a 00 box.  tho bottom of the capsules does not go into the base at all, not even slightly, after being in a mason jar with the desiccant for over a week.  I live in Louisiana so I wanted to give the capsules extra time to dry since it is so humid here but this is a bit ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 00 size machine combo that came with 00 sized capsules. The box was labeled as a 00 sized machine; what was actually inside would fit 0 size capsules but had no chance of fitting the 00 capsules that came with it. So, it was obviously mis-boxed. In order to avoid getting another wrong sized machine possibly from a bad lot number, I reordered a 00 machine alone (without the capsules, in hopes of assuring I would get a completely different lot#). The result was success - the new 00 machine is the right size and fits the &#x27;old&#x27; 00 capsules.&lt;br /&gt;Using the machine is okay, once you catch on to how to do it. Expect a bent capsule or two at first - but its the mistakes in loading you make that make you an expert in record time. Its worth it if you are going to make small batches.</li>
            <li> Love the product... very easy to use, now I am my own health food store!! Will purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is my second one. My first one was the single &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; size. When I wanted bigger capsules I did not even look at other brands.That being said, it is still a tedious process, but a process where you do not loose any of your product. When using this I simply do all the filling in a baking pan so it catches all the overflow. No mess.</li>
            <li> I have just used this tonight for the first time. I just spent about 2 hours making 300 filled capsules. Very very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Works well as advertised. Good price. Works well with kratom and other herbs. Would not advise for extacy or powders.</li>
            <li> Works great for my herbal supplements!  Makes those horrible tasting powders MUCH easier to handle.  Quality seems fine and no problems with the plastic.</li>
            <li> This works great!  I was very pleased.  Watched a video on you tube on this very product.....  I could not be happier!  and it got delieverd way faster than it said....  which was way cool.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy the little capsule machine, it&#x27;s quick easy and convenient.  I am not a big fan of the gelatin capsules but 1000 of them is hard to beat for the deal I got.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it to make capsules for a dietary supplement from some tree she is growing. She filled a 6 month supply in about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I save a lot of money by using the filler kit and gelatin capsules, instead of buying pre-filled capsules from the pharmacy.  The capsule machine is super easy to use but bit messy so I put baking pan on the table, then parchment to collect excess that falls off for easy clean up afterwards.  One thing I have noticed that capsule does not get fully filled, maybe 85-90% so I deducted one star for that.  I will definitely be buying more gel caps when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great little device that will save you money AND allow you to know exactly what is in your supplements! I do my own non-GMO Vitamin C, Matcha, fiber, and am searching for other great bulk supplement powders that DON&#x27;T COME FROM CHINA! Know what you are really getting, deal with reputable companies that provide proper information or keep looking elsewhere! Have no fear, it is simple to use and basically indestructible!</li>
            <li> Product worked exactly how it was represented.  I have no complaints. We now have homemade Turmeric capsules at a fraction of the retail price.</li>
            <li> Abit on the messy side, but it gets the job done and fairly quick. A good machine and a good value.</li>
            <li> Oh this makes filling capsules EXTREMELY easy!!  I&#x27;ve done it by hand, but it&#x27;s impossible to tamp them down so I&#x27;m sure the dosages vary widely between caps.  With the tamper I&#x27;m sure that all the caps are roughly the same dose.  Doing this by hand it took me a half hour to do about 15!  With this I can literally do 72 caps in 10 minutes - what a difference.  This is DEFINITELY worth the money.</li>
            <li> I may be using the Capsule machine wrong, but I have never been able to get the device to work as it appears in the instructions. I often have to cap the pills individually then remove them with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews about how this was complicated, and that the pill maker didn&#x27;t do all the pills. I had no problems at all with it. It worked great. It was easy to understand. Took a little time at first to figure it out, but after that, it was pretty fast. The only thing that is difficult is to determine how much product goes in each pill.</li>
            <li> This has been a blessing as my daughter who just had surgery for brain abscess/edema wanted to take turmeric and I purchased the organic non-capsule type.  I would like a little larger unit but believe it would be messier (I&#x27;m loading for 2 families as hubby and I take also)...after I got the hang of filling the capsules, it works great, just my learning curve.  You just have to make certain you press about 3x and ALL capsules release very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, received product timely! Well pleased.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,  following the clear, simple instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I am now able to incorporate Turmeric into my daily routine and am reaping the health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;How come I didn&#x27;t think of this sooner??</li>
            <li> I use this to make pills filled with turmeric, cinnamon, mustard seeds, etc... Basically any spice that provides fantastic health benefits but don&#x27;t like the spicy tastes. I fill the lid also but it doesn&#x27;t quite fill to capacity due to the top needing to close properly but it&#x27;s a great product and I really like it! I&#x27;ve used it many times!</li>
            <li> Good idea, poor execution. Material is inferior and thus does not stand up to many real world conditions. I used it twice effectively, however I wasted 3 times as many gelcaps as I created. When you buy it they warn you of gelcap expansion, however fail to realize that it is actually the device which expands. There is a very simple solution to this, but I&#x27;m not doing anyone any favors when I lose money. That being said, if they reworked the design I would try it again, but only if incentives were offered, otherwise that would be like collecting taxes for R&amp;D from customers.  If the price point is too high for a better quality machine they can offer one with the better materials as an &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; for people like myself who would shell out the money if it was more well made.</li>
            <li> Does what it says.just watch the capsule humidity like it it tells you to.</li>
            <li> Only got one of the items.  Not both items ordered.</li>
            <li> The package arrived very quickly. The contents were as shown and described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine had some random dust/fiber/hair and needed to be cleaned. It was cleaned in warm soapy water and then sun dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions and some of the comments at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag of capsules and the box that contained the machine both had size &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; printed on them. I took apart the first capsule but after attempting to insert the smaller half into the machine, the capsule got slighly crushed. I fixed the capsule but on closer inspection it was clear that there was no way it was going to fit into the machine. The holes in the machine were too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took another randon capsule out of the bag; it didn&#x27;t fit either. Because of some of the other comments on Amazon I knew that it may be a tight fit, but these capsules were never going to fit into this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, either the bag was mislabled or the machine box was mislabled. Fortunately I had some &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; capsules from another manufacturer; they didn&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inspected the machine for any symbols that may indicate a part number or size but there are none. Whoever put the machine into the box must have grabbed the wrong machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had saved the shipping box and packing materiels. Amazon will be picking up the item in the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll change the rating and update my comment if the replacement works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these capsule machines before they are easy to operate &amp; it&#x27;s nice to make your own capsules. You have to get into a meditative space though as it can be tedious. I think that can add energy and healing power to the capsules though which is why it&#x27;s preferable to make them yourself.  This set is a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to encapsulate herbs. I could do a month&#x27;s supply in ten minutes or so. Make sure you buy the right size capsules for the machine (that&#x27;s why I bought the combo kit - to be sure). The process was fun and everything was easy to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> The kit is easy to use, just stick the large end of the capsule into the top and pull the smaller end out, though filling will take a little longer.  I would like to get a size larger than 00 but that&#x27;s it apparently.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to pack my own herbs and vitamins. Especially the healthy ones i cant choke down. It is so easy and fast I love it and I have refered friends to it who have purchased it and they also love it..</li>
            <li> Whole sold 100 for 6 bucks, I got 1000 for 10 buck should I say more</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Perfect caps, even with my thick and clumsy fingers.  Some of my supplements require small doses. and putting them in caps avoids mistakes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Simple to use.  Fills 24 caps quickly.  Includes tamper to obtain consistently filled caps.  Well made, easy to clean.  Buy your vits in bulk and save.</li>
            <li> I have nothing else to compare this to, as I was the pill filler before this purchase. That was aweful. Especially when I filled capsules with turmeric.  Yellow stained finger nails for days.  Very attractive. Needless to say,  I love it.  Works great. You will owner it forever, as there are no parts that I can see that would ever break.</li>
            <li> This little machine allowed me to purchase bulk herbs and create my own capsules.  It is simple to use, of hardy construction that will last forever and the price was right.  I will likely be buying ones for other sizes of capsules in the future.</li>
            <li> Currently using this to fill capsules with a piracetam supplement.  It has great ease of use and looks to be durable enough.  The capsules aren&#x27;t always fully together after one puts the caps on so it is a good idea to run your finger over them until you feel a pop from each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are worried about waste, make sure to put the platform on a paper plate and, if you are very worried about waste, you can shake the capsules in a bag with a small hole in the bottom to get the excess powder off of them.</li>
            <li> Had to figure it out. The caps I bought were bigger than machine would hold. So it took me a while to figure things out.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Capsules are good quality, I&#x27;ve been able to fit nearly a gram into one, impressive, though a tad difficult to swallow if your not a pill person. These are big.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as the description says. All good, nothing to complain about. I would easily buy again these items.</li>
            <li> This is about the neatest device out there for making your own capsules. I have never had a problem with it sticking, the capsules that came with it are a perfect fit, the caps fit perfectly, and they pop right out of the machine.  It is a major time saver and sure beats filling them by hand!! I do not regret buying this at all and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make their own capsules.</li>
            <li> This a great gadget if you need to fill your own capsules. If you need to take some powdered herbs for even a few weeks, you&#x27;ll appreciate the convenience of capsules over measuring out 1/2 teaspoons for each dose. With practice, you can load 24 capsules in about 5 minutes with a process that is almost foolproof. I say Almost because occasionally a poorly inserted capsule will get crushed. And with practice that rarely happens. The kit gives you everything you need (except for the herbs, of course) and the instructions are very simple. In addition, you can find youtube demos by searching for &amp;#34;The Capsule Machine&amp;#34;. Also, filling capsules is good therapy!</li>
            <li> i liked this the filler is high quality and the caps are very nice and sturdy but beef gelatin so be ware for those vegetarians out there but otherwise a good buy, this should last me for at least a year or two because you get a lot and it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive, as some of the reviews were slightly unfavorable. I also doubted that I&#x27;d be able to make my own perfect capsules. Surely this is complicated, right? Nope. This machine has completely demystified capsule-making. It&#x27;s scary how easy this thing is to use and make my own perfect supplement mixture.</li>
            <li> I like Cap M Quick better. The large capsules get stuck in the holes.</li>
            <li> This capsule filler is easy to use and seems like it is made to last. Buying it bundled with the empty capsules was a great bargain. Be sure to place the included desiccant packing with the capsules into an airtight container, otherwise the capsules will swell and will no longer fit properly into the filler. Also, the tamping tool is quite helpful to ensure the proper amount gets into each capsule. If you follow the easy to understand instructions, you will find this to be a quality product that will suit your needs just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice product, they work well for constructing your own vitamins.  Sturdy capsules, don&#x27;t break easy which is nice for filling and sealing capsules.</li>
            <li> works very well. i had to capsule my fermented cod liver oil because it was too unbearable to take on its own. this worked well. looking forward to using it for my own herbal remedies. overall good value, easy to use. easy to clean. the capsules are great too!</li>
            <li> Was pretty darn easy to use and came with plenty of capsules. Also wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive. Im happy with it.</li>
            <li> So glad I have this; will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!  Works great.</li>
            <li> Greatly appreciate the value of being able to make my own capsules.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Simply easy....so much so my daughter VOLUNTEERS to make them for me as she thinks its &#x27;fun&#x27;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you pay attention to the size you need versus the capsules (extras) that you buy and you&#x27;ll be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great set, worth the money and seems very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues at all so far.  Easy to follow directions and easy to wipe down or clean when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used it both for putting in powder and liquid so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID recommend it to a friend already too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for L-Theanine Powder...used to taste bad, now easy.</li>
            <li> Good product--as described in ad. Good shipping speed.</li>
            <li> It works as described.  Easier than expected.  Better if it makes more than 24 a time.  If you are making a lot, stop and clean a little bit before continuing, that will make sure you don&#x27;t get jam easily.</li>
            <li> I put superfood in these and pop away!!!!</li>
            <li> The machine makes capsule assembly MUCH more efficient than my previous method (assembly by hand).  Easy to fill, easy to seal, easy to clean.  A clever idea executed flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Works well, the only thing I noticed is I thought the capsules were longer than others I had used (pills I bought already filled), but come to find out they just needed to be pushed together further. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal, they still work fine, your just swallowing a slightly (like maybe a millimeter) longer pill, or squeezing them together by hand. Still, I was buying the pills prefilled, and this is saving me quite a bit of money (although, I&#x27;m making up for it in time). It took about 2 hours to fill 300. Most people won&#x27;t need to fill that many pills as frequently. I&#x27;m using it for bentonite clay so I don&#x27;t have to drink the stuff, but still get the benefits.</li>
            <li> Machine is very easy to use. I bought it to get down some bad tasting supplements. I have to fill 5 or 6 capsules to get a 5 gram serving (1 tsp). Still better than tasting the supplements. I didn&#x27;t have to do any trimming as some others had to do. Some of the capsules fit more snug than others.</li>
            <li> Does what you need,I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly so far</li>
            <li> great product....really easy to get running well....</li>
            <li> Easy enough to use for small quantities. Two to four minutes to make one batch. Wasn&#x27;t all that inconvenient to make 400 capsules once you get a rhythm going.</li>
            <li> Capsule machine is fast and easy. Capsules are great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use and efficient! We make our own supplements and it&#x27;s a great help.</li>
            <li> These work just fine and the capsule machine makes it very simple to load the caps. The construction of the machine appears to be fairly solid and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend that uses it.  I have no prior experience with encapsulating. I was surprised at how easily I was able to use this product. Any apprehension that I had from negative reviews that I had read was immediately washed away when the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li> nothing special just as they should be.</li>
            <li> very easy to make your own capsules</li>
            <li> Figured cheaper making your own turmeric or green tea pills this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So got it, and it was much easier to use then I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that caused a little grief but super easy fix was some of the holes had a tiny bit of plastic still around the inside rings causing it to be hard to press in the capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy just to take a pen and \\&quot;roll\\&quot; it around in the capsule hole to clear it out. Took seconds.</li>
            <li> We chose this product because our dog is ill and one of his meds only comes in a power, to be sprinkled on his food; once we do that, he won&#x27;t eat his food. This makes giving him his meds very easy every couple days I fill the capsules with this machine, works great! Product is exactly as described, comes with clear instructions and buying the capsules with it, just makes it all the easier!</li>
            <li> I find this machine very entertaining to use, it arrived here this morning and I&#x27;ve made a few hundred capsules already! The easiest way to learn to use it is YouTube, I was instantly making them like a pro after watching a 2 minute video.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product after reading good reviews about it. I had purchased tumeric and decided it would be less expensive to make these capsules rather than buying them. The directions are easy and after the second try, they looked as professional as the ones I had previously purchased.I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This thing works perfectly - it&#x27;s great for filling capsules with vitamin powder. Love it!</li>
            <li> Goes pretty fast once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Works flawlessly. So easy to make your own caps. Everything you need to get you going, other then the supplement of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gripe is that my second batch always has a little supplement residue after I pressed the caps which doesn&#x27;t look as nice as a professional companies supplement.</li>
            <li> The capsules are easy to work with and, since it comes in a pkg of 1,000 my learning curve was no big loss.&lt;br /&gt;My dog has to take 7 huge nasty tasting horse pills every morning. He can&#x27;t be fooled by the nasty pills being crushed in anything yummy. Nor will he be fooled by slipping pill portions into a hotdog (&amp;#34;yuck, these hotdogs have pits inside!&amp;#34; He says) He can, however, let these capsules slide down the gullet with some tasty goo (ham salad, egg salad, ground beef &amp; cheese... that he doesn&#x27;t need to chew (so he doesn&#x27;t break open the nastiness inside the capsules ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I crush his 3 tablets into a fine powder with a pill crusher, then fill as many capsules as it takes to contain all the crushed med. It always takes 7 capsules. I wipe the pill dust off the outside of capsules,,,(obvious stinky evidence to our dog) and we can f.i.n.a.l.l.y. trick him into getting his very important meds down each morning, so he can get on the mend from his very serious and stubborn infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister gave me some capsules from her order to get me started, then I ordered my own bag, plus the capsule machine. The capsule machine is nifty &amp; really speeds up the process. I am very happy with my purchase. Some days I feel weird cuz the items look kinda shady sitting around the kitchen. Other times I feel like a scientist, back in science lab or compounding pharmacist, but every way, every day....I am a dog mommy who can now do the happy dance that her sweet pooch gets the meds he needs and I outsmarted him....for a change! Even if it&#x27;s only temporary,  I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> Excellent capsule machine and excellent capsules. Bought the 1000 capsules size 00. This was my first time using a product of this kind and I was able to fill all 1000 capsules in a little less than 3 hours. Everything was perfect. No problems whatsoever. I was using this to make root tabs (fertilizer) for planted aquarium. If this is also your intended purpose, don&#x27;t forget to get a capsule injector so you can push these into gravel with ease. Capsule/pill injectors are sold under pet supplies, normally used to push medication down a dog&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> Not sure what everyone is talking about in some of these reviews.  Perhaps I simply got a superior capsule machine compared to most.  It works beautifully.  The hardest part was loading the capsules.  It took a minute or two.  Then simply add your powder, spread it with the card, tamp it down, spread some more, then push down to cause the bottoms of the capsules to raise, put the top over the bottom to _automatically_ join the caps together, then eject them from the top into a bowl.  I made 96 caps of Piracetam within 10 minutes and this was my first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that the top does not always join the capsules tightly to the bottom so I would press the caps together real quick before I eject them from the capsule machine.  But this thing works beautifully.  Not having to put the tops of the caps on myself is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> So instead of making pills and spilling powder everywhere, you can fire up a podcast on your computer and listen while you labor away doing this. i messed up the first time by not shoving the pills all away down and I spilled powder everywhere. I re-read the instructions and realized that I was supposed to use the moisture absorbing packet to shrink the little buggers. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them getting stuck stuck, but just dry them out a little more in a container of sorts.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make probiotic capsules for my daughter. Works amazingly well. I made 72 capsules in about 20 minutes and now I can make them super fast...since I know approx. how much each one can hold. Capsules went together smoothly and easily. Was even kinda fun!! Clean up was a breeze, too!! If you need to make powders into capsules, this is the product you need!! MUCH cheaper than having the pharmacist do it!</li>
            <li> I had never filled my own caps before - this little gadget is super easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had a broken cap yet.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, easy to clean, a big money saver. Will buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> The product is a great idea and if it wasnt flawed Im sure it would have gotten 4 or 5 stars. The problem I had was that at the bottom of 75% of the holes there was flash (excess plastic) which made it impossible to get the capsules all the way in, making it impossible to fill them the way it is suppose to be. Had to return the item for a refund, now, waiting another 3 days just for it to even be shipped</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm the first time, it worked even better the second time,third time I was a champ.Easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is a great capsule-making system, easy to use and much easier than making capsules by hand. This was an excellent purchase and Ill be using this capsule filler for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have used other capsule filling trays, but this one is an engineering masterpiece.  It is well designed and implemented, and works perfectly every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You place the device in the base (the larger part of the base with the flange upward), and fill the base with the longer part of 24 capsules.  You fill the lid with the shorter part of the capsules.  Use the green card to spread the herbs or nutrients into the lower parts of the capsules. Use the reaming tool, if desired, to pack down all 24 capsules at once, in order to make room for additional herbs or nutrients.  Place the lid on and press.  Remove the base and press in the clips on the bottom, and, voila!, all 24 filled capsules eject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave away the empty capsules that came with the tool because they are made with beef gelatin.  I purchased vegan capsules from another source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the silica gel packets from another source.  The kit comes with one large silica gel packet in a large zip-lock plastic back, for drying and shrinking an entire batch of capsules at at time.  Firstly, I do not think that the capsules need to be dried and sealed.  They are firmly pressed together by the tool.  For simple humidity protection, I would much rather have tiny silica packets that I would store with each individual batch of filled packets, such as one would find in a store-purchased jar of vitamins.  So I purchased [[ASIN:B0070FKL3Y 100 1/2 (Half) Gram Silica Gel Packets]] from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is still a 5-star product.  I would have ordered it with or without the included extras.</li>
            <li> I encapsulated my placenta with this kit. It was so easy (I was 3 days postpartum so I NEEDED easy). Love that I can use it over and over again. Didn&#x27;t find a single capsule that was broken or the wrong size. Loved being able to do this myself!! I made 250 capsules and it took me about an hour. (Again I was post partum and very slow.)</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly, though I have to say I was very glad for the website to the demonstration video - I found the instructions a bit confusing as I was using a capsule machine for the first time.  Otherwise, would definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very clever device, but my copy was poorly executed. The capsules would not fit into the holes in the base. They went a bit more than half way in easily and then I had to force them. What is more, the amount of force varied from hole to hole. So I looked at the holes and found mold flash at the bottoms of all of them. I snapped out the plastic pusher from the bottom of the base and using the tip of a sharp knife I beveled the bottoms of all the holes removing the mold flash. When done I replaced the pusher. Now the capsule bases fit all the way in easily and the contraption works great. I&#x27;d have given it all five stars if I didn&#x27;t have to fix it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pharmacist and I bought this for home use. It didn&#x27;t work properly .&lt;br /&gt;The directions were vague....and the capsules once filled would not release from the machine</li>
            <li> This is a very neat little machine and I could not be more pleased with its purchase. I think it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got my pill machine, I started making pills (liver and red raspberry leaf) because it is cheaper to buy bulk herbs and fill them yourself. I started out having trouble getting my pills to come out of the machine, but I had read another reviewer day that they had to scrape some of the extra plastic left over from manufacturing out of the holes. After I did this, my pills no longer stuck in the machine. By my 3rd round of pills, all but 1 came out and the tops of the pills were securely on (one end locks into the other). I love it!</li>
            <li> Great item if you have something like tea to take from a Chinese Medical Doctor that is too bitter (check with Doctor first).  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this since it came with the machine AND the capsules for cheaper than they are separate. It takes only a few minutes to place the capsules in the machine and then depending on how fluffy and in need of compacting the supplement you are using is, it can take take only a few seconds or a few more minutes to fill the capsules and only seconds to seal them using the machine. The instructions are clear and in less than an hour you can make hundreds of capsules.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I gave this to a pharmacist who knows compounding pharmacy. For design and ease of use, he gave this device a 9/10 quality compared to his professional tools. Overall, 10/10 for experience including easy ordering, delivery as promised, working device, working capsule. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++++++++&lt;br /&gt;If your powder to not fill evenly in all capsule because total volume of powder is less then total volume of 24 capsules, read below:&lt;br /&gt;Possible solution: put in 12 capsules and fill. That means you now have half of volume of capsule. Each capsule should fill in full by now. If not, use less capsules, maybe use 8 capsules?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible solution: If you still insist on filling 24 capsules at 1 time, another solution is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have partial-filled-problem, here is a solution:&lt;br /&gt;Commenter Steely Blue wrote: \\&quot;Not yet, but I&#x27;ll post here if I come across anything. For the moment, my idea is to use a size 1 capsule filler with a fully tamped cellulose or erythritol filler powder, after having done and tested the math. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My answer: You are near there my friend; ideally, we love to have all possible sizes so we do not partial fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you, try this:&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Use the same capsule you have, and&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Increase volume of your powders. How? Calculate and try to add enough corn powder or rice powder or whatever powder you like. Really? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Buy a small kitchen weighing scale on Amazon for 10 dollars or at Target or Walmart....&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Weigh and write down 10 grams of powder you like, add to the existing powder, mix well. Because we will need to shake out the powder in a few minutes, fill loosely your capsule WITHOUT PUSHING POWDER DOWN. DO NOT PUT THE SMALL CAP ON YET. Again, fill capsule and look: Do you see the capsule fully filled or partial fill?&lt;br /&gt;Step 4.1: If still partial filled, shake out those existing powder, weigh 10 grams more (and write down#, add to existing powder andmix well, fill capsule again and look: Do you see the capsule fully filled or partially filled?&lt;br /&gt;Step 4.2: If fully filled, give yourself a pat in the back and help others.&lt;br /&gt;Step 5: Keep total weigh of ADDED EXTRA powder, and you have your own formula for your batch of 24 capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Be aware that many powders can cause you to make gas and fart.

            <li> I fill capsules with virgin coconut oil, and it is so much quicker to fill the capsules with this kit. You can get quicker with practice. It is easy to use, and easy to clean. The kit was everything I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> This is the first capsule filling machine I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It is very easy to use, and the accompanying instructions are very clear.  This machine is great for filling capsules with ground herbs.  I love it.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to tamp down very fine powders like activated charcoal, as it could get messy.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I wasnt sure if this thing was actually gonna work. As soon as it came in the mail I put it to the test, all 24 capsules came together like a charm. I have had a problem once where my capsules were stored in a spot in my home that was cold and they would not come together at all it just crushed them. Make sure to keep them stored at a warmer tempature and it will work perfectly every single time. Also the machine is dishwasher safe and doesnt stain like previous reviews have stated. All in all, this thing is perfect and I highly recommend buying this machine.</li>
            <li> Works just like it said it would. Love it!</li>
            <li> I had a smaller size, but needed this size for my &amp;#34;Salt/C+ Protocol&amp;#34; (see Amazon for the book) -- I immediately made up about 500 capsules of Himalayan Salt from The Spice Lab on Amazon.  (I think it took about 2 hours.)  One bag probably makes something closer to 600 or more capsules.</li>
            <li> I use it for a particular herb that is like saw dust going down. You get pretty fast at using this. 24 pills a pop. Easy to do after awhile. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works well to fill the capsules with the material I am using (a dietary fiber supplement). It does take more than two minutes to load all the gelatin capsules into the holders, but once this is done, the rest is fast and easy. Sealing the capsules has worked perfectly so far.</li>
            <li> Works just as described, might take a little longer to use than they advertise but saves a lot of time regardless.</li>
            <li> This machine is great. It works as advertised, simple to use and effective to push out 24 capsuls at a time, once you get used to it you can pop them out very quickly as well. Definitly would suggest this machine to people. The capsuls it comes with are Beef Geletin capsuls and work wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> The machine itself works fine, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the capsules getting jammed. My issue is that the machine I received was not the correct machine. The box says &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; and the capsules that came with it were &amp;#34;00&amp;#34;, however the &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; capsules are too large for the machine. I had some size &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; capsules which fit the machine perfectly, so I think I just got unlucky and received a size &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; machine in a size &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; box. I don&#x27;t want to return the machine because I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems others have mentioned about jamming, but I will contact the seller about exchanging the capsules. I&#x27;m giving three stars because though the machine works great, there is an obvious lack of quality control coming from the factory if a size &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; machine gets put in a &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; box. . .it also seems like the majority of complaints about this product come down to lack of quality control from the factory.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived in a timely fashion.nice product ingenious good directions correct advertising; Great and magnificent gift. Arrived in a timely fashion.nice product ingenious good directions correct advertising;  magnificent gift.</li>
            <li> i bought this machine to fill my own herbal supplements and was extremely disappointed by how much work it really was. The holes in the machine are not cut right and the capsules jammed so bad i could not even use it anymore. What a waste of money! It worked good with the capsules that came with the machine but as soon as i bought some new ones (yes they were the right size i checked twice) they did not fit into the machine right. That was when i noticed that the holes in the machine are not even consistent circles! Way too much work! i would rather pay the obscene amounts for my herbal supplements then cap them myself!</li>
            <li> Love both items. So glad I found them!</li>
            <li> The tolerances and effect of the entire machine design are very effective. Everything fits and works as you would expect. Design is efficient.</li>
            <li> perfect for the application it was purchased for.</li>
            <li> It did the job very well</li>
            <li> There is a lot of manual work filling capsules with this type of machine, but it works very well. It is also less expensive.  I recommend this filler if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of ongoing capsules to fill.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and with no damage. The gel caps are flawless and the machine works with no flaws. I have used 500 of the caps thus far and have had maybe 5 that did not cap right. I will be purchasing more caps real soon.</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;ts extremely easy to use. I&#x27;ve had no capsules fail to fill and none have become stuck.. If you follow the directions it works just like it&#x27;s supposed to. I made around 72 capsules in around five minutes after I gathered the stuff I needed together.</li>
            <li> After great deliberation, I decided to purchase the capsule machine. It was very easy and very quick to fill the capsules and put them together. Every so often, a capsule won&#x27;t fill right or the end will squish, but for the most part it works well and the job is much easier to get done with the machine, rather than by hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the capsule machine to encapsulate the contents of mother&#x27;s milk tea bags (can&#x27;t stand the taste). It worked well and I was able to take the capsules orally without having to deal with the taste!</li>
            <li> They work perfect together. Saving me many dollars.  Good directions, easy to use, what more could I ask for. Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t number how many pills I made by hand before getting one of these. Thought it would be annoying but it definitely helps. Takes a few tries to get used to but it&#x27;s pretty easy once you get a hang of it.</li>
            <li> The capsule machine is a piece of junk.  It is cumbersome, time consuming, seems to waste product.  I find it much faster to fill each capsule by hand like I did prior to wasting my money on this.&lt;br /&gt;The capsules are capsules....exactly what advertised, etc. No complaints there.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and easy to use. If you&#x27;re okay with fitting 24 capsules at a time, this will work for you as well. I wish they had a model with an interchangeable size holder because now I want to buy the size &#x27;0&#x27; and if they sold it a size &#x27;000&#x27; as well. It truly saves a bundle on supplements.</li>
            <li> I used this capsule filler for my first time placenta encapsulation. By being able to do my own encapsulation I saved over $100. This little unit is a breeze to use!</li>
            <li> Works ok. A little messy and cumbersome , but works fine.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing however I need to purchase a big one for what I&#x27;m making, but this will do for now :)</li>
            <li> I recently started taking MSM for joint pain. The taste of MSM is unpleasant to me. As I enjoy gourmet  foods I am sensitive to foreign tastes in my food and drink. I tried putting the MSM crystals in orange and other fruit juices but I can still taste the bitterness.. If and when I have to increase the dose it will make matters worse.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to encapsulate the crystals and bought this kit because of the reviews. I found it excellent and easy to use although a bit labor intensive. On my first trial it took me 11 minutes to do the load of 24 capsules. O my third try I had knocked off one minute. I think with a bit of practice and improvement of technique I could probably do a load in 8 to 9 minutes if not better. That&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product based on my initial reaction and as there are really no parts to break off I don&#x27;t see this machine wearing out. Unfortunately the crystals don&#x27;t leand themselves to tamping to get more in. By tapping the side of bottom half I got a little settling of about 5%.</li>
            <li> works great and makes what would have been a tedious chore quick and easy. highly recommend! easy to use, easy to clean, so get one lol</li>
            <li> Perfect for making your own charcoal pills and powdered flax pills.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my freind and she was very satisfied with it because it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a great little machine. No issues functionally.Once I got my rhythm down I could do 100 grams in around 30 minutes. It took me the first 100 grams to get my rhythm down :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Lay a towel down first. Stuff can get messy,&lt;br /&gt;2. Put a piece of aluminium foil over a plate, but don&#x27;t fold over, leave it flat. Use an large piece that goes over the edge so you can use it to funnel extra material back into original bag. I leave the extra on the foil until i have a good amount then dump excess back in.&lt;br /&gt;3. After you press down on the unit wiggle a little, then you will have to push slightly down on the caps to fully seal them together. Very quick, not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;4. Then gently push them out onto another piece of aluminium foil or container to hold them.&lt;br /&gt;5. I have to dry my hands off on towel after each batch. Easier to grasp gel caps with clean hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it, and you can make ALOT of pills with bulk powder. Happy capping.</li>
            <li> Thank you. Everything worked as promised.</li>
            <li> I filled several hundred capsules the same day I received product.  It worked perfectly.  Still, you have to be a little bit nimble to pull the empty capsules apart and fit them in their respective slots.  The first batch I was kind of wondering how the world it was going to all work and then when they popped out of there, it was OMG this is so cool.  All those years of stuffing capsules by hand.  Why oh why didn&#x27;t I think to look on Amazon sooner for this simple little device.</li>
            <li> This works great for people wanting to add natural substance a Passion Flower Leaf, Ginger, or Turmeric Powder to their regiments without having to suffer through tasting them. It claims that you can fill 24 capsules in 2 minutes. With people people working as a team, maybe. However it works great. I&#x27;d recommend using a paper plate under the machine so you can fold it and pour the powder that didn&#x27;t get in the machine back into its container.</li>
            <li> works as expected. it was very easy to use just takes some time. i&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone else</li>
            <li> A little messy, but starting to get the hang of it. Made my first few batches of herbal remedies and I LOVE it! One of the best investments I have made.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and inexpensive product.  I was surprised at how easy it was to use.  The only thing I can say is don&#x27;t do what I did and load a lot of capsules at once in front of the TV. I did and my back hurt for 2 days.  Use a table so you are not bending over.</li>
            <li> these are great my only problem is that sometimes when I put the caps on they dont fill up all the way but its ok.</li>
            <li> I have filled hundreds of gelcaps with cinnamon, caffeine and other powdered supplements and have had no problems. It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever purchased a product like this. Definitely faster to fill caps with this rack. It does leave some powdered ingredients on the rack which you need to wipe off. So that slows things down some. But it is still worth to get it.</li>
            <li> This capsule filler is great.  It only takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, and once you do you can be making capsules quickly.</li>
            <li> This little contraption and the capsules that come with it work amazingly well together. The only time I had any trouble with it was a user error. I managed to pack 2 large capsule halves together in the same hole, which threw the whole thing off. Once I realized what happened, I took that capsule out and all the others went together flawlessly. This is so much nicer than trying to do all of these individually. It&#x27;s a huge money saver for me as well, since the powdered herbs I use these for are much cheaper when bought in bulk, then processed into gelatin capsules for easy consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the gelatin capsules come with a silica gel packet that give additional instructions on how to package it with the gelatin capsules  keep them at a uniform size. They can be affected enough by humid or dry conditions to warp. The packet tells not only how to keep this from happening, but also how to make the packet reusable by gently reheating it in the oven so it releases the water it has taken in.</li>
            <li> My cat required a powdered medication but didn&#x27;t like the taste.  He would accept tablets or capsules but it was a chore to fill the capsules and put them together by hand.  The &amp;#34;Capsule Machine&amp;#34; makes it so much easier and faster</li>
            <li> Great capsules and the machine is simply easy and perfect</li>
            <li> The machine works great and conserves product. This is a great buy if you hate drinking yucky medicine powders and just want to swallow it in a pill.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit and capsules only to receive the wrong size capsule kit!  So now i have to return the whole thing to get my credit back, i wont do this again!</li>
            <li> For the life of me I would not have figured out how to fill the 00 capsules until I got this machine. Works like a charm and it&#x27;s very easy to use. Makes quite a few capsules in no time at all</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a few months and it works great. I cant imagine it ever breaking. very useful.</li>
            <li> Great little machine that works well.  Great purchase and saves you money.</li>
            <li> Saves so much time. A little bit of a learning curve but once you get it, it&#x27;s very useful. Make sure you keep your empty capsules in an airtight container because the moisture in the air can affect the capsules making the device a little more difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This little thing is pretty cool. It&#x27;s easy to use and makes a nice tight capsule filled with all my crazy herbal concoctions.</li>
            <li> Returned before I even opened the box to look at the capsule loader...the loader and capsules come sealed in a bag together.  I am allergic to beef (found out about 3 months ago-hooray-NOT) and the capsules are made of some beef byproduct.  Would  have been nice if this had been mentioned in the product description.  Went to PCC and bought 200 vegetarian capsules and a capsule loader for less than this set.  Yes, I got fewer capsules, but at least I know they are safe for me to consume.  AGAIN (see some of my other reviews)...shame on AMAZON for not making their sellers fully disclose ingredients of eatable products.  The only way you would know that the capsules are made of beef byproducts is to scroll over the picture to zoom in on the label.  I guess I&#x27;m going to have to do this with EVERYTHING from now on if I plan to buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Clearly there is variability with the manufacturing of this contraption. 00 capsules do not fit. This was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I fill my own capsules with dietary supplements, saving significant $.  This capsule filling machine works very well for that.  It does however take a few trials to get the process down pat.  Many inexpensive empty gelatin capsules are manufactured with significant variations in size, plus all of them will swell in high humidity.  A few just do not want to fit into the holes, while others will be loose. I found that if I match the tops and bottoms of the capsules when inserting them, so the each top goes back on the same bottom it came from, I can pretty much get a 100% success rate. Given that the other \\&quot;machines\\&quot; in this price range require you to install the tops by hand, this is a great time-saving device.  It also disassembles completely for easy cleaning when you are done.  Of course, as for all of these filling machines, you have to have a separate one for each size capsule you want to fill.</li>
            <li> Mix that creatine with other vitamines and minerals into the capsules.  Don&#x27;t forget to get measuring spoons and scale.  Throw in some latex glvoes so your hands dont get stained.</li>
            <li> good product! works great! easy to get used to and i am very satisfied. i plan on recommending this to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> This was a good value and I had no problem with the shipment or the product. The capsule filler is easy to use and the capsules are a good quality. I would purchase this product again and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> works great. Thanks. makes it a lot easier to fill the capsules. this is all i have to say now.</li>
            <li> I bought some powdered garlic thru Springtime for my dog and she refused to eat it on her food. Don&#x27;t blame her either PU! so I decided to get this and see if I can use it this way and it is so easy and great too..the capsules are easy to fill (watch the video on the comments and you will see how easy) and they are easy to get the pills down my dog too!..lol</li>
            <li> I am making my own supplements now.  I weigh out yohimbine and caffeine anhydrous and fill the rest with beta alanine.  I make my own cayanne pepper pills, glutamine, and cocoa pills.  Watch a YouTube video on this handy little device.  There is another brand out there that makes more pills at one time, but the tops have to be individually placed on the filled bottoms one by one.  With the Capsule Machine I can insert the tops of the capsules in the top of the device as I am placing the bottoms of the capsules in the bottom part of the device. (Watch the video, it shows a better demo than I can explain).  Long story short, I can do all the above mentioned, fill the capsules, pack em&#x27;, add more filling, pack, etc in just over 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of herbs and some are just too expensive to buy in 30 to 60 capsule bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I gulp a lot of powder and tastes really bad. Thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this as my hands&lt;br /&gt;aren&#x27;t so dextrous anymore. Instructions could have been more clear, but after the first success&lt;br /&gt;it was a great discovery to know I can &amp;#34;roll my own&amp;#34; so to speak. Only thing I might wish is a machine&lt;br /&gt;that is bigger and can do more capsules at a time than 24. Nice unit!</li>
            <li> Simple to use kit that saves a lot of time and money. Fills 24 capsules with ease and I like that it shows the approximate milligram weight per filled capsule on the box, based on the capsule size you use.</li>
            <li> Honestly there&#x27;s not much to say about this capsule filler. It&#x27;s a simple, straightforward product that does what it&#x27;s designed to do. With reasonable care it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to fill their own capsules.  I&#x27;ve used it a lot since I got it and haven&#x27;t had even one not turn out.</li>
            <li> Great for do t yourself I buy bulk herbs and fill them my self you save ton&#x27;s of money will use until I die.</li>
            <li> I just received my Capsule filler kit. Before I got it I took the time to look at a couple of videos on YouTube to watch other people use it. What I found is that it is very easy to use.  It takes time to separate the capsules and put the long half in one side and the short half in the other side. I seem to get faster at it every time I use the filler. I only lost about 3 capsules out of 6 batches so I am working on 100% success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend putting only a little bit of your powder or herbs on the top of the filler, so you don&#x27;t need to try and scrape up excess and put it back in the bag. You can always add more but it can get wasteful if you spill a ton of powder everywhere. I start with 1-2 tablespoons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual filling of the capsules I recommend that people think about the order in which they choose which vitamins or herbs they will use to fill the capsules. For instance I filled Quercetin first. Then I filled Vitamin C. That way if there was any left over quercetin it goes well with vitamin C. Then I cleaned up and did something else that goes together like Vitamin D and Magnesium. This cuts down on cleaning and waste. To clean just dry dust with a clean cloth or paper towel. I don&#x27;t see any need to wash with water unless it gets very dusty, dirty or sticky.</li>
            <li> Came quick and works great!</li>
            <li> These are easy to swallow and the filler kit works perfectly.  Having been using now for about a month.  Cuts the cost of pre filled supplements like Camu Camu, Fenugreek and Corydalis.</li>
            <li> use this to make my own vitamin pills. works good if you are pilling up a fine powder you have to clean out occasionally so pills dont get stuck. works good. gelatin pills arent exactly candy flavored but I can deal since you dont have to chew.</li>
            <li> This machine works really well. I&#x27;ve used it to encapsulate herbs and spices to take as natural remedies. I&#x27;m glad I bought this. Some of the other reviews said they received the wrong sized capsules, but mine were perfect.</li>
            <li> works very well for packing our own vitamin C and herbs</li>
            <li> I got this as my son with Autism can&#x27;t take liquid medications without throwing up.  I realize it is not meant for liquids, but as long as you take them right away, it works.  Great idea, and a wonderful time saver!</li>
            <li> I got this because I have a greens powder that I cannot drink in plain water and I don&#x27;t feel like making smoothies everyday to hide the taste. I was missing my greens powder and figured the next best thing was to get it into capsules. I found this capsule machine with the capsules and thought it was a great value based on others that I had looked at both on Amazon and elsewhere. It gets the job done and is pretty simple to use. I can&#x27;t really complain about it for the price. It&#x27;s hard plastic that is sure to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to be and worked smoothly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to keep all the pills the same quantity of stuff, and with the powder smasher you can pack it down and then put smaller doses of other substances in the same pill.  In my case I had Pramiracetam, Centrophenoxine, and Vinpocetine all in one pill in reasonable doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used latex gloves while doing it because the water in your hands could potentially cause stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions were also easily understandable, including pictures at each step.</li>
            <li> Although I myself do not use the capsule filler, I bought it for my son to fill and make capsules for me since I have use of just my right hand. He tells me that because it makes much more at a time that it really is a time saver too!</li>
            <li> Great little kit.  This little capsule machine makes filling capsules MUCH easier and quicker.  You can fill 24 pills at a time.  I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so tedious to actually put 24 capsules in the machine (not the machines fault).  It gets old separating the capsules, place one half in the bottom of the machine, place the other half in the top of the machine, repeat 24 times...  Then repeat this whole process until you&#x27;ve filled 1000 capsules.  Really tedious.  Took me about an hour to fill all 1000 capsules.  Money well spent!  This capsule machine should last forever, good quality and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just read directions. Perfect for capping your own herbal concoctions. I buy bulk organic tumeric, etc from starwest botanicals and cap myself. It saves a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Works as described. It&#x27;s actually a lot faster than I thought it would take to do. Now, I order supplements in bulk powder and make my own capsules. I&#x27;l be buying different sized capsule machines now that I know how to use this. I also used it to make individual capsules and it worked just fine. Great buy</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good value</li>
            <li> Awesome! Filling capsules has become incredibly easy and fast. Instructions were simple. However, a bit of a mess is created when using this (unless you&#x27;re very careful), so make sure to use it in a bowl or pan. Not perfect, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34; works pretty well, but the caps aren&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> Great service. Received on time. This product is wonderful. I have a Corgi that takes a powdered medication that is very bitter. We are able to put in the gel caps and he takes like a champ. With the capsule machine we can make 36 gel caps at a time and save a lot of time and stress for all of us. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the encapsulator worked flawlessly right out of the box, and I have used it many times by now with no problems to speak of (other than once, which was user error) ... I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants to fill their own capsules, either to insure the purity of the contents or to save money by buying in bulk, this machine is amazing.  I was filling capsules by hand &amp; it was tedious &amp; messy.  This little &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; contraption makes filling the capsules a breeze!  I recommend it highly.  I think I&#x27;m going to buy another size.  That&#x27;s how good it is.  The free capsules is a sweet plus to the deal.  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly simple to use once you get a rhythm going.</li>
            <li> this priduct works like a dream,  would recommend this product 100 percent..try it for yourself you will love it. word</li>
            <li> Happy with the kit. Glad to be able to make coconut oil supplements. I keep the caps in the fridge if filling with oil.</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own coconut oil capsules.  I can&#x27;t stand the taste of coconut oil by itself.  Yuck!  It got a little messy but I could easily fill 24 capsules in less than three minutes.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I ran out of product to fill because I was having such a good time doing it.</li>
            <li> the capsule filling machine was designed for &#x27;OO&#x27; size capsule to which they shipped me the &#x27;04&#x27; size which does not work.  Had a delay in receiving the replacements to use with the machine...... they should higher someone at the factory that can read and count.......</li>
            <li> We needed this for a very fine powdery supplement that doesn&#x27;t mix well in liquid and is only available in bulk powder. This capsule filler makes it so much easier to manage. It cleans up quite easily too. Just rinse it off with water and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> The 00 size is about the size of a citrical capsule and holds a good amount of powder for whatever you&#x27;re doing. depending on powder density it will hold 500-800 mg from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> THIS CAPSULE FILLING KIT IS VERY SIMPLE TO USE. IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES TO MAKE&lt;br /&gt;24 CAPSULES. WE USE THIS CAPSULE MAKER SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK AND AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF USE IT HAS FOR THE MOST PART HELD UP. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT NOW A COUPLE OF THE CAPSULES GET STUCK IN THE TRAY AFTER THE CAPSULES ARE JOINED TOGETHER AND THEY WON&#x27;T COME LOOSE UNLESS YOU YANK THEM OUT AND SOMETIMES THEY GET RUINED, OTHER THAN THAT WE FIND THIS LITTLE CAPSULE MAKER TO BE FASTER THAN MAKING THEM BY HAND.</li>
            <li> the capsules are easy to use and can use for other ingredients as well as Nopal Powder. But for the reason i ordered it, there were too many capsules. I wish they had come in smaller packages.l</li>
            <li> Some of the herbs I take come in bulk form and I don&#x27;t do the drinks very well, so the capsules are a great way to get these things down without having to suffer unpleasant taste.  This item works well for the most part, but occasionally the capsules hang up in the top portion and I have to manually place the tops on the capsules... this is only for a small number tho, overall, this item is well worth the money.  It takes a couple tries to get the hang of it, but works well.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, it worked very well. It is time consuming, but it is effective in making capsules from powder</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this.  I use it for Maca Powder and Tumeric.  Easy to load and I can take my herbs on my travels.  Simple and easy to use just make sure you always buy the right size capsules for the filler kit.</li>
            <li> I was not to sure about it, but took a gamble.  Turns out it is very simple.  In a matter of minutes we made 48 capsules.  No mess!  They all sealed no problem.  My 14 year old daughter makes them in her spare time.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> After filling a multitude of custom-blended herbal supplements by hand, this was truly a blessing. It is not too large nor costly for the relatively small amounts I make from time to time.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is that capsules get jammed a lot. Both the upper and/or the lower half of the capsule can independently get jammed. It can be impossible to seal and remove the capsule then. The only way I see in which jamming can be prevented is if the plastic parts which rub against the capsule are washed cleanly with water and dried - before each time they&#x27;re used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, I have also used the Cap-M-Quik capsule filler. Jamming is not a problem with it, because the system works differently, although a bit more manually, but that&#x27;s the price I pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is only a suitable filler if you are going to be filling the larger part of each capsule *completely*. For almost all applications, only partial filling by weight is desirable, irrespective of the capsule size. If you try to partially fill capsules with this device, you will end up with some capsules that have significantly more powder than others - this is highly unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know of no good solution to the partial filling problem. One approximate solution is to use different size capsules and Filler-Kits for different products. Another solution is to compute and use a large amount of filler powder such as microcrystalline cellulose in order to standardize the dose volume to the capsule size - this is mathematically involved and potentially error-prone. A hybrid solution is what I am using now, with the Cap-M-Quik capsule filler.</li>
            <li> I have been taking herbs from my acupuncturist and had been filling the capsules myself when she mentioned this device.  She actually gave me the link to buy it from another site, but I found this one for far less money--yay!  I ordered it and absolutely love it.  It makes filling the capsules so much easier and faster.  Plus, the waste and mess is minimal.  The downside that I think some other reviews have mentioned is that you get less into each capsule.  There is a device for packing the herbs (or whatever you put in) but I think the reason you get less into the capsule in the end is because you can&#x27;t fill the top portion as well.  When I was doing each capsule by hand, I was able to also fill in the top section.  However, I&#x27;d rather have to take one additional capsule in order to get the full amount than do it by hand with the mess and fuss and take one less.  I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> i dont know how this item was so highly rated. I buy alot of items based on the quantity and quality of rating by other customers. This plastic contraption is hard to use and very frustrating. The capsules stay stuck in the holes once filled and half fall apart. It takes a hulk sometimes to punch these things out and then the capsule is all dented and comes apart. Out of a batch, we got 3 to stay together the first time, 7 to stay together the second time, and it was just frustrating. Yes, we bought the right size capsules, yes we used the bag and a sealed container to shrink the capsules, yes we followed the directions... my hubby is quite a calm guy, but there were &amp;^%$! words coming out of him during the whole time we were doing this. We thought we could save money putting pills together ourselves, but I&#x27;m finding that its worth paying extra to avoid the stress that comes along with using this piece of junk. ugh!</li>
            <li> Great transaction and product</li>
            <li> I encapsulated my placenta at home and it was easy to use and a good price.</li>
            <li> I used this to fill over 500 capsules in just a few hours. Using this product it was really easy to fill capsules. It comes with everything you need and the capsules that are included are good for general use. I&#x27;ve been using them for the past four months and I have had no problems. If you want to make your life easy then get this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second machine. Could not ask  for more. Take time and read the directions. They are actually understandable.</li>
            <li> This capsule machine is the bomb!!! I buy bulk powders on Amazon and usually try to just scoop the powder into a drink. The nasty tasting powders, on the other hand, I -cannot- stomach. That&#x27;s where this capsule machine saves the day, it saves me from having to taste the most vile powdered supplements known to mankind. That and I can still save money over buying pre made capsules. Win!</li>
            <li> The kit is easy to use and completely meets my requirements.  I use it to fill capsules with tumeric, an herb with anti-cancer properties.  I also use it to fill capsules with cinnamon, which may help in diabetes control.</li>
            <li> As described &amp; great value</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes filling capsules very easy! I just set by the Tv in my off time and fill capsules as buying herbs are much cheaper this way. Only thing I would change is the side where you scrape off excess medium. I wish there was a piece that would keep it closed while you are filling the capsules.</li>
            <li> Other than some of the capsules being very brittle, everything else was very satisfactory, the 24 cap filler kit is just right for the number of caps to make at a time and the ease of loading and closing the caps is just great. I love it.</li>
