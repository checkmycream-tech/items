            <li>I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I expect wonderful things from it.</li>
            <li>a beautiful scent I would truly recommend it.</li>
            <li>With a heavenly scent like this, who wouldn&#x27;t be happy?</li>
            <li>Very nice Jas fragrance and NOT diluted.  </li>
            <li>and I find that I get lots of comments on how pleasant my hair</li>
            <li>does a good job of providing its smell.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>best thing about this particular brand of oil is that the Jasmine scent is intoxicating!</li>
            <li>Very strong oil.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent, but very very light.</li>
            <li>Would have given it a 5 because it smells amazing, but it arrived with the cap not on securely.</li>
            <li>Love&#x27;s Musky Jasmine.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a light, lingering reminder!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Jasmine - I have some Jasmine deoderant and this smells nothing like that.</li>
            <li>Love the oil</li>
            <li>For a perfume&#x27;s top note, it is quite long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Not floral and refreshing.</li>
            <li>many times&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>and then you come back, the room is filled with very good Jasmine smell.</li>
            <li>So far do good though.</li>
            <li>I have AC&#x27;s undiluted jasmine absolute and love it.</li>
            <li>The jojoba oil, being a liquid wax, is quite good as a preservative for essential oil.</li>
            <li>Some other jasmine oils may be a bit more festive and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This so strong that it cannot be worn directly from the bottle.</li>
            <li>tub of pure coconut oil that I slather on, pure sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Jasmine because of my favorite perfume from way back.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought this oil at my local whole foods and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I naturally love the smell of Jasmine and this oil essential</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of home remedy and meditation, this one is for you (especially if you also love Jasmine).</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many benefits using this king of flower (as rose the queen of flower) mentally and physically.</li>
            <li>I have been using Aura Cacia Jasmine Absolute for many years, however, I use it differently than what I&#x27;ve read in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the carrier oil is jojoba, it is a &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; or light oil, which isn&#x27;t absorbed as deeply as a &amp;#34;mid&amp;#34; like coconut or &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34;, like shea.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is very natural, imposing floral (not heavy), a bit creamy (not sharp), with a hint of citrus and green undertone... very pleasant indeed.</li>
            <li>enjoyed telling several of my friends, both white and women of color (those of us with natural hair have to use natural products to maintain length) and it seems to have the same effect on all three hair types (mine is straight with a bit of wave, medium fine but thick)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too heavy for my medium fine hair, for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a natural jasmine scent without being perfumy, but rather, smells quite like the Confederate jasmine that grows over my fence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given how pricey jasmine is, I was surprised at its strength.</li>
            <li>even though I&#x27;m not in to aromatherapy or oil burners, I do use this exclusively and frequently and spend pretty much my whole life within a few inches of it</li>
            <li>After washing my hair, I use a bit of shea and jojoba mixed and twice a week, I use the jojoba only (on dry hair) to keep my hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had leaked all over the package and was only half full.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers complained about being rancid or urine-smell, which is nowhere near the true scent of this oil.</li>
            <li>The scent is not very impressive right from the bottle, but warms on the skin and smells delicate and lovely after a bit.</li>
            <li>Perhaps their oil is unfortunately exposed to light, oxidation, or old age.</li>

            <li> a beautiful scent I would truly recommend it. Very happy</li>
            <li> Would have given it a 5 because it smells amazing, but it arrived with the cap not on securely. It had leaked all over the package and was only half full.</li>
            <li> Very nice Jas fragrance and NOT diluted.  Along with a million unfinished projects I have going on, now I&#x27;m experimenting with lip treatments (something mellow that doesn&#x27;t make chapped lips feel worse, little this, little amaretto, little anise - good flavors).  Air sprays with home made lemon or lime oils - mint leaves tuned into mulch.  2 lb. tub of pure coconut oil that I slather on, pure sweet almond oil.  I bought the Jasmine because of my favorite perfume from way back.  Love&#x27;s Musky Jasmine.  A smear of Jasmine with a squirt of Musk and it&#x27;s a light, lingering reminder!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this oil at my local whole foods and it smells great. It&#x27;s sweet without being overpowering and has no chemical or bad odor as mentioned by some reviewers.

While I feel this jasmine could be slightly stronger, I can still smell the jasmine even mixed with 3 other oils.

            <li> The scent is not very impressive right from the bottle, but warms on the skin and smells delicate and lovely after a bit.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but very very light.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I naturally love the smell of Jasmine and this oil essential does a good job of providing its smell. However, my only complaint is that its smell is not quite Jasmine&#x27;s. When you put this oil essential into an oil diffuser, the smell it gives out is quite nasty at first. However, if you leave for a couple hour and then you come back, the room is filled with very good Jasmine smell. You can put this oil essential on your skin or your face to have it further moistened, which was what I did for a while. It runs out quite fast if you put it on your skin everyday though. Anyway, would totally recommend it to a friend. If you are a fan of home remedy and meditation, this one is for you (especially if you also love Jasmine).</li>
            <li> Arrive on time,  very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this has no resemblance to Jasmine.  I doubt if I will use this bottle.  Tried it twice in a diffuser and it makes the room smell horrible.  I love the smell of Jasmine - I have some Jasmine deoderant and this smells nothing like that.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This so strong that it cannot be worn directly from the bottle. Given how pricey jasmine is, I was surprised at its strength. I will dilute it further since I wanted to wear it as a body perfume.</li>
            <li> The other scent in this overpowers the jasmine.</li>
            <li> A little on the weak side.</li>
            <li> Everything was great !!!! Love the oil</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have AC&#x27;s undiluted jasmine absolute and love it. I bought this version in jojoba oil as a gift. Some reviewers complained about being rancid or urine-smell, which is nowhere near the true scent of this oil. Perhaps their oil is unfortunately exposed to light, oxidation, or old age. The jojoba oil, being a liquid wax, is quite good as a preservative for essential oil. Some reviewers complained &amp;#34;too strong&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;too weak&amp;#34;... perhaps it is subjective. To my nose, applying one drop to my arm, last about 5 hours with detectable scent still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its fragrance is very natural, imposing floral (not heavy), a bit creamy (not sharp), with a hint of citrus and green undertone... very pleasant indeed. For a perfume&#x27;s top note, it is quite long-lasting. Some other jasmine oils may be a bit more festive and sophisticated. This oil is not quite as such, just a quiet, euphoric note all the way. It is a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many benefits using this king of flower (as rose the queen of flower) mentally and physically. With a heavenly scent like this, who wouldn&#x27;t be happy?</li>
            <li> It smells horrible. Not floral and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Product arrived frozen. Defrosted it smelled terrible. Don&#x27;t know if that made the difference. I have used Aura Cacia many times&lt;br /&gt;and I am very happy with the product. Don&#x27;t understand what happened with the Jasmine. Smells nothing like Jasmine.</li>
            <li> A little longer to receive than expected but it had to come across the country</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t overly sold on the scent. Strictly my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very strong oil.  I expect wonderful things from it.</li>
