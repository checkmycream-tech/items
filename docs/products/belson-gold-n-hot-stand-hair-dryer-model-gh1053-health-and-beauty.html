    <ol>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED!!!</li>
            <li>the best thing I&#x27;ve treated myself to this year.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent portable hair dryer for use around the salon.  </li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I chose this raiting because the product is absolutly awesome.</li>
            <li>It performed beautifully for the majority of the time.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is great for my long-curly hair.</li>
            <li>and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is probably good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the stand up dryers I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Go with this one for sure!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this dryer at first for an at home use dryer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe it as luke warm.  </li>
            <li>They arrived the day after I purchased them, a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>and I paid another $21.00 more than is now advertised.</li>
            <li>Not noisy when on, warm and comfortable air flow.</li>
            <li>is way more sturdy, ability to adjust the hood to a greater extent to your liking.</li>
            <li>I love it-</li>
            <li>I will never buy another Belson and will opt for a better dryer recommended by a Hair Salon.</li>
            <li>This product does what it claims my hair is frizz free in a fraction of the time and is able to maintain a frizz free status in the most humid environment of south Florida.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to put together.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium /long - fine, curly....  </li>
            <li>The two different speeds are great as well</li>
            <li>so this dryer is great for deep conditioners too!</li>
            <li>Gold n Hot needs to make better equipment.  </li>
            <li>and they told me that I had to ship it to them (at my own expense) to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and comfortable to sit under.  </li>
            <li>My hair is highlighted, and damaged, so I wanted a way to put light curl in it without too much heat or more damage.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had it for a full 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because it was a belson and usually Belson is a very good quality product.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for a gift , person has been using it every sine they recieved the hair dryer, gets very hot just what it was bought for.</li>
            <li>The client does not even have to leave the chair, the unit can be rolled out to where they are and this powerful hair dryer can be brought to them.</li>
            <li>They get hot quickly, keep an eye on your clients.  </li>
            <li>I put large velcro rollers, and sit under this hairdryer while on the computer, and 1 hour later - perfect dry hair.  </li>
            <li>But now, it doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore.  </li>
            <li>I used it once a month for six months and it just stopped getting hot.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT get hot anymore.  </li>
            <li>And is much easier on my arm!</li>
            <li>I would totally recoment to those of you who want to take care of your hair and keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this dryer I wanted to have the convenience of bonnet style hair drying in my home at odd hours what I did not expect was AMAZING SALON QUALITY RESULTS FAST!</li>
            <li>This one is hotter, has more setting options (ion, high, low),</li>
            <li>It would be better if it had a medium heat/fan setting, because basically the low and high are functioning as heat on or off for me.  </li>
            <li>The dryer works good enough on the low fan / high heat setting.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s  might be the one I purchased because the one I tested in the local Sally&#x27;s store was fine.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if the stand adjusted a little taller too.  </li>
            <li>If I turn the fan up to high, the heat gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li>I had seen another hair dryer which I really should have gotten instead.</li>
            <li>This dryer seemed promising</li>
            <li>If anyone know how to fix this without sending it back(cost to much to ship)please let me know.  </li>
            <li>Thanks in advance.</li>
            <li>But that is because it is producing so much air</li>
            <li>At first it ran only on high, but then I heard a snap and smelled an electrical burning smell and quickly switched it off and unplugged it for fear of fire.  </li>
            <li>Low heat is too cool.  </li>
            <li>It has a wide opening for clients with a head full of foils with room to spare!</li>
            <li>This dryer is of decent quality</li>
            <li>This makes less curl - a straighted effect - (without a hot iron straightener) with the jumbo rollers, and they do fit under this dryer....</li>
            <li>I probably would not buy this product again, I would look for one that has a few more heat/fan options, nor would I recommend my friends buy it either.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair much faster than me standing in front of a mirror with a hand-held dryer with a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li>It is loud - I wear ear-plugs when I use it.</li>
            <li>I like it so much, that I intend to buy another one for my second home.</li>
            <li>I have used this several times now to dry my shoulder length+ naturally curly hair.  </li>

            <li> but after about 10 uses it just stopped working for no apparent reason at all.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to get it for my house since I swim a lot and need to dry my hair under the dryer.</li>
            <li> so my hair will dry faster.</li>
            <li> They are really two, one too hot and the other too cold.  </li>
            <li> and I was unable to use it until I returned from a trip on which I was going to take along as I had special assignments that required impecable hair-do&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a bit awkward and top heavy.</li>
            <li> Not as noisy whatsoever as a handheld dryer and the air comes from up and around so that your entire head of hair is equally dried in maybe 20 minutes.    </li>
            <li> so I spent 100 on it.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent...</li>
            <li> I plan to contact the company and discuss warranty options to see if I can get some type of remedy, but am not very hopeful.  </li>
            <li> This lets you do other things while drying hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after my Babyliss Rollabout Hooded Dryer decided to give out on me after less than a year of use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s either too hot or too cold to my liking.</li>
            <li> This is a little on the pricey side for it to break so soon.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair too and no patience for holding a hand-held dryer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Futher the shipment arrived late</li>
            <li> so angry that I spent my $100.00</li>
            <li> Anyway, it has a 2 yr warranty, so if anything goes wrong, I will return it.</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed in the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed with this dryer.  </li>

            <li> I have very thick hair too and no patience for holding a hand-held dryer. This lets you do other things while drying hair. Not as noisy whatsoever as a handheld dryer and the air comes from up and around so that your entire head of hair is equally dried in maybe 20 minutes.    Beware of shipping fees. Cost me $49.00 and I paid another $21.00 more than is now advertised.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer.  Dries hair quickly and comfortable to sit under.  Only issue is that it&#x27;s a bit noisey.  I think it&#x27;s  might be the one I purchased because the one I tested in the local Sally&#x27;s store was fine.  Anyway, it has a 2 yr warranty, so if anything goes wrong, I will return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for myself as a Christmas present a year ago.  It performed beautifully for the majority of the time.  But now, it doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore.  I&#x27;d describe it as luke warm.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Wife used product on my hair for a scalp treatment. Works well. Would fall asleep under the Hair Dryer... Not noisy when on, warm and comfortable air flow. Will write further reviews on how long product holds up to repeat use.</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to hooded hair dryers. I bought this one after my Babyliss Rollabout Hooded Dryer decided to give out on me after less than a year of use. This one is hotter, has more setting options (ion, high, low), is way more sturdy, ability to adjust the hood to a greater extent to your liking. Go with this one for sure!</li>
            <li> I have used this several times now to dry my shoulder length+ naturally curly hair.  The dryer works good enough on the low fan / high heat setting.  If I turn the fan up to high, the heat gets way too hot.  Low heat is too cool.  It would be better if it had a medium heat/fan setting, because basically the low and high are functioning as heat on or off for me.  Would be nice if the stand adjusted a little taller too.  I probably would not buy this product again, I would look for one that has a few more heat/fan options, nor would I recommend my friends buy it either.</li>
            <li> This dryer has for legs to support the dryer the two of the legs keep fell off every 10 hours.after one week I return and I need to pay my shipping and Elephant Deal they just refund 76.91,but I did pay 107.89 and now they put the dryer on the Market again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the stand up dryers I purchased.  They do the job. They get hot quickly, keep an eye on your clients.  They arrived the day after I purchased them, a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer for processing color at my salon and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It has a wide opening for clients with a head full of foils with room to spare! The two different speeds are great as well and it was easy to put together. VERY PLEASED!!!</li>
            <li> This dryer is probably good. I never used it because I couldn&#x27;t get it to assemble. I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I love it- My hair is highlighted, and damaged, so I wanted a way to put light curl in it without too much heat or more damage.  I put large velcro rollers, and sit under this hairdryer while on the computer, and 1 hour later - perfect dry hair.  My hair is medium /long - fine, curly....  This makes less curl - a straighted effect - (without a hot iron straightener) with the jumbo rollers, and they do fit under this dryer....</li>
            <li> The five temperature controls threw me off.  They are really two, one too hot and the other too cold.  I have to place my head almost at the rim of the dryer not to burn my scalp.  I had seen another hair dryer which I really should have gotten instead. Futher the shipment arrived late and I was unable to use it until I returned from a trip on which I was going to take along as I had special assignments that required impecable hair-do&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has this at her home salon. So I decided to get it for my house since I swim a lot and need to dry my hair under the dryer. I am also African American so this dryer is great for deep conditioners too!</li>
            <li> This dryer seemed promising so I spent 100 on it.  I used it once a month for six months and it just stopped getting hot.  I called the manufacture since I was within its one year warranty period and they told me that I had to ship it to them (at my own expense) to get a new one.  Not sure how much shipping will be but I since lost my receipt so I cant even send it back.  Im very disappointed in the dryer.  Gold n Hot needs to make better equipment.  Im so angry that I spent my $100.00 and they would even pay for shipping to fix thier crappy dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this product or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this dryer I wanted to have the convenience of bonnet style hair drying in my home at odd hours what I did not expect was AMAZING SALON QUALITY RESULTS FAST! This product does what it claims my hair is frizz free in a fraction of the time and is able to maintain a frizz free status in the most humid environment of south Florida. Money well spent...the best thing I&#x27;ve treated myself to this year.</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed with this dryer.  I received it as a gift nine months ago.  I always wanted one.  I use it every week.  It does NOT get hot anymore.  I will not buy this product again. If anyone know how to fix this without sending it back(cost to much to ship)please let me know.  Thanks in advance.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a gift , person has been using it every sine they recieved the hair dryer, gets very hot just what it was bought for.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this dryer at first for an at home use dryer but after about 10 uses it just stopped working for no apparent reason at all.  I plan to contact the company and discuss warranty options to see if I can get some type of remedy, but am not very hopeful.  It should not just quit on me.  I haven&#x27;t even had it for a full 6 months.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great for my long-curly hair. It allows me to check my e-mail, do online banking, read a book, or eat breakfast all while my hair is drying. I appreciate that it has multiple heat settings and ions. It dries my hair much faster than me standing in front of a mirror with a hand-held dryer with a diffuser attachment. And is much easier on my arm! It is loud - I wear ear-plugs when I use it. But that is because it is producing so much air so my hair will dry faster.</li>
            <li> This dryer is of decent quality but it&#x27;s either too hot or too cold to my liking. I can&#x27;t seem to get it to the proper setting. Also, it&#x27;s a bit awkward and top heavy.</li>
            <li> Just as the warranty expired, the fan switch burned out.  At first it ran only on high, but then I heard a snap and smelled an electrical burning smell and quickly switched it off and unplugged it for fear of fire.  I will never buy another Belson and will opt for a better dryer recommended by a Hair Salon.</li>
            <li> It works.  It shipped as advertised.  Heats up and dries faster than the professionals do.  I would reccommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent portable hair dryer for use around the salon.  The client does not even have to leave the chair, the unit can be rolled out to where they are and this powerful hair dryer can be brought to them. Excellent!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it was a belson and usually Belson is a very good quality product.  I used it once and it worked great.  When I tried to use it again 30 days later it broke.  This is a little on the pricey side for it to break so soon.  Would definitely not recommend to purchase.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is perfect for me. With it on a stand, I can sit under it just like in a salon. I does take up space, but I keep it in a spare closet. I like it so much, that I intend to buy another one for my second home.</li>
            <li> I chose this raiting because the product is absolutly awesome. Heats up well, comfrtable to use and move around. the fact that its adjustable to different heights rocks. I would totally recoment to those of you who want to take care of your hair and keep it healthy. No blowdriers.</li>
