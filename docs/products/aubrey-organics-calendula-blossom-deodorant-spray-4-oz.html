    <ol>
            <li>I was hoping it smelled like this chamomile/calendula diaper ointment I have that smells awesome.  </li>
            <li>The smell is the best part of it!!!</li>
            <li>This works great and with no chemicals!!!!  </li>
            <li>I figured this would be a great alternative to use during the six weeks.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I smelled not so great.</li>
            <li>I have to apply it more than I would like to but its great!!</li>
            <li>Good for the winter but didn&#x27;t like its smell</li>
            <li>It works fairly well</li>
            <li>But it does keep me from being a stinky hippie, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>But make sure you smell this before you purchase!  </li>
            <li>i love this product, its fir men version is just as good and the smell is quite nice, too.</li>
            <li>I liked the list of ingredients but the \\&quot;nose\\&quot; didn&#x27;t deliver, I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice, but not too strong, fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s more appealing to me as a woman, but I haven&#x27;t found it in the deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that there are no harmful chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those who sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I have been using both products for about a month now, and am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I like this product better than most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants.</li>
            <li>I just love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and great.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am looking for healthy products.</li>
            <li>I love the more feminine scent but the men&#x27;s works so much better for me.</li>
            <li>I notice it&#x27;s not quite able to handle the job.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely smell.</li>
            <li>It took me about a week to get used to the strong--</li>
            <li>Still three stars because the product works fine in that it helps prevent and mask body odor.</li>
            <li>In fact my daughter, who is very allergic to alot of fragrances, liked it alot.  </li>
            <li>keep in mind that the primary antiperspirant is calamine.</li>
            <li>I have tried alot of natural deodorants and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews about this &amp; really wanted it to work, plus the EWG ratings were good.</li>
            <li>It lasts a very long time, has a very nice fragrance (not overpowering), and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>but the smell of the product is pretty strong</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re super concerned with your odor and sweat, this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>I have never not used a product because of its smell, this is a first!</li>
            <li>It kept me smelling fresh for all of an hour.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Thanks AO!</li>
            <li>I apply it only in the mornings on most days, and maybe once during the day on particularly warm or active days.     </li>
            <li>It is hard to find and I am glad to be able to order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It really works for me and my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell; it reminds me of lilac.</li>
            <li>I was driving on a cool morning, shortly after putting it on &amp; took a whiff (just because I like the smell!)</li>
            <li>usually I smell like a mix of calendula and sweat throughout the day which is actually nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong, too, so it is not easily ignored.</li>
            <li>at the same time in an effort to find a more natural replacement for the major name-brand anti-perspirant deodorants I had been using up to this point.</li>
            <li>B00014D5YI Aubrey Organics - E Plus High C Deodorant, 3 fl oz roll-on]]</li>
            <li>Also, as far as effectiveness goes, I&#x27;m much happier with the Weleda deodorant sprays....</li>
            <li>100% natural and works really well.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear deodorant because I don&#x27;t have offensive body odor.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t sweat at all this may work for you, but for us normal people it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love this product but it doesn&#x27;t last long having to keep reapplying .</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it was touted as being all natural.  </li>
            <li>So far no allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>Smell is natural.</li>
            <li>so if your natural odor is stronger than the herbs in this mix, your smell will break through as well.</li>
            <li>It holds down a full day of sweat with 10 stars.</li>
            <li>I just wish it could stay fresh a little longer...</li>
            <li>I know the ingredients are all natural but it smells a bit like public bathroom disinfectant to me.  </li>
            <li>I have read the other reviews and have to say that I didn&#x27;t think it had that much of a scent.  </li>

            <li> Yes, a little expensive but for those of us who must be careful with ingredients and scents it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few natural deodorants that actually work.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I normally do not sweat or have odor, even if I work out without deodorant.</li>
            <li> I really like it because it&#x27;s natural and it does not have any other weird ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has been years since I was able to lift my arm at the end of a day and not worry if I smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> Then, I worked out &amp; my underarms were wet.</li>
            <li> Keeps my pits smelling fresh without all the scary chemicals!</li>
            <li> I realize I should have been more careful in reading the ingredients, but was still very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was just looking for something flowery to wear because natural perfume is really hard to find and outrageously expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with the scent, although it does soften a little bit with time</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the patchouli, calamine(like that pink crap you put on chicken pox), and the wood oils are winning this war.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not thrilled about the scent.</li>
            <li> kinda)we both agree the smell is not good.  </li>
            <li> I hate that I have to go back to the pine</li>
            <li> I am usually not picky when it comes to scents, but this deodorant smells awful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after buying two bottles, my doctor said it contains alcohol which cannot be used on the radiated area.  </li>
            <li> It smells faintly of baby powder.</li>
            <li> So weird.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just a stinker.</li>
            <li> I gave mine to my husband, but even on him, the smell is bad enough to almost make me sick!</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does not stop you from sweating because it is not an anti-perspirant, but it does keep the bad odors under control.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It smells like bug spray :(  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed, but I may carry it around as a perfume spritz.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this deodorant several years ago after breaking out from &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products.  It lasts a very long time, has a very nice fragrance (not overpowering), and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  My son used it after coming home for a visit and forgetting his deodorant.  He ended up taking mine home with him.</li>
            <li> Good for the winter but didn&#x27;t like its smell</li>
            <li> i love this product, its fir men version is just as good and the smell is quite nice, too.</li>
            <li> This one lasted about 6 hours.  I hate that I have to go back to the pine smelling Aubrey but it&#x27;s the only one that seems to last.  I see Aubrey has another scent, city something, that&#x27;s more appealing to me as a woman, but I haven&#x27;t found it in the deodorant.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get the sprayer nozzle to work properly.</li>
            <li> I am usually not picky when it comes to scents, but this deodorant smells awful. The smell is very strong, too, so it is not easily ignored. I gave mine to my husband, but even on him, the smell is bad enough to almost make me sick! It works fairly well and I love the fact that there are no harmful chemicals in it. But make sure you smell this before you purchase!  I have never not used a product because of its smell, this is a first!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was touted as being all natural.  I am going through radiation for breast cancer and am not permitted to use an anti per-spirant or deodorant containing aluminum.  I figured this would be a great alternative to use during the six weeks.  Unfortunately, after buying two bottles, my doctor said it contains alcohol which cannot be used on the radiated area.  I realize I should have been more careful in reading the ingredients, but was still very disappointed.  Is the alcohol really necessary?</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of natural deodorants and this one is by far the best.  I have read the other reviews and have to say that I didn&#x27;t think it had that much of a scent.  In fact my daughter, who is very allergic to alot of fragrances, liked it alot.  It smells faintly of baby powder. It has been years since I was able to lift my arm at the end of a day and not worry if I smelled bad.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just got this product in the mail.  Sprayed some on, and the scent reminded me of Avon&#x27;s skin-so-soft mosquito repellant.  Not happy with the scent, although it does soften a little bit with time so I&#x27;ll give it a three.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.  It smells like bug spray :(  Definitely not what I had in mind.  I was hoping it smelled like this chamomile/calendula diaper ointment I have that smells awesome.  Unfortunately, the patchouli, calamine(like that pink crap you put on chicken pox), and the wood oils are winning this war.  My husband told me I should wash it off.  He was joking (kinda)we both agree the smell is not good.  I normally don&#x27;t wear deodorant because I don&#x27;t have offensive body odor.  I was just looking for something flowery to wear because natural perfume is really hard to find and outrageously expensive.  Essential oil it is...</li>
            <li> This is one of the few natural deodorants that actually work.&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent too</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this deodorant! I just wish it could stay fresh a little longer...that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Too bad. I liked the list of ingredients but the \\&quot;nose\\&quot; didn&#x27;t deliver, I just don&#x27;t like the smell. Also, as far as effectiveness goes, I&#x27;m much happier with the Weleda deodorant sprays....those are divine!</li>
            <li> It was okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those who sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant spray along with [[ASIN:B00014D5YI Aubrey Organics - E Plus High C Deodorant, 3 fl oz roll-on]] at the same time in an effort to find a more natural replacement for the major name-brand anti-perspirant deodorants I had been using up to this point. I have been using both products for about a month now, and am quite pleased.  It took me about a week to get used to the strong--though not unpleasant--smell of both of these products. This deodorant does not stop you from sweating because it is not an anti-perspirant, but it does keep the bad odors under control. I apply it only in the mornings on most days, and maybe once during the day on particularly warm or active days.     I have also tried Miessence Tahitian Breeze Roll-on Deodorant since I purchased this product, and I actually prefer the smell of the Aubrey Organics deodorants.  I cannot say the same about Aubrey Organics facial lotions/moisturizers. I had to give them away because of the overpowering scent and replace them with Miessence moisturizers. Go figure! It could be just personal preference for different scents.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants. No, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant. So sweating is part of the deal. But it does keep me from being a stinky hippie, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> I just love everything about this product. It really works for me and my super sensitive skin. I really like it because it&#x27;s natural and it does not have any other weird ingredients. It holds down a full day of sweat with 10 stars. Shipping was fast and great. The smell is the best part of it!!!</li>
            <li> i am allergic to deodorants even organic this is is the only thing i can use, i have used it for the lad 15 years. love it. CK</li>
            <li> This works great and with no chemicals!!!!  It also has a nice, but not too strong, fragrance.  It is hard to find and I am glad to be able to order it from Amazon.  P Pratt</li>
            <li> I use this product daily. It has a nice light fragrance. So far no allergic reactions. I am looking for healthy products.</li>
            <li> The have changed their formula and packaging, now the calendula deodorant does not work.</li>
            <li> I just got this product in the mail and I&#x27;m not thrilled about the scent. I know the ingredients are all natural but it smells a bit like public bathroom disinfectant to me.  I&#x27;m going to try to remedy this by adding some lavender essential oil to it but the smell of the product is pretty strong so I don&#x27;t know if it will work.  Still three stars because the product works fine in that it helps prevent and mask body odor.</li>
            <li> As described, will purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I like this spray.  I have to apply it more than I would like to but its great!! Thanks AO!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! It kept me smelling fresh for all of an hour. If you don&#x27;t sweat at all this may work for you, but for us normal people it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews about this &amp; really wanted it to work, plus the EWG ratings were good. I really like the smell; it reminds me of lilac. The smell faded after about 30 minutes, though. All downhill from there. I normally do not sweat or have odor, even if I work out without deodorant. But with this...it&#x27;s like it made me sweat &amp; smell! So weird. I was driving on a cool morning, shortly after putting it on &amp; took a whiff (just because I like the smell!) &amp; I smelled not so great. Then, I worked out &amp; my underarms were wet. Ack!! Never happened before. Really disappointed, but I may carry it around as a perfume spritz.</li>
            <li> flowery but not overpowering smell. doesn&#x27;t block sweat however it does block odor!!! 100% natural and works really well. lasts 12+ hours. I only wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love the more feminine scent but the men&#x27;s works so much better for me. I spray this on in the morning and by mid afternoon I notice it&#x27;s not quite able to handle the job. I guess I&#x27;m just a stinker.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it doesn&#x27;t last long having to keep reapplying . Smell is natural.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Yes, a little expensive but for those of us who must be careful with ingredients and scents it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It has a lovely smell. keep in mind that the primary antiperspirant is calamine. Ultimately, your sweat will break through this if you sweat moderately-heavily. Also keep in mind that there aren&#x27;t chemical deodorants here so if your natural odor is stronger than the herbs in this mix, your smell will break through as well. usually I smell like a mix of calendula and sweat throughout the day which is actually nice. If you&#x27;re super concerned with your odor and sweat, this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> Keeps my pits smelling fresh without all the scary chemicals!</li>
