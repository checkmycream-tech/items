            <li>Excellent product recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>So I decided that I would keep the one that works best and return the one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>

            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found for an infant and/or toddler.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product-</li>
            <li>Valuable size is very good.</li>
            <li>Great for Halloween costuming.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I stumbled upon it</li>
            <li>great on my skin as well.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s already tried it and it works great.</li>
            <li>Goes on great but doesn&#x27;t not stay well on the face.</li>
            <li>This is great for not getting burnt.</li>
            <li>This stuff has been great - NO outbreaks or irritation at all.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>This was great.</li>
            <li>Does a great job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit chalky and doesn&#x27;t absorb great</li>
            <li>so its great</li>
            <li>I especially love that it lacks that chemical smell most sunblocks have.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for most of this summer, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff is pleasant to wear.</li>
            <li>Good protection and no problems with rashes.</li>
            <li>It is a good sized bottle though.</li>
            <li>Offers excellent protection on me, and on my very fair skinned five and three year olds.</li>
            <li>I wish the smell were better but this is a great product.</li>
            <li>and I have many photos to prove it!</li>
            <li>Item arrived promptly and as described, couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li>that way I know for sure she&#x27;s covered!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out and will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>My favorite baby sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I bought one of their top rated brand!</li>
            <li>I have used and liked a baby sunblock before so when I saw this product I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I make my own sunscreen since I surf all the time</li>
            <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve found per ounce and on the larger 5 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a chalky residue but who cares if you get great sun protection.</li>
            <li>Absolute best for all kids!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>this is great and worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it is DEFINITELY more suitable for a baby if this is what your purchasing it for.</li>
            <li>Knock on wood and he has a very light complexion.</li>
            <li>To top it all off its made by Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Titanium</li>
            <li>We may not be able to finish before the expiration date.</li>
            <li>My wee one seems to do ok with this one and doesn&#x27;t break out, which I love.</li>
            <li>that she&#x27;s not allergic to, and, I&#x27;ve tried many, many kinds.  </li>
            <li>My all-time favorite sunscreen to use on the kids (everywhere</li>
            <li>We love and swear by everything they make.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It has kept baby sunburn free!  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love that this stuff is non greasy, we also have it in stick form for on the go touch ups.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product under the assumption that it was a safer option for my kids than most sunblocks.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Which is a lot since I&#x27;m out surfing most of the year.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face on top of my lotion during the day.</li>
            <li>This one is better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Great for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Baby doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it at all - just don&#x27;t apply to any body part like hands that baby will be sticking in their mouth to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for several years very successfully.  </li>
            <li>Great product for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Now not used,But it looks very good, I chose this physical sunscreen products for my baby, hoping to protect her</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and stinging with traditional face sunscreens</li>
            <li>Use it on my two year old and it works great.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by our pediatrician for our 6 month old and it did the job and well - easy to apply and great protection in and out of the water.</li>
            <li>I love this product, the price is great for the size, especially if you subscribe.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and protects baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Size is great as it actually lasts more than one week.  </li>
            <li>and I burn easily.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t smell and is easily applied.  </li>
            <li>It works great, feel good, and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen for people wanting a more natural product.</li>
            <li>Our dermatologist recommended this product as we spend our winters in AZ...hot strong sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Neutrogena Age Shield 110 SPF, which I would still use today if it weren&#x27;t so greasy with a strong fragrant smell.</li>
            <li>He is totally fine with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>For the body this was fine.</li>
            <li>But I just used it on my body and it was fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fragrance free, water resistant, paraben free, and dye free.</li>
            <li>And it does not have free return.</li>
            <li>We have been using this for several years now and it works great.  </li>
            <li>These are designed to absorb into your skin - oil-soluble, and react with UV light in a sacrificial process.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen on my face every day for the past decade, and I&#x27;m really impressed with this one.</li>
            <li>This product contains a lot of chemical compounds, which one of the first ingredient listed is called alumina that is also known as aluminum oxide which is also in deordant that is linked to cancer which many people try to avoid.</li>
            <li>If you are in doubt and want to try some products for first time use, make sure this is on your list.</li>
            <li>Keeps my 2 yr old safe from the sun!</li>
            <li>My baby has very light skin, so I was very concerned when we decided to travel to northeastern Brazil with her.</li>
            <li>Great sun protection, and, even better, it&#x27;s the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far for my daughter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena mix is full of chemicals and alcohol.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for children because it only has phisical sun blockers (Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide), so there is no risk of putting harmful chemical ingredients in your kids skin.</li>
            <li>I have free samples of this from the skin cancer surgeon that is treating me right now.</li>
            <li>My son has mild skin sensitivity, so I had to find something that wouldn&#x27;t make him break out and swell up.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit more pricey than standard sunscreens but compared to some brands out there that advertises for babies etc, this Neutrogena one came as the better value IMO.. &amp;#60;(^.^)&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally fragrance free lotion that feels nice</li>
            <li>Yes it costs more then generic but with fair skinned kids with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is a nice, convenient, easy to use sunscreen for young kids in particular.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;May be great for white skinned babies, but not, sadly for adults with a need for an absorbing sunscreen that won&#x27;t require ghost busters when you walk out the door.</li>
            <li>Be aware!</li>
            <li>Our children have never been burned when using this product and it does exactly what we hoped it would!  </li>
            <li>use Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby Sunscreen on faces.  </li>
            <li>Just being near most sun block causes my eyes to burn and tear (even those advertised as tearless).</li>
            <li>For me that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it really does a good job keeping the sun off and preventing not only sunburn but sun damage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind sunscreen being visible on my kids&#x27; skin, but I would rather have a nice even layer rather than white splotches here and there.</li>
            <li>Stopped using right away and cleared up.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right.</li>
            <li>This stick is convenient and easy to use; however you must use your fingers to completely rub it in.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle as well.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on your skin, no smell.  </li>
            <li>and it also kept my skin very well hydrated and moisturized!</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free, as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>so I tried it one more time and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li>I paid double the price for what I thought was a safe product.</li>
            <li>First inactive ingredient is alumina/alumina-</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that works great over a long time and won&#x27;t get in my eyes when I sweat in the heat.</li>
            <li>The bottle turning color is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this sunblock on my kids and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>He was outside for at most one hour.</li>
            <li>Safe to stay, I&#x27;ll be avoiding this in the future.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many baby sunscreens that claim they won&#x27;t sting but this is the only one that truly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It leaves a white finish though, so it is OK for kids that still do not care or notice this.</li>
            <li>First problem was that it isn&#x27;t sweat proof.  </li>
            <li>Very thick, perfect for sensitive baby skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife who is 1/2 Irish (fair skin) and never had any allergic reaction to any product, used this one day with only one application.</li>
            <li>dioxide sounds scary but is inert and non toxic, it&#x27;s also the most reflective substance on earth making it ideal for sunblock and white paint.</li>
            <li>No icky fragrance, my dermatologist recommended this one, and he was right.</li>
            <li>Goes on so easy for baby and definitely protects!</li>
            <li>A really handy feature of the same product is that it comes in a stick form; easy to carry with you and use without getting your hands messy.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using it, and starting to not hate sunscreen quite so much.</li>
            <li>This product is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>I really think these companies need to be fined for misleading  advertising.</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter may not be a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34;, but this works very well on her.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>apply this on my daughter&#x27;s face and legs as well as neck and arms every morning regardless of weather and reapply as needed which isn&#x27;t very often.</li>
            <li>and it applies very evenly with no stickiness afterwards.</li>
            <li>and this works very well with him.</li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t really been out in the sun to see if really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks allot Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>(My understanding is that the \\&quot;white stuff\\&quot; is what is so effective - rubbing it in is no big deal and helps you see where it goes!)  </li>
            <li>which is why I&#x27;ve tried so many other kinds of sunscreen, but, keep returning to this, because she&#x27;s not allergic to it on her face.  </li>
            <li>Price beats many, if not all, other sellers.</li>
            <li>So you need to be sure to spread it around on your face very carefully.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s only fair that you want extreme protection for your baby&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li>The most dangerous one is Methylisothiazolinone to which many people have severe allergies and a lot of them including me develop severe contact dermatitis to Methylisothiazolinone and all because manufacturers now put it into everything!</li>
            <li>Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me.</li>
            <li>I wear sun block daily and have used Neutrogena clear face breakout free for a while.</li>
            <li>Older kids may not like this.</li>
            <li>Make sure to reapply every 80 minutes - it doesn&#x27;t smell bad (has a very light scent to it that goes away quickly), doesn&#x27;t streak/run off with sweat or water.</li>
            <li>This sunblock has it all, high SPF, titanium dioxide, non comedogenic, and won&#x27;t sting eyes.</li>
            <li>She can use other kinds on her body, but, her face is so over the top sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy, absorbs well and stays on unlike a lot of other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunblock because I read that it would be gentle on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Even though this is a bit expensive, it seems to do a great job of protecting our skin.  </li>
            <li>He uses it more heavily than I do, and I use mine under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s better for you as the ingredients used are not as harsh as those that&#x27;s not made for babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new sunblock.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything against chemicals per se, but I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use anything scented.</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin but does not react to this, nor does he burn when wearing it.</li>
            <li>My husband has had problems with skin cancer and is very sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li>She was protected all day and even though her skin is very sensitive, it caused no reactions.</li>
            <li>Wish they made the formula in an adult version!</li>
            <li>Use it on my 6 year old and hubby too!</li>
            <li>it is better to be safe than sorry with the sun!</li>
            <li>It seems to be equivalent to the Sensitive Faces version in terms of sun protection and in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My 6 month old has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and my little one has yet to burn.</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find a baby safe sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Just wanted to clear up a misconception from someone&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li>My wife recently developed basil cell skin cancer.</li>
            <li>I called Neutrogena&#x27;s medical department to report my allergic reactions to this product (which required emergent oral and topical steroids), but they gave me very defensive responses and said that they &amp;#34;test their product for allergies.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sorry, but Methylisothiazolinone is not an uncommon allergy.</li>
            <li>Anyway, on a whim, I drove to Walgreens and bought this &amp;#34;Pure and Free&amp;#34; sunscreen and also bought the Walgreens brand Ology Sunscreen which is all natural and 50 SPF.</li>
            <li>you want a quality sunscreen, please, go drive to Walgreens or go online and buy their Ology natural sunscreen SPF 50</li>
            <li>Did prevent sunburn on a day at the zoo, used on my adult face, too, and it did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>I put Neutrogena Baby on my 13 month old every day before taking him to day care:</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Thought I would try baby version of sunscreen in order to skip the sun lotion smell of adult versions.</li>
            <li>would react so poorly on my old skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything but natural.</li>
            <li>I am a mom and try to use natural products on my children, I was at the store in the sunscreen isle for about an hour trying to find a natural sunscreen, once I came across this product I grabbed it and ran.</li>
            <li>I looked at the ingredients, which is everything but natural.</li>
            <li>My son has sensitive skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li>Ingredients: Alumina, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Beeswax (Apis Mellifera), Behenyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, BHT, Bisabolol, Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cetyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG 8 Laurate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root), Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexl Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Methicone, Methylisothiazolinone, Pantothenic Acid, PEG 100 Stearate, PEG 8, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polymethylmethacrylate, Polysorbate 60, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Potassium Sorbate, Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A), Silica, Stearic Acid, Styrene Acrylates Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Trisiloxane, Water, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen</li>
            <li>I like this product for my infant and three year old.  </li>
            <li>My 7 mth old hasn&#x27;t burned at all this summer...</li>
            <li>I use it as an adult</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ve learned and been told from certified medical experts that SPF 15 - 30 is all you really need.</li>
            <li>Zinc and Titanium Oxides are critical ingredients if you want real sunBLOCK.</li>
            <li>We applied it on her skin early in the morning and then every 2 or 3 hours.</li>
            <li>i thought the natural was a go.</li>
            <li>His neck was completely sun burned.</li>
            <li>My 2.5 year old prefers this than the tube sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I use it on sensitive adult skin.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say when she planed a trip to the Florida keys we had to get some good sunblock.</li>
            <li>but after finding out this brand rated poorly on the EWG website for hazardous Chemicals.</li>
            <li>but it stung a little when I put it on and didn&#x27;t feel as clean as this one does.</li>
            <li>You may notice it doesn&#x27;t completely disappear, but I&#x27;d much rather have a slightly white chalky completion than skin damage - especially for my children.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and white enough that you can tell where you&#x27;ve apllied as you go and rubs in nice.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried, it does go on thick and it does leave a bit of a white cast, but after a few minutes it&#x27;s almost all the way absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>I guess that just means it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job really well, but when it comes times to clean up it can be a bit tough.</li>
            <li>My kids are relatively patient, but they can&#x27;t sit still long enough for me to rub this lotion in thoroughly enough.&lt;br /&gt;After a month or so, the tube wouldn&#x27;t reliably stay closed, and I had to take extra precautions to make sure it didn&#x27;t spill inside the backpack.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind a little extra whiteness when the alternatives are full cover clothing or skin cancer which I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ALL about natural and hollistic everything, especially skin care.</li>
            <li>I had a similar reaction to Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunscreen.</li>
            <li>As a 40 year old if you hear the words irreversible skin damage, you can&#x27;t help but to want different for your kids.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before a beach trip last summer because my daughter had somewhat sensitive skin as a baby.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it seemed that my face/eye area reacted with this brand more than Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>I have a very white skinned baby with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I tell him we are doing his &amp;#34;face-paint&amp;#34;, nearly every morning if he is going outside.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s so thick and white, it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;ve applied it, so as not to miss any spots.  </li>
            <li>So the &amp;#34;alcohols&amp;#34; this product contains are emollient fatty compounds that have been altered slightly to make them mix better instead of separating into globs of oil.</li>
            <li>I put half of the Ology natural sunscreen on the left side of my face and this Neutrogena on my right, and after 5 minutes, the Neutrogena side was covered in white powder!</li>
            <li>I found a smaller version of this at other stores for the same price - totally not worth it especially when you can get more on Amazon.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s protecting our kids super pale skin!</li>
            <li>Tried using this sunscreen because it was one of the only store-brand/drugstore brands that only had the oxides since my skin is sensitive to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>For some reason, the Neutrogena Sensitive Sunblock is usually more expensive than this one even though they have identical formulations.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the second leading cause of dermatitis after Nickel metal (not sure if that&#x27;s true 100%).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile the left side with the natural product had a Very subtle white cast that was gone after I thoroughly massaged it some more</li>
            <li>Because of the white color, I use a different sunscreen on the rest of her body, because it&#x27;s only her face that is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The rest of chemicals in the mix is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver... Unbelievable.</li>
            <li>highly toxic to babies, neurotoxic and damaging in other ways as well.</li>
            <li>I have just purchased this exact same item at my local Giant Eagle Grocery Store where it was almost $5.00 less then it is here.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately their solubility, which makes them aesthetically appealing since they &amp;#34;disappear &amp;#34;, also means that they can accumulate and react in the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Zinc/titanium oxides are not absorbed by the body at all, and are nonreactive at STP, so they are much safer, but it may leave your skin looking ghost-like while you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I started noticing my skin getting red and itchy not long after I used it..</li>
            <li>It wears very well under makeup and leaves a less shiny finish than even the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer.</li>
            <li>I am an adult, and I usually get the Neutrogenia Faces Sensitive sunscreen, but one day I randomly decided to try out this kind instead</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you have sensitive skin, this is a winner, but, if you or your baby&#x27;s skin is not super sensitive, I would look to something else that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with white streaks.  </li>
            <li>This is a dangerous product full of chemicals nothing pure!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen seems to have good sun protection, but it is difficult to rub in because there are little lumps in it.</li>

            <li> Valuable size is very good.</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween costuming.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I stumbled upon it</li>
            <li> great on my skin as well.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s already tried it and it works great.</li>
            <li> Goes on great but doesn&#x27;t not stay well on the face.</li>
            <li> This is great for not getting burnt.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great - NO outbreaks or irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This was great.</li>
            <li> Does a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit chalky and doesn&#x27;t absorb great</li>
            <li> so its great</li>
            <li> I especially love that it lacks that chemical smell most sunblocks have.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for most of this summer, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this stuff is pleasant to wear.</li>
            <li> Good protection and no problems with rashes.</li>
            <li> It is a good sized bottle though.</li>
            <li> Offers excellent protection on me, and on my very fair skinned five and three year olds.</li>
            <li> I wish the smell were better but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> and I have many photos to prove it!</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and as described, couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> that way I know for sure she&#x27;s covered!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out and will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> My favorite baby sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I bought one of their top rated brand!</li>
            <li> I have used and liked a baby sunblock before so when I saw this product I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I make my own sunscreen since I surf all the time</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found per ounce and on the larger 5 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a chalky residue but who cares if you get great sun protection.</li>
            <li> Absolute best for all kids!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> this is great and worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it is DEFINITELY more suitable for a baby if this is what your purchasing it for.</li>
            <li> Knock on wood and he has a very light complexion.</li>
            <li> To top it all off its made by Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Titanium</li>
            <li> We may not be able to finish before the expiration date.</li>
            <li> My wee one seems to do ok with this one and doesn&#x27;t break out, which I love.</li>
            <li> that she&#x27;s not allergic to, and, I&#x27;ve tried many, many kinds.  </li>
            <li> My all-time favorite sunscreen to use on the kids (everywhere</li>
            <li> We love and swear by everything they make.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It has kept baby sunburn free!  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love that this stuff is non greasy, we also have it in stick form for on the go touch ups.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product under the assumption that it was a safer option for my kids than most sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Which is a lot since I&#x27;m out surfing most of the year.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face on top of my lotion during the day.</li>
            <li> This one is better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Baby doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it at all - just don&#x27;t apply to any body part like hands that baby will be sticking in their mouth to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years very successfully.  </li>
            <li> Great product for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Now not used,But it looks very good, I chose this physical sunscreen products for my baby, hoping to protect her</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and stinging with traditional face sunscreens</li>
            <li> Use it on my two year old and it works great.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by our pediatrician for our 6 month old and it did the job and well - easy to apply and great protection in and out of the water.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the price is great for the size, especially if you subscribe.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and protects baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Size is great as it actually lasts more than one week.  </li>
            <li> and I burn easily.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t smell and is easily applied.  </li>
            <li> It works great, feel good, and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen for people wanting a more natural product.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this product as we spend our winters in AZ...hot strong sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Neutrogena Age Shield 110 SPF, which I would still use today if it weren&#x27;t so greasy with a strong fragrant smell.</li>
            <li> He is totally fine with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> For the body this was fine.</li>
            <li> But I just used it on my body and it was fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fragrance free, water resistant, paraben free, and dye free.</li>
            <li> And it does not have free return.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for several years now and it works great.  </li>
            <li> These are designed to absorb into your skin - oil-soluble, and react with UV light in a sacrificial process.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen on my face every day for the past decade, and I&#x27;m really impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> This product contains a lot of chemical compounds, which one of the first ingredient listed is called alumina that is also known as aluminum oxide which is also in deordant that is linked to cancer which many people try to avoid.</li>
            <li> If you are in doubt and want to try some products for first time use, make sure this is on your list.</li>
            <li> Keeps my 2 yr old safe from the sun!</li>
            <li> My baby has very light skin, so I was very concerned when we decided to travel to northeastern Brazil with her.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection, and, even better, it&#x27;s the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far for my daughter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena mix is full of chemicals and alcohol.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for children because it only has phisical sun blockers (Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide), so there is no risk of putting harmful chemical ingredients in your kids skin.</li>
            <li> I have free samples of this from the skin cancer surgeon that is treating me right now.</li>
            <li> My son has mild skin sensitivity, so I had to find something that wouldn&#x27;t make him break out and swell up.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit more pricey than standard sunscreens but compared to some brands out there that advertises for babies etc, this Neutrogena one came as the better value IMO.. &amp;#60;(^.^)&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally fragrance free lotion that feels nice</li>
            <li> Yes it costs more then generic but with fair skinned kids with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is a nice, convenient, easy to use sunscreen for young kids in particular.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;May be great for white skinned babies, but not, sadly for adults with a need for an absorbing sunscreen that won&#x27;t require ghost busters when you walk out the door.</li>
            <li> Be aware!</li>
            <li> Our children have never been burned when using this product and it does exactly what we hoped it would!  </li>
            <li> use Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby Sunscreen on faces.  </li>
            <li> Just being near most sun block causes my eyes to burn and tear (even those advertised as tearless).</li>
            <li> For me that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it really does a good job keeping the sun off and preventing not only sunburn but sun damage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind sunscreen being visible on my kids&#x27; skin, but I would rather have a nice even layer rather than white splotches here and there.</li>
            <li> Stopped using right away and cleared up.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right.</li>
            <li> This stick is convenient and easy to use; however you must use your fingers to completely rub it in.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle as well.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on your skin, no smell.  </li>
            <li> and it also kept my skin very well hydrated and moisturized!</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free, as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> so I tried it one more time and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> I paid double the price for what I thought was a safe product.</li>
            <li> First inactive ingredient is alumina/alumina-</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that works great over a long time and won&#x27;t get in my eyes when I sweat in the heat.</li>
            <li> The bottle turning color is pretty neat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this sunblock on my kids and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> He was outside for at most one hour.</li>
            <li> Safe to stay, I&#x27;ll be avoiding this in the future.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many baby sunscreens that claim they won&#x27;t sting but this is the only one that truly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It leaves a white finish though, so it is OK for kids that still do not care or notice this.</li>
            <li> First problem was that it isn&#x27;t sweat proof.  </li>
            <li> Very thick, perfect for sensitive baby skin.  </li>
            <li> My wife who is 1/2 Irish (fair skin) and never had any allergic reaction to any product, used this one day with only one application.</li>
            <li> dioxide sounds scary but is inert and non toxic, it&#x27;s also the most reflective substance on earth making it ideal for sunblock and white paint.</li>
            <li> No icky fragrance, my dermatologist recommended this one, and he was right.</li>
            <li> Goes on so easy for baby and definitely protects!</li>
            <li> A really handy feature of the same product is that it comes in a stick form; easy to carry with you and use without getting your hands messy.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using it, and starting to not hate sunscreen quite so much.</li>
            <li> This product is very deceiving.</li>
            <li> I really think these companies need to be fined for misleading  advertising.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter may not be a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34;, but this works very well on her.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> apply this on my daughter&#x27;s face and legs as well as neck and arms every morning regardless of weather and reapply as needed which isn&#x27;t very often.</li>
            <li> and it applies very evenly with no stickiness afterwards.</li>
            <li> and this works very well with him.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t really been out in the sun to see if really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks allot Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> (My understanding is that the \\&quot;white stuff\\&quot; is what is so effective - rubbing it in is no big deal and helps you see where it goes!)  </li>
            <li> which is why I&#x27;ve tried so many other kinds of sunscreen, but, keep returning to this, because she&#x27;s not allergic to it on her face.  </li>
            <li> Price beats many, if not all, other sellers.</li>
            <li> So you need to be sure to spread it around on your face very carefully.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s only fair that you want extreme protection for your baby&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li> The most dangerous one is Methylisothiazolinone to which many people have severe allergies and a lot of them including me develop severe contact dermatitis to Methylisothiazolinone and all because manufacturers now put it into everything!</li>
            <li> Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me.</li>
            <li> I wear sun block daily and have used Neutrogena clear face breakout free for a while.</li>
            <li> Older kids may not like this.</li>
            <li> Make sure to reapply every 80 minutes - it doesn&#x27;t smell bad (has a very light scent to it that goes away quickly), doesn&#x27;t streak/run off with sweat or water.</li>
            <li> This sunblock has it all, high SPF, titanium dioxide, non comedogenic, and won&#x27;t sting eyes.</li>
            <li> She can use other kinds on her body, but, her face is so over the top sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy, absorbs well and stays on unlike a lot of other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunblock because I read that it would be gentle on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Even though this is a bit expensive, it seems to do a great job of protecting our skin.  </li>
            <li> He uses it more heavily than I do, and I use mine under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s better for you as the ingredients used are not as harsh as those that&#x27;s not made for babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my new sunblock.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything against chemicals per se, but I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use anything scented.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin but does not react to this, nor does he burn when wearing it.</li>
            <li> My husband has had problems with skin cancer and is very sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li> She was protected all day and even though her skin is very sensitive, it caused no reactions.</li>
            <li> Wish they made the formula in an adult version!</li>
            <li> Use it on my 6 year old and hubby too!</li>
            <li> it is better to be safe than sorry with the sun!</li>
            <li> It seems to be equivalent to the Sensitive Faces version in terms of sun protection and in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 6 month old has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and my little one has yet to burn.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a baby safe sunblock.  </li>
            <li> Just wanted to clear up a misconception from someone&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li> My wife recently developed basil cell skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I called Neutrogena&#x27;s medical department to report my allergic reactions to this product (which required emergent oral and topical steroids), but they gave me very defensive responses and said that they &amp;#34;test their product for allergies.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sorry, but Methylisothiazolinone is not an uncommon allergy.</li>
            <li> Anyway, on a whim, I drove to Walgreens and bought this &amp;#34;Pure and Free&amp;#34; sunscreen and also bought the Walgreens brand Ology Sunscreen which is all natural and 50 SPF.</li>
            <li> you want a quality sunscreen, please, go drive to Walgreens or go online and buy their Ology natural sunscreen SPF 50</li>
            <li> Did prevent sunburn on a day at the zoo, used on my adult face, too, and it did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> I put Neutrogena Baby on my 13 month old every day before taking him to day care:</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Thought I would try baby version of sunscreen in order to skip the sun lotion smell of adult versions.</li>
            <li> would react so poorly on my old skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything but natural.</li>
            <li> I am a mom and try to use natural products on my children, I was at the store in the sunscreen isle for about an hour trying to find a natural sunscreen, once I came across this product I grabbed it and ran.</li>
            <li> I looked at the ingredients, which is everything but natural.</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> Ingredients: Alumina, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Beeswax (Apis Mellifera), Behenyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, BHT, Bisabolol, Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cetyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG 8 Laurate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root), Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexl Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Methicone, Methylisothiazolinone, Pantothenic Acid, PEG 100 Stearate, PEG 8, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polymethylmethacrylate, Polysorbate 60, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Potassium Sorbate, Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A), Silica, Stearic Acid, Styrene Acrylates Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Trisiloxane, Water, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen</li>
            <li> I like this product for my infant and three year old.  </li>
            <li> My 7 mth old hasn&#x27;t burned at all this summer...</li>
            <li> I use it as an adult</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ve learned and been told from certified medical experts that SPF 15 - 30 is all you really need.</li>
            <li> Zinc and Titanium Oxides are critical ingredients if you want real sunBLOCK.</li>
            <li> We applied it on her skin early in the morning and then every 2 or 3 hours.</li>
            <li> i thought the natural was a go.</li>
            <li> His neck was completely sun burned.</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old prefers this than the tube sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I use it on sensitive adult skin.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say when she planed a trip to the Florida keys we had to get some good sunblock.</li>
            <li> but after finding out this brand rated poorly on the EWG website for hazardous Chemicals.</li>
            <li> but it stung a little when I put it on and didn&#x27;t feel as clean as this one does.</li>
            <li> You may notice it doesn&#x27;t completely disappear, but I&#x27;d much rather have a slightly white chalky completion than skin damage - especially for my children.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and white enough that you can tell where you&#x27;ve apllied as you go and rubs in nice.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried, it does go on thick and it does leave a bit of a white cast, but after a few minutes it&#x27;s almost all the way absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> I guess that just means it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job really well, but when it comes times to clean up it can be a bit tough.</li>
            <li> My kids are relatively patient, but they can&#x27;t sit still long enough for me to rub this lotion in thoroughly enough.&lt;br /&gt;After a month or so, the tube wouldn&#x27;t reliably stay closed, and I had to take extra precautions to make sure it didn&#x27;t spill inside the backpack.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a little extra whiteness when the alternatives are full cover clothing or skin cancer which I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ALL about natural and hollistic everything, especially skin care.</li>
            <li> I had a similar reaction to Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As a 40 year old if you hear the words irreversible skin damage, you can&#x27;t help but to want different for your kids.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before a beach trip last summer because my daughter had somewhat sensitive skin as a baby.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seemed that my face/eye area reacted with this brand more than Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> I have a very white skinned baby with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I tell him we are doing his &amp;#34;face-paint&amp;#34;, nearly every morning if he is going outside.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s so thick and white, it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;ve applied it, so as not to miss any spots.  </li>
            <li> So the &amp;#34;alcohols&amp;#34; this product contains are emollient fatty compounds that have been altered slightly to make them mix better instead of separating into globs of oil.</li>
            <li> I put half of the Ology natural sunscreen on the left side of my face and this Neutrogena on my right, and after 5 minutes, the Neutrogena side was covered in white powder!</li>
            <li> I found a smaller version of this at other stores for the same price - totally not worth it especially when you can get more on Amazon.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s protecting our kids super pale skin!</li>
            <li> Tried using this sunscreen because it was one of the only store-brand/drugstore brands that only had the oxides since my skin is sensitive to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the Neutrogena Sensitive Sunblock is usually more expensive than this one even though they have identical formulations.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the second leading cause of dermatitis after Nickel metal (not sure if that&#x27;s true 100%).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile the left side with the natural product had a Very subtle white cast that was gone after I thoroughly massaged it some more</li>
            <li> Because of the white color, I use a different sunscreen on the rest of her body, because it&#x27;s only her face that is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The rest of chemicals in the mix is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver... Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> highly toxic to babies, neurotoxic and damaging in other ways as well.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased this exact same item at my local Giant Eagle Grocery Store where it was almost $5.00 less then it is here.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately their solubility, which makes them aesthetically appealing since they &amp;#34;disappear &amp;#34;, also means that they can accumulate and react in the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Zinc/titanium oxides are not absorbed by the body at all, and are nonreactive at STP, so they are much safer, but it may leave your skin looking ghost-like while you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I started noticing my skin getting red and itchy not long after I used it..</li>
            <li> It wears very well under makeup and leaves a less shiny finish than even the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer.</li>
            <li> I am an adult, and I usually get the Neutrogenia Faces Sensitive sunscreen, but one day I randomly decided to try out this kind instead</li>
            <li> Bottom line, if you have sensitive skin, this is a winner, but, if you or your baby&#x27;s skin is not super sensitive, I would look to something else that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with white streaks.  </li>
            <li> This is a dangerous product full of chemicals nothing pure!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen seems to have good sun protection, but it is difficult to rub in because there are little lumps in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the lotion is too thick to be absorbed or something.</li>
            <li> My three year old reacted to other sunscreens with huge red hives that were worse than a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I applied it to my 4 month old son and it was extremely clumpy.  </li>
            <li> My one year old is still as pale as paper, but since I forgot to put sunscreen on myself last time, I am red as a lobster.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times so far, but it is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is sort of thick and needs to be rubbed in very well to get rid of the white hue.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, advertised a as &amp;#34;2 of Neutrogena Pure and Free baby sunscreen&amp;#34; but only received one tube.</li>
            <li> But when it comes down to natural sunscreens, there are few and far between that</li>
            <li> its a little thick, kind of hard to apply to a wiggly infant.</li>
            <li> My entire chest, stomach, hands, are covered in little tiny red bumps.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad of a sunscreen although it could have been more sheer for daily wear.</li>
            <li> I can use it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange.</li>
            <li> , it takes a long time for it to rub in,</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and this in one of the few sunscreens I can tolerate.  </li>
            <li> In our experience over several months/year ~ there is a slight haze of residue left when used.  </li>
            <li> The only thing about it is that is leaves a bit of a ghostly look due to the whiteness of the zinc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick though and seems to leave a white layer over her skin no matter how much I try to rub it in....</li>
            <li> It absorbs and leaves skin dry verses oily.  </li>
            <li> Do not purchase this item as it is 2009 formulation which has quite a few major concerns if you check out, e.g. EWG.</li>
            <li> This lotion is actually highly toxic and NOT safe at all!  </li>
            <li> and my skin was also DRY!</li>
            <li> All other sunscreens, even the natural ones sold at Whole Foods make her nose run like a faucet and eyes turn red, and she is unbearably unhappy.  </li>
            <li> Second problem was that I developed pretty bad heat rashes due to the sunscreen blocking up my pores.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful of what I use on my skin, or I will get rashes or blisters.  </li>
            <li> My window of opportunity to return it has also closed because I didn&#x27;t check the expiration date when I received it and just put it in our bathroom closet.  </li>
            <li> Anything over 30 is redundant as a 40/50/60 etc provides the same protection as a 30.</li>
            <li> One minus</li>
            <li> Even when rubbed in entirely ~ you still see a slight haze!  </li>
            <li> #34;natural source&amp;#34; meaning the sun protection is naturally source but doesn&#x27;t mean the remaining ingredients are.</li>
            <li> which for me is a bit too long when you have squirmy toddlers on your hands who can care less about sun protection.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients are great, it&#x27;s the boatload of &amp;#34;other stuff&amp;#34; that makes it horrible.</li>
            <li> I got this for my two young children who have pretty bad eczema.</li>
            <li> Careful though as a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I developed a painful rash on my face.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t care ~ and know that, that haze, is actually protecting our little ones face, ears, and neck!  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other sunscreen on my babies.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen itself isn&#x27;t greasy or oily like some other sunscreens out there</li>
            <li> Lots of other brands make my babies eyes burn</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;cheap Irish skin&amp;#34; and usually try to use products I know</li>
            <li> I applied this to my skin 5 days ago and still can&#x27;t go a day without taking an anti histamine due to how severe my reaction was.</li>
            <li> other sunscreens are a class of chemical sunblocks - avobenzone, oxybenzone, PABA, et al.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide (4.9%), Zinc Oxide (4.7%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive</li>
            <li> , it leaves quite a bit of a white film over your kid, and it&#x27;s hard to wash off in the tub.  </li>
            <li> It was even the common allergen of the year recently</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen for cosmetic reasons - to reduce the risk of dark spots and freckles and to reduce the risk of scarring on my face.</li>
            <li> But keep it in a dark place.</li>
            <li> is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> At least we got our money back.</li>
            <li> Previously I used Bullfrog sunblock containing titanium dioxide, but found it has the tendency to run into your eyes when perspiring and stings.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind these ingredients, i recommend buying the cheaper brands that come from triple the size for less money.</li>
            <li> If you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that...</li>
            <li> and it takes less than a handful of organic ingredients</li>
            <li> Why would anyone put alcohol on their skin is beyond me less alone on their baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Being of Irish descent, it&#x27;s been an evil necessity for most of my life, and I accepted the burning/stinging feeling of sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li> Especially bad in rougher, more pigmented areas of skin where the white does not go away.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is slightly thicker than chemical screens.</li>
            <li> sunscreen sells for $9.99 for 3 oz and $13.99 for 5 oz at Target, so Amazon&#x27;s prices are slightly cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is a little cheaper than California Baby</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a spray bottle!</li>
            <li> ........and recommended it to us and all of her little patients.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to completely rub it into the skin...</li>
            <li> The next day she wound up with a horrible reaction of huge 2-3&amp;#34; hives, redness, rash, heat and lots of itching witg lost sleep for about 6 days.</li>
            <li> (I think it was a few dollars cheaper).</li>
            <li> I use a lot of physical sunscreens and this is the worse.  </li>
            <li> So Cal means sunblock year round.</li>
            <li> It does leave a thin film of white but that did not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Which is why they exhort people to reapply every few hours.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a pain to apply, leaving your skin all white, it also received poor product quality and safety reviews largely due to dangerous ingredients.  </li>
            <li> There are other lotions that aren&#x27;t labelled natural that aren&#x27;t as bad as this one.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for my kids&#x27; comfort.</li>
            <li> No sunscreen out there came close to this one from Neutrogena according to not just our pediatrician, but also dermatologists and our friends who work in the clinical field that oversees some of the most disgusting things that our environment can have on our skins.</li>
            <li> No more headaches from perfume in my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is very thick but it doesn&#x27;t feel as sticky or greasy as some other sunscreen I have used.</li>
            <li> Creamy, and not too hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Hard to disappear.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that reacts badly to chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Like all physical sunblocks, it does give a faint white cast, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Methylisothiazolinone is a relatively common allergen, so test this before using it all over your body.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin but was shocked a lotion for baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but when I do not have time, I look for a mix with the least amount of ingredients, all in organic form mix which will at least keep me away from hospitals.</li>
            <li> Some parents fear what chemical products may do to their childrens skin, while other parents hate the &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34; appearance physical sunscreen products leave on</li>
            <li> Not only is it the chalkiest, messiest one I&#x27;ve ever used, it doesn&#x27;t blend well and leaves horrible white streaks on your skin and rubs off on everything.  </li>
            <li> Seriously go pick it up</li>
            <li> Traditional sunscreens were causing them to have bad outbreaks, even when we washed it off as soon as we got home from the pool.</li>
            <li> My son gets bad rashes from almost every single sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Normal sunscreen always gives me a terrible rash</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and this made me break out in an AWFUL rash on both my arms.  </li>
            <li> I used this all summer with my 3 boys, and never once did it fail me.  </li>
            <li> This is my go to product to protect my skin and expensive tattoos.</li>
            <li> It was the worst rash I ever had in 20+ years of daily sunblock on my face.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days had horrible white splotches and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and this leaves a white residue/cast on my skin which I hate!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I hate that,</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not even the worst part.  </li>
            <li> Your life will become a living hell as this dangerous chemical is even in paint!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just being near most sun block causes my eyes to burn and tear (even those advertised as tearless). I can apply Neutrogena to my face with no worries. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I used this all summer with my 3 boys, and never once did it fail me.  I even forgot to occasionally reapply, but never once did my kid end up with a sunburn (unless I missed a spot).  Just use liberally all over, and your kid will be well protected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is, it leaves quite a bit of a white film over your kid, and it&#x27;s hard to wash off in the tub.  I guess that just means it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job really well, but when it comes times to clean up it can be a bit tough.</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween costuming. You will look like a ghost for hours after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be great for white skinned babies, but not, sadly for adults with a need for an absorbing sunscreen that won&#x27;t require ghost busters when you walk out the door.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and my little one has yet to burn. I especially love that it lacks that chemical smell most sunblocks have. Careful though as a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My wife recently developed basil cell skin cancer. Needless to say when she planed a trip to the Florida keys we had to get some good sunblock. She came home from Florida after using their product with no sunburn and almost no tan, and this is after snorkeling, swimming and spending the majority of time outdoors. Previously I used Bullfrog sunblock containing titanium dioxide, but found it has the tendency to run into your eyes when perspiring and stings. This sunblock has it all, high SPF, titanium dioxide, non comedogenic, and won&#x27;t sting eyes. To top it all off its made by Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Titanium dioxide sounds scary but is inert and non toxic, it&#x27;s also the most reflective substance on earth making it ideal for sunblock and white paint.</li>
            <li> Valuable size is very good. I can use it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a baby safe sunblock.  This is the best one and doesn&#x27;t irritate my 1 yo kids skin.  Recommended</li>
            <li> I am an adult, and I usually get the Neutrogenia Faces Sensitive sunscreen, but one day I randomly decided to try out this kind instead (I think it was a few dollars cheaper). It seems to be equivalent to the Sensitive Faces version in terms of sun protection and in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years very successfully.  Good protection and no problems with rashes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  My son has never burnt with it on, even after 4+ hours in sun and water. It absorbs immediately and is NOT greasy at all.  I use it over and over.  Very gentle as well.  I myself have an allergy to sunscreen and it has never bothered me either.  Wish they made the formula in an adult version!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is gonna expired in 1 year (Mar 2013). We may not be able to finish before the expiration date. And it does not have free return. So don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> My wee one seems to do ok with this one and doesn&#x27;t break out, which I love. It&#x27;s very thick though and seems to leave a white layer over her skin no matter how much I try to rub it in....it also does not wash out of her hair well (she hates to wear a hat). I will continue to use it though as it protects her and is finally something that doesn&#x27;t cause her to break out into a rash.</li>
            <li> I have free samples of this from the skin cancer surgeon that is treating me right now. So far, so good. I have to be careful of what I use on my skin, or I will get rashes or blisters.  I have just purchased this exact same item at my local Giant Eagle Grocery Store where it was almost $5.00 less then it is here. So watch the prices.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection, and, even better, it&#x27;s the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far for my daughter&#x27;s face that she&#x27;s not allergic to, and, I&#x27;ve tried many, many kinds.  She can use other kinds on her body, but, her face is so over the top sensitive.  All other sunscreens, even the natural ones sold at Whole Foods make her nose run like a faucet and eyes turn red, and she is unbearably unhappy.  This sunscreen has never done that.  The biggest down-side is that it leaves a chalky-white color on her face.  I hate that, which is why I&#x27;ve tried so many other kinds of sunscreen, but, keep returning to this, because she&#x27;s not allergic to it on her face.  Because of the white color, I use a different sunscreen on the rest of her body, because it&#x27;s only her face that is so sensitive.  Bottom line, if you have sensitive skin, this is a winner, but, if you or your baby&#x27;s skin is not super sensitive, I would look to something else that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with white streaks.  My all-time favorite sunscreen to use on the kids (everywhere but my daughter&#x27;s face) is Alba &amp;#34;very emollient sunscreen&amp;#34; &amp;#34;natural protection sport spray&amp;#34; (non-aerosol) SPF 40 in a blue bottle.</li>
            <li> Creamy, and not too hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the price is great for the size, especially if you subscribe. I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen on my face every day for the past decade, and I&#x27;m really impressed with this one. I have sensitive skin that reacts badly to chemical sunscreens. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with this one. It wears very well under makeup and leaves a less shiny finish than even the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer. Like all physical sunblocks, it does give a faint white cast, but nothing too bad. I tend to apply this to my face and brush my teeth while I&#x27;m waiting for it to settle. I apply foundation immediately afterward and it doesn&#x27;t lift it off or affect the texture. For some reason, the Neutrogena Sensitive Sunblock is usually more expensive than this one even though they have identical formulations.</li>
            <li> No no no no.  This stuff is awful.  I use a lot of physical sunscreens and this is the worse.  Not only is it the chalkiest, messiest one I&#x27;ve ever used, it doesn&#x27;t blend well and leaves horrible white streaks on your skin and rubs off on everything.  That&#x27;s not even the worst part.  I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and this made me break out in an AWFUL rash on both my arms.  I would not use this again and would think twice before putting it on a baby.</li>
            <li> This is a dangerous product full of chemicals nothing pure! The most dangerous one is Methylisothiazolinone to which many people have severe allergies and a lot of them including me develop severe contact dermatitis to Methylisothiazolinone and all because manufacturers now put it into everything! BEWARE and do not put anything with this chemical or anything that contains word -isothiazolinone on you or even into you!!!! Your life will become a living hell as this dangerous chemical is even in paint!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am severely allergic to Methylisothiazolinone, which is in this product. Methylisothiazolinone is a relatively common allergen, so test this before using it all over your body. I called Neutrogena&#x27;s medical department to report my allergic reactions to this product (which required emergent oral and topical steroids), but they gave me very defensive responses and said that they &amp;#34;test their product for allergies.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sorry, but Methylisothiazolinone is not an uncommon allergy. It was even the common allergen of the year recently and I read somewhere it&#x27;s the second leading cause of dermatitis after Nickel metal (not sure if that&#x27;s true 100%). Regardless, I just want people to know that this product is not allergy-free and I have many photos to prove it!</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen to have on hand when I needed it this summer.  Well, I needed it last weekend.  I applied it to my 4 month old son and it was extremely clumpy.  This caused me to look at the expiration date, and I learned that the sunscreen was expired. Like a year expired.  My window of opportunity to return it has also closed because I didn&#x27;t check the expiration date when I received it and just put it in our bathroom closet.  I will not be purchasing items with expiration dates from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. I put it all over my body and then I started to sweat and it created white milky streaks all over my face, knees, and elbows. Also don&#x27;t get it on your clothes, it leaves white powdery marks. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ALL about natural and hollistic everything, especially skin care. But when it comes down to natural sunscreens, there are few and far between that don&#x27;t make you look like a powdery ghost. Anyway, on a whim, I drove to Walgreens and bought this &amp;#34;Pure and Free&amp;#34; sunscreen and also bought the Walgreens brand Ology Sunscreen which is all natural and 50 SPF. So I decided that I would keep the one that works best and return the one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I wear sunscreen for cosmetic reasons - to reduce the risk of dark spots and freckles and to reduce the risk of scarring on my face. I put half of the Ology natural sunscreen on the left side of my face and this Neutrogena on my right, and after 5 minutes, the Neutrogena side was covered in white powder! It was caked onto my hair and my eyebrows and I used such a sparing amount and my skin was also DRY! I looked like I had my makeup done at a funeral home. Thats why I give it 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile the left side with the natural product had a Very subtle white cast that was gone after I thoroughly massaged it some more and it also kept my skin very well hydrated and moisturized! Matte and glowy..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a quality sunscreen, please, go drive to Walgreens or go online and buy their Ology natural sunscreen SPF 50 it&#x27;s 8oz(!) and only $8.99! (4.99 online!!) It doesn&#x27;t have unnatural chemicals (especially petrochemicals... yikes) and it is DEFINITELY more suitable for a baby if this is what your purchasing it for. It&#x27;s also fragrance free, water resistant, paraben free, and dye free. Seriously go pick it up I am so happy that I stumbled upon it and I&#x27;m BLOWN away it&#x27;s my new sunblock.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is called \\&quot;Neutro-genius\\&quot; is our house. We love and swear by everything they make. When it came time to buy sunscreen for our baby girl, there was only one choice in our minds. Easy to put on and protects baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my daily SPF for arms and chest. Love it. Living in So Cal means sunblock year round. This is my go to product to protect my skin and expensive tattoos.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Recommended and preferred by our dermatologist.  Size is great as it actually lasts more than one week.  Price beats many, if not all, other sellers.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a pain to apply, leaving your skin all white, it also received poor product quality and safety reviews largely due to dangerous ingredients.  http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617927/Neutrogena_Pure_%26_Free_Baby_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_60%2B/</li>
            <li> I wish the smell were better but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Tried using this sunscreen because it was one of the only store-brand/drugstore brands that only had the oxides since my skin is sensitive to sunscreen. However, I started noticing my skin getting red and itchy not long after I used it.. I found out through Paula&#x27;s Choice that it could be that there is a preservative called methylisothiozoline that could have attributed to the sensitivity, so I stopped using it. It wasn&#x27;t too bad of a sunscreen although it could have been more sheer for daily wear.</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and as described, couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> I bought this sunblock because I read that it would be gentle on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  We&#x27;ve been using it for most of this summer, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  It&#x27;s the only sunscreen that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t aggravate her eczema. It is fragrance free, as far as I can tell.  It is a little difficult to completely rub it into the skin... but I don&#x27;t mind some white blotches.. that way I know for sure she&#x27;s covered!</li>
            <li> My three year old reacted to other sunscreens with huge red hives that were worse than a sunburn.  He is totally fine with this sunscreen.  He doesn&#x27;t like having it rubbed in but he&#x27;s protected from the sun and it works!  I&#x27;m almost out and will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use anything scented. Normal sunscreen always gives me a terrible rash so I have to use baby sunscreen and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It protects my skin but isn&#x27;t greasy and lasts for hours in the Caribbean sun so I only have to reapply once on a vacation beach day.</li>
            <li> Quality product.  We purchase this every year.</li>
            <li> My son gets bad rashes from almost every single sunscreen.  This one and California Baby do not give him any problems.  This one is a little cheaper than California Baby so we get this one.  I wish it came in a waterproof form or a sweat proof form.  When he sweats a lot or goes in the water this sunscreen seems to wash off.</li>
            <li> I use is almost exclusively now because it uses minerals, instead of chemicals.  I don&#x27;t have anything against chemicals per se, but I live in the desert.  In the summer, I actually run before sunrise, and in the winter, I run during the day.  That means this stuff might sit around for six months.  Chemical sunscreens can weaken or lose their effectiveness over time.  Mineral sunscreens do not.  But keep it in a dark place.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this item as it is 2009 formulation which has quite a few major concerns if you check out, e.g. EWG.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to chemical sunscreens, so physical block is my only option. This is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried, it does go on thick and it does leave a bit of a white cast, but after a few minutes it&#x27;s almost all the way absorbed into my skin. There&#x27;s only one or two white smudges that have to be rubbed in. For me that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this sunblock daily.  This can be used all over your face and it never burns your eyes. Very gentle on your skin, no smell.  It&#x27;s makes your skin look a bit \\&quot;white\\&quot;  which I don&#x27;t mind because it evens out my \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Original.&lt;br /&gt;great protection for the sun</li>
            <li> Its the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Goopy, stays white after application for a LOOONG time. Did prevent sunburn on a day at the zoo, used on my adult face, too, and it did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> I put Neutrogena Baby on my 13 month old every day before taking him to day care: lotion on his body, the stick on his face.  This stick is convenient and easy to use; however you must use your fingers to completely rub it in.  (My understanding is that the \\&quot;white stuff\\&quot; is what is so effective - rubbing it in is no big deal and helps you see where it goes!)  My son has very sensitive skin but does not react to this, nor does he burn when wearing it.</li>
            <li> My favorite baby sunscreen! Use it on my 6 year old and hubby too!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I burn easily. I wear sun block daily and have used Neutrogena clear face breakout free for a while. I have used and liked a baby sunblock before so when I saw this product I wanted to try it. The first time I tried it, I developed a painful rash on my face. It was the worst rash I ever had in 20+ years of daily sunblock on my face. I actually couldn&#x27;t believe the rash was from this product so I tried it one more time and the same thing happened.  I had a similar reaction to Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try baby version of sunscreen in order to skip the sun lotion smell of adult versions. Within 3 days had horrible white splotches and itchy skin. Stopped using right away and cleared up. I have somewhat sensitive skin but was shocked a lotion for baby&#x27;s would react so poorly on my old skin.</li>
            <li> This product is very deceiving. It&#x27;s everything but natural. I am a mom and try to use natural products on my children, I was at the store in the sunscreen isle for about an hour trying to find a natural sunscreen, once I came across this product I grabbed it and ran. As soon as I got home I looked at the ingredients, which is everything but natural. This product contains a lot of chemical compounds, which one of the first ingredient listed is called alumina that is also known as aluminum oxide which is also in deordant that is linked to cancer which many people try to avoid. I really think these companies need to be fined for misleading  advertising. This product says &amp;#34;natural source&amp;#34; meaning the sun protection is naturally source but doesn&#x27;t mean the remaining ingredients are. I paid double the price for what I thought was a safe product. Save yourself the heartache of this product, and save your money. If you don&#x27;t mind these ingredients, i recommend buying the cheaper brands that come from triple the size for less money. From furious mom</li>
            <li> My 6 month old has very sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t give us one issues. It&#x27;s thick and white enough that you can tell where you&#x27;ve apllied as you go and rubs in nice. No burns on the trip.&lt;br /&gt;Felt great on my skin as well.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t smell and is easily applied.  It has kept baby sunburn free!  I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our pediatrician. Ended up breaking me and the baby out in a rash. The active ingredients are great, it&#x27;s the boatload of &amp;#34;other stuff&amp;#34; that makes it horrible. It is a good sized bottle though.</li>
            <li> Gave a chemical burn to the baby of one of the moms in my mom group! Be aware!</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter may not be a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34;, but this works very well on her. She&#x27;s already tried it and it works great.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, advertised a as &amp;#34;2 of Neutrogena Pure and Free baby sunscreen&amp;#34; but only received one tube. When I checked again to see why  I only got one, I found that the offer was changed to 1 unit. Sneaky...</li>
            <li> Best lotion for kids without all of those harmful chemicals! Keeps my 2 yr old safe from the sun!</li>
            <li> While we understand the differences of both Physical &amp; Chemical sunscreen products, we have actually gone with both for our 2 boys ... Ages 18 months and 3 years.  Some parents fear what chemical products may do to their childrens skin, while other parents hate the &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34; appearance physical sunscreen products leave on their children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve gone the physical route for faces/noses/ears/etc...  We have gone the chemical route, for the rest of the body.  We stay away from spray for children, and check EACH sunscreen product we purchase on EWG.org (which rates sunscreen&#x27;s on safety).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby Sunscreen on faces.  In our experience over several months/year ~ there is a slight haze of residue left when used.  Even when rubbed in entirely ~ you still see a slight haze!  We don&#x27;t care ~ and know that, that haze, is actually protecting our little ones face, ears, and neck!  Our children have never been burned when using this product and it does exactly what we hoped it would!  And that&#x27;s protecting our kids super pale skin! :)  Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin and eczema.  He appears to have no reactions to this product and does not complain - yeah!</li>
            <li> I love that this stuff is non greasy, we also have it in stick form for on the go touch ups.</li>
            <li> First inactive ingredient is alumina/alumina- highly toxic to babies, neurotoxic and damaging in other ways as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that works great over a long time and won&#x27;t get in my eyes when I sweat in the heat. It can look a bit white if I put a lot on, but I try to put on just enough to do the job. I don&#x27;t mind a little extra whiteness when the alternatives are full cover clothing or skin cancer which I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Use it on my two year old and it works great.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide (4.9%), Zinc Oxide (4.7%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Alumina, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Beeswax (Apis Mellifera), Behenyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, BHT, Bisabolol, Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cetyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG 8 Laurate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root), Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexl Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Methicone, Methylisothiazolinone, Pantothenic Acid, PEG 100 Stearate, PEG 8, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polymethylmethacrylate, Polysorbate 60, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Potassium Sorbate, Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A), Silica, Stearic Acid, Styrene Acrylates Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Trisiloxane, Water, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price. If you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that... Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me. I make my own sunscreen since I surf all the time and it takes less than a handful of organic ingredients but when I do not have time, I look for a mix with the least amount of ingredients, all in organic form mix which will at least keep me away from hospitals. This Neutrogena mix is full of chemicals and alcohol. Why would anyone put alcohol on their skin is beyond me less alone on their baby&#x27;s skin. The rest of chemicals in the mix is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver... Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> As a 40 year old if you hear the words irreversible skin damage, you can&#x27;t help but to want different for your kids.  Since there are messages everywhere that say apply sunscreen like it is your second job I am starting to for myself and definitely for my children.  I like this product for my infant and three year old.  It absorbs and leaves skin dry verses oily.  We are using this as part of our daily routine!  My dermatologist recommended it!  Will buy again and again...</li>
            <li> Was recomended by my dermatologist.  I wish is rubbed in easier.</li>
            <li> My 7 mth old hasn&#x27;t burned at all this summer... Knock on wood and he has a very light complexion. I&#x27;d recommend this product.a</li>
            <li> A friends pediatric dermatologist recommended this. Yes it costs more then generic but with fair skinned kids with very sensitive skin this is great and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I feel duped.  I&#x27;ve been buying this product under the assumption that it was a safer option for my kids than most sunblocks.  Boy was I wrong!  This lotion is actually highly toxic and NOT safe at all!  There are other lotions that aren&#x27;t labelled natural that aren&#x27;t as bad as this one.  Please think twice before putting this on your kids skin!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen.  Being of Irish descent, it&#x27;s been an evil necessity for most of my life, and I accepted the burning/stinging feeling of sunscreen on my face.  My son has mild skin sensitivity, so I had to find something that wouldn&#x27;t make him break out and swell up.  This sunscreen created no reaction at all.  Now I&#x27;m using it, and starting to not hate sunscreen quite so much.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for baby</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other sunscreen on my babies.</li>
            <li> Goes on great but doesn&#x27;t not stay well on the face. Safer alternative than the regular octinoxate sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this product as we spend our winters in AZ...hot strong sunlight.  My husband has had problems with skin cancer and is very sensitive to the sun.  Even though this is a bit expensive, it seems to do a great job of protecting our skin.  He uses it more heavily than I do, and I use mine under my makeup.  The only thing about it is that is leaves a bit of a ghostly look due to the whiteness of the zinc.  So you need to be sure to spread it around on your face very carefully.  A really handy feature of the same product is that it comes in a stick form; easy to carry with you and use without getting your hands messy.  Glad the dr. put us on to this...it is better to be safe than sorry with the sun!</li>
            <li> Great product for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is great for not getting burnt. I use it as an adult and I don&#x27;t need to reapply, one application last me all day at the beach! It is very thick but it doesn&#x27;t feel as sticky or greasy as some other sunscreen I have used. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It was recommended by our pediatrician for our 6 month old and it did the job and well - easy to apply and great protection in and out of the water.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. We&#x27;ve been using it all summer when we go swimming. My one year old is still as pale as paper, but since I forgot to put sunscreen on myself last time, I am red as a lobster. We got the same amount of sun, but he was we protected by this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have hypersensitive skin &amp; this stuff works the best on me without breaking out or getting rashes.</li>
            <li> I got this for my two young children who have pretty bad eczema. Traditional sunscreens were causing them to have bad outbreaks, even when we washed it off as soon as we got home from the pool. This stuff has been great - NO outbreaks or irritation at all. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a spray bottle! But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for my kids&#x27; comfort.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It is not greasy. You need to rub well though or your skin will show some white spots.</li>
            <li> Now not used,But it looks very good, I chose this physical sunscreen products for my baby, hoping to protect her</li>
            <li> ........and recommended it to us and all of her little patients. No sunscreen out there came close to this one from Neutrogena according to not just our pediatrician, but also dermatologists and our friends who work in the clinical field that oversees some of the most disgusting things that our environment can have on our skins. So it&#x27;s only fair that you want extreme protection for your baby&#x27;s brand new skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s said that when shopping for sunscreen, you want to obtain the highest SPF out there but we&#x27;ve learned and been told from certified medical experts that SPF 15 - 30 is all you really need. Anything over 30 is redundant as a 40/50/60 etc provides the same protection as a 30. Anyhow, Neutrogena one came as a 60 by default and even though this formula is specifically tailored for a baby/toddler, anyone can use it and in my opinion, I think it&#x27;s better for you as the ingredients used are not as harsh as those that&#x27;s not made for babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this on my daughter&#x27;s face and legs as well as neck and arms every morning regardless of weather and reapply as needed which isn&#x27;t very often. The sunscreen itself isn&#x27;t greasy or oily like some other sunscreens out there and it applies very evenly with no stickiness afterwards. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit more pricey than standard sunscreens but compared to some brands out there that advertises for babies etc, this Neutrogena one came as the better value IMO.. &amp;#60;(^.^)&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I found a smaller version of this at other stores for the same price - totally not worth it especially when you can get more on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only sunscreen products with no scent. It works great, feel good, and I use it everyday. No more headaches from perfume in my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and this leaves a white residue/cast on my skin which I hate! It looks like it hasn&#x27;t been rubbed in properly and can be unsightly. Especially bad in rougher, more pigmented areas of skin where the white does not go away.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use this on my tattoo and anytime I need to protect my face or neck from blazing sun. Which is a lot since I&#x27;m out surfing most of the year. Goes on easy, absorbs well and stays on unlike a lot of other sunscreens. Oh, and it really does a good job keeping the sun off and preventing not only sunburn but sun damage. Zinc and Titanium Oxides are critical ingredients if you want real sunBLOCK.</li>
            <li> A baby was affected this, si I returned it for a different sun screen.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my baby, now toddler. It&#x27;s the only one I use.</li>
            <li> My baby has very light skin, so I was very concerned when we decided to travel to northeastern Brazil with her. This product saved us! She was protected all day and even though her skin is very sensitive, it caused no reactions. We applied it on her skin early in the morning and then every 2 or 3 hours. If you are in doubt and want to try some products for first time use, make sure this is on your list.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen my son can wear.  All others give him red bumps that look like a heat rash.  We have been using this for several years now and it works great.  This is the best price I&#x27;ve found per ounce and on the larger 5 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a chalky residue but who cares if you get great sun protection.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found for an infant and/or toddler.  I did a lot of research before a beach trip last summer because my daughter had somewhat sensitive skin as a baby. This was great. No rashing, no burning, it was not oily, and it rubbed in with ease.  I recommend this product for babies, infants, and toddlers!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t make my face sting. I have very fair skin and stinging with traditional face sunscreens happens like 50% the time for me, so I wanted to give a &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunscreen a shot. I read that this works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate the face or cause breakouts. When I wear this sunscreen on my face, it sweats off almost immediately, especially on my upper lip and chin. It&#x27;s strange. It&#x27;s like the lotion is too thick to be absorbed or something. Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I&#x27;m still in search of a non stinging face sunscreen. For the body this was fine.</li>
            <li> Saves my ears and nose and does not cause any problems on my kids.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen for people wanting a more natural product. The bottle turning color is pretty neat. The sunscreen is slightly thicker than chemical screens. It does leave a thin film of white but that did not bother me at all. Being preggo, this is one that was recommended by my ob gyn. My only complaint is that it seemed that my face/eye area reacted with this brand more than Blue Lizard. But I just used it on my body and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Very thick, perfect for sensitive baby skin.  Since it&#x27;s so thick and white, it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;ve applied it, so as not to miss any spots.  There is no scent.  We love it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. It&#x27;s a bit chalky and doesn&#x27;t absorb great is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> i thought the natural was a go. but after finding out this brand rated poorly on the EWG website for hazardous Chemicals. I bought one of their top rated brand!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen seems to have good sun protection, but it is difficult to rub in because there are little lumps in it. I don&#x27;t mind sunscreen being visible on my kids&#x27; skin, but I would rather have a nice even layer rather than white splotches here and there. My kids are relatively patient, but they can&#x27;t sit still long enough for me to rub this lotion in thoroughly enough.&lt;br /&gt;After a month or so, the tube wouldn&#x27;t reliably stay closed, and I had to take extra precautions to make sure it didn&#x27;t spill inside the backpack.</li>
            <li> Absolute best for all kids!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion for my sensative skin toddler. It doesn&#x27;t cause her to break out which some lotions do. It is sort of thick and needs to be rubbed in very well to get rid of the white hue.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I use. Lots of other brands make my babies eyes burn but this doesn&#x27;t. I have a very white skinned baby with sensitive skin and this works very well with him. I tell him we are doing his &amp;#34;face-paint&amp;#34;, nearly every morning if he is going outside.</li>
            <li> No smell and does not turn the skin white</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this sunblock on my kids and it works pretty well. One minus, it takes a long time for it to rub in, which for me is a bit too long when you have squirmy toddlers on your hands who can care less about sun protection.</li>
            <li> Protects well, feels like glue. I use this for cycling and it definitely picks up a lot of dirt from roads.</li>
            <li> its a little thick, kind of hard to apply to a wiggly infant. but he didnt get sunburned....so its great</li>
            <li> Finally fragrance free lotion that feels nice on.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face on top of my lotion during the day. I used to use the Neutrogena Age Shield 110 SPF, which I would still use today if it weren&#x27;t so greasy with a strong fragrant smell. It felt unclean having it on and washing my face at night felt like such a relief. Anyway, this stuff is pleasant to wear. I only used it a few times so far, but it is good.&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I tried the Aveeno baby 55 SPF which is also fragrance fee but it stung a little when I put it on and didn&#x27;t feel as clean as this one does. The ingredients are totally different. This one is better in my opinion. Though I haven&#x27;t really been out in the sun to see if really works. So far so good. I&#x27;ll update if it changes.</li>
            <li> We used this on our son this weekend in Seattle. He was outside for at most one hour. His neck was completely sun burned. This product does not work.</li>
            <li> Goes on so easy for baby and definitely protects!</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;cheap Irish skin&amp;#34; and usually try to use products I know won&#x27;t have adverse reactions with my skin. I applied this to my skin 5 days ago and still can&#x27;t go a day without taking an anti histamine due to how severe my reaction was. My entire chest, stomach, hands, are covered in little tiny red bumps. Safe to stay, I&#x27;ll be avoiding this in the future.</li>
            <li> My wife who is 1/2 Irish (fair skin) and never had any allergic reaction to any product, used this one day with only one application. The next day she wound up with a horrible reaction of huge 2-3&amp;#34; hives, redness, rash, heat and lots of itching witg lost sleep for about 6 days. Was on benedryl for 5 of those days. They the call this stuff &amp;#34;Pure and Free&amp;#34; and expect you to put this toxic stuff on your babies. This was the safest looking stuff in Safeway. Yeah, right. Thanks allot Neutrogena. At least we got our money back.</li>
            <li> When my baby was 6 mos, I asked her pediatrician what sunscreen she recommended.  She told me that I should look for a sunscreen with ONLY Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide.  I went to Target and searched through all the sunscreens including the baby brands.  This sunscreen was the only one I found with only those 2 ingredients.  I did research on the chemicals, and this is what I discovered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The oxides are physical sunblocks, literally a barrier to stop the sun before it reaches your skin. This sunscreen lays on the surface of the skin, which is why they are so visible and chalky sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The other sunscreens are a class of chemical sunblocks - avobenzone, oxybenzone, PABA, et al. These are designed to absorb into your skin - oil-soluble, and react with UV light in a sacrificial process. Which is why they exhort people to reapply every few hours. Unfortunately their solubility, which makes them aesthetically appealing since they &amp;#34;disappear &amp;#34;, also means that they can accumulate and react in the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Zinc/titanium oxides are not absorbed by the body at all, and are nonreactive at STP, so they are much safer, but it may leave your skin looking ghost-like while you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen sells for $9.99 for 3 oz and $13.99 for 5 oz at Target, so Amazon&#x27;s prices are slightly cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: This sunscreen is the safest for your baby/children.  It is now the only sunscreen our entire family uses. You may notice it doesn&#x27;t completely disappear, but I&#x27;d much rather have a slightly white chalky completion than skin damage - especially for my children.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product- my son has allergy issues with perfumes and dyes... this is a life saver!  wuick shipping too... thanks!</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and this in one of the few sunscreens I can tolerate.  Great for the whole family.</li>
            <li> This had been the only sunscreen (including organic and natural baby sunscreens) that doesn&#x27;t hurt and irritate my son&#x27;s eyes once his face gets wet at the pool or beach. I&#x27;ve tried many baby sunscreens that claim they won&#x27;t sting but this is the only one that truly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for children because it only has phisical sun blockers (Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide), so there is no risk of putting harmful chemical ingredients in your kids skin. It leaves a white finish though, so it is OK for kids that still do not care or notice this. Older kids may not like this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, convenient, easy to use sunscreen for young kids in particular.  My 2.5 year old prefers this than the tube sunscreens.  You still have to rub it in after you roll it on, but it is a bit quicker and simpler.  Doesn&#x27;t feel as sticky either which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I use it on sensitive adult skin.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> No icky fragrance, my dermatologist recommended this one, and he was right. It does its job well. Has zinc oxide in it.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Make sure to reapply every 80 minutes - it doesn&#x27;t smell bad (has a very light scent to it that goes away quickly), doesn&#x27;t streak/run off with sweat or water. Baby doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it at all - just don&#x27;t apply to any body part like hands that baby will be sticking in their mouth to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I get severe rashes when I use chemical-based sunscreen so I am always picky with the ingredients.  I like it because it goes on clearer than others.  First problem was that it isn&#x27;t sweat proof.  It becomes milky and runny.  Second problem was that I developed pretty bad heat rashes due to the sunscreen blocking up my pores.</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen for a child</li>
            <li> The protection is excelent, but the product gives a &amp;#34;whited aspect&amp;#34; to the skin. Hard to disappear. I prefer the product of La&#x27;Roche on my kids.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to clear up a misconception from someone&#x27;s review. This product does NOT contain &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; ie drinking or rubbing alcohol. In organic chemistry nomenclature, and &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; is any compound with a hydroxyl group attached (-OH) which increases water solubility. So the &amp;#34;alcohols&amp;#34; this product contains are emollient fatty compounds that have been altered slightly to make them mix better instead of separating into globs of oil. Sheesh, people. Science.</li>
            <li> Offers excellent protection on me, and on my very fair skinned five and three year olds. You can&#x60;t feel it on your skin once you&#x60;ve rubbed it in. I get no protests from the kids about not wanting to use it.</li>
