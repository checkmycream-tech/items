            <li>Really like this product, ordered it on a whim based on reviews and very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>just spray it with water and spray some of the conditioner and my hair curls up nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it kind of tames it.  </li>

            <li>I finally have great curls!</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my curls look.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion for my 3-mix curls.</li>
            <li>It would be ok if the price reflected this loss of quality, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I have permed hair, so I use this product to give my curls more definition and keep it from looking frizzy.</li>
            <li>Love how my hair responds to it.</li>

            <li>I even like it better than B&amp;B&#x27;s curl creme.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>But I can honestly say this is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>I have battled with my curly hair for as long as I can remember and this product is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell and a quarter-sized drop seems to do the trick on my medium-long hair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and you don&#x27;t have to use very much, so even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey (for my tastes)</li>
            <li>If you have a special event, you might want to try something with more hold.</li>
            <li>(I am 58 and have hair loss and fine hair.)</li>
            <li>When I tried Enjoy Shaping Lotion</li>
            <li>Bought it for her, fantastic</li>
            <li>Does the job and leaves your hair feeling silky am smooth.</li>
            <li>bought it once in a salon, and then they stopped selling the Enjoy products, so I&#x27;ve been buying it on Amazon ever since.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend purchasing it here and plus, free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep your curls soft and perfectly shaped all day, it washes out cleanly and washes most of your tangles out with it.  </li>
            <li>Every day I would have to start from a clean slate plus those were all so drying the alcohol, sulfates, and parabens.  </li>
            <li>this is a soft lotion and the style you get is amazing</li>
            <li>I have very curly, but fine hair that easily dries out and is quite temperamental.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair and this product is great!  </li>
            <li>I can tell it&#x27;s there, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant in any way.</li>
            <li>Love this for soft curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for the 4 and not 5 stars is that the old, salon-only formula was more concentrated.</li>
            <li>I feel I get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products for curly hair and by far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this because I don&#x27;t have to use other hair products except a light hair spray.  </li>
            <li>so many people have complimented me and noticed the difference in my curls are now extra spiraly!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for well over a month</li>
            <li>Lookin forward to get from you more beauty supplies in the future.</li>
            <li>This shaping lotion is exactly that - a lotion for your hair.</li>
            <li>It really defines curl without making hair greasy or crunchy!</li>
            <li>But this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the shaping lotion</li>
            <li>Love it and definitely would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>: 1) put on product FIRST, 2) comb with a wide-tooth comb, 3)</li>
            <li>the description for this product is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>and it dries very healthy looking a little crunchy, but you can work it out with your fingers.</li>
            <li>â€™s great to use if you want to blow dry it or let air dry.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and the hold lasts all day beautifully without making my hair feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>Good product if you don&#x27;t want all the hard and crunchy hair feeling.</li>
            <li>This hair-shaping lotion works very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This product works really well to hold and define my curls all day, even in humid weather.</li>
            <li>and it really does help to take the frizz out</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the drying alcohol of gel, but is very lightweight</li>
            <li>The kind that makes your hair feel heavy and crispy (almost like a wind chime).</li>
            <li>I just put my hair in sections and from the top to ends just coat and crunch it, diffuse it sometimes too, but the fact that I only use this 1 product and it holds leaves it shiny and soft</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is soft- really like a hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price compared to buying at an expensive salon</li>
            <li>I get compliments every time and it takes a fraction of the time it takes to blow dry &amp; straighten my hair - how cool is that?</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and middle of the back</li>
            <li>The lady that colors my hair uses this to style it and it make me feel like I have a new head of hair.</li>
            <li>Additionally I live in Florida and it holds the curls all day even with the humidity.</li>
            <li>I use this every day, whether I am wearing my hair down and curly, or tied back in a very smooth bun.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, never stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li>It keeps the back of my head (where its really curly) soft and curled.</li>
            <li>It takes away the frizz and enhances your naturally curly hair...</li>
            <li>I get complements on how soft and curly my hair is.</li>
            <li>Makes my undefined wavy hair into curly and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not heavy at all, nor does it leave my hair crunchy.  </li>
            <li>and I have perfectly soft curls with no frizz whatsoever that hold all day.  </li>
            <li>It finishes with a soft hold and never feels</li>
            <li>It was thicker and I only needed a dollop to cover my whole head.</li>
            <li>It leave it soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that can get out of control &amp; frizzy.  </li>
            <li>so I get bouncy, soft curls.  </li>
            <li>It is great for thick curly hair and is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>What I love about Enjoy is that a little goes a very long way, even in my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I like this product for the times I want to blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a hair lotion that will lightly hold hair in place without residue.</li>
            <li>My old bottle lasted almost a year of daily use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be on the lookout for old stock.</li>
            <li>Adds a lot of body when I blow dry it straight and keeps it from frizzing when I let it dry naturally curly.</li>
            <li>Once my hair is mostly dry later in the morning, I just loosen the twists a bit by lightly shaking my hair at the roots and scrunching a little</li>
            <li>I definitely feel the need to wash it out of my hair every day to feel fresh, but this  is such a small sacrifice for finding something that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like a &amp;#34;magic shell&amp;#34; experience-- (I often have to use hairspray like Aquanet to get any hold.)  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair-</li>

            <li> Adds a lot of body when I blow dry it straight and keeps it from frizzing when I let it dry naturally curly.</li>
            <li> Once my hair is mostly dry later in the morning, I just loosen the twists a bit by lightly shaking my hair at the roots and scrunching a little</li>
            <li> I definitely feel the need to wash it out of my hair every day to feel fresh, but this  is such a small sacrifice for finding something that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like a &amp;#34;magic shell&amp;#34; experience-- (I often have to use hairspray like Aquanet to get any hold.)  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has been my go to product for over 2 years.  It is great for thick curly hair and is not too heavy.  If you have a special event, you might want to try something with more hold.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product, just remember to use it sparingly because it&#x27;s concentrated. It feels nice in my hair, and gives it body. (I am 58 and have hair loss and fine hair.)</li>
            <li> The lady that colors my hair uses this to style it and it make me feel like I have a new head of hair. It makes my hair feel thick and gives it shine and keeps my hair under control for days.</li>
            <li> Truly awesome stuff for curly hair! It takes away the frizz and enhances your naturally curly hair...</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair- and I like it curly.  This hair-shaping lotion works very well. A little goes a long way, and the hold lasts all day beautifully without making my hair feel sticky.  I definitely feel the need to wash it out of my hair every day to feel fresh, but this  is such a small sacrifice for finding something that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like a &amp;#34;magic shell&amp;#34; experience-- (I often have to use hairspray like Aquanet to get any hold.)  This stuff is soft- really like a hand lotion.  I can tell it&#x27;s there, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant in any way. Doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch either like hair spray can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Run a little through your curls to give them definition without the frizz! You can leave it in as long as needed. Works very well on fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I have found for curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy . It works for me with shoulder length hair and my daughter with long hair (heavy and thick).</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say enough about this product.. Since my hair is thick and very curly, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything. The kind that makes your hair feel heavy and crispy (almost like a wind chime). And then some of the smells and residue that some leave behind. This doesn&#x27;t smell or have a heavy aroma. I had used one that attracted Flies and Bees( made me feel unclean and like I had bad hygiene). Once I&#x27;m out of the shower I apply and go. Since I don&#x27;t ever have time to use a diffuser, I just apply it and I let it air dry. I use my fingers and hand as a human diffuser. I get complements on how soft and curly my hair is. Im sometimes in such a hurry that there are time a miss a section. I just wet that section and a apply a dab and then on the go again. It help with frizz, defines curls, and with shape your wring lets.</li>
            <li> Love this for soft curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes my undefined wavy hair into curly and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this for my curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have used countless products for curly hair from salon to drugstore brands from mousses, gels, hairsprays, to curl creams. I have NEVER found a product that would work alone, for example mousse I had to finish with hair spray to hold it. I am mixed with Indian/black and my curl type 3b/3c really full thick curly hair past my shoulders, would get dry and frizzy by lunch time so I always had to have something for frizz control and hold which led to a lot of products making my hair crunchy and just built up. Every day I would have to start from a clean slate plus those were all so drying the alcohol, sulfates, and parabens.  When I tried Enjoy Shaping Lotion I was absolutely shocked, it is like the miracle product for my hair type. Once I get out the shower I just put my hair in sections and from the top to ends just coat and crunch it, diffuse it sometimes too, but the fact that I only use this 1 product and it holds leaves it shiny and soft so many people have complimented me and noticed the difference in my curls are now extra spiraly!!! To make things better I can do the second day look by just spraying my hair with a water bottle making it damp then just adding a little extra for control and I&#x27;m out the door! I HIGHLY recommend this for thick frizzy kinda coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to count how many products I&#x27;ve tried over the years in search of perfect curls. But I can honestly say this is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve come across. I have extremely thick, curly hair. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of gels, sprays and lotions, of which I have to use a ton (seriously, a typical bottle would last no more than two weeks) and they would all leave my hair crunchy, looking permanently wet and make it so dry. What I love about Enjoy is that a little goes a very long way, even in my thick hair. I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for well over a month and I still have at least a week&#x27;s worth of it left. It&#x27;s also not heavy at all, nor does it leave my hair crunchy.  How I use it:  When I get out of the shower I get my hair fairly dry, just so it&#x27;s damp, then comb the lotion through my hair with my fingers in 3 passes, each time using about a quarter size. Then I twist the individual curls around my finger. Once my hair is mostly dry later in the morning, I just loosen the twists a bit by lightly shaking my hair at the roots and scrunching a little and I have perfectly soft curls with no frizz whatsoever that hold all day.  Honestly, this stuff is amazing. My long search is over. I finally have great curls!</li>
            <li> Bought it for her, fantastic she said. We found it a bit cheaper than where she lives. Lookin forward to get from you more beauty supplies in the future.</li>
            <li> this is a soft lotion and the style you get is amazing</li>
            <li> Good product if you don&#x27;t want all the hard and crunchy hair feeling. Does the job and leaves your hair feeling silky am smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this product for the times I want to blow dry my hair straight. If I am defuzing my curly hair, it leaves it crunchy and I do not like crunchy curls.</li>
            <li> I like it, i learn to use that product with my mother in law, and all my family used it now</li>
            <li> I love this hair product!</li>
            <li> This shaping lotion is exactly that - a lotion for your hair. I use this every day, whether I am wearing my hair down and curly, or tied back in a very smooth bun. It smells great, it&#x27;s awesome for fine hair and wispies, and it reactivates with water! So instead of being the curly haired girl that&#x27;s afraid of rain, I am the girl welcoming it bc it makes my hair look even better! It finishes with a soft hold and never feels heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it once in a salon, and then they stopped selling the Enjoy products, so I&#x27;ve been buying it on Amazon ever since. A bottle lasts me about 4-6 months and I use it every day. My hair is fine and middle of the back length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews.  It is way too sticky.  It did nothing for my curly/wavy hair but make it look worse.  I returned it after one use.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my curls look.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion for my 3-mix curls. It leaves my hair shiny with the perfect control and no crunchiness (unless I overuse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 and not 5 stars is that the old, salon-only formula was more concentrated. It was thicker and I only needed a dollop to cover my whole head. My old bottle lasted almost a year of daily use.  And I have thick hair.  Now I need at least twice as much to get the same results.  It would be ok if the price reflected this loss of quality, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll definitely be on the lookout for old stock.</li>
            <li> Great product that doesn&#x27;t leave my curls crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have permed hair, so I use this product to give my curls more definition and keep it from looking frizzy. It doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell and a quarter-sized drop seems to do the trick on my medium-long hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. The best hair product out there for wavy frizzy hair. It really defines curl without making hair greasy or crunchy!</li>
            <li> Great product and it is a fraction of the price my salon charges. Love how my hair responds to it. A little goes a long way for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only styling product that helps my curly hair. It leave it soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I have battled with my curly hair for as long as I can remember and this product is AWESOME!  Not only does it keep your curls soft and perfectly shaped all day, it washes out cleanly and washes most of your tangles out with it.  Wonderful product that finally let me love my curls.</li>
            <li> It left a white residue on my hair even though I used a small amount.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, ordered it on a whim based on reviews and very happy with it.  I use it when my hair is when and it dries very healthy looking a little crunchy, but you can work it out with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this keeps it from frizzing!  I don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the speed that this product came in. For not being amazon prime eligible I was a little worried. It came via USPS which usually takes a long time in my experience but it came in 2 or 3 days for only $1.00! I was VERY happy.   As for the product itself, I use it combined with Paul Mitchell Mouse and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. It keeps the back of my head (where its really curly) soft and curled. I use it while my hair is wet and squeeze about a quarter size amount into my palm, then work it into the back of my hair, while scrunching it up. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this product is great!  I use a diffuser, scrunch my hair and add this product and it&#x27;s curly all day.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and will continue as long as they make the stuff. I have coarse, thick, wavy hair. I apply a little when my hair is wet, twirl my hair into loose curls, air-dry or use a diffuser and it&#x27;s great. My hair feels soft, never stiff or greasy. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, and this is the only product that gives me the curls I want with no time spent. I just scrunch and go - love it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that can get out of control &amp; frizzy.  I shower, comb through my hair with conditioner still in, rinse, then pat my hair dry with a towel.  Then I add this lotion and let it air dry. I get compliments every time and it takes a fraction of the time it takes to blow dry &amp; straighten my hair - how cool is that?</li>
            <li> I also like the leave-in spray conditioner by this brand.  I use it on days I don&#x27;t wash my hair...just spray it with water and spray some of the conditioner and my hair curls up nicely.  I have wavy, looser curls and the curl creme is not too thick or sticky.  I even like it better than B&amp;B&#x27;s curl creme.  Not sold on their shampoos though.  Those with curly hair should try this product!!</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used as a \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; conditioner. The blow dryer works with the product to shape a great style and it dramatically reduces static electricity. A must try for everyone, and you only use a nickle size each day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the lotion or the seller providing an old product because I&#x27;ve never had issues with Enjoy products in the past.  But this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the shaping lotion and I did not like the smell (musty) nor did it hold my thick hair well.</li>
            <li> This product works really well to hold and define my curls all day, even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Great product! Much more expensive if you buy it in a salon.I have curly hair and it kind of tames it.  Love it and definitely would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products for curly hair and by far this is my favorite. Once I found this product per a hair stylist recommendation and now Iâ€™ve been using it for years with no reason to switch. This is a great price compared to buying at an expensive salon so I would recommend purchasing it here and plus, free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itâ€™s great to use if you want to blow dry it or let air dry. I typically let my hair air dry but a hair stylist once told me a perfect process for using a diffuser which I tried using this product and it really does help to take the frizz out: 1) put on product FIRST, 2) comb with a wide-tooth comb, 3) towel dry and scrunch up, 4) flip your hair, and lastly 5) diffuse each section at a time. Trust me, it works great!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a hair lotion that will lightly hold hair in place without residue. This lotion left my hair a little oily every day I used it. When I kept cutting the amount down, it didn&#x27;t do anything to keep hair in place.</li>
            <li> This product works good for me.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, but fine hair that easily dries out and is quite temperamental.  I switched to using this product because my gel was weighing my hair down and mousse was drying it out.  This product was the perfect answer.  It doesn&#x27;t have the drying alcohol of gel, but is very lightweight so I get bouncy, soft curls.  It has a nice smell and you don&#x27;t have to use very much, so even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey (for my tastes) I feel I get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this product. Enough control without the feel of damaged or crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> Love this because I don&#x27;t have to use other hair products except a light hair spray.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff; it fact it feels softer and ye give my limp hair some body.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I would purchase again!  the description for this product is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> This shaping lotion is the only product I use for my hair.  A little goes a long way and lasts me over a month.  And I have long super thick curly hair.  Additionally I live in Florida and it holds the curls all day even with the humidity.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s the best shaper for me</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of body when I blow dry it straight and keeps it from frizzing when I let it dry naturally curly.</li>
