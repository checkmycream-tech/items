            <li>Better than vaseline.</li>
            <li>There are many reasons for writing about aquaphor healing cream.</li>

            <li>great stuff, recommended by podiatrist and it really works</li>
            <li>Use instead of lotion skin feels soft,no more dry,cracked skin.</li>
            <li>I am dissapointed in the product, and in myself for not researching better.  </li>
            <li>This is the best healing lotion for dry spots even on my face (NOT EVERY DAY THOUGH) and \\&quot;THE BeST\\&quot; chapstick I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>lol it is so soft and</li>
            <li>This stuff is great on feet to get them soft and for chapped lips.</li>
            <li>anything from a small cut, nose bleeds, to sun burns and dry skin and best of all PERFECT FOR TATTOOs.</li>
            <li>even Wal-Mart didnt sell it that cheap.</li>
            <li>This one is safe to use on chapped lips, and works great in all the other applications, also.  </li>
            <li>Also works great on lips, and minor sores.</li>
            <li>Pls this container is user friendly unlike the tube, which may result in wastage.</li>
            <li>If you are reading this review, be aware that if you use petroleum jelly, you can get it at a better cost, and if you are looking for quality ingrediants, keep on looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This ointment is great to paste on those with vitiligo before swimming in chlorinated water to protect the skin , babies with eczema, or anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use on my very dry hands and feet and it works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really good to keep the body skin with proper moisture without oily sensation.</li>
            <li>I sent this to my grand daughter who was suffering very chafed skin on her hands.</li>
            <li>I use this for my baby who has mild eczema.</li>
            <li>No other product I tried was as effective.</li>
            <li>However, it is good for my dry hands.</li>
            <li>Does a good job preventing the problem in the first place when applied regularly</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price, both single and bundle purchases make this an easy buy!!</li>
            <li>I apply to my tattoos to keep them looking fresh and have that just inked look.</li>
            <li>It never seems to be absorbed into the skin and gets on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>Mine is positive too!</li>
            <li>This works great for my little one...tried a few diaper ointments, but this offers great protection.</li>
            <li>This ointment is the most dynamic and diverse used skin product out there.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products.</li>
            <li>It was first recommended by a dermatologist for bruising.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for extra dry skin on any body part as well as helping to healing wounds.</li>
            <li>Great product -- really does a nice job -- especially on hands that are out in the cold all the time -- I have recommended it to other people and they all find the product is great.</li>
            <li>Your product was received on time, I use the product for dry hands , I like to show my appreciation that this product make me feel better, improve my skin</li>
            <li>Received after feeling bottle quality is not very good, something which is not used, hope is good.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product, it could be a little thick but</li>
            <li>but I really wanted a tub-like container.</li>
            <li>This product is VERY Pricey as I paid $16+ for a tub at the store.</li>
            <li>This pack is really value for money.</li>
            <li>After putting the cream on hand then cover the hands with cotton gloves for 10 minutes then I am set for whole day.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Really coats your skin and protects, in my case, my hands.  </li>
            <li>I rub aquaphor on her feet very night  and put on cotton socks within a week</li>
            <li>cream x vaseline seems to help more than other lotions.</li>
            <li>The larger tubs that are more widely available are probably more cost effective, but I really hate sticking my hand into the bottom of a huge tub, and its harder to tote around a costco-size tub.  </li>
            <li>Heals completely and eases irritation from the first moment of application.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so much more moisturized and softer than previous.</li>
            <li>now they are soft and healthy pink.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone for tattoo use or with skin disorders.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this ointment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for healing the bruises &amp; wounds faster.</li>
            <li>Aquafor is amazing for dry lips or dry skin patches.  </li>
            <li>But I find that I keep coming back to Aquaphor and just find it so useful.  </li>
            <li>These containers are just the right size to keep one in each room, tuck one in a big diaper bag if needed, send one to daycare, etc.  </li>
            <li>Works great on rough dry patches on elbows and knees or any place dry skin is a problem.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy because my children have allergies and eczema, I tried other things</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a petroleum type salve that absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s keeps my skin supple for a 40 something year old!</li>
            <li>always have 1 ready for general home use.</li>
            <li>This is excellent for your hands and feet in cold weather!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li>With over 15 large tats currently I don&#x27;t use anything else on them to help in the healing process and keep moisture in them.</li>
            <li>I use this because of my sensitive skin and it was recommended by my&lt;br /&gt;doctor.  </li>
            <li>She used this and wore white gloves to bed and was amazed in the morning with how much her hands had healed.</li>
            <li>her toes healed and now they are baby soft.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other ointment if your skin is VERY dry like mine.</li>
            <li>Just remember to moisten your skin with water, and pat dry first, BEFORE applying the ointment.</li>
            <li>A little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; until is is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I like it, because it is the only thing I have found to really help my dry cuticuls.</li>
            <li>good on nose area, after a bad sick/ tissue using day</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like it, because it is the only thing I have found to really help my dry cuticuls.</li>
            <li> good on nose area, after a bad sick/ tissue using day</li>
            <li> With the constant handwashing to keep away germs during the winter, both adults and kids have dry chapped hands, so I use this on hands constantly.  </li>
            <li> Essential for kids and baby, anyone with eczema, long distance runners ...</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works on my dry, cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> I started applying it on her face as well since her cheeks are always dry and red</li>
            <li> But lately her skin was getting really scale-like</li>
            <li> Cleared up long standing  skin issues.  </li>
            <li> This made my dry,cracked winter lips that peel almost every day to every other day with constant use of chapstick (that didn&#x27;t help) restore my lips...</li>
            <li> Much lesser than what you get at walgreens or any other store.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor was recommended by my dermatologist for skin irritations, dry skin and wound healing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> The stuff works on dry feet as well as keeping my lips, hands and legs moisturized and protected.</li>
            <li> Family utilizes Aquaphor for severe dry skin we have for some time</li>
            <li> for dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have chapped or simply dry hands as I do from mainly not wearing gloves while doing dishes, this cram is for you.  </li>
            <li> I also used it on some itchy red patches on my arm and it calmed down the itching and these areas healed.</li>
            <li> When nothing else works this helps my dry skin!</li>
            <li> They got so dry and itchy!  </li>
            <li> when I received the products, only half year to the exp date.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dermatologist for my very very dry hand.  </li>
            <li> I use on my daughter&#x27;s eczema and in other dry spots.  </li>
            <li> I used this oinment on my feet and found that it softened rough skin after a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way even though I lather it all over her legs and arms.</li>
            <li> really works for dry skin, where other products fail.</li>
            <li> The uses are endless, plus it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> any other ointment.</li>
            <li> Looks very rough.</li>
            <li> Living in a cold climate, my feet get very dry and my heels are very cracked in the Winter.  </li>
            <li> I previously used to use Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> It is also a little pricey.  Would not recomend.</li>
            <li> it is very thick reminds me of utter</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve found nothing wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this product for the past few years, but everyone loves to save money where ever they can!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Aquaphor was recommended by my dermatologist for skin irritations, dry skin and wound healing. I use it for all of those needs and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old daughter has ezcema especially behind her knees &amp; elbows so I have always used Cetaphil all over her body. But lately her skin was getting really scale-like so her doctor recommended we use Aquaphor 3x a day instead. At first I thought this product was going to be too small but I really wanted a tub-like container. So far I&#x27;ve found nothing wrong with this item. Aquaphor is like vaseline so a little goes a long way even though I lather it all over her legs and arms. I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> This ointment is great to paste on those with vitiligo before swimming in chlorinated water to protect the skin , babies with eczema, or anyone with very dry skin. Just remember to moisten your skin with water, and pat dry first, BEFORE applying the ointment. That aquaphor then locks in the moisture from the water to keep your skin hydrated  all day and through the night</li>
            <li> This is the ointment my daughter and I use for our body, face and lips.  We having been using it this way for a couple of years.  Very satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> With over 15 large tats currently I don&#x27;t use anything else on them to help in the healing process and keep moisture in them. Highly recommended for anyone for tattoo use or with skin disorders.</li>
            <li> A miracle salve.  Heals completely and eases irritation from the first moment of application.  No other product I tried was as effective.</li>
            <li> Quality product. I previously used to use Neutrogena. Until one of my friends recommended this product. I currently use this product with baby oil. My skin is so much more moisturized and softer than previous.</li>
            <li> when I received the products, only half year to the exp date. I brought 6 bottles. Oh my God, how can I use them up? So they are sent to my relatives as a gift. However, it is good for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I quit using vaseline! This product is VERY Pricey as I paid $16+ for a tub at the store. This is the best healing lotion for dry spots even on my face (NOT EVERY DAY THOUGH) and \\&quot;THE BeST\\&quot; chapstick I have ever tried! This made my dry,cracked winter lips that peel almost every day to every other day with constant use of chapstick (that didn&#x27;t help) restore my lips...YES this stuff restored my lips back to when I was a baby lol it is so soft and even when you apply at night before bed you still wake up with it moisturized!!! WILL REPURCHASE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. A little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; until is is absorbed.  Great for your feet before a run so you don&#x27;t get blisters</li>
            <li> My family has been using this product for the past few years, but everyone loves to save money where ever they can! Amazon&#x27;s price, both single and bundle purchases make this an easy buy!! The stuff works on dry feet as well as keeping my lips, hands and legs moisturized and protected. The uses are endless, plus it&#x27;s inexpensive. I highly recommend this ointment.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s one on my desk at work, on my nightstand, on my coffee table, in my kitchen, a tube in my purse.  Every dermatologist recommends it for everything.  This is great stuff and this was a great deal for 3 jars.</li>
            <li> This ointment is the most dynamic and diverse used skin product out there. anything from a small cut, nose bleeds, to sun burns and dry skin and best of all PERFECT FOR TATTOOs. I apply to my tattoos to keep them looking fresh and have that just inked look. Moreover, any time I get a sun burn it&#x27;s perfect, peeling never occurs and heals within a couple days tops. Can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;It is really good to keep the body skin with proper moisture without oily sensation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great on feet to get them soft and for chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This works great for my little one...tried a few diaper ointments, but this offers great protection.</li>
            <li> Great for use on babies diaper rash.  Does a good job preventing the problem in the first place when applied regularly</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works on my dry, cracked feet.  Living in a cold climate, my feet get very dry and my heels are very cracked in the Winter.  This stuff is the bomb.  It works better than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products.</li>
            <li> Bought three jars so i have them spread out in my house.  I use on my very dry hands and feet and it works great.  Hands will be greasy for awhile so i usually put on at bedtime.  Also works great on lips, and minor sores.</li>
            <li> Family utilizes Aquaphor for severe dry skin we have for some time it is very thick reminds me of utter cream x vaseline seems to help more than other lotions.</li>
            <li> I put this ointment on my eye lids at night to prevent my atopic dermatitis from appearing, but I do not like pointing this ointment elsewhere since it is thick and does not soak into your skin (be design I believe).</li>
            <li> Received after feeling bottle quality is not very good, something which is not used, hope is good. Looks very rough.</li>
            <li> This is incredibly oily, slippery, etc. for dry skin and if I could get it up I would use it too.</li>
            <li> Works great on rough dry patches on elbows and knees or any place dry skin is a problem.  It&#x27;s a petroleum type salve that absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Better than vaseline. I use this for my baby who has mild eczema. It stays longer than regular vaseline. This pack is really value for money. Much lesser than what you get at walgreens or any other store. Pls this container is user friendly unlike the tube, which may result in wastage.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for extra dry skin on any body part as well as helping to healing wounds. This is a must in my house. Good to soften cracked feet. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best skin sealant ever made! My brother told me about it when he lived in Fairbanks Alaska . I only use this in the winter in Minnesota and it&#x27;s keeps my skin supple for a 40 something year old!</li>
            <li> If you have chapped or simply dry hands as I do from mainly not wearing gloves while doing dishes, this cram is for you.  It does the trick. I bought some cotton gloves to wear at night after putting on a small dab of Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> There are many reasons for writing about aquaphor healing cream. Your product was received on time, I use the product for dry hands , I like to show my appreciation that this product make me feel better, improve my skin and I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I was using cortisone ointment but this feels and works better then any other ointment. My skin feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the cream because it feels that it cakes up.</li>
            <li> Have had serious exema issued.  This stuff is the bomb!  Cleared up long standing  skin issues.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I hate how this stuff feels but it works wonders! Its great for my sons skin an mine! When nothing else works this helps my dry skin!</li>
            <li> As many people suggestion, this is a good item for baby. Mine is positive too! I don&#x27;t need to say a lot, since it is real good thing!</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered this.  With small kids, I find that we always need aquaphor. With the constant handwashing to keep away germs during the winter, both adults and kids have dry chapped hands, so I use this on hands constantly.  I apply to my feet and cover with socks to soften them up.  I use as a diaper barrier cream sometimes.  I use on my daughter&#x27;s eczema and in other dry spots.  I use on cuts and scrapes to keep them moist and heal.  I personally have always tried to find a petroleum alternative because I worry that it is not the healthiest option.  But I find that I keep coming back to Aquaphor and just find it so useful.  The larger tubs that are more widely available are probably more cost effective, but I really hate sticking my hand into the bottom of a huge tub, and its harder to tote around a costco-size tub.  These containers are just the right size to keep one in each room, tuck one in a big diaper bag if needed, send one to daycare, etc.  Love that it comes in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> This product came in a set of three.  I use this because of my sensitive skin and it was recommended by my&lt;br /&gt;doctor.  This is a great value for the money!  If you use this, this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME!  It was first recommended by a dermatologist for bruising. I was totally amazed on the improvement of the bruise within a 24 hour period. Highly recommend for healing the bruises &amp; wounds faster. The product is water solvable &amp; is safe for all ages.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for my son since he has been born. it takes away diaper rash in one use. and i was so glad to find 3 for that price. even Wal-Mart didnt sell it that cheap.</li>
            <li> Essential for kids and baby, anyone with eczema, long distance runners ... great skin protectant for chafing, cuts, burns, rash, etc.</li>
            <li> great stuff, recommended by podiatrist and it really works</li>
            <li> I used this oinment on my feet and found that it softened rough skin after a couple of weeks and I will keep using it.  I also used it on some itchy red patches on my arm and it calmed down the itching and these areas healed.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dermatologist for my very very dry hand.  After putting the cream on hand then cover the hands with cotton gloves for 10 minutes then I am set for whole day.  It works better than any other ointment if your skin is VERY dry like mine.</li>
            <li> good use for the skin. really works for dry skin, where other products fail. always have 1 ready for general home use.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz.  I have used Eucerin on my skin for years, but not Aquaphor.  The one I have used was not for around the lips or face.  This one is safe to use on chapped lips, and works great in all the other applications, also.  Check out the Eucerin website for all that it does.  It really works.</li>
            <li> Great product -- really does a nice job -- especially on hands that are out in the cold all the time -- I have recommended it to other people and they all find the product is great.</li>
            <li> I purchased Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy because my children have allergies and eczema, I tried other things but I always come back to this product. It works well on their skin. For me it outlasts anything else that I have tried on my children. I am truly satisfied with this product, it is expensive but it&#x27;s woth the money.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my grand daughter who was suffering very chafed skin on her hands. She used this and wore white gloves to bed and was amazed in the morning with how much her hands had healed. I had seen it on the Dr. Oz show.</li>
            <li> Love,Love,Love.Use instead of lotion skin feels soft,no more dry,cracked skin.Thank you.</li>
            <li> This ointment is to greasy for me.  It never seems to be absorbed into the skin and gets on your clothes.  It&#x27;s like coating yourself with vaseline.  When outside things stick to it. It is also a little pricey.  Would not recomend.</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed in the product, and in myself for not researching better.  I do not believe in putting petroleum in any form on my body.  I read the golden glowing reports, I found the best price, recieved it quickly and was gob smacked when I read the ingrediant list.  If you are reading this review, be aware that if you use petroleum jelly, you can get it at a better cost, and if you are looking for quality ingrediants, keep on looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
            <li> Aquafor is amazing for dry lips or dry skin patches.  Also can be used after getting a tattoo or to keep stains off head (if you dye your hair).  Shipped as promised.</li>
            <li> I always use this product and it helps in the winter time when my skin is the driest.</li>
            <li> I like it, because it is the only thing I have found to really help my dry cuticuls. Great stuff</li>
            <li> I like it so far.&lt;br /&gt;seems like vaseline without the smell&lt;br /&gt;works good on nose area, after a bad sick/ tissue using day</li>
            <li> This is excellent for your hands and feet in cold weather!  Really coats your skin and protects, in my case, my hands.  Being in healthcare, I wash and sanitize my hands a hundred times a day it seems.  They got so dry and itchy!  Every night before bed I&#x27;ve been putting this on..what a difference!!  My husband puts on his feet because they crack so bad..helps both of us..alot!</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from dry toes and at times the skin cracks open very painful. I rub aquaphor on her feet very night  and put on cotton socks within a week her toes healed and now they are baby soft. I started applying it on her face as well since her cheeks are always dry and red now they are soft and healthy pink.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product, it could be a little thick but its great Great great... I use it in my face, body parts and also on my 18month son</li>
