            <li>As a purchaser of dozens of acne treatment products, I am very familiar with them.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but this is by far the most effective for me.</li>
            <li>And the genuine product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat sensitive to fragrances, but Proactiv has a nice soft scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>

            <li>This really controls breakouts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for results, but I gave it 4 stars because of the price.</li>
            <li>would normally lasts me a year or longer.  </li>
            <li>The item is sealed and appears to be brand new.  </li>
            <li>Ill start by saying im NOT the biggest proactive fan because they rely too much on endorsements and bull rather than just being a good affordable product.</li>
            <li>Always use after washing and keeps skin clear!  </li>
            <li>I used Proactiv in the past, but tried to find a more affordable product.</li>
            <li>This has never dried my skin out, but it isn&#x27;t super moisturing, so if you have dry skin you might need an additional moisturizer.</li>
            <li>There is an old addage that comes to mind, &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s complete rip</li>
            <li>The only solution for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I paid less than five dollars for 3 oz, and about five dollars to ship it, so it&#x27;s not worth shipping back, but I am glad to have the opportunity to write a review and warn others that the price you pay with this seller probably reflects a rapidly approaching expiration date.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t find anything effective enough to replace the Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t want to deal with the company directly after they charged me for an additional $50 order more than two weeks after cancelling my subscription, then failed to refund me after I returned the product.</li>
            <li>but they give u these baby, travel size unbelievable bottles that just arent worth it.</li>
            <li>I used to use them all and slowly filtered the rest out, realizing that none of the others did anything significant for me (especially for the price of all of them).  </li>

            <li> the date of validity has expired long time  ago...</li>
            <li> I only use this product every other day, and sparingly at that, so 3 oz.</li>
            <li> About 3-4 years ago I stopped using the other products and only use the repairing lotion.</li>
            <li> long time user since it&#x27;s introduction years ago!</li>
            <li> but if youre black, id say all benzoyl creams dry white</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not for black people to wear during the day cuz it dries white.</li>
            <li> packaging is a FAIL - first time I&#x27;ve ever had these problems.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty expensive for a repairing lotion, even though it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as advertised and I recommend it along with its other products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s also the most expensive.</li>
            <li> Use it as advertised and your skin will be smoother and have less splotches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to wear heavy foundation to cover skin.</li>
            <li> I wear it under my makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> I noticed few weeks after I was already using this.</li>
            <li> Ive used bottles two years past their expiration dates ( i had a small stock pile) and It still worked.</li>
            <li> I never leave negative reviews, but I feel obligated to warn those considering purchasing from this company.  </li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> I prefer to purchase products as needed rather than being forced into a subscription.</li>
            <li> Horrible bottle - lid broke within one week of use, green ink rubbed off on my hands and left green dots all over - ugh!  </li>
            <li> :-((</li>

            <li> This is an excellent product. I have tried many products, but this is by far the most effective for me. Unfortunately it&#x27;s also the most expensive. I&#x27;ve tried many salicylic acid products, but they don&#x27;t seem to work for me. I&#x27;ve tried the Acne Free and Neutrogena products without much luck. I&#x27;m somewhat sensitive to fragrances, but Proactiv has a nice soft scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I used Proactiv in the past, but tried to find a more affordable product. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t find anything effective enough to replace the Proactiv. I also didn&#x27;t want to deal with the company directly after they charged me for an additional $50 order more than two weeks after cancelling my subscription, then failed to refund me after I returned the product. I prefer to purchase products as needed rather than being forced into a subscription. Amazon provides me the option of buying as needed. This product works great, I just wish the price wasn&#x27;t this offensive.</li>
            <li> Ill start by saying im NOT the biggest proactive fan because they rely too much on endorsements and bull rather than just being a good affordable product. i do NOT have a subscription for their 3 step system because it&#x27;s a rip off and they will make u go bankrupt. these 90 day bottles are what their actual 30 day system bottles SHOULD look like. but they give u these baby, travel size unbelievable bottles that just arent worth it. the product works OK sometimes. it&#x27;s not for black people to wear during the day cuz it dries white. white people may use it twice a day but if youre black, id say all benzoyl creams dry white so theyre not for day time use when u will be seen. wear it at night only</li>
            <li> Good product and shipped quickly.  Better price then from proactive directly!</li>
            <li> This repairing lotion is great. It goes on smooth, dries fast, and protects against breakouts and/or clears up breakouts.</li>
            <li> Love Proactiv products</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE!! And the genuine product. I was concerned that with the price of this size of lotion, it maybe in some way counterfeit. However It is the real deal, and the rice can not be beat.</li>
            <li> Something i order often</li>
            <li> Worked just the way I needed it to..</li>
            <li> I never leave negative reviews, but I feel obligated to warn those considering purchasing from this company.  There is an old addage that comes to mind, &amp;#34;If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.&amp;#34;  I ordered the product on Sunday and received it Wednesday, so shipping was fast.  The item is sealed and appears to be brand new.  BUT ... the expiration date is only 2 months from now ~ 4/14!  I only use this product every other day, and sparingly at that, so 3 oz. would normally lasts me a year or longer.  I paid less than five dollars for 3 oz, and about five dollars to ship it, so it&#x27;s not worth shipping back, but I am glad to have the opportunity to write a review and warn others that the price you pay with this seller probably reflects a rapidly approaching expiration date.</li>
            <li> My face is all better!!! I get cystic acne. I exfoliate with crystals then use this. My face is a million times better. I used to wear heavy foundation to cover skin. Now I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using proactiv for well over 10 years. About 3-4 years ago I stopped using the other products and only use the repairing lotion. It works. At least for me. The only product to work for me actually. I dont have acne as of about 5 years ago but kept using it because i kept getting compliments about my skin. Would recommend. Also about the expiration date. Ive used bottles two years past their expiration dates ( i had a small stock pile) and It still worked. I wouldnt worry too much about the expiration date. I only use this at night before I go to sleep. No sun exposure. In the morning I wash it off.</li>
            <li> the only thing that helps my daughters acne.</li>
            <li> Horrible bottle - lid broke within one week of use, green ink rubbed off on my hands and left green dots all over - ugh!  Have used this product successfully for over 10 years, works great!&lt;br /&gt;This packaging is a FAIL - first time I&#x27;ve ever had these problems.  Had to transfer product into the old bottle, which was messy and also lost product.  :-((</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the repairing treatment for a while. I don&#x27;t use the other Proactiv products (or go through the company directly because they require a sort of subscription service and require you to purchase sets of other products), and because their other products Iâ€™ve tried don&#x27;t work very well. But this repairing lotion is great. As a purchaser of dozens of acne treatment products, I am very familiar with them. This is one of my favorites. It goes on smooth, dries fast, and protects against breakouts and/or clears up breakouts. Use it as acne cream (day or night). I wear it under my makeup everyday. Highly recommended for results, but I gave it 4 stars because of the price. This is pretty expensive for a repairing lotion, even though it works.</li>
            <li> best face stuff ever arrived quickley</li>
            <li> Always buy it. It is the best.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, reliable. Love it!</li>
            <li> The only solution for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> its not about the proactive .... the date of validity has expired long time  ago... the seller should be carefull... I noticed few weeks after I was already using this. So upset ;-(</li>
            <li> Always use after washing and keeps skin clear!  luv it</li>
            <li> Works great but not quite perfectly.</li>
            <li> The  wife loves proactiv  products, they work for her.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Clears areas that have been constant problems. Use consistently.</li>
            <li> What I ordered as described</li>
            <li> Helps .y granddaughter</li>
            <li> The only product of any of the series I use.  I used to use them all and slowly filtered the rest out, realizing that none of the others did anything significant for me (especially for the price of all of them).  This gets me the most bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> Product has always lived up to my expectations....long time user since it&#x27;s introduction years ago!</li>
            <li> This is the only product of proactiv that I use. I started off using all 3 steps as a teenager, but this is the only part of the line I still use. I wash with Mary Kay timewise and use this after. I&#x27;m at the in between age of 25. I need to protect my skin, but also need something for acne. This has never dried my skin out, but it isn&#x27;t super moisturing, so if you have dry skin you might need an additional moisturizer. This really controls breakouts.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It works so well for me</li>
            <li> This stuff works as advertised and I recommend it along with its other products. Use it as advertised and your skin will be smoother and have less splotches.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. C.</li>
            <li> This was a rip off . They make it look all big !! It&#x27;s the size of my thumb $43 bucks that&#x27;s complete rip</li>
