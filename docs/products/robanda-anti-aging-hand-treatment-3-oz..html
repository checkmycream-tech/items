            <li>The ingredients sound good, it absorbs quickly and the size of the bottle is perfect for my purse.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling and not greaxy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overly perfumed, probably to cover up the SPF scent, which on its own would be preferable.</li>
            <li>Awesome price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>So many better ones out there!</li>
            <li>This hand cream is one of the best that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best, by far.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, but was hoping it would be much more than a nice sunscreen, but I needed a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot but wish it was more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I would look at it as more of a preventative lotion.  </li>
            <li>I DO love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes hands feel smooth, but did not help with my wrinkly hands.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also just purchased more.</li>
            <li>It does make my hands look better.  </li>
            <li>My mother loves it and keeps requesting more of it.  </li>
            <li>Recommend for sure, a must try.</li>
            <li>Love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>It has a light, creamy texture and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Smells lovely...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this may work if used twice a day.</li>
            <li>Why do manufacturers think more and stronger perfumes are better?</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I love the texture.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li>love it.... smells really good, not too strong, just left my hands feeling like velvet and with a beautiful soft smell.</li>
            <li>Excellent for fading dark spots.  </li>
            <li>Hands and arms are the forgotten part of most people bodies and are the true teller of age.</li>
            <li>Maybe the retinol will help diminish fine lines?  </li>
            <li>I bought it to try to smooth the crepey look that has occurred over time, as well as lighten age spots.</li>
            <li>I am 64 and have great hands and deceiving hands because of my experiments with various types of hand lotions.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant but too too strong for any hand lotion/cream.</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant difference in my hands since using this product.</li>
            <li>I bought the last order in quantity so that I got a good price.</li>
            <li>It works nice so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs fairly quickly</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand cream by far!</li>
            <li>so far its ok.</li>
            <li>I mixed olive oil and sea salt and made a home made scrub and rubbed it for a couple of minutes over my hands, which I had rinsed in warm water.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a good hand lotion, i would suggest you check out other hand lotions, not this one!</li>
            <li>this society, we spend hours and great fortunes on our faces to keep them looking younger and totally forget the rest of our body.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>I purchased this off Ebay to address some fine horizontal lines that developed (seemingly overnight) on my lower hand and wrist area.  </li>
            <li>You see so may healthy, older, pretty faces, and old wrinkled hands and arms.</li>
            <li>I realize it can only do so many things.  </li>
            <li>Did not find much of a difference!</li>
            <li>Love the hand cream, instant results!!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li>The freckles and age spots are DEFINITELY lighter and the skin on my hands seems more luminous.</li>
            <li>price on Amazon is good, and it is decent if you are lacking other options, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, if you have no other spf hand cream options available.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after noticing age spots continually getting worse on the top of my hands but honestly didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for t to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks, the fine lines became deep creases.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for sunscreen for your hands, use your facial cream or sunscreen for face, afterall if its mild enough for your face, then it ok to use on your hands.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizesmiddle-aged hands, and</li>
            <li>It really does what it claim to do.</li>
            <li>This cream is straight up sunscreen with a bit of retinol in it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care as much for the claims of sun screening benefits as much as the age spot fading.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>Too girly for a guy, but doesn&#x27;t compete too much with my perfume.  </li>
            <li>Thanks ~+~</li>
            <li>works better than any other fade cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After all, our arms get more sun than any other part of our body.</li>
            <li>Decent price as well.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes your hands soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t gotten any new age spots either.</li>
            <li>I live in the south</li>
            <li>I did that every day for a week and the lines are nearly gone!  </li>
            <li>Bought this because it seemed the best reviewed, and have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I just put a small amount on the top of one hand and then rub the backs together.</li>
            <li>this lotion has a nice feel and scent and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>If you want to guess the real age of someone, look past that smooth face, and look at their hands.</li>
            <li>They feel dry right after applying it.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say it reverses aging.  </li>
            <li>The skin on the back of my hands is smoother, and the age spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li>My husband always notices my soft hands.  </li>
            <li>My 44 year old daughter, who has started to get spot on her hands, started to use it and has seen improvement.</li>
            <li>As far as lessening brown spots- didn&#x27;t see it after one tube...</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hands so soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it about 10 times and only on he tops of my hands because I don&#x27;t really like the feel of it as a whole hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This cream initially faded my brown spots, but now seems to have stoppedâ€¦.I am still using it and hope after a few more weeks they disappear.</li>
            <li>To me, there is very little scent and what is there is fine with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like old floral and powder, and while not necessarily awful, it&#x27;s just not pleasant for</li>
            <li>Goes on a little greasy but sinking in quickly.</li>
            <li>This is sort of a major fault for me.</li>
            <li>Chemotherapy can make skin dry and thin - very glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li>I have to echo the other positive reviews -</li>
            <li>It left my hands soft and moisturized without any greasiness.  </li>
            <li>I was freaking out about my new old lady hands and started searching for other remedies online.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, this product stinks and is very greasy, like sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really hope it lightens dark spots.  </li>
            <li>Makes hands feel soft; non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t take long to sink in.  </li>
            <li>only complaint -- although it is quite a big one -- is that when it arrived, it wasn&#x27;t completely full.</li>

            <li> It left my hands soft and moisturized without any greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I was freaking out about my new old lady hands and started searching for other remedies online.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, this product stinks and is very greasy, like sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really hope it lightens dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Makes hands feel soft; non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t take long to sink in.  </li>
            <li> only complaint -- although it is quite a big one -- is that when it arrived, it wasn&#x27;t completely full.</li>
            <li> I feel strange returning something that I have opened and used.</li>
            <li> Some people say it makes their hands feel dry.</li>
            <li> It coats the hands with sunscreen and then absorbs leaving my hands feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this was so obvious after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think I only got half a tube of product.</li>
            <li> It made my hands very dry and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your precious money, there are other less expensive hand lotions out there that will do the job.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve always done that, even though I&#x27;ve never really seen a difference.</li>
            <li> Does not perform as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Like any other hand cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s possible</li>
            <li> I use morning and night and for moisturizing during the day I use other hand cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long you&#x27;re supposed to use this product before you notice any results.  </li>
            <li> A long time ago, there was an article that said, you hands don&#x27;t stop at your wrist, so use your hand cream past your wrists.</li>
            <li> It just always leaves this slightly greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> Then there is the lingering feeling of lotion that remains, no matter how little I apply.</li>
            <li> Can tell a little difference just after one day.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago, and used it for a little bit</li>
            <li> -- obviously, I can&#x27;t quite say if my hands are reverting in age or not, but a few pumps definitely completely lather my hands in beneficial sunscreen which can&#x27;t be a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I find it to be quite messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using daily for months and my hands look worse than before I started using.</li>
            <li> so my hands are exposed to sun all year round.  </li>
            <li> A few reviews mentioned not liking the smell.</li>
            <li> Still dry from the winter weather, and skin also now look wrinkly and thin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s caused by the cream or not.</li>
            <li> Just a small dot works for both hands once per day.</li>
            <li> So, I started rubbing the cream all the way to my elbows, and all that creepy wrinkled pre aged look disappeared, immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and not too thick.</li>
            <li> There is only one spot remaining and it is very faint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically impossible to find a hand lotion with sunscreen, so I have reordered it several times.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and I feel as if this is a purchase you have to buy very frequently since it runs out</li>
            <li> but my hands looked 10x worse than they had before!  </li>
            <li> The lotion is very thin and runny</li>
            <li> but it stinks!</li>
            <li> The worst hand lotion i have ever bought!!!Used it for almost a week now, did nothing for my hands.</li>
            <li> But, the worst and biggest turn off for me is the scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this handcream!  I purchased two; one for home and one for work.  It really moisturizesmiddle-aged hands, and I believe that my age spots are fading.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Seems to living up to its claims</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant difference in my hands since using this product. The price is lower than another vendor that I have used.</li>
            <li> I just start using the hand cream for two days now. May be later</li>
            <li> This handcreme has strengthen my nails.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot but wish it was more moisturizing.  I realize it can only do so many things.  It&#x27;s anti-aging but I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say it reverses aging.  I would look at it as more of a preventative lotion.  The ingredients sound good, it absorbs quickly and the size of the bottle is perfect for my purse.</li>
            <li> I am on my third tube and I can see the difference in the color of my age spots on my hands. They are slowly fading. I bought the last order in quantity so that I got a good price. I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my age spots and I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about a year. But I haven&#x27;t gotten any new age spots either. Not sure if that&#x27;s caused by the cream or not.</li>
            <li> works better than any other fade cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It really does what it claim to do.</li>
            <li> i like this-does smell a bit sunsceen-y tho</li>
            <li> Like any other hand cream. Did not find much of a difference!</li>
            <li> Love the hand cream, instant results!!</li>
            <li> I DO love this hand cream. I bought it to try to smooth the crepey look that has occurred over time, as well as lighten age spots. This stuff really does work! The skin on the back of my hands is smoother, and the age spots are much lighter. Some people say it makes their hands feel dry. I only use it on the back of my hands. Just a small dot works for both hands once per day. I also use it on my chest with good results!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes hands feel smooth, but did not help with my wrinkly hands.</li>
            <li> The worst hand lotion i have ever bought!!!Used it for almost a week now, did nothing for my hands. Did not lighten any spots or made any difference. It made my hands very dry and wrinkled. Please dont waste your precious money, there are other less expensive hand lotions out there that will do the job. I was mislead by the reviews and i paid the price for it. If you are looking for sunscreen for your hands, use your facial cream or sunscreen for face, afterall if its mild enough for your face, then it ok to use on your hands. But if you are looking for a good hand lotion, i would suggest you check out other hand lotions, not this one!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is the only hand cream I use on a regular basis.  The age spots on my hands are quite a bit lighter than the ones on my arms.  My husband always notices my soft hands.  Decent price as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My hands look great and I know I am protected when I have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it&#x27;s not that moisturizing so I mixed it with a hand cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I bought two this time because the price was great, however when they arrived the items had expiration dates of 2013 and 2014. Not cool. Hoping they work as well as prior purchases of this product.</li>
            <li> It works nice so far.  I really hope it lightens dark spots.  I wish it were unscented though,  I have allergies to perfume smelling things.&lt;br /&gt;But so far its ok.</li>
            <li> This cream is straight up sunscreen with a bit of retinol in it.  Not moisturizing - It coats the hands with sunscreen and then absorbs leaving my hands feeling dry.  Maybe the retinol will help diminish fine lines?  Three stars for the spf factor.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and not greaxy</li>
            <li> This hand cream is one of the best that I have used so far.  It definitely makes your hands soft and smooth.  I love it! I also just purchased more.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product, but in researching it I came across studies that show retinyl palmitate - an ingredient in this hand cream - seems to increase cancer risks when exposed to sunlight. Just something to consider. You can check out what EWG (The Environmental Working Group) has to say about this topic by going here: http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/the-problem-with-vitamin-a/</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care as much for the claims of sun screening benefits as much as the age spot fading. I was getting quite a few very noticible spots on both my hands. My mother always had called them &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34;.I tried this and am AMAZED at the results. There is only one spot remaining and it is very faint. Don&#x27;t expect overnight results. It takes several weeks of regular use. And my hands are a lot softer, too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. The lotion is very thin and runny so I find it to be quite messy. It also leaves quite a greasy residue on my hands, even 15 minutes after use, I feel like I can&#x27;t touch anything without leaving my fingerprints all over the place. I tried to use a hand sanitizer on my palms after using this, but still I am left with greasy feeling hands. I feel strange returning something that I have opened and used. I will put it in the fridge to help with the runny consistency and use it before bed or when at home. I used it before work this morning and I am leaving hand/finger prints on my folders, yuck!</li>
            <li> Great hand cream and it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long you&#x27;re supposed to use this product before you notice any results.  I purchased this off Ebay to address some fine horizontal lines that developed (seemingly overnight) on my lower hand and wrist area.  After using it for 2 weeks, the fine lines became deep creases.  I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s possible but my hands looked 10x worse than they had before!  On top of that, this product stinks and is very greasy, like sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you what DID work however.  I was freaking out about my new old lady hands and started searching for other remedies online.  I mixed olive oil and sea salt and made a home made scrub and rubbed it for a couple of minutes over my hands, which I had rinsed in warm water.  I did that every day for a week and the lines are nearly gone!  I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li> Robanda is the ONLY hand cream that takes years off my hands.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> I like this hand cream.  It does make my hands look better.  A little goes a long way.  Goes on a little greasy but sinking in quickly. It does have a fragrance but I can see the difference in my hands younger looking.</li>
            <li> Excellent for fading dark spots.  My mother loves it and keeps requesting more of it.  Recommend for sure, a must try.</li>
            <li> Has helped diminish some of the spots on my hands. I would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, if you have no other spf hand cream options available. But, it&#x27;s not my go to hand cream, and I often find myself choosing a non spf just so I don&#x27;t have to use this. For one, it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I would have imagined. This is sort of a major fault for me. Then there is the lingering feeling of lotion that remains, no matter how little I apply. It just always leaves this slightly greasy feel. But, the worst and biggest turn off for me is the scent. It&#x27;s overly perfumed, probably to cover up the SPF scent, which on its own would be preferable. It&#x27;s like old floral and powder, and while not necessarily awful, it&#x27;s just not pleasant for me.&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is good, and it is decent if you are lacking other options, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream. Can tell a little difference just after one day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using daily for months and my hands look worse than before I started using. Still dry from the winter weather, and skin also now look wrinkly and thin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand cream by far! It&#x27;s not sticky, smells great, and has SPF.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Did not see a big difference!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using for many years. It definitely eliminated spots and lighten my skin. People compliment on my hands for the way they look for my age. My 44 year old daughter, who has started to get spot on her hands, started to use it and has seen improvement. I use morning and night and for moisturizing during the day I use other hand cream.</li>
            <li> Makes hands feel soft; non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t take long to sink in.  3 oz airplane-friendly size.</li>
            <li> Just started using this hand cream.  I live in the south so my hands are exposed to sun all year round.  I coudn&#x27;t find a hand cream with spf in the stores so ordered this online.  It has a light, creamy texture and smells nice.  Too girly for a guy, but doesn&#x27;t compete too much with my perfume.  It left my hands soft and moisturized without any greasiness.  I bought it for the sunscreen so if it helps with age spots and wrinkles that will be a bonus.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Very nice.. Smells lovely... Feels divine... Hands rejuvenated after a nightly rub in with product... As far as lessening brown spots- didn&#x27;t see it after one tube...&lt;br /&gt;Excellent ingriedients for softness.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for several years and avoided brown spots and shriveling. This summer my husband started using it and now is a regular</li>
            <li> Used to buy Neutrogenia Anti Aging hand cream, but can no longer find it anywhere.  Bought this because it seemed the best reviewed, and have not been disappointed.  Chemotherapy can make skin dry and thin - very glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about this product sooner!  In my experience (and I&#x27;m finishing my second bottle), it doesn&#x27;t fade brown spots.  It DOES keep further sun damage from occurring.  I use this hand cream daily on my hands and forearms.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and rubs in almost instantly. I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this may work if used twice a day. I&#x27;m having  difficulty using it once a day. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs fairly quickly but it stinks! The smell is not unpleasant but too too strong for any hand lotion/cream. After using this I find myself using a non-perfumy hand cream to cut the scent and 10 minutes or so later washing my hands. Why do manufacturers think more and stronger perfumes are better?</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cream, it seams to absorb immediately so you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot and I use it nearly daily on my hands -- obviously, I can&#x27;t quite say if my hands are reverting in age or not, but a few pumps definitely completely lather my hands in beneficial sunscreen which can&#x27;t be a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint -- although it is quite a big one -- is that when it arrived, it wasn&#x27;t completely full. In fact, I think I only got half a tube of product. I was very disappointed and I feel as if this is a purchase you have to buy very frequently since it runs out quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product but not for the money advertised.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hands so soft.  Awesome price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago, and used it for a little bit and then it got put away and forgotten about. I don&#x27;t believe that I was overly impressed at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks ago, I found it and decided to just use it instead of wasting it. I put it on my hands and rubbed it into part of my wrists. A long time ago, there was an article that said, you hands don&#x27;t stop at your wrist, so use your hand cream past your wrists. Since then, I&#x27;ve always done that, even though I&#x27;ve never really seen a difference. This time, though I did. Wow! The quarter of the way up my arms that I used this lotion, had no wrinkles! I couldn&#x27;t believe this was so obvious after only a few uses. So, I started rubbing the cream all the way to my elbows, and all that creepy wrinkled pre aged look disappeared, immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I used this on my hands and arms just once a day. I rub it all the way up to my shoulders, and rub it in real good. I am really impressed with how the sun aging has stopped. After all, our arms get more sun than any other part of our body. I am over 50, and have removed virtually all the sun darkening and sun wrinkles on my arms in about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reordered a couple bottles and will keep watch for times when I can order in bulk. I have no plans to stop using this any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this society, we spend hours and great fortunes on our faces to keep them looking younger and totally forget the rest of our body. You see so may healthy, older, pretty faces, and old wrinkled hands and arms. If you want to guess the real age of someone, look past that smooth face, and look at their hands. Hands and arms are the forgotten part of most people bodies and are the true teller of age. I, for one, have plans to make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on the back of my hands for about a week. The freckles and age spots are DEFINITELY lighter and the skin on my hands seems more luminous. Not greasy and not too thick. A few reviews mentioned not liking the smell. To me, there is very little scent and what is there is fine with me. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after noticing age spots continually getting worse on the top of my hands but honestly didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for t to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it about 10 times and only on he tops of my hands because I don&#x27;t really like the feel of it as a whole hand moisturizer. The spots are about 50% gone and the others are fading. It seems to work best if I put it on at night after getting in bed. I just put a small amount on the top of one hand and then rub the backs together. I&#x27;m assuming it works best this way because there are hours in between hand washings.</li>
            <li> Trying all types of anti-aging handcreams because the hands truly reveal one&#x27;s age.  I am 64 and have great hands and deceiving hands because of my experiments with various types of hand lotions.  This is one of the best, by far.  Works and moistens as promised.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have to echo the other positive reviews - this lotion has a nice feel and scent and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily before my commute on the backs of my hands and hope that the sun spots I have started to get will indeed start to fade.  Too soon to tell but will give it some time to work.  In the meantime, it&#x27;s a great skin softener if nothing else.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works very good on my hands, the result is excellent :)</li>
            <li> Great hand cream.  I love the texture.  Not greasy at all.  Smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s practically impossible to find a hand lotion with sunscreen, so I have reordered it several times.</li>
            <li> Robanda Anti-Aging Hand Cream  I like it very much, it helps dryness on my hand.  I use it all over my body.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. The best parts being the incredible value and that it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. My hands are drier from using this cream. They feel dry right after applying it. Would NOT recommend this product. So many better ones out there! booo</li>
            <li> good cream , helps also with brown spots on your hands , good price good buy</li>
            <li> This cream initially faded my brown spots, but now seems to have stoppedâ€¦.I am still using it and hope after a few more weeks they disappear.</li>
            <li> Softest hands and reduces age spots.  i love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but was hoping it would be much more than a nice sunscreen, but I needed a sunscreen. Thanks ~+~</li>
            <li> Does not perform as expected. Not moisturizing at all, and rather greasy</li>
            <li> Saw great results within days of using it</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product and deliver.</li>
            <li> love it.... smells really good, not too strong, just left my hands feeling like velvet and with a beautiful soft smell.</li>
