            <li>This is the best chemical free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>both my daughters and myself again feeling good that it is what it claims to be.</li>
            <li>It has so many good reviews!  </li>
            <li>The smell is not the best but definitely not bad.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell great and my hair is so shiny and light!</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair with a lovely lavender scent.</li>

            <li>Their body wash is really good---not the best I have ever used, but really good.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing part of all, I didnt use any conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>, hope it&#x27;ll be more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Manufactures, please keep this quality!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Try this shampoo, you will love it too!</li>
            <li>Leaves Hair nice and shiny plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I even created my own shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love it as much as I loved the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>I liked that i could pronounce everything on yhe ingrediant list.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of not putting all the chemicals found in shampoo on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice to not have those chemicals in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up nice and cleans my hair</li>
            <li>It used to have a nice lather but not anymore.</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk....</li>
            <li>Smells great, no weird chemicals, and my hair looks and feels good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo turned out to be the BEST shampoo I have ever used on my 58 year old head!  </li>
            <li>These folks are onto something good, because this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that my hair looks any better, but it certainly is nice knowing that you do not dump chemicals on your head.</li>
            <li>After all, I think this shampoo is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>It came well protected and shampoo&#x27;s good and comfortably.</li>
            <li>and I love how it&#x27;s been kind to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful all natural shampoo</li>
            <li>and I liked it but wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied</li>
            <li>My hair looks as good, and sometimes better, than when I used Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I did warn them it smelled strong, but I liked the way my hair turned out with it.</li>
            <li>On top of this, after just one washing, the frizziness of my hair was reduced by about 80%.  </li>
            <li>We both love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:  I love the scent and even wish it was stronger.  </li>
            <li>Many guys think that they are losing hair because the age or because their genetic load...</li>
            <li>However many do not know that perhaps they are losing hair because the type of soap and/or shampoo they are using.</li>
            <li>Most of shampoo brands are utilizing many chemical compounds in their formula and that affects the scalp pH, the hairâ€™s consistency and structure.</li>
            <li>i personally love this product.</li>
            <li>I also found that my hair was more manageable after each use.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin, lips and insides feel after using all of these.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE this shampoo</li>
            <li>OKay</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Not insanely thicker</li>
            <li>It ended up being fantastic!</li>
            <li>Many SLS shampoos I have tried feel like I am rubbing condition into my hair</li>
            <li>My hair felt much more moisturized and was thicker when using this product.  </li>
            <li>just bought 6 bottles more.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t feel this shampoo is any better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos have the SLS which just keeps it going.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work and is better for me.</li>
            <li>So I use Organic Excellence shampoo in between washings with this (love that shampoo too).</li>
            <li>This shampoo is okay</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the conditioner and love that too.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but my hair would get greasy between washes.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels hydrated and healthy.  </li>
            <li>this is the most import for my hai.</li>
            <li>Love the way this product makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the company can see this comment and make the product line better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely -love-</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo...</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>But for my daughter it seems to work better</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser noticed how healthy my hair has become.  </li>
            <li>When a friend told me about Fundamental Shampoo I got very excited.</li>
            <li>Yes, its natural and good for you, NO it does not make your hair feel nice.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo (the conditioner is also a must if you have fine hair).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and shiny, and my natural highlights come through bright and lovely!  </li>
            <li>The smell was too strong for me, I typically love lavender scent, I read the reviews, about the smell being strong, but thought I would give it a try any way.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s a great shampoo</li>
            <li>This shampoo wasn&#x27;t a good match for me because my hair got very squeaky with the washing and lathering.  </li>
            <li>I follow with my rinse of apple cider vinegar (1 part vinegar, 1 part water in a squirt bottle), and my hair is beautiful and shiney-not oily and not dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean and residue free.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, mostly neutral, and most importantly it cleans my hair well and leaves it soft and light without conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I have to use detangler to spray on the hair to comb easily.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is easy to spread and use.  </li>
            <li>I love this about it, because it gets my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>FYI Wen has been the best shampoo for my hair so far, and that is basically like washing your hair with straight conditioner, but I can&#x27;t stand the company&#x27;s ordering process and customer service.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well for an all natural shampoo, and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>the person who did my hair couldn&#x27;t believe how strong and glossy my hair came out after the treatment.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, its mild lavender, not too strong at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is fine.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest shift to a Chemical Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise it was to read the natural ingredients found in Fundamental Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Right away I was first impressed with the ingredients, all things I know and all completely natural.</li>
            <li>Once I started using this shampoo, within a couple washes I noticed  a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>But he&#x27;s been using it and his hair is smooth and shinny.  </li>
            <li>and yeah these are important causes.</li>
            <li>Still, I didn&#x27;t give up in.my search as chemical free products are important to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally free of all harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shampoos, every brand both sulfate free, with sulfates, smoothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pinchpenny who doesn&#x27;t like spending more than $2 at a time, but this was worth it.</li>
            <li>It is low to almost no odor or fragrance which is great.</li>
            <li>I like that it is Chemical Free.</li>
            <li>The next time I used it, I loved it, and now, after having used it for a month--I love both and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>It a good natural product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their conditioner seems to work fine, but doesn&#x27;t get me as excited as their shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I love love love this for a facial and body cleanser!  </li>
            <li>with my first couple washes I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it</li>
            <li>I thought this was awesome when I found this brand but not sure if I would buy these two (shampoo &amp; conditioner) again for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great all natural product that really works.  </li>
            <li>Until they bring back the old, wonderful, and moisturizing formula this review</li>
            <li>How on earth do you clean oily hair with oil?</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so clean, way cleaner than on a baking soda method.</li>
            <li>My hair does feel clean, but it&#x27;s squeaky clean; therefore, I can&#x27;t get a comb through</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very happy to finally find a truly natural product.</li>
            <li>My hair certainly has more body to it and is easier to style.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about this.</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients carefully on the information page here on amazon and it looked great..</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product due to its great reviews.</li>
            <li>Leave my hair nice and soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It smells like lavendar and sweet pine and rain.</li>
            <li>I do feel I need to use more because SLS-free shampoos does not lather as much as SLS shampoos.</li>
            <li>In the end, after drying, hair feels nice and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>Trying to lather my very squeaky hair seemed to do more damage than benefit.  </li>
            <li>I use an apple cider vinegar rinse afterward and love the results in my naturally very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole family and they all love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo, I won&#x27;t use anything else and love that it is entirely organic and chemical free.</li>
            <li>It had a light fresh feeling yet looked shiny and full.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please bring back the original formula that was great and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great smelling as other shampoos</li>
            <li>Hair and scalp seem better, but will it make me handsome and 20 years younger?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first bottle, my first bottle of many.</li>
            <li>Wife is pregnant and she enjoys the scent.</li>
            <li>The result of this shampoo is super.  </li>
            <li>Butttt I could barely run a brush through it and it didn&#x27;t look or feel nice.</li>
            <li>It is the first chemical free shampoo I have tried that didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m aware of the importance of using sulfate free shampoo, I find this one to be easy to lather and gentle on your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite all natural shampoo!</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Most of all, I absolutely love the smell and how it makes my hair feel clean without being weighed down by aweful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I really like the idea that this is a chemical free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy/curly hair and for my hair to be more curly than frizzy it need lots of natural oil and moisture.</li>
            <li>so I never, ever have written a review for anything before but this one is worth the time.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it so far.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when switching from chemical shampoo to a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair still looks soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>have strong, healthy hair for long time.</li>
            <li>The delivery and packaging were also just right.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this shampoo to lather as much as traditional shampoos, but, once again, I was pleasantly surprised that there was a nice, creamy lather that was soothing to the scalp and easy to work throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>Also ,  your hair has that squeaky clean  feeling and rinses out really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you want a genuine organic shampoo.</li>
            <li>It had to be free of toxic chemicals and use only pure 100% organic healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>Been searching far and wide for a really good SLS free shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s chemically clean, it smells amazing, it cleans without weighing down or leaving buildup...</li>
            <li>I have tried other natural shampoos and like this one the best by far.</li>
            <li>Gentle and mild with no fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you have fine or dry hair, you need to leave the shampoo in for a full minute, and you need to use the conditioner and leave it in for the full 2 minutes (and comb your hair while the conditioner is in it--that helps).</li>
            <li>This shampoo seemed to be very promising.</li>
            <li>The shampoo on it&#x27;s own left my hair feeling clean and healthy, but because my hair is so dry, I tried adding a few drops of natural avocado oil to the shampoo today and it responded very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Plus it is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Definetly love the fact that this is made in America and it is basically checmical free, other than using the soapification product.</li>
            <li>no harsh chemicals, no perfumed smell--it smells clean and fresh, and thicker and shinier hair.  </li>
            <li>The second time (using a little more product than the first time) my hair felt clean, shiny and soft - really nice!</li>
            <li>This is not fake lavender.  </li>
            <li>Many brands make testing in animals and compounds like SLS and Polysorbates that have been demonstrated its toxicity hence you can imagine what those chemicals can make in a human scalp.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I came across this shampoo and decided to try it, purchasing a travel size first from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I now use the conditioner as a shampoo/conditioner, and love it (I wrote a different review on the conditioner listing)&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it took my hair</li>
            <li>Lathers really well!</li>
            <li>Thanks Fundamental!</li>
            <li>I know exactly what he means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not go hot about the lavender smell</li>
            <li>If you have great thick hair you might get away with using this</li>
            <li>glad i only bought the sample sizes.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method (baking soda as &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and apple cider vinegar as &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>And it works really well!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the shampoo (and conditioner)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I only bought the travel-size shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Other thing I suggest is avoid the use of any kind of styling grease or setting lotion because that will accelerate the hair lose.</li>
            <li>Shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Removes all residue and leaves hair naturally shiny and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>They display a FULL List of natural ingredients on the site, to view before buying.</li>
            <li>but this one makes a nice thick rich lather and covers my hair well without having to use too much.</li>
            <li>and at first I loved it because it seemed like the perfect antidote to all of the natural shampoos that were making my hair feel oily and sticky, but sadly things have moved too far in the other direction and now with this stuff I have straw-like hair with a lot of dandruff..</li>
            <li>This product put my hair more dry.</li>
            <li>Makes his hair and beard super soft.</li>
            <li>When using this product, you&#x27;re going to want to use a good conditioner if your hair is long enough to tangle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see in any of the reviews I read that it had such a strong smell.</li>
            <li>shampoo is very gentle on your scalp and I am not afraid to use it everyday unlike ordinary shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, leaves your hair fresh and clean, and is totally natural!</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li>I then bought a bottle for my father--who constantly complains of itching--and his first comment was he &#x27;couldn&#x27;t believe how clean it made his head feel.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I have fragile, straight, fine hair that is prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li>Fundamental really came through on that.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels healthier, I swear my hair grows twice as fast when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>In the beginning it won&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really cleaning your hair</li>
            <li>I also find when I use this shampoo i dont have as much hair fall, as my hair was thinning quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this stuff and, although I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a shampoo I&#x27;d never even heard of before, I decided to give this stuff a go anyway.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product I have found that I feel is truly chemical free.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was really worried about the hair loss and dandruff</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m trying to let you know is my real thoughts about this product, and you can tell I&#x27;m not hired by the company to write this review.</li>
            <li>I did extensive searching for TRULY chemical free hair care and found this.</li>
            <li>and it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>I did not massage it in very well, and I did not leave it on my hair for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really for my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>finally found  a shampoo that has nothing toxic in it, tried many that claim they are natural</li>
            <li>so finding something that will meet my needs is quite challenging, This left my hair feeling very clean and smelling wonderful, without all the awful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I had been using popular brand shampoos for all my life and when I started to learn more about the harm of sulfates and other gross ingredients in soaps and shampoos I became an instant convert.</li>
            <li>First all natural shampoo that CLEANS your hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is still struggling to get back to its original fullness and luster.</li>
            <li>You do need to use more than with &amp;#34;the other guys&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it actually made my scalp feel clean.  </li>
            <li>It looks almost as good as it does freshly washed, regardless of whether I rinse and blow dry again or skip getting it wet entirely.  </li>
            <li>I decided to switch to a chemical free shampoo after I noticed my hair look so dry and damage.  </li>
            <li>I like the chemical-free aspect, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help resolve my particular issue.</li>
            <li>My hair is vibrant again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, although a bit on the spendy sideâ€¦</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t give the 5 stars because the price is a bit high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and I will buy again.  </li>
            <li>now read the ingredients of every product I buy, because many products have a natural name like \\&quot;Organic Aloe Vera Splendor Shampoo\\&quot;, but looking at the ingredients may show ammonium lauryl sulfate, a bunch of other chemicals and maybe 5% aloe vera lotion.  </li>
            <li>It actually gets your hair clean (not exactly the squeaky clean like chemical shampoos do but just one step below that-</li>
            <li>It lathers really well too for a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean without leaving it dry or straw like.</li>
            <li>Recently I really tried to switch to natural products.</li>
            <li>a normal shampoo would have.  </li>
            <li>It is totally dried out, feels like straw and is falling out more than ever.  </li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but would suggest it to someone who have greasier then normal hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair just as clean as other SLS shampoos but much softer</li>
            <li>It gets weighed down and oily quicky and easily.</li>
            <li>I have tried making my own in the past with major failures.</li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>My hair was SUPER dry</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding a natural shampoo that really didn&#x27;t contain all the toxic chemicals found in most shampoos.</li>
            <li>:  Leave the shampoo in for extra time after lathering it, it really does moisturize your hair!  </li>
            <li>Other than wishing I could afford it on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is the cost... why do all the better for you products have to be so much more expensive?</li>
            <li>This had ALL natural ingredients and appeared to be low in salt which is important for water that will subsequently be applied to trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner works pretty well too but has a different smell than that of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint for the first rinse and this for the second - lasts longer that way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that many of the &#x27;natural shampoos&#x27; are misleading and when they say they don&#x27;t have sodium lauryl sulfate, they&#x27;ll often use sodium laureth sulfate or some other similarly harmful chemical.</li>
            <li>the smell is kind of different, compared to my past purchase.</li>
            <li>Will be my new regular shampoo for the whole household.</li>
            <li>if only this could be a little more hydrating</li>
            <li>I found similar performance, scent, and chemically purity at a much more modest price and thicker consistency (so a little product goes a lot farther) with Beauty Without Cruelty&#x27;s Lavender Higlands shampoo.</li>
            <li>Pity the larger salon bottles with pump don&#x27;t seem available on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, those who aren&#x27;t used to natural scents won&#x27;t like howauthentic it is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used natural castile soaps for some time</li>
            <li>They really shouldn&#x27;t market this as a solution for such issues.</li>
            <li>For years I have tried every natural shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Stripped my hair of all natural oils.</li>
            <li>Looking for a solution to our problem I went the all-natural route, believing that our problems were rooted in the chemical used in the most common store-bought</li>
            <li>Bought this because I &#x27;m looking for natural shampoo as well as conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>fundamental brand leaves my hair: soft, shiny, manageable without any greasy feeling, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so naturally soft.</li>
            <li>It is the cheapest completely and truly all-natural cleanser out there.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers quite well, and works even on my 5-year old.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this on my 2yr old daughter as well.</li>
            <li>once I received the item I went to the shower and used it and immediately noticed that it lathers very well which is a red flag as all SLS-Free shampoos don&#x27;t lather well at all ..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want chemicals in my hair, and it has none--all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This natural shampoo is truly natural.  </li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that it does create a lather, but if you&#x27;re not used to natural shampoo methods it is not the lather you get from chemical based shampoos, no worries.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the fundamental conditioner and my oily hair has completely changed texture.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are saponified olive oil, saponified coconut oil and all natural ingredients (except for biotin and niacin which are vitamins).  </li>
            <li>My hair did have body with this shampoo, and it felt soft after I sprayed in my leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>I try to keep as much chemicals out of my families lives as possible.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love it, but my Dad has started using it (since he has had trouble with hair falling and dandruff) and his dandruff has went away and his hair does not fall out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to order this one regularly, as I think the price is right.</li>
            <li>so I try a lot of organic shampoos, and this made my hair pretty dry.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my hair, I thought it felt really dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long, extremely fine, and trying to bounce back from my last pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I have tried about 3 or 4 different shampoos (the only ones I could find that had recognizable and completely natural) ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair, and this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, natural or otherwise, that allows me to skip a day of washing without my hair getting limp and greasy by the end of the 2nd day.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped and used apple cider vinegar to clarify my strands, all the sticky weird gunk that was on my hair and scalp was gone, and for the first time in a couple months I was able to run my fingers through my hair without having to wash my hands after.</li>
            <li>Tends to dry it out a little more</li>
            <li>The shampoo left a residue in my hair that made me hate touching my own hair.</li>
            <li>I only have to wash it every 3 days instead of daily, which has in turn made it much healthier.</li>
            <li>I used every brand and kind and would at times go back to regular shampoos because I felt like the natural shampoos were not really cleaning my hair or making it look dull and mousy.</li>
            <li>We have only used the product once, but so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li>I like that it is not ridiculously priced like Nature&#x27;s Paradise or other natural products.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is really clarifying so that&#x27;s why it has a tendency to dry my hair out if I use it daily.</li>
            <li>I have tried no poo, other natural shampoos and tons of conventional shampoos and always felt that my hair only looked clean the day of washing.  </li>
            <li>I like that this product is SLS free, but it really strips my hair pretty bad.</li>
            <li>Compounding this issue, I have a young son who has the same type of skin, who began having similar issues that I fought with all my life.  </li>
            <li>I switched back to my old Aubrey Blue Chamomile.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came in larger sized bottles because it does go quick, and the price is hefty, but it is one of the few things I will pay extra for.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for a week or so now, and I was a little unsure at first.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and it is different then other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other natural shampoos, this one leaves your hair feeling soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as it used to, therefore I wash my hair less often now.</li>
            <li>Yes, my hair did feel soft when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>This is a little pricey for me but a lot less than many other shampoos you will find at beauty stores that have SLS listed as the second ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry hair and previously was using another natural shampoo without conditioner at all.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to part with the scent, which I love so much that I mix in a little each wash.</li>

            <li> The smell isnt the greatest but than again if you are trying to find a chemical free product its not gonna smell all that great.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Try this shampoo, you will love it too!</li>
            <li> Leaves Hair nice and shiny plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I even created my own shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love it as much as I loved the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> I liked that i could pronounce everything on yhe ingrediant list.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of not putting all the chemicals found in shampoo on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice to not have those chemicals in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up nice and cleans my hair</li>
            <li> It used to have a nice lather but not anymore.</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk....</li>
            <li> Smells great, no weird chemicals, and my hair looks and feels good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo turned out to be the BEST shampoo I have ever used on my 58 year old head!  </li>
            <li> These folks are onto something good, because this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that my hair looks any better, but it certainly is nice knowing that you do not dump chemicals on your head.</li>
            <li> After all, I think this shampoo is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> It came well protected and shampoo&#x27;s good and comfortably.</li>
            <li> and I love how it&#x27;s been kind to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful all natural shampoo</li>
            <li> and I liked it but wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied</li>
            <li> My hair looks as good, and sometimes better, than when I used Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I did warn them it smelled strong, but I liked the way my hair turned out with it.</li>
            <li> On top of this, after just one washing, the frizziness of my hair was reduced by about 80%.  </li>
            <li> We both love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :  I love the scent and even wish it was stronger.  </li>
            <li> Many guys think that they are losing hair because the age or because their genetic load...</li>
            <li> However many do not know that perhaps they are losing hair because the type of soap and/or shampoo they are using.</li>
            <li> Most of shampoo brands are utilizing many chemical compounds in their formula and that affects the scalp pH, the hairâ€™s consistency and structure.</li>
            <li> i personally love this product.</li>
            <li> I also found that my hair was more manageable after each use.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin, lips and insides feel after using all of these.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE this shampoo</li>
            <li> OKay</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Not insanely thicker</li>
            <li> It ended up being fantastic!</li>
            <li> Many SLS shampoos I have tried feel like I am rubbing condition into my hair</li>
            <li> My hair felt much more moisturized and was thicker when using this product.  </li>
            <li> just bought 6 bottles more.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t feel this shampoo is any better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos have the SLS which just keeps it going.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work and is better for me.</li>
            <li> So I use Organic Excellence shampoo in between washings with this (love that shampoo too).</li>
            <li> This shampoo is okay</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the conditioner and love that too.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but my hair would get greasy between washes.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels hydrated and healthy.  </li>
            <li> this is the most import for my hai.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, the company can see this comment and make the product line better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely -love-</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo...</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> But for my daughter it seems to work better</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser noticed how healthy my hair has become.  </li>
            <li> When a friend told me about Fundamental Shampoo I got very excited.</li>
            <li> Yes, its natural and good for you, NO it does not make your hair feel nice.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo (the conditioner is also a must if you have fine hair).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and shiny, and my natural highlights come through bright and lovely!  </li>
            <li> The smell was too strong for me, I typically love lavender scent, I read the reviews, about the smell being strong, but thought I would give it a try any way.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s a great shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo wasn&#x27;t a good match for me because my hair got very squeaky with the washing and lathering.  </li>
            <li> I follow with my rinse of apple cider vinegar (1 part vinegar, 1 part water in a squirt bottle), and my hair is beautiful and shiney-not oily and not dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels very clean and residue free.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, mostly neutral, and most importantly it cleans my hair well and leaves it soft and light without conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I have to use detangler to spray on the hair to comb easily.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is easy to spread and use.  </li>
            <li> I love this about it, because it gets my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> FYI Wen has been the best shampoo for my hair so far, and that is basically like washing your hair with straight conditioner, but I can&#x27;t stand the company&#x27;s ordering process and customer service.</li>
            <li> It lathers really well for an all natural shampoo, and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> the person who did my hair couldn&#x27;t believe how strong and glossy my hair came out after the treatment.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, its mild lavender, not too strong at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is fine.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest shift to a Chemical Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise it was to read the natural ingredients found in Fundamental Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Right away I was first impressed with the ingredients, all things I know and all completely natural.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this shampoo, within a couple washes I noticed  a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> But he&#x27;s been using it and his hair is smooth and shinny.  </li>
            <li> and yeah these are important causes.</li>
            <li> Still, I didn&#x27;t give up in.my search as chemical free products are important to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally free of all harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shampoos, every brand both sulfate free, with sulfates, smoothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pinchpenny who doesn&#x27;t like spending more than $2 at a time, but this was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is low to almost no odor or fragrance which is great.</li>
            <li> I like that it is Chemical Free.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it, I loved it, and now, after having used it for a month--I love both and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> It a good natural product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their conditioner seems to work fine, but doesn&#x27;t get me as excited as their shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I love love love this for a facial and body cleanser!  </li>
            <li> with my first couple washes I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it</li>
            <li> I thought this was awesome when I found this brand but not sure if I would buy these two (shampoo &amp; conditioner) again for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great all natural product that really works.  </li>
            <li> Until they bring back the old, wonderful, and moisturizing formula this review</li>
            <li> How on earth do you clean oily hair with oil?</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so clean, way cleaner than on a baking soda method.</li>
            <li> My hair does feel clean, but it&#x27;s squeaky clean; therefore, I can&#x27;t get a comb through</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very happy to finally find a truly natural product.</li>
            <li> My hair certainly has more body to it and is easier to style.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special about this.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients carefully on the information page here on amazon and it looked great..</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product due to its great reviews.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair nice and soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It smells like lavendar and sweet pine and rain.</li>
            <li> I do feel I need to use more because SLS-free shampoos does not lather as much as SLS shampoos.</li>
            <li> In the end, after drying, hair feels nice and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> Trying to lather my very squeaky hair seemed to do more damage than benefit.  </li>
            <li> I use an apple cider vinegar rinse afterward and love the results in my naturally very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole family and they all love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, I won&#x27;t use anything else and love that it is entirely organic and chemical free.</li>
            <li> It had a light fresh feeling yet looked shiny and full.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please bring back the original formula that was great and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great smelling as other shampoos</li>
            <li> Hair and scalp seem better, but will it make me handsome and 20 years younger?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first bottle, my first bottle of many.</li>
            <li> Wife is pregnant and she enjoys the scent.</li>
            <li> The result of this shampoo is super.  </li>
            <li> Butttt I could barely run a brush through it and it didn&#x27;t look or feel nice.</li>
            <li> It is the first chemical free shampoo I have tried that didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m aware of the importance of using sulfate free shampoo, I find this one to be easy to lather and gentle on your hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite all natural shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Most of all, I absolutely love the smell and how it makes my hair feel clean without being weighed down by aweful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I really like the idea that this is a chemical free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy/curly hair and for my hair to be more curly than frizzy it need lots of natural oil and moisture.</li>
            <li> so I never, ever have written a review for anything before but this one is worth the time.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it so far.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when switching from chemical shampoo to a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair still looks soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> have strong, healthy hair for long time.</li>
            <li> The delivery and packaging were also just right.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this shampoo to lather as much as traditional shampoos, but, once again, I was pleasantly surprised that there was a nice, creamy lather that was soothing to the scalp and easy to work throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> Also ,  your hair has that squeaky clean  feeling and rinses out really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want a genuine organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> It had to be free of toxic chemicals and use only pure 100% organic healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Been searching far and wide for a really good SLS free shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chemically clean, it smells amazing, it cleans without weighing down or leaving buildup...</li>
            <li> I have tried other natural shampoos and like this one the best by far.</li>
            <li> Gentle and mild with no fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you have fine or dry hair, you need to leave the shampoo in for a full minute, and you need to use the conditioner and leave it in for the full 2 minutes (and comb your hair while the conditioner is in it--that helps).</li>
            <li> This shampoo seemed to be very promising.</li>
            <li> The shampoo on it&#x27;s own left my hair feeling clean and healthy, but because my hair is so dry, I tried adding a few drops of natural avocado oil to the shampoo today and it responded very nicely.  </li>
            <li> Plus it is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Definetly love the fact that this is made in America and it is basically checmical free, other than using the soapification product.</li>
            <li> no harsh chemicals, no perfumed smell--it smells clean and fresh, and thicker and shinier hair.  </li>
            <li> The second time (using a little more product than the first time) my hair felt clean, shiny and soft - really nice!</li>
            <li> This is not fake lavender.  </li>
            <li> Many brands make testing in animals and compounds like SLS and Polysorbates that have been demonstrated its toxicity hence you can imagine what those chemicals can make in a human scalp.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I came across this shampoo and decided to try it, purchasing a travel size first from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I now use the conditioner as a shampoo/conditioner, and love it (I wrote a different review on the conditioner listing)&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first it took my hair</li>
            <li> Lathers really well!</li>
            <li> Thanks Fundamental!</li>
            <li> I know exactly what he means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not go hot about the lavender smell</li>
            <li> If you have great thick hair you might get away with using this</li>
            <li> glad i only bought the sample sizes.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method (baking soda as &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and apple cider vinegar as &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> And it works really well!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo (and conditioner)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I only bought the travel-size shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Other thing I suggest is avoid the use of any kind of styling grease or setting lotion because that will accelerate the hair lose.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Removes all residue and leaves hair naturally shiny and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> They display a FULL List of natural ingredients on the site, to view before buying.</li>
            <li> but this one makes a nice thick rich lather and covers my hair well without having to use too much.</li>
            <li> and at first I loved it because it seemed like the perfect antidote to all of the natural shampoos that were making my hair feel oily and sticky, but sadly things have moved too far in the other direction and now with this stuff I have straw-like hair with a lot of dandruff..</li>
            <li> This product put my hair more dry.</li>
            <li> Makes his hair and beard super soft.</li>
            <li> When using this product, you&#x27;re going to want to use a good conditioner if your hair is long enough to tangle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see in any of the reviews I read that it had such a strong smell.</li>
            <li> shampoo is very gentle on your scalp and I am not afraid to use it everyday unlike ordinary shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, leaves your hair fresh and clean, and is totally natural!</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li> I then bought a bottle for my father--who constantly complains of itching--and his first comment was he &#x27;couldn&#x27;t believe how clean it made his head feel.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I have fragile, straight, fine hair that is prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li> Fundamental really came through on that.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels healthier, I swear my hair grows twice as fast when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> In the beginning it won&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really cleaning your hair</li>
            <li> I also find when I use this shampoo i dont have as much hair fall, as my hair was thinning quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this stuff and, although I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a shampoo I&#x27;d never even heard of before, I decided to give this stuff a go anyway.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product I have found that I feel is truly chemical free.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was really worried about the hair loss and dandruff</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m trying to let you know is my real thoughts about this product, and you can tell I&#x27;m not hired by the company to write this review.</li>
            <li> I did extensive searching for TRULY chemical free hair care and found this.</li>
            <li> and it really does what it says.</li>
            <li> I did not massage it in very well, and I did not leave it on my hair for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really for my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> finally found  a shampoo that has nothing toxic in it, tried many that claim they are natural</li>
            <li> so finding something that will meet my needs is quite challenging, This left my hair feeling very clean and smelling wonderful, without all the awful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I had been using popular brand shampoos for all my life and when I started to learn more about the harm of sulfates and other gross ingredients in soaps and shampoos I became an instant convert.</li>
            <li> First all natural shampoo that CLEANS your hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is still struggling to get back to its original fullness and luster.</li>
            <li> You do need to use more than with &amp;#34;the other guys&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it actually made my scalp feel clean.  </li>
            <li> It looks almost as good as it does freshly washed, regardless of whether I rinse and blow dry again or skip getting it wet entirely.  </li>
            <li> I decided to switch to a chemical free shampoo after I noticed my hair look so dry and damage.  </li>
            <li> I like the chemical-free aspect, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help resolve my particular issue.</li>
            <li> My hair is vibrant again.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, although a bit on the spendy sideâ€¦</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t give the 5 stars because the price is a bit high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and I will buy again.  </li>
            <li> now read the ingredients of every product I buy, because many products have a natural name like \\&quot;Organic Aloe Vera Splendor Shampoo\\&quot;, but looking at the ingredients may show ammonium lauryl sulfate, a bunch of other chemicals and maybe 5% aloe vera lotion.  </li>
            <li> It actually gets your hair clean (not exactly the squeaky clean like chemical shampoos do but just one step below that-</li>
            <li> It lathers really well too for a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean without leaving it dry or straw like.</li>
            <li> Recently I really tried to switch to natural products.</li>
            <li> a normal shampoo would have.  </li>
            <li> It is totally dried out, feels like straw and is falling out more than ever.  </li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but would suggest it to someone who have greasier then normal hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair just as clean as other SLS shampoos but much softer</li>
            <li> It gets weighed down and oily quicky and easily.</li>
            <li> I have tried making my own in the past with major failures.</li>
            <li> but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> My hair was SUPER dry</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a natural shampoo that really didn&#x27;t contain all the toxic chemicals found in most shampoos.</li>
            <li> :  Leave the shampoo in for extra time after lathering it, it really does moisturize your hair!  </li>
            <li> Other than wishing I could afford it on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the cost... why do all the better for you products have to be so much more expensive?</li>
            <li> This had ALL natural ingredients and appeared to be low in salt which is important for water that will subsequently be applied to trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner works pretty well too but has a different smell than that of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint for the first rinse and this for the second - lasts longer that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that many of the &#x27;natural shampoos&#x27; are misleading and when they say they don&#x27;t have sodium lauryl sulfate, they&#x27;ll often use sodium laureth sulfate or some other similarly harmful chemical.</li>
            <li> the smell is kind of different, compared to my past purchase.</li>
            <li> Will be my new regular shampoo for the whole household.</li>
            <li> if only this could be a little more hydrating</li>
            <li> I found similar performance, scent, and chemically purity at a much more modest price and thicker consistency (so a little product goes a lot farther) with Beauty Without Cruelty&#x27;s Lavender Higlands shampoo.</li>
            <li> Pity the larger salon bottles with pump don&#x27;t seem available on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, those who aren&#x27;t used to natural scents won&#x27;t like howauthentic it is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural castile soaps for some time</li>
            <li> They really shouldn&#x27;t market this as a solution for such issues.</li>
            <li> For years I have tried every natural shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Stripped my hair of all natural oils.</li>
            <li> Looking for a solution to our problem I went the all-natural route, believing that our problems were rooted in the chemical used in the most common store-bought</li>
            <li> Bought this because I &#x27;m looking for natural shampoo as well as conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> fundamental brand leaves my hair: soft, shiny, manageable without any greasy feeling, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so naturally soft.</li>
            <li> It is the cheapest completely and truly all-natural cleanser out there.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers quite well, and works even on my 5-year old.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this on my 2yr old daughter as well.</li>
            <li> once I received the item I went to the shower and used it and immediately noticed that it lathers very well which is a red flag as all SLS-Free shampoos don&#x27;t lather well at all ..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want chemicals in my hair, and it has none--all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This natural shampoo is truly natural.  </li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that it does create a lather, but if you&#x27;re not used to natural shampoo methods it is not the lather you get from chemical based shampoos, no worries.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the fundamental conditioner and my oily hair has completely changed texture.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are saponified olive oil, saponified coconut oil and all natural ingredients (except for biotin and niacin which are vitamins).  </li>
            <li> My hair did have body with this shampoo, and it felt soft after I sprayed in my leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> I try to keep as much chemicals out of my families lives as possible.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love it, but my Dad has started using it (since he has had trouble with hair falling and dandruff) and his dandruff has went away and his hair does not fall out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to order this one regularly, as I think the price is right.</li>
            <li> so I try a lot of organic shampoos, and this made my hair pretty dry.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed my hair, I thought it felt really dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, extremely fine, and trying to bounce back from my last pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 3 or 4 different shampoos (the only ones I could find that had recognizable and completely natural) ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair, and this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, natural or otherwise, that allows me to skip a day of washing without my hair getting limp and greasy by the end of the 2nd day.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped and used apple cider vinegar to clarify my strands, all the sticky weird gunk that was on my hair and scalp was gone, and for the first time in a couple months I was able to run my fingers through my hair without having to wash my hands after.</li>
            <li> Tends to dry it out a little more</li>
            <li> The shampoo left a residue in my hair that made me hate touching my own hair.</li>
            <li> I only have to wash it every 3 days instead of daily, which has in turn made it much healthier.</li>
            <li> I used every brand and kind and would at times go back to regular shampoos because I felt like the natural shampoos were not really cleaning my hair or making it look dull and mousy.</li>
            <li> We have only used the product once, but so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not ridiculously priced like Nature&#x27;s Paradise or other natural products.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is really clarifying so that&#x27;s why it has a tendency to dry my hair out if I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have tried no poo, other natural shampoos and tons of conventional shampoos and always felt that my hair only looked clean the day of washing.  </li>
            <li> I like that this product is SLS free, but it really strips my hair pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Compounding this issue, I have a young son who has the same type of skin, who began having similar issues that I fought with all my life.  </li>
            <li> I switched back to my old Aubrey Blue Chamomile.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came in larger sized bottles because it does go quick, and the price is hefty, but it is one of the few things I will pay extra for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a week or so now, and I was a little unsure at first.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal and it is different then other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other natural shampoos, this one leaves your hair feeling soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as it used to, therefore I wash my hair less often now.</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair did feel soft when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> This is a little pricey for me but a lot less than many other shampoos you will find at beauty stores that have SLS listed as the second ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry hair and previously was using another natural shampoo without conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to part with the scent, which I love so much that I mix in a little each wash.</li>
            <li> I also bought other couple natural shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Other natural shampoos leave my hair oily and it feels like I never washed it.</li>
            <li> The price however is a little high in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I now use hemp hydrating shampoo, which works the same but far less drying.</li>
            <li> but it is not for my hair because I had Keratine and brazilian treatment in the past and I have very damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo removes all of that and leaves my hair very straw like and hard to style, even with extra leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I seriously feel like I can eventually wash my hair every other day with this, something that I haven&#x27;t done since I was wearing light up shoes and puffy pink tulle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same lathery shampoo experience as with other shampoos (because of its lack of chemicals) but it gets the job done and there is no residue left over.</li>
            <li> We took it camping and it lathered very well, but at our house where we have hard water we get about a quarter of the lather</li>
            <li> few notes for those who haven&#x27;t used natural shampoo before:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long</li>
            <li> I have historically had very dry itchy skin, and after taking a shower, the skin on my forehead and scalp would always dry our and crack/flake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly hard on my hair, but it&#x27;s usually frizzy</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-20s and already having thinning hair and rapidly so I am always looking for good organic shampoos, this one seemed like from heaven as every organic shampoo I have used before had some sort of hidden bad ingredient ..</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry already and I feel like it strips my hair of any moisture.</li>
            <li> my hair felt stripped and dry, like when I&#x27;ve used bar soap while camping.</li>
            <li> It perpetually smelled and felt like I didn&#x27;t thoroughly rinse, no matter how long I spent in the shower.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped, and my face is not at all irritated by it, and as actually calmed down some minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I have found that if I use it every single day, my hair will get a tad bit dry.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does not leave my hair flat like other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I think $14 is a bit pricey (s/b $8-$10 IMO) for shampoo (especially when the kids poor it down the tub drain), but I am willing to pay this price for now to go the chemical-free route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess my search for a decent natural shampoo continues, sadly.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair like me, better use conditioner after shampoo, tried like other reviews to just shampoo but was impossible to comb my long hair.</li>
            <li> My son has seen similar improvements, with much less flaking and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t really bothered me because I used head &amp; shoulders shampoo for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this exacerbated a dry scalp condition I was experiencing, and actually made it much itchier.</li>
            <li> I also have highlights in my hair and it may be turning them a little yellow, which is why it&#x27;s 4 stars not 5.</li>
            <li> The pretty cherry chocolate brown color I use is revitalized from the dull brown it usually washes out to.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair real dry.</li>
            <li> Case closed</li>
            <li> I got Japanese straightening a few weeks ago and</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell.  </li>
            <li> and I know it will be healthier and less damaged in the long run.</li>
            <li> the strong smell of lavender makes it impossible for me to use it.  </li>
            <li> and I have not once noticed my hair being greasy the day after a washing like my other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use both shampoo and conditioner and will buy other products from this company.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely picky on products I choose.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does what every other shampoo does,except harm you.</li>
            <li> I use a dime-sized amount every other day and order it every six months or so.</li>
            <li> It actually feels thicker than it used to, although I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s due to the shampoo/ conditioner.</li>
            <li> Long story short, every time I washed my hair with this product, I lost a bunch of my hair, and my dandruff problem got really serious.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that where I live is dry and cold</li>
            <li> Most natural shampoos are awful.</li>
            <li> I would use it everyday but it is really expensive and I have a very large mane.</li>
            <li> I had at least a hundred zits on my back.</li>
            <li> so you have to use a lot, and it&#x27;s expensive considering how much I had to use per wash</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it has been very drying.  </li>
            <li> and that is NOT good for hair especially thinning hair like mines, it&#x27;s already dried my hair after one single use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying on the hair and is next to impossible to work through your hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t contain any of the ingredients you typically associate with shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to have gotten a slightly darker richer color since I began using these products</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it has an odd smell - almost medicinal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I find my hair has been less static-y.</li>
            <li> My previous shampoos were based on sodium laureth sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate.  </li>
            <li> My hair falls less and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing hidden here.</li>
            <li> This stuff has my vote,first time user,but Ill be a steady customer from here on in.</li>
            <li> I got on here to find something to help my naturally dry, staticky hair, and also try to get away from the typical store-bought shampoos that leave my hair dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> There is little lather, but that isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> I am a little bit of a product junkie.  </li>
            <li> I have tried very very many and this is the only one that isn&#x27;t too oily, therefore creating a terrible dandruff problem, or irritating.  </li>
            <li> It caused me to shed hair like crazy, so much so that every time I went to my stylist</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not money wasted.  </li>
            <li> and I wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave the itchy scalp that some products do because of the harsh chemicals on them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> she&#x27;d make a harsh comment about changing my routine.</li>
            <li> but it does take a few washes to get to the consistency i like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I cant use it at every wash or else my hair gets dried out.</li>
            <li> I also like to wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> Also, my bangs looked greasy after missing just one day of shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it would be a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> My head used to itch after I dried it, until I discovered that the chemicals in my shampoo were causing the problem.  </li>
            <li> I received the product within a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write another review in a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find store bought Beauty products that don&#x27;t have hidden chemicals</li>
            <li> But the ones I have found are usually really expensive and still contain other chemicals, maybe slightly less damaging than SLS but still damaging chemicals none the less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and the matching conditioner for the past 4 days</li>
            <li> boyfriend has semi-curly hair that is usually a frizz ball in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Does take two applications, as usual for my somewhat oily hair anyway.  </li>
            <li> However, unlike most reviewers here, my experience was quite horrible.</li>
            <li> Lots of tangles and just not healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Thought this product might help with my hair as it is starting to thin, but it made my hair much worse.  </li>
            <li> Since it is all natural ingredients with no preservatives I am not sure I want to stock up my usual 1+ year supply since it may go bad if it sits around.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty protective about my hair, and hate putting chemicals in it</li>
            <li> Got this for my 11 year old daughter who had very difficult to manage hair.</li>
            <li> The search for products w/o chemicals that worked well for my hair proved to be hard until now.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t produce enough suds, but it does.  </li>
            <li> it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel dirty at all).</li>
            <li> (I have medium length, medium textured thick hair...</li>
            <li> (I have thick curly hair).</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch of this product but for me, it was a definite nightmare!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair and scalp clean without any nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> But put me in the very small minority group that this didn&#x27;t work out for me.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lather: This shampoo does not lather well in hard water, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t working!  </li>
            <li> About 5 years ago, I began getting painful pimples on the back of my head after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> (yes I know, it&#x27;s not good to do that, but i&#x27;m trying!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically impossible to get it through my long hair....</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> The fragrance seems worse in the bottle than when the shampoo is used.</li>
            <li> if you have thin hair DO NOT USE this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s watery and thin</li>
            <li> Leaves my hear stronger and because I have thin hair</li>
            <li> Thin as water and doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, and using this shampoo with the conditioner, is weightless, but nourishing.  </li>
            <li> This is a new formulation and it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> (sadly) stays at 1 star.</li>
            <li> Then I found this shampoo and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> It was frightening.</li>
            <li> But way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately my scalp found it a bit drying.</li>
            <li> If not, your hair will be a bit difficult to brush.  </li>
            <li> Also tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li> My hair had the tendency to look greasy after one day of not washing, but with this shampoo/ conditioner, I can go three days without washing it before it looks bad.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Stupidly, I blamed the residue and hair loss on everything</li>
            <li> and I hate it now.</li>
            <li> Well, I hated this as a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> but it is not so horrible that I wouldn&#x27;t use the product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great all natural product that really works.  Been using for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair, and this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, natural or otherwise, that allows me to skip a day of washing without my hair getting limp and greasy by the end of the 2nd day.  It looks almost as good as it does freshly washed, regardless of whether I rinse and blow dry again or skip getting it wet entirely.  I can and often do go a 3rd day without shampooing but by then I can definitely tell.  I have tried no poo, other natural shampoos and tons of conventional shampoos and always felt that my hair only looked clean the day of washing.  I am very happy with this shampoo (and I use and like the conditioner as well).  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell.  I will try the grapefruit next time.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this shampoo by a friend and I was skeptical because I&#x27;m one of those girls who has no loyalty to shampoo because every time I use the same shampoo for more than one or two bottles, I have the greasiest roots you&#x27;ve ever seen and ends that look like straw.  I&#x27;m not particularly hard on my hair, but it&#x27;s usually frizzy and I do dye it quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and the matching conditioner for the past 4 days and I have not once noticed my hair being greasy the day after a washing like my other shampoo.  On top of this, after just one washing, the frizziness of my hair was reduced by about 80%.  I literally could not believe it.  I&#x27;ve had people telling me that the color of it has even changed and I haven&#x27;t dyed it in about 4 weeks.  I notice the difference too!  The pretty cherry chocolate brown color I use is revitalized from the dull brown it usually washes out to.  I seriously feel like I can eventually wash my hair every other day with this, something that I haven&#x27;t done since I was wearing light up shoes and puffy pink tulle dresses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend has semi-curly hair that is usually a frizz ball in the morning.  But he&#x27;s been using it and his hair is smooth and shinny.  We both love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes for those who haven&#x27;t used natural shampoo before:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: This shampoo does not lather well in hard water, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t working!  We took it camping and it lathered very well, but at our house where we have hard water we get about a quarter of the lather a normal shampoo would have.  This is because it has no foaming agents (SLS, etc) in it.  It still cleanses your hair and scalp though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time:  Leave the shampoo in for extra time after lathering it, it really does moisturize your hair!  Leave the conditioner in for the time recommended too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:  I love the scent and even wish it was stronger.  However, those who aren&#x27;t used to natural scents won&#x27;t like howauthentic it is.  This is not fake lavender.  This is the real deal and it is different then other shampoos.  I&#x27;ve used natural castile soaps for some time and I&#x27;m used to the smell.  When I used this at while camping in a group shower setting, I had a lady ask me what it was because she thought it smelled wonderful.  But it may not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I&#x27;ll use. Unlike other natural shampoos, this one leaves your hair feeling soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Fundamental Shampoo is the foundation of my hair...Many guys think that they are losing hair because the age or because their genetic load...and yeah these are important causes. However many do not know that perhaps they are losing hair because the type of soap and/or shampoo they are using. Most of shampoo brands are utilizing many chemical compounds in their formula and that affects the scalp pH, the hairâ€™s consistency and structure. Many brands make testing in animals and compounds like SLS and Polysorbates that have been demonstrated its toxicity hence you can imagine what those chemicals can make in a human scalp. Other thing I suggest is avoid the use of any kind of styling grease or setting lotion because that will accelerate the hair lose. I strongly suggest shift to a Chemical Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed an improment on my hair after a week of using the shampoo.I decided to switch to a chemical free shampoo after I noticed my hair look so dry and damage.  I feel like my hair looks fuller and healthier now.  So far it&#x27;s a great shampoo and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> i personally love this product. i am on my 3rd bottles now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on my niece&#x27;s recommendation and found it to be everything she said.  My salon shampoos leave my hair with an oily residue.  Not so with Fundamental. My hair feels very clean and residue free.  Plus no stinging eyes! I also found that my hair was more manageable after each use.  My hair certainly has more body to it and is easier to style.  The conditioner does not leave my hair flat like other conditioners.  I will continue to use both shampoo and conditioner and will buy other products from this company.  I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> The fragrance seems worse in the bottle than when the shampoo is used. There is little lather, but that isn&#x27;t a problem. Hair and scalp seem better, but will it make me handsome and 20 years younger?</li>
            <li> They display a FULL List of natural ingredients on the site, to view before buying. Case closed</li>
            <li> Only shampoo I&#x27;ve used in the last 10 years that hasn&#x27;t made my head itch.  Does take two applications, as usual for my somewhat oily hair anyway.  Great pr</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this exacerbated a dry scalp condition I was experiencing, and actually made it much itchier. They really shouldn&#x27;t market this as a solution for such issues. I like the chemical-free aspect, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help resolve my particular issue. Folks with scalp issues should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair like me, better use conditioner after shampoo, tried like other reviews to just shampoo but was impossible to comb my long hair. I color my hair every 3 weeks in a medium auburn shade and color has not fade out as with regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!  I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t produce enough suds, but it does.  It also smells good!</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoos there is!  Just enough suds to avoid no-poo greasy hair.  And a quality product!  I can tolerate the fragrance, and actually like it.  No issues from this household!  Other than wishing I could afford it on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> First all natural shampoo that CLEANS your hair! This stuff has my vote,first time user,but Ill be a steady customer from here on in.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product for my curly course hair.  My hair is dry already and I feel like it strips my hair of any moisture.</li>
            <li> For years I have tried every natural shampoo on the market. I used every brand and kind and would at times go back to regular shampoos because I felt like the natural shampoos were not really cleaning my hair or making it look dull and mousy. Still, I didn&#x27;t give up in.my search as chemical free products are important to me. I came across this shampoo and decided to try it, purchasing a travel size first from Amazon. To my amazement this shampoo should be called a miracle shampoo!!!! Right away I was first impressed with the ingredients, all things I know and all completely natural. Second, I tried the shampoo and my hair felt, looked, smelled A-mazing! It had a light fresh feeling yet looked shiny and full. The most amazing part of all, I didnt use any conditioner! I will never use another shampoo again!! Thank you Fundamental Earth!</li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive scalp. Every shampoo I tried left my scalp itchy and even scabby.  Then I tried Fudamental Earth shampoo and finally got relief. It&#x27;s a great shampoo. It lathers really well, smells good, and best of all, doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Very good Product. I am pleased. Leaves Hair nice and shiny plus it smells nice. The price however is a little high in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I heard of these products from a friend of mine and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them. The search for products w/o chemicals that worked well for my hair proved to be hard until now. The shampoo and conditioner smell great and my hair is so shiny and light! I also got some of the face wash , lip balm and detox greens formula. I love how my skin, lips and insides feel after using all of these. All while doing good for the planet, how awesome is that!!!</li>
            <li> This is a new formulation and it&#x27;s terrible. Drying and does not lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring back the original formula that was great and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Stripped my hair of all natural oils.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE this shampoo but they recently changed the formula. It&#x27;s very drying on the hair and is next to impossible to work through your hair. Until they bring back the old, wonderful, and moisturizing formula this review (sadly) stays at 1 star. ):</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a week or so now, and I was a little unsure at first. It didn&#x27;t contain any of the ingredients you typically associate with shampoos. How on earth do you clean oily hair with oil? These folks are onto something good, because this stuff is fantastic. It smells good, mostly neutral, and most importantly it cleans my hair well and leaves it soft and light without conditioner. Will be my new regular shampoo for the whole household.</li>
            <li> I had to come on here and just say Fundamental shampoo is great. I am extremely picky on products I choose. It had to be free of toxic chemicals and use only pure 100% organic healthy ingredients. Fundamental really came through on that. It&#x27;s as good as it gets. It&#x27;s totally free of all harmful chemicals. I highly recommend this product if you want a genuine organic shampoo. I will continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is SLS free, but it really strips my hair pretty bad. I have frizzy/curly hair and for my hair to be more curly than frizzy it need lots of natural oil and moisture. This shampoo removes all of that and leaves my hair very straw like and hard to style, even with extra leave in conditioner. It really isn&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
            <li> It is a good shampoo for a hair without any treatment but it is not for my hair because I had Keratine and brazilian treatment in the past and I have very damaged hair. This product put my hair more dry. My husband is using it and it is very good for him.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea that this is a chemical free shampoo. You can actually read the ingredients list. It also smells wonderful. I will order the conditioner. I cannot say that my hair looks any better, but it certainly is nice knowing that you do not dump chemicals on your head. Highly recommended, although a bit on the spendy sideâ€¦</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo couple months ago.  I also bought other couple natural shampoos.  I even created my own shampoo.  After all, I think this shampoo is the best so far.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner but my hair is still shine.  My hair is long so I have to use detangler to spray on the hair to comb easily.</li>
            <li> Well, I hated this as a shampoo.  I wanted to love it as much as I loved the ingredient list.  But put me in the very small minority group that this didn&#x27;t work out for me.  I left it sitting for 3 minutes before rinsing, and followed up with the conditioner.  It just left my hair feeling frizzy.  I tried it for a couple of weeks, hoping to convince myself I loved it.  I now use the conditioner as a shampoo/conditioner, and love it (I wrote a different review on the conditioner listing)&lt;br /&gt;BUT....I love love love this for a facial and body cleanser!  So, it&#x27;s not money wasted.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped, and my face is not at all irritated by it, and as actually calmed down some minor breakouts.  I would buy again, just not for the advertised use.</li>
            <li> I have historically had very dry itchy skin, and after taking a shower, the skin on my forehead and scalp would always dry our and crack/flake.  About 5 years ago, I began getting painful pimples on the back of my head after shampooing.  I tried shampoo after shampoo (chemical-based) hoping that something would improve my condition.  Compounding this issue, I have a young son who has the same type of skin, who began having similar issues that I fought with all my life.  Looking for a solution to our problem I went the all-natural route, believing that our problems were rooted in the chemical used in the most common store-bought brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years using chemical-free shampoo, my results have been wonderful.  I no longer experience the forehead/scalp dryness, and have NO pimples on my head since making the switch!  My son has seen similar improvements, with much less flaking and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the Fundamental Shampoo, it is a very good product.  It suds up sufficiently well and has a pleasant, somewhat gender neutral smell to it.  I think $14 is a bit pricey (s/b $8-$10 IMO) for shampoo (especially when the kids poor it down the tub drain), but I am willing to pay this price for now to go the chemical-free route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a really good product... I&#x27;ll be sticking around for a while!</li>
            <li> OKay so I never, ever have written a review for anything before but this one is worth the time.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shampoos, every brand both sulfate free, with sulfates, smoothing. clarifying... anyways you get the point. My hair was always oily the next day and always seemed to be breaking, I could not get my hair to grow, which I&#x27;ve been trying to do for years now. Once I started using this shampoo, within a couple washes I noticed  a HUGE difference. My hair was growing, it wasn&#x27;t getting oily and gross the next day and it actually made my scalp feel clean.  It doesn&#x27;t lather so with my first couple washes I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it but after seeing what a difference it made in my hair I will never go back to any other brand. My hair looks and feels healthier, I swear my hair grows twice as fast when I&#x27;m using it. I&#x27;d recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> This works very well. It came well protected and shampoo&#x27;s good and comfortably. No reaction and simple ingrediants. I recommend it, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I love the smell and I love how it&#x27;s been kind to my hair.  I look forward to washing it every time.  My only gripe is the cost... why do all the better for you products have to be so much more expensive?</li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner and I am quite pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now. At first it took my hair some getting use to. I didn&#x27;t like how it felt in my hair in the beginning but I kept using it and I&#x27;m glad I did. It made my hair thicker! Not insanely thicker but I can feel the difference. I think it made my hair darker too. My hair seems to have gotten a slightly darker richer color since I began using these products and I haven&#x27;t colored my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine. It&#x27;s not as great smelling as other shampoos but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Both the shampoo and conditioner lasted me about 2 months and I wash my hair everyday. (yes I know, it&#x27;s not good to do that, but i&#x27;m trying!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend people trying this out. In the beginning it won&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really cleaning your hair that well but it is! You just have to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have 3b type hair.  Bought this because I &#x27;m looking for natural shampoo as well as conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This fundamental brand leaves my hair: soft, shiny, manageable without any greasy feeling, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Also doesn&#x27;t leave the itchy scalp that some products do because of the harsh chemicals on them.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t give the 5 stars because the price is a bit high, hope it&#x27;ll be more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Manufactures, please keep this quality!</li>
            <li> Been searching far and wide for a really good SLS free shampoo. But the ones I have found are usually really expensive and still contain other chemicals, maybe slightly less damaging than SLS but still damaging chemicals none the less. Then I found this shampoo and was skeptical. It ended up being fantastic! Smells great and leaves my hair with a lovely lavender scent. Lathers really well! Many SLS shampoos I have tried feel like I am rubbing condition into my hair but this one makes a nice thick rich lather and covers my hair well without having to use too much. This is a little pricey for me but a lot less than many other shampoos you will find at beauty stores that have SLS listed as the second ingredient. It leaves my hair just as clean as other SLS shampoos but much softer and I know it will be healthier and less damaged in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really big fan of this shampoo. Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like it just got worked over.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so naturally soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo on account of all the great reviews. I had been using popular brand shampoos for all my life and when I started to learn more about the harm of sulfates and other gross ingredients in soaps and shampoos I became an instant convert. This shampoo seemed to be very promising. However, unlike most reviewers here, my experience was quite horrible. The shampoo left a residue in my hair that made me hate touching my own hair. I couldn&#x27;t stand running my fingers through it because it left a gross film on my hands. It perpetually smelled and felt like I didn&#x27;t thoroughly rinse, no matter how long I spent in the shower. It caused me to shed hair like crazy, so much so that every time I went to my stylist she&#x27;d make a harsh comment about changing my routine. Stupidly, I blamed the residue and hair loss on everything BUT the shampoo: diet, hardwater, stress, whatever. At the same time my back was breaking out. I had at least a hundred zits on my back. It was frightening. It finally occurred to me that the shampoo was causing the acne. As soon as I stopped and used apple cider vinegar to clarify my strands, all the sticky weird gunk that was on my hair and scalp was gone, and for the first time in a couple months I was able to run my fingers through my hair without having to wash my hands after. About a month later the acne cleared up. My hair is still struggling to get back to its original fullness and luster. Not sure if I got a bad batch of this product but for me, it was a definite nightmare!</li>
            <li> Wonderful all natural shampoo</li>
            <li> I bought it together with the conditioner and that&#x27;s one of the best decisions I ever made. My hair smells and feels great. It doesn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as it used to, therefore I wash my hair less often now. I feel that I don&#x27;t even need to use leave-in conditioners anymore. It&#x27;s really great!!</li>
            <li> Best chemical free shampoo I&#x27;ve used yet! Shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean and soft. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the PH factor but when you wash it out the water should be the same PH. Leaves hair real dry.</li>
            <li> I am a little bit of a product junkie.  I used this product when I switched over to organic products.  I can totally read the label without having to Google any of the ingredients to see what they are.  I had to pick this product up again.  My hair felt much more moisturized and was thicker when using this product.  I missed having thread like strands.  Had to have it back.  This product will stay in my regiment from now on.  No mare product hopping.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome. It is the cheapest completely and truly all-natural cleanser out there. It makes my hair so clean, way cleaner than on a baking soda method. Note for oily-hair people though: you don&#x27;t need the conditioner with this. Thanks Fundamental!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd wash and I really love it so far. but it does take a few washes to get to the consistency i like.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a compatible detergent for the shower for greywater effluent.  This had ALL natural ingredients and appeared to be low in salt which is important for water that will subsequently be applied to trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo turned out to be the BEST shampoo I have ever used on my 58 year old head!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.  I then bought a bottle for my father--who constantly complains of itching--and his first comment was he &#x27;couldn&#x27;t believe how clean it made his head feel.&#x27;  I know exactly what he means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought 6 bottles more.  Since it is all natural ingredients with no preservatives I am not sure I want to stock up my usual 1+ year supply since it may go bad if it sits around.  Pity the larger salon bottles with pump don&#x27;t seem available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their conditioner seems to work fine, but doesn&#x27;t get me as excited as their shampoo.  Their body wash is really good---not the best I have ever used, but really good.  But way too expensive.  And needs to be in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers quite well, and works even on my 5-year old.  I like that it is not ridiculously priced like Nature&#x27;s Paradise or other natural products.</li>
            <li> Loves this shampoo and how it makes my hair feel. Removes all residue and leaves hair naturally shiny and squeaky clean. I&#x27;m not go hot about the lavender smell but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Yes, its natural and good for you, NO it does not make your hair feel nice.  I have to use a leave in conditioner (which I never have to do) when I use this.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Not only do I love it, but my Dad has started using it (since he has had trouble with hair falling and dandruff) and his dandruff has went away and his hair does not fall out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is very gentle on your scalp and I am not afraid to use it everyday unlike ordinary shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, leaves your hair fresh and clean, and is totally natural! Great product.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m aware of the importance of using sulfate free shampoo, I find this one to be easy to lather and gentle on your hair.  It also has a very nice scent.  I&#x27;m starting to order this one regularly, as I think the price is right.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  I liked that i could pronounce everything on yhe ingrediant list.  I love the smell, its mild lavender, not too strong at all.  The conditioner is easy to spread and use.  Leave my hair nice and soft and shiny.  I also find when I use this shampoo i dont have as much hair fall, as my hair was thinning quite a bit.  Would definitly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and it makes my hair feel great.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when switching from chemical shampoo to a natural shampoo. I have tried making my own in the past with major failures. I have very thick, wavy hair so finding something that will meet my needs is quite challenging, This left my hair feeling very clean and smelling wonderful, without all the awful chemicals. I will be using this on my 2yr old daughter as well. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-20s and already having thinning hair and rapidly so I am always looking for good organic shampoos, this one seemed like from heaven as every organic shampoo I have used before had some sort of hidden bad ingredient ..I read the ingredients carefully on the information page here on amazon and it looked great..once I received the item I went to the shower and used it and immediately noticed that it lathers very well which is a red flag as all SLS-Free shampoos don&#x27;t lather well at all ..so I looked at the back of the bottle and it has Saponified  Oils...on the ingredients page here it just says Olive Oil, Coconut Oil without mentioning the saponified part. This shampoo is basically SOAP ...and that is NOT good for hair especially thinning hair like mines, it&#x27;s already dried my hair after one single use. Extremely disappointed. If you have great thick hair you might get away with using this but I don;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it has an odd smell - almost medicinal. When using this product, you&#x27;re going to want to use a good conditioner if your hair is long enough to tangle. My hair does feel clean, but it&#x27;s squeaky clean; therefore, I can&#x27;t get a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I find my hair has been less static-y. But I don&#x27;t feel this shampoo is any better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> would give it 0 stars if i could. if you have thin hair DO NOT USE this shampoo and conditioner. it will make your hair fall out!!! glad i only bought the sample sizes.</li>
            <li> I used this for awhile and unfortunately my scalp found it a bit drying. I now use hemp hydrating shampoo, which works the same but far less drying. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to part with the scent, which I love so much that I mix in a little each wash. It smells like lavendar and sweet pine and rain. So the best of all worlds...if only this could be a little more hydrating I&#x27;d use this exclusively.</li>
            <li> the strong smell of lavender makes it impossible for me to use it.  I didn&#x27;t see in any of the reviews I read that it had such a strong smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does what every other shampoo does,except harm you.</li>
            <li> I needed to get away from sodium lauryl sulfate because of scalp issues.  The anti dandruff shampoos you can use forever, but never stop.  Most shampoos have the SLS which just keeps it going.  Tried this and it seems to work and is better for me.</li>
            <li> Thought this product might help with my hair as it is starting to thin, but it made my hair much worse.  It is totally dried out, feels like straw and is falling out more than ever.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 3 or 4 different shampoos (the only ones I could find that had recognizable and completely natural) ingredients. None worked except for this one. It actually gets your hair clean (not exactly the squeaky clean like chemical shampoos do but just one step below that- it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel dirty at all). The smell is not the best but definitely not bad. The conditioner works pretty well too but has a different smell than that of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this shampoo. It&#x27;s chemically clean, it smells amazing, it cleans without weighing down or leaving buildup...but, it&#x27;s watery and thin so you have to use a lot, and it&#x27;s expensive considering how much I had to use per wash (I have medium length, medium textured thick hair...which means there&#x27;s a lot of it). I found similar performance, scent, and chemically purity at a much more modest price and thicker consistency (so a little product goes a lot farther) with Beauty Without Cruelty&#x27;s Lavender Higlands shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells great, no weird chemicals, and my hair looks and feels good. I&#x27;m a pinchpenny who doesn&#x27;t like spending more than $2 at a time, but this was worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I don&#x27;t want chemicals in my hair, and it has none--all natural ingredients.  I follow with my rinse of apple cider vinegar (1 part vinegar, 1 part water in a squirt bottle), and my hair is beautiful and shiney-not oily and not dry.  Thank you amazon.com for offering it at a lower price than on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite all natural shampoo! I use it three times a week. I have found that if I use it every single day, my hair will get a tad bit dry. So I use Organic Excellence shampoo in between washings with this (love that shampoo too). The shampoo is really clarifying so that&#x27;s why it has a tendency to dry my hair out if I use it daily. I love this about it, because it gets my hair squeaky clean. Other natural shampoos leave my hair oily and it feels like I never washed it. Also, my face is allergic to almost every face wash/soap I have tried...except for this. So I use this fundamental shampoo as a face wash too. What a great product. The best thing is that there is nothing harmful in it. It lathers really well too for a natural shampoo. Love it!</li>
            <li> Definetly love the fact that this is made in America and it is basically checmical free, other than using the soapification product. This shampoo is okay but I cant use it at every wash or else my hair gets dried out. The smell isnt the greatest but than again if you are trying to find a chemical free product its not gonna smell all that great.</li>
            <li> I was using another organic brand and I liked it but wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied so I decided to try this shampoo and I love it.  Highly recommend and I will buy again.  I also purchased the conditioner and love that too.</li>
            <li> When a friend told me about Fundamental Shampoo I got very excited. I had a hard time finding a natural shampoo that really didn&#x27;t contain all the toxic chemicals found in most shampoos. I&#x27;ve found that many of the &#x27;natural shampoos&#x27; are misleading and when they say they don&#x27;t have sodium lauryl sulfate, they&#x27;ll often use sodium laureth sulfate or some other similarly harmful chemical. What a pleasant surprise it was to read the natural ingredients found in Fundamental Shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t expect this shampoo to lather as much as traditional shampoos, but, once again, I was pleasantly surprised that there was a nice, creamy lather that was soothing to the scalp and easy to work throughout my hair. Most of all, I absolutely love the smell and how it makes my hair feel clean without being weighed down by aweful chemicals.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful natural shampoo. Next, I&#x27;ve got to try their conditioner and face wash.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great!  I did the baking soda/apple cider vinegar thing for about 4 months.  I liked the idea of not putting all the chemicals found in shampoo on my hair.  It was ok, but my hair would get greasy between washes.  I began my search to find another alternative.  I found it!  This natural shampoo is truly natural.  You can actually read all the ingrediants as well as see all the things is does not contain.  I was actually surprised that it does create a lather, but if you&#x27;re not used to natural shampoo methods it is not the lather you get from chemical based shampoos, no worries.  It cleans your hair.  You will need to use a conditioner with this product.  If not, your hair will be a bit difficult to brush.  I&#x27;m on my first bottle, my first bottle of many.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves your hair very soft. I do feel I need to use more because SLS-free shampoos does not lather as much as SLS shampoos. In the end, after drying, hair feels nice and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> The BEST chemical free shampoo for oily hair, and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL. I use this with the fundamental conditioner and my oily hair has completely changed texture. I only have to wash it every 3 days instead of daily, which has in turn made it much healthier.</li>
            <li> The smell was too strong for me, I typically love lavender scent, I read the reviews, about the smell being strong, but thought I would give it a try any way. Well, I anded up giving it away to a friend. Hope they remain friends,lol! I did warn them it smelled strong, but I liked the way my hair turned out with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this shampoo more than once, and it is a great, chemical-free option.  The delivery and packaging were also just right.  It leaves my hair clean, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I got on here to find something to help my naturally dry, staticky hair, and also try to get away from the typical store-bought shampoos that leave my hair dull and lifeless.  I read the reviews on this stuff and, although I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a shampoo I&#x27;d never even heard of before, I decided to give this stuff a go anyway.  I am so glad I did!  I am pretty protective about my hair, and hate putting chemicals in it so it&#x27;s not dyed or anything.  I have been using this shampoo for a couple days now and already I have noticed a change in the way my hair looks, and cooperates!  It&#x27;s smooth and shiny, and my natural highlights come through bright and lovely!  My co worker even asked me tonight if I had recently lightened my hair! The shampoo on it&#x27;s own left my hair feeling clean and healthy, but because my hair is so dry, I tried adding a few drops of natural avocado oil to the shampoo today and it responded very nicely.  My hair feels hydrated and healthy.  I would definitely recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find store bought Beauty products that don&#x27;t have hidden chemicals so I decided to try the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method (baking soda as &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and apple cider vinegar as &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;). After about two months of low self esteem because of my  greasy, yet, brittle hair, I decided to look online for something natural-ish.  This is the ONLY product I have found that I feel is truly chemical free. And it works really well! My hair looks as good, and sometimes better, than when I used Enjoy. It&#x27;s not the same lathery shampoo experience as with other shampoos (because of its lack of chemicals) but it gets the job done and there is no residue left over.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are saponified olive oil, saponified coconut oil and all natural ingredients (except for biotin and niacin which are vitamins).  My previous shampoos were based on sodium laureth sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate.  Nice to not have those chemicals in my hair.  It lathers up nice and cleans my hair really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now read the ingredients of every product I buy, because many products have a natural name like \\&quot;Organic Aloe Vera Splendor Shampoo\\&quot;, but looking at the ingredients may show ammonium lauryl sulfate, a bunch of other chemicals and maybe 5% aloe vera lotion.  Who needs ammonia, sulfur and chemicals on their skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have fragile, straight, fine hair that is prone to breakage.  I also like to wash my hair everyday.  This shampoo wasn&#x27;t a good match for me because my hair got very squeaky with the washing and lathering.  Also the directions recommended lathering for 1 minute before rinsing.  Trying to lather my very squeaky hair seemed to do more damage than benefit.  Also, my bangs looked greasy after missing just one day of shampooing.  My hair did have body with this shampoo, and it felt soft after I sprayed in my leave-in conditioner.  In the end (I only lasted 5 days) I switched back to my old Aubrey Blue Chamomile.  FYI Wen has been the best shampoo for my hair so far, and that is basically like washing your hair with straight conditioner, but I can&#x27;t stand the company&#x27;s ordering process and customer service.</li>
            <li> I will buy this shampoo for ever. Leaves my hear stronger and because I have thin hair this is the most import for my hai. My hair falls less and looks healthier. I whish I can buy it at any local store.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel. Leaves hair feeling clean without leaving it dry or straw like. Not too fond of the smell but it is not so horrible that I wouldn&#x27;t use the product.  I have tried other natural shampoos and like this one the best by far.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo (and conditioner) my hair felt stripped and dry, like when I&#x27;ve used bar soap while camping. I was about to give up on it, but tried it again. The second time (using a little more product than the first time) my hair felt clean, shiny and soft - really nice! You do need to use more than with &amp;#34;the other guys&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent for my somewhat oily hair . I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint for the first rinse and this for the second - lasts longer that way.</li>
            <li> I got Japanese straightening a few weeks ago and the person who did my hair couldn&#x27;t believe how strong and glossy my hair came out after the treatment. My hair still looks soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product due to its great reviews. But when I tried it.. O M G. I have normal to dry hair and previously was using another natural shampoo without conditioner at all. Fundamental Shampoo dried my hair instantly so much to the point that it was squeaky.  My hair was SUPER dry and I couldn&#x60;t even brush it. I don&#x60;t get that even with regular chemical shampoos. Moreover, when I tried to return it, it stated as it was nonreturnable. I had to contact Amazon customer service.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful. It is low to almost no odor or fragrance which is great. It leaves your hair and scalp clean without any nasty chemicals. You do however need a conditioner to comb out snags without tugging on the hair. I also have highlights in my hair and it may be turning them a little yellow, which is why it&#x27;s 4 stars not 5.</li>
            <li> I tried to post a review on the company&#x27;s website but it didn&#x27;t work. Maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t give them five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have strong, healthy hair for long time. The only problem is that where I live is dry and cold so I have some dandruff on my hair. That hasn&#x27;t really bothered me because I used head &amp; shoulders shampoo for the past few years. Recently I really tried to switch to natural products. I read the reviews here, and I thought this is the product I must buy! So I bought it. I&#x27;m really glad I only bought the travel-size shampoo and conditioner. Otherwise it would be a waste of my money. Long story short, every time I washed my hair with this product, I lost a bunch of my hair, and my dandruff problem got really serious. Yes, my hair did feel soft when it&#x27;s dry but I was really worried about the hair loss and dandruff problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a good product. I&#x27;m just saying it doesn&#x27;t work for me. What I&#x27;m trying to let you know is my real thoughts about this product, and you can tell I&#x27;m not hired by the company to write this review. Hopefully, the company can see this comment and make the product line better.</li>
            <li> This is the best chemical free shampoo.  I have tried very very many and this is the only one that isn&#x27;t too oily, therefore creating a terrible dandruff problem, or irritating.  Plus it is very reasonably priced.  I use an apple cider vinegar rinse afterward and love the results in my naturally very curly hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my psoriasis not as itchy and not as flaky. It isn&#x27;t gone, but is an improvement. However, they recently changed the formula and I hate it now. It used to have a nice lather but not anymore. It&#x27;s practically impossible to get it through my long hair.... time to search for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Most natural shampoos are awful. I absolutely -love- this shampoo. It lathers really well for an all natural shampoo, and smells awesome. I would use it everyday but it is really expensive and I have a very large mane.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 11 year old daughter who had very difficult to manage hair. Lots of tangles and just not healthy looking. This in combination with the conditioner has worked great for her and she is very happy.</li>
            <li> finally found  a shampoo that has nothing toxic in it, tried many that claim they are natural then you read the label and they have snuck something toxic in it. I will be buying this for both my daughters and myself again feeling good that it is what it claims to be. Also ,  your hair has that squeaky clean  feeling and rinses out really well.</li>
            <li> My wife has brought home hippie shampoo before and I did not like them.  This stuff is great.  Wife is pregnant and she enjoys the scent.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this. I have a really sensitive scalp so I try a lot of organic shampoos, and this made my hair pretty dry. The only pro to that: my hair lasts like 4 days until I had to wash it. Butttt I could barely run a brush through it and it didn&#x27;t look or feel nice.</li>
            <li> I was a no-pooer for about 6 months before trying this product. After having two kids (wreaks havoc on your hair... it changes color, texture, and thickness) and trying lots of different shampoos, my hair needed a break from the roller coaster of products. I did extensive searching for TRULY chemical free hair care and found this. My hair is very long, extremely fine, and trying to bounce back from my last pregnancy. It gets weighed down and oily quicky and easily. Also tangles like crazy. Not so with this shampoo. I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner. Lathers great. Leave it on for two minutes and it really does what it says. I use a dime-sized amount every other day and order it every six months or so. It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo...no harsh chemicals, no perfumed smell--it smells clean and fresh, and thicker and shinier hair.  My head used to itch after I dried it, until I discovered that the chemicals in my shampoo were causing the problem.  I switched to Fundamental shampoo, and my scalp is now itch-free.  The shampoo has also restored the lustre to my hair...it feels &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; when I run my hands through my hair.  I tried another chemical-free shampoo, but I didn&#x27;t like the scent of it.  Try this shampoo, you will love it too!</li>
            <li> I thought this was awesome when I found this brand but not sure if I would buy these two (shampoo &amp; conditioner) again for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and a lot of it. I love this shampoo (the conditioner is also a must if you have fine hair). You have to give it time, though. The first time I washed my hair, I thought it felt really dry. I did not massage it in very well, and I did not leave it on my hair for the recommended amount of time. The next time I used it, I loved it, and now, after having used it for a month--I love both and will continue to purchase. My hair looks healthy, feels and smells great. It actually feels thicker than it used to, although I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s due to the shampoo/ conditioner. My hair had the tendency to look greasy after one day of not washing, but with this shampoo/ conditioner, I can go three days without washing it before it looks bad. If you have fine or dry hair, you need to leave the shampoo in for a full minute, and you need to use the conditioner and leave it in for the full 2 minutes (and comb your hair while the conditioner is in it--that helps). This is great shampoo and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It is the first chemical free shampoo I have tried that didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. I use it on my whole family and they all love it. I wish it came in larger sized bottles because it does go quick, and the price is hefty, but it is one of the few things I will pay extra for. My hair hasn&#x27;t been washed with regular shampoo in over a year, and has never been healthier.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, I won&#x27;t use anything else and love that it is entirely organic and chemical free.</li>
            <li> Thin as water and doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> Over priced..... Still had problems with chemicals in it but could be just me.... Buy at your own risk.... May like it</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great!  Lathers up well.  No chemicals added!  Yay!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I like that it is Chemical Free. I try to keep as much chemicals out of my families lives as possible. This shampoo does a good job of cleaning my hair and smells great. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Gentle and mild with no fragrance. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It a good natural product but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really for my hair. Tends to dry it out a little more then I like. (I have thick curly hair). But for my daughter it seems to work better (she has wavy hair) Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but would suggest it to someone who have greasier then normal hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy to finally find a truly natural product. I can actually read each of the ingredients. There&#x27;s nothing hidden here. Shipping was expedient. I received the product within a few days of ordering. We have only used the product once, but so far it has worked well. I&#x27;ll write another review in a few months. I will try to find another scent next time I order because my family does not prefer lavender. Otherwise this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite shampoo.  I have looked everywhere with the ingredients this shampoo has.  The result of this shampoo is super.  My hair is vibrant again.  Even my hairdresser noticed how healthy my hair has become.  My hair is thin, and using this shampoo with the conditioner, is weightless, but nourishing.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this.  It has so many good reviews!  Unfortunately for me it has been very drying.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and at first I loved it because it seemed like the perfect antidote to all of the natural shampoos that were making my hair feel oily and sticky, but sadly things have moved too far in the other direction and now with this stuff I have straw-like hair with a lot of dandruff.. something that has never ever been a problem for me.  I guess my search for a decent natural shampoo continues, sadly.</li>
            <li> hubby swears by this. Makes his hair and beard super soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for a while.  Overall it&#x27;s a fine product. In my recent order, I feel the shampoo is diluted and the smell is kind of different, compared to my past purchase. But it&#x27;s still acceptable.</li>
