            <li>Best toothbrush in the world.</li>
            <li>Best brush I ever used.</li>
            <li>And my gum pocket numbers were all excellent.  </li>
            <li>One of the best tooth brushes I have ever used</li>
            <li>even though the design looks identical to brushes like the Nimbus (i.e. with the mix of shorter &amp; longer ultra-fine bristles), it brings an ideal combination of softness yet thoroughness of cleaning &amp; best of all a wonderful &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I must agree with those who say that this is a great toothbrush- again, for me, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Great tooth brushes not abrasive.</li>
            <li>I used to buy them in a health food store but buy them in bulk online now because they are really great for getting under the gum line.  </li>
            <li>This company also makes a great tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li>and the hygienist could not believe how great my teeth looked.  </li>
            <li>This one worked great.</li>
            <li>is awesome as my doctor explained that plaque is the root cause of gum recession which in turn easily results in sensitivity as areas which were designed to be protected &amp; covered by the gum</li>
            <li>IMPRESSED &amp; EACH OF US AGREE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST BRUSH TO BE NOTICEABLY GREAT &amp; A JOY TO USE + DELIVERING THE BEST CLEANING EASILY &amp; COMFORTABLY.  </li>

            <li>Great product I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>HOPING THAT AS MORE AMAZON CUSTOMERS DISCOVER HOW GREAT THIS BRUSH IS, AMAZON WILL SOON OFFER MORE COST-EFFECTIVE PURCHASING OPTIONS as I love the simplicity &amp; efficiency of being able to get everything I need from Amazon but the current pricing of about $7 for 1 brush</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this toothbrush the first day I used it.  </li>

            <li>AS MOST PEOPLE EXERT TOO MUCH PRESSURE WHEN ALL THAT&#x27;S NEEDED IS SOME GOOD ROTATIONS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES INCLUDING DOING MICRO-CIRCLES AT THE GUM LINE as another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li>and my gums feel so good after being brushed.</li>
            <li>I bought the youth size through Amazon given a fairly competitive total cost including free shipping option but had first checked out the manufacturer&#x27;s website which is where the friend who raved about this brush sent me to.  </li>
            <li>This is proof that safer products along with a great brush do more than dangerous additives and popular</li>
            <li>But that is fine because it should be replaced for health reasons much sooner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But by the second day I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are the only kind that I would use.  </li>
            <li>When i am in a hurry it does the complete job and feels great and stimulates entire gum area.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me since I&#x27;m not great on flossing too much.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover that they had in the meantime added a temporary special pack of 6 adult brushes with 2 travel caps for a total cost of $12 + tax &amp; shipping.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on gums.</li>
            <li>and I consistently get compliments from my dental hygienist on the condition of my teeth</li>
            <li>Finally, I turned to the Internet to try to find a better toothbrush and took a chance on SoFresh Flossing Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I used this brush right after I got the cleaning treatments, as well as a ToiletTree portable flosser twice a week, or if I eat something that really gets stuck in my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and fine, and dentists  recommend soft bristles.</li>
            <li>YOU ALWAYS BRUSH GENTLY</li>
            <li>YOU ALWAYS BRUSH GENTLY</li>
            <li>It cleans in between the teeth very well.</li>
            <li>These really work, I have used them for years.</li>
            <li>every 2 -3 weeks, so this is a real time saver.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Really cleans between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It helps to clean my teeth very well and keep them white.</li>
            <li>These are called &amp;#34;pocket&amp;#34; brushes in Australia and New Zealand and available in regular drugstores.  </li>
            <li>I like the thin bristles for easy removing food inbetween the teethand better brushing.</li>
            <li>Our pharmacist put us on to these several years back, but they don&#x27;t carry them any more, so found them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It has two heights of wonderfully soft bristles (I used to think that harder bristles must do a better job</li>
            <li>/&gt;The BEST way to use this brush is after your regular up/down and back and forth as directed by your dentist, I place it in one spot directing the bristles between each set of teeth and make very tiny little circles.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that they get in between my teeth l as well as they do, and on my six-week check up after having to have a scaling (intense cleaning, in which my mouth was numbed, and took two 2-hour appointments).</li>
            <li>No it is NOT a replacement for flossing, but it is a huge improvement over all other brushes.  </li>
            <li>Also very soft.</li>
            <li>This is simply one of my top ten personal healthcare items I use it alongside my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>UNLESS ONE IS A YOUNG CHILD, I went to stock up at http://sofreshoralcare.com/ .  </li>
            <li>HAD TRY THIS BRUSH SO FAR</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m almost 64 years old).  </li>
            <li>It really is like flossing at the same time you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>I need to explore shipping options here, because I can usually find them at a &amp;#34;health food store&amp;#34; at a better price, unless I can get several brushes for one shipping fee.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of tight spots, that are difficult to clean easily, so I&#x27;m loving flossing brushes.</li>
            <li>IF IT ONLY HAPPENS INITIALLY as the design + mix of bristles enabling a more thorough &amp; deeper cleaning will often result in dislodging plaque that other brushes did not clear out.</li>
            <li>IF IT ONLY HAPPENS INITIALLY as the design + mix of bristles enabling a more thorough &amp; deeper cleaning will often result in dislodging plaque that other brushes did not clear out.</li>
            <li>the bristles are soft and one brush can last a bit over a month.</li>
            <li>Mine is probably 8 months old and the bristles are starting to fall out.  </li>
            <li>This brush does such a complete job.</li>
            <li>It very rapidly cleared up areas that even the hygienist &amp; every type of flossing &amp; other brush could never get clean because of the way my 3 lower front teeth run super close &amp; slightly twisted over the next.  </li>
            <li>Those initially exposed areas can initially feel more painful simply because they were used to being covered by the plaque but it is well worth its removal as plaque will cause/worsen gum recession + gum disease &amp; even tooth decay.</li>

            <li> seems ridiculous when it can be bought directly for much less &amp; they ship super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That area has as a result always caused me the worst sensitivity problems as well as having the worst gum recession so to have the plaque so easily &amp; rapidly released is awesome as my doctor explained that plaque is the root cause of gum recession which in turn easily results in sensitivity as areas which were designed to be protected &amp; covered by the gum</li>
            <li> The long bristles get in between my teeth and push out what&#x27;s in there, and the short bristles do the work that every other toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li> I stopped buying other brands from a local drugstore since I discovered this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for another...but not very soon!</li>
            <li> They are not thick and hard like other brushes, but are finer.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to learn to move with the different shaped bristles.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are neither too hard, nor too soft.  </li>
            <li> I have tried them all, and others are too rough, or don&#x27;t penetrate.  </li>
            <li> It has bristles that are different lengths which makes it easier to brush those hard to get areas.</li>
            <li> Normal toothbrushes feel weird now.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried these toothbrushes, you are missing out.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this toothbrush for a few years now</li>
            <li> I am not very good with conventional flossing, but this gets the job done and its easier to get to the molars and wisdom teeth because there is reach with the handle.</li>
            <li> Not sure you can do away with flossing.</li>
            <li> I have been using these hard to find toothbrushes for years.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> I always hated after brushing with previous brushes how I could still feel biofilm around my gum line where the brush had not reached.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss</li>
            <li> I really HATE flossing.</li>

            <li> I bought the youth size through Amazon given a fairly competitive total cost including free shipping option but had first checked out the manufacturer&#x27;s website which is where the friend who raved about this brush sent me to.  There I saw that once one knows this brush work, the more one buys the cheaper it gets.  So once I had found THIS TRULY IS AN AWESOME BRUSH BUT BEST IN ADULT SIZE UNLESS ONE IS A YOUNG CHILD, I went to stock up at http://sofreshoralcare.com/ .  I was thrilled to discover that they had in the meantime added a temporary special pack of 6 adult brushes with 2 travel caps for a total cost of $12 + tax &amp; shipping.  I AM HOPING THAT AS MORE AMAZON CUSTOMERS DISCOVER HOW GREAT THIS BRUSH IS, AMAZON WILL SOON OFFER MORE COST-EFFECTIVE PURCHASING OPTIONS as I love the simplicity &amp; efficiency of being able to get everything I need from Amazon but the current pricing of about $7 for 1 brush seems ridiculous when it can be bought directly for much less &amp; they ship super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IS AWESOME ABOUT THE SoFRESH FLOSSING TOOTHRBUSHES IS THAT even though the design looks identical to brushes like the Nimbus (i.e. with the mix of shorter &amp; longer ultra-fine bristles), it brings an ideal combination of softness yet thoroughness of cleaning &amp; best of all a wonderful &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; feeling like your teeth &amp; gums are being fully &amp; wonderfully embraced &amp; cleansed in a way no other brush has ever come close to &amp; I have tried many over the years. EVERY PERSON I&#x27;VE HAD TRY THIS BRUSH SO FAR WAS ALSO IMMEDIATELY IMPRESSED &amp; EACH OF US AGREE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST BRUSH TO BE NOTICEABLY GREAT &amp; A JOY TO USE + DELIVERING THE BEST CLEANING EASILY &amp; COMFORTABLY.  It very rapidly cleared up areas that even the hygienist &amp; every type of flossing &amp; other brush could never get clean because of the way my 3 lower front teeth run super close &amp; slightly twisted over the next.  That area has as a result always caused me the worst sensitivity problems as well as having the worst gum recession so to have the plaque so easily &amp; rapidly released is awesome as my doctor explained that plaque is the root cause of gum recession which in turn easily results in sensitivity as areas which were designed to be protected &amp; covered by the gum end up exposed instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN CASE ANY OF YOU EXPERIENCE INITIALLY AGGRAVATED SENSITIVITY (which was not a problem in my case but given another reviewer for the youth brush mentioning this as a downside), IT CAN OFTEN BE A GOOD SIGN IF IT ONLY HAPPENS INITIALLY as the design + mix of bristles enabling a more thorough &amp; deeper cleaning will often result in dislodging plaque that other brushes did not clear out. Those initially exposed areas can initially feel more painful simply because they were used to being covered by the plaque but it is well worth its removal as plaque will cause/worsen gum recession + gum disease &amp; even tooth decay. JUST MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS BRUSH GENTLY AS MOST PEOPLE EXERT TOO MUCH PRESSURE WHEN ALL THAT&#x27;S NEEDED IS SOME GOOD ROTATIONS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES INCLUDING DOING MICRO-CIRCLES AT THE GUM LINE as another reviewer suggested.um recession so to have the plaque so easily &amp; rapidly released is awesome as my doctor explained that plaque is the root cause of gum recession which in turn easily results in sensitivity as areas which were designed to be protected &amp; covered by the gum end up exposed instead.

            <li> best toothbrush ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I have yet to have a cavity. I am not very good with conventional flossing, but this gets the job done and its easier to get to the molars and wisdom teeth because there is reach with the handle. the bristles are soft and one brush can last a bit over a month. it is cheaper though to buy it from the actual SoFresh website I just discovered. but still its a great brush.</li>
            <li> Your mouth feels like you just got your teeth cleaned at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth are clean, your gums feel great.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great toothbrush.  Try it, guaranteed you will love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush ever. I have been using this one for already 2 years. It helps to clean my teeth very well and keep them white. I stopped buying other brands from a local drugstore since I discovered this one.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried these toothbrushes, you are missing out.  I hate to floss and these do a petty good job for you.  Our pharmacist put us on to these several years back, but they don&#x27;t carry them any more, so found them on Amazon.  Once you use one, you won&#x27;t go back to regular brushes again.  The power brushes drive me nuts with their vibrations, so I use these.  Amazon store shipped them very quickly.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this toothbrush the first day I used it.  But by the second day I really liked it.  It actually gets between the teeth and seems great for the gums.  For those like me who don&#x27;t floss enough, this is the toothbrush to get!</li>
            <li> A dentist gave me one to try. It was gentle but yet effective in cleaning the spaces in between my&lt;br /&gt;teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the very best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used!  The long bristles get in between my teeth and push out what&#x27;s in there, and the short bristles do the work that every other toothbrush does.  The bristles are neither too hard, nor too soft.  I&#x27;ve used this brush by SoFresh now for about 3-4 years and I consistently get compliments from my dental hygienist on the condition of my teeth (I&#x27;m almost 64 years old).  I no longer dread the &#x27; get my teeth cleaned&#x27; day!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are the only kind that I would use.  They get in-between all spaces and makes you feel like a dentist cleaned your teeth.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. They are the only ones I use.</li>
            <li> Have been using this toothbrush for a few years now and I feel that it works well and you actually feel that you have flossed.  Great product I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush in the world.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brushes not abrasive. Like using floss and brushing at the same time. This is my third order of them.</li>
            <li> I must agree with those who say that this is a great toothbrush- again, for me, the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The bristles are soft and fine, and dentists  recommend soft bristles. I was actually surprised that they get in between my teeth l as well as they do, and on my six-week check up after having to have a scaling (intense cleaning, in which my mouth was numbed, and took two 2-hour appointments). I used this brush right after I got the cleaning treatments, as well as a ToiletTree portable flosser twice a week, or if I eat something that really gets stuck in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist raved at how much better my gums were, and how clean my teeth were. I really HATE flossing. I have a lot of tight spots, that are difficult to clean easily, so I&#x27;m loving flossing brushes. I need to explore shipping options here, because I can usually find them at a &amp;#34;health food store&amp;#34; at a better price, unless I can get several brushes for one shipping fee.</li>
            <li> These are just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended I try this toothbrush out and I have to say it is unlike any brushing experience I have ever had.  It truly is a massage for your mouth.  It&#x27;s the softest toothbush ever and my gums feel so good after being brushed.</li>
            <li> These are called &amp;#34;pocket&amp;#34; brushes in Australia and New Zealand and available in regular drugstores.  I used to buy them in a health food store but buy them in bulk online now because they are really great for getting under the gum line.  My hygienist always comments on how healthy my gums are.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever used. It cleans in between the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using these hard to find toothbrushes for years. You will crave them if you run out. For me my mouth gets sore if I wear my last one out and don&#x27;t replace it. This is simply one of my top ten personal healthcare items I use it alongside my Sonicare. This company also makes a great tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t floss.  This is the next best thing.  This brush is Very different than a standard toothbrush.  Also very soft.</li>
            <li> These really work, I have used them for years.</li>
            <li> This flossing toothbrush is the only one I use. It has bristles that are different lengths which makes it easier to brush those hard to get areas. It really is like flossing at the same time you&#x27;re brushing. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on gums. Not sure you can do away with flossing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush.  It truly does floss while you brush. This is a standard variegated height bristle brush with finer and longer bristles along both sides. which penetrate between teeth and under the gum line. They are not thick and hard like other brushes, but are finer. I always hated after brushing with previous brushes how I could still feel biofilm around my gum line where the brush had not reached. After a few brushings you will learn and it gently cleans where regular brushes do not reach. (See directions below)  Not even so called \\&quot;reach\\&quot; brushes can get where this one does.  I just had my 6 month check up and the hygienist could not believe how great my teeth looked.  And my gum pocket numbers were all excellent.  My mouth feels fresher and my teeth feel cleaner after using this brush.  I use regular floss every 2 -3 weeks, so this is a real time saver.  No it is NOT a replacement for flossing, but it is a huge improvement over all other brushes.  I have tried them all, and others are too rough, or don&#x27;t penetrate.  This one worked great. It takes a little while to learn to move with the different shaped bristles.  Mine is probably 8 months old and the bristles are starting to fall out.  But that is fine because it should be replaced for health reasons much sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST way to use this brush is after your regular up/down and back and forth as directed by your dentist, I place it in one spot directing the bristles between each set of teeth and make very tiny little circles.  This gives me a cleaning that our $100 Sonic toothbrush never did!  I also NEVER use any products with SLS (Sodium Laurel Sulphate),  Fluoride or Alcohol in my oral care.  This is proof that safer products along with a great brush do more than dangerous additives and popular brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the child&#x27;s size version: [[ASIN:B006F96EOG SoFresh Child&#x27;s Flossing Toothbrush Assorted Colors]]</li>
            <li> This brush does such a complete job.When i am in a hurry it does the complete job and feels great and stimulates entire gum area.Would recomend to all my family and friends.Really works.</li>
            <li> The overall quality of toothbrushes seems to have have declined over the years, while getting more expensive. Finally, I turned to the Internet to try to find a better toothbrush and took a chance on SoFresh Flossing Toothbrush. It has two heights of wonderfully soft bristles (I used to think that harder bristles must do a better job but my dentist straightened me out on that. I&#x27;ll be back for another...but not very soon!</li>
            <li> One of the best tooth brushes I have ever used</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  Really cleans between my teeth.  Perfect for me since I&#x27;m not great on flossing too much.</li>
