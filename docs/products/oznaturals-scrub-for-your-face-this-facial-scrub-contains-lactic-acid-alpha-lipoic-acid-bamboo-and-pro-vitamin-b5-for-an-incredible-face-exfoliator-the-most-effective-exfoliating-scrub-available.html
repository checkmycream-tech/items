            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>this is a very good product sand is worth buying.</li>
            <li>but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>I feel that it gives the skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It does not scratch your skin off but it is a nice exfoliator</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li>I never did much exfoliation until I went to the spa and got this awesome exfoliation treatment</li>
            <li>I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED.</li>
            <li>Nice one.</li>
            <li>I have used Oz Naturals products before and liked them a lot so</li>
            <li>This is an extremely effective exfoliator.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>so I kind of combine our review scores.</li>
            <li>did receive this to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use with great results!</li>
            <li>The top part to get the exfoliator out was tricky to figure out because you just twist the very top part.</li>
            <li>Very fine particles which were very gentle on the skin but yet a very good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>But I gave it a try and am SUPER happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love this product!</li>
            <li>This scrub was perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This exfoliator really works and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an incredible exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Wonderful natural scrub to use weekly to enhance skin.</li>
            <li>* - it&#x27;s a very fine powder</li>
            <li>Very happy overall  &amp;#34;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>I leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Makeup and lotions went on very smooth after.</li>
            <li>This scrub is very good but not get it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the shake container</li>
            <li>others have stated, the bottle top could use an upgrade.</li>
            <li>does it buff your skin and make it feel like velvet, but it has the lactic acid component most exfoliators don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product is more abrasive than I would like to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>For me, I like this more as a hand scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably my favorite exfoliant of all time is Kate Somerville&#x27;s Exfolikate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with a harsher scrub.</li>
            <li>I unscrewed  the top and have  been  using  </li>
            <li>I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>

            <li>i love the way it makes amy face feel and look.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li>I received this exfoliate for free to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this rice powder mixture.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I opened it by unscrewing the top.</li>
            <li>Enjoy and use sparingly!</li>
            <li>I just love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>received this item free of charge for an honest review</li>
            <li>I love to use it after I remover my makeup.</li>
            <li>I think this makes whatever serum or moisturizer you put on afterwards soak in a lot better.</li>
            <li>love love love :)</li>
            <li>To begin with I love that this item is cruelty free!</li>
            <li>you have baby smooth skin!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love all the products that I&#x27;ve tried in this line.  </li>
            <li>, I feel like you get more value for the money.  </li>
            <li>Cute packaging.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free!</li>
            <li>The product spreads evenly over your skin, and when you rinse it off, it feels LOVELY.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I recommend this product and have thoroughly enjoyed the smoother skin it provides.</li>
            <li>It has Aloe in it and that is something I am allergic to but for others it may be okay.</li>
            <li>Ok, I am not one to write reviews about products because I believe that &amp;#34;tastes&amp;#34; are varied according to who you are.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice scrub to it which I do enjoy because I feel like there is a build up on my skin at times.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say that this product is great and Oz Naturals does it again!</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>- then you leave it on for 5 minutes so that the lactic acid can work it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li>did receive this product free in return for an honest reveiw.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that you don&#x27;t clog the part where the powder comes out of.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Every time I try something from this line I fall in love with it</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li>So far, I have truly loved each one that I have tried!</li>
            <li>Makes my face and necklace feel amazing and so clean.</li>
            <li>Face was baby smooth after and it was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle exfoliator and does a good job at cleaning the skin of acne and blackheads without any irritation to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Great lovely natural products that do the job well!</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I loved how my skin felt  the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for 2 months now - Love it, easy to apply to the skin at night..</li>
            <li>I am glad to have discovered this company,so far I have tried 3 of their products and I am extremely happy with this company.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more finely ground.  </li>
            <li>My face since using Oz Naturals scrub has been so much more clearer and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regular exfoliation is one of the most effective ways to repair/replace damaged skin but keep in mind that this is just the first step in the process.</li>
            <li>Mixing the OZ Naturals Scrub with your OZ Naturals facial cleanser feels really good and does a great job cleaning your skin, your face feels fresh and invigorated.  </li>
            <li>received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>The rice and bamboo give a perfect blend; it&#x27;s just such a super exfoliator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best if you have some water in a bottle (dropper or spray) so that you have complete control over how much water comes out at a time.</li>
            <li>and I like how easy it is to dispense the product.</li>
            <li>Great facial scrub, I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I used this while in the shower and found that it was easy to dispense the powder into my hand</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t dissolve too easily before I could rub it onto my face.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow instructions this item is in powder form</li>
            <li>fine powder provides mechanical exfoliation and</li>
            <li>Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>super  fresh and bright  right after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very professionally and securely packaged and it arrived to my home very quickly!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fine ground rice powder that is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m furious that this product misled me and the reviews weren&#x27;t accurate.</li>
            <li>effective.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li>... After I use OZ exfoliate, my face always feels as smooth as a baby ....</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I enjoy OZ Naturals.  </li>
            <li>but my review is genuine.</li>
            <li>I was sent this product for free for review</li>
            <li>I love the way you can customize and make a fresh paste every time you use</li>
            <li>After I used this product my skin was incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>I could easily only every use this one scrub and be perfectly happy.</li>
            <li>got this as a free sample to review.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product 3 times a week; my face is so smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I received this as a promotional sample free of charge for my unbiased opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I remember correctly, I think I received this as a free product.</li>
            <li>After using this my face immediately felt so smooth, a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>However it does make your face smooth after, dries like sand on your face</li>
            <li>They sent me a free bottle of this exfoliator to try</li>
            <li>but this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I do receive free products for an accurate review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit tempted to rub this on my legs before shaving to get a smooth shave</li>
            <li>It made my skin glow and remain oil free all day.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly to buff my skins smooth, and I can use it a few times per week.</li>
            <li>but the Dermalogica one is far superior.</li>
            <li>its just so much for effective than others I have used and is so unique.</li>
            <li>Thanks, OZ, for providing clean ingredients in amazing products that WORK.  </li>
            <li>As a person who is constantly trying out new beauty products, I was really impressed with the effectiveness of it.</li>
            <li>First I don&#x27;t  like the shaker top</li>
            <li>First, I mix this in with my liquid cleanser sometimes, it feels better this way, and it works just as well</li>
            <li>wonderful product will probably use once a week as it is quite potent made my skin smooth and shiny immediately without irritating</li>
            <li>I have found though it takes very little to get an excellent and thorough clean.</li>
            <li>I think I like it more as a hand scrub than a face scrub because it really makes my hands feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love all the OZ products and this one makes your face so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Leaves my pores clean.</li>
            <li>One of the best things about this exfoliator is the ingredient list is a simple and natural one with five ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job with exfoliating my skin without leaving dry patches behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While there are a lot thing going against the product, I will admit that every time I have used it I felt my pores being unclogged and my skin feels really clean and toned.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin clean, refreshed and glowing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was very, very surprised at how well it works and how amazing my face felt after using it.</li>
            <li>so be sure to utilize the proper routine for best long term results.</li>
            <li>The Dermafoliant has Organic Rice Powder, Green Tea Powder, Lactic Acid, Provitamin B5 and even Bamboo, it is in a finely ground powder form, I know all of those things are great for my skin, and it’s even vegan and animal cruelty free which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only needed 4-5 drops to create a nice, gritty paste that was very easy to work with and scrubbed my face effectively.</li>
            <li>I still have a full tube of Exfolikate, but the truth is, when it&#x27;s gone, I think I found its replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was good enough for me until I tried this.</li>
            <li>This scrub is extremely gentle and leave your akin so smooth you can&#x27;t even believe it!</li>
            <li>Given about five minutes to activate, it rinsed leaving no residue and made my skin feel fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I really love the whole OZ Naturals line</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s so rare to find a beauty product line that is both vegan and cruelty free,</li>
            <li>I like to leave it on for a couple minutes to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>So I was delighted to get to test this version by Oz naturals, a brand that I trust and have liked in the past.</li>
            <li>Then I scrubbed my face in circular motions, you do not need to scrub hard at all, this dermafoliant scrub is very effective!  </li>
            <li>I am in love with Oz Naturals new product!</li>
            <li>I however, found it to be a super scrub.</li>
            <li>After I used the exfoliator I touched my chin and for the first time in years it was smooth.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>It does clean very well and it feels smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean that I don&#x27;t want to stop touching it.</li>
            <li>It is not easy to create the paste to the way it should be (after many attempts I realized that one drop of water is the best choice), not only did I feel the texture of the paste is grittier like sand</li>
            <li>I just think that after trying brushes and little drug store packets this is by far the absolute best for exfoliating, powder and a little water, so easy to use to get that great smooth feeling on your face.</li>
            <li>and you do feel like your skin is more refreshed and new</li>
            <li>You see, I have always loved dry scrubs where I could add it to water, or my face wash or whatever else</li>
            <li>It has a soft scent and it gently removes old cells to leave your skin feeling soft and smooth,  I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I avoided my eye area as I am really cautious about that area!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not that easy to twist the top to open it.</li>
            <li>However, I love that the top is like a salt/pepper shaker with little holes in it, making it really easy to get just the right amount (nickel size) in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>long way.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is very fine, the abrasers are fine in size and texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I think it is also important to note that you need to be gentle like the instructions say when you are scrubbing your face.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it made my skin.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to a lot of cosmetics so finding something that wasn&#x27;t heavy in &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is great.</li>
            <li>It was a great way to exfoliate without being a harsh and abrasive product.</li>
            <li>Now my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive for the most part.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised how much better it was than what I was using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the twisty salt shaker esq bottle cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin stays glowy &amp; fresh for days after using it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the fact the Oz Naturals products are natural and made in the USA.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to try something natural for once.</li>
            <li>and so far have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin clean and fresh, but be very gentle with the first use and avoid exposure to the sun afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently started using some of the other Oz products and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It does also work well with the face, but be sure to use a moisturizer after drying skin after shower/bath - and remember to pat dry, not rub the skin when drying.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product and would recommend to anyone who wants to use as suggested with only water, as well as those more advanced that would use it as the exfoliating</li>
            <li>Considering how much product this comes with I think 1 bottle will last a long time which is great!  </li>
            <li>on right</li>
            <li>I think it will be a new staple in my skincare routine, and I plan to give them as gifts in the future as it is perfect for the skincare ethusist who has it all or those just starting out.</li>
            <li>It rinses off very easily and your skin will feel instantly softer and smoother!</li>
            <li>found one of my mini travel bottles that wasn&#x27;t being used, and placing some OZ Naturals Best Rice Enzyme (facial scrub) in the bottle, also adding a few drops of jojoba oil, and peppermint oil, to make my own personal refresher body scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup applies more smoothly when I use this, as I don&#x27;t have dry skin bits to contend with anymore.</li>
            <li>It was super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can&#x27;t use it in the shower, and need to keep the powder dry when not in use, but as a straight scrub, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>yeah, it has a pleasant enough taste, as it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>When time is up the residue is gently rinsed off and patted dry and the end result is skin that feels supremely soft, supple and beautifully</li>
            <li>So if you weren&#x27;t sure if you got it all over your face, you&#x27;ll be sure once it has dried.</li>
            <li>nice facial scrub, really does the job.</li>
            <li>So far so good with the initial use of this exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Such a gentle yet effective product.</li>
            <li>,then I let it sit for 5 min,then rinsed,my skin was very soft and smooth</li>
            <li>My face has never been so smooth and soft until I used this product!</li>
            <li>desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried to mix the powder with water, way too much water was added too quickly.</li>
            <li>And my wallet doesn&#x27;t mind it either as it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>feel my skin is not only clean but also smooth after use.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face super well and leaves it feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>I love this facial Exfoliator</li>
            <li>I love about this product is not only</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re probably also aware it&#x27;s not cheap, but then that&#x27;s the price of a good exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Finally  I would  have given  this a 5 star but that shaker top has to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I was so weirded out my the packaging at first.</li>
            <li>You DO NOT need to remove the lid, just twist a click and the holes will open on top like a powder shaker bottle.</li>
            <li>sure FEELS a lot younger.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Like all of the OZ naturals products this is all natural and cruelty free</li>
            <li>and it make me look and feel younger :)</li>
            <li>&gt; When I first got the product</li>
            <li>This white powder comes in an aluminum bottle with a shaker top.  </li>
            <li>I also am using this on my hands and they are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>All their products are cruelty free and natural.</li>
            <li>(so I do it before brushing my teeth, and leave it on while I brush my teeth and scoop the cat box ;-) ).  </li>
            <li>much* easier to use this way!</li>
            <li>At first I used it by just mixing with water</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and applied it every day for the first week.</li>
            <li>I personally isnt a fan of the packaging, and I wish they put a lid on top too.</li>
            <li>Though I have pretty sensitive skin, this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, so I was delighted to have a product that actually let me see pretty much immediate results without any irritation.</li>
            <li>It is true that the exfoliating process feels more potent than other exfoliators  while at the same time it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin damaged and irritated.  </li>
            <li>The scrub left my skin feeling clean, refreshed, super soft and flake free</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it with a facial exfoliator and it does absolute wonders : )</li>
            <li>This one pretty much blew me</li>
            <li>Other buyers/users commented on the texture and on the design-flaw (it reminds me of the good old day talcum powder dispenser head)</li>
            <li>I will not only be returning this for a full refund but writing a blog about it to warn others!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended - just give these products time to show results and be consistent.</li>
            <li>No perfumes and the gentle beads were effective without being harsh.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really  like the way this stuff  feels on my skin...</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this because of the description that it&#x27;s gentle and paste like.  </li>
            <li>This thing isn&#x27;t gentle.  </li>
            <li>skin looks fantastic after using this for the last month or so.</li>
            <li>But will continue using it thanks oznaturals</li>
            <li>Left my skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>so I was very intrigued.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>My wife did not like this product as much as I did, ergo the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Must rinse REALLY</li>
            <li>The claim is this product gently exfoliates skin and unclogs pores without irritation, drying, or stripping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used powder exfoliants before and I really like this one by OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li>So I just remove the whole lid to pour the product.</li>
            <li>I actually really like that this comes in a powder form</li>
            <li>Can be used in your whole face or just in problem areas.</li>
            <li>When I received the package, I was unsure if I would like the method of adding water, but after several uses, my skin feels smooth and gives me confidence that I have not had in years.</li>
            <li>sometimes it was just easier to take off the whole cap then to try and turn it</li>
            <li>My face is improving while adding this to my face regimen in a sense that my face feel much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look at the description very well when I ordered this</li>
            <li>, is the twist cap does not work very well.</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals really needs to redesign the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The paste is then massaged into your skin with gentle circular motions and then you let it set for 3-5 minutes to let the lactic acid compounds penetrate the skin.  </li>
            <li>would then massage my face gently</li>
            <li>(really nothing to get upset about)</li>
            <li>After each time I&#x27;ve used it my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s been nicely cleansed/scrubbed, but rather it feels like it just scratched off a few protective layers of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I am as pleased with this exfoliant as I am with the other Oz products I use in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I applied a retinol cream after and it went on much easier and absorbed so much better than usual.</li>
            <li>I love the asian influence in this product, as I&#x27;ve been interested in asian skincare.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial scrub, and will last a long time because you do not need to use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product because it helps me with my acne but is gentle enough it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you need an exfoliator for your face that is not irritating.</li>
            <li>Like other Oz natural products ancient orient rice enzyme dermafoliant is made of natural ingredients and free from harsh chemicals, making it great for any type of skin.</li>
            <li>, a mistake I made on my first two uses was to remove the complete lid to the bottle.</li>
            <li>like the tiny grains (they are better for resurfacing, rather than big grains in apricot scrubs.</li>
            <li>This is rough on the skin - there are far better products out there including Laura Mercier&#x27;s face scrub.  </li>
            <li>was lucky enough to get this product in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>We even threw out 2 tubes of a name brand toothpaste after discovering that particular brand used the plastic microbeads, which is known to contaminant the water supply and environment.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic, absolutely left my skin radiant and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been eyeing rice enzyme exfoliating powders for some months after reading about them in a magazine article, but the high price has kept me away.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to exfoliating powders then initial application might seem unusual - this is basically a fine powder that is sprinkled into your hands and then mixed with a small amount of warm water and rubbed together into a paste.</li>
            <li>I also think that the cap could of been made a little better as for me</li>
            <li>I used a little bit more than a nickel size and added the water.</li>
            <li>It has all natural ingredients which makes it gentle and harmless for the skin.</li>
            <li>All you do is make a paste with the granules and than rub it into your face, leave it on for a few mins and than rinse it off it could not be simpler or more</li>
            <li>the product is dried, it&#x27;s more noticeable on the skin.</li>
            <li>but I also decided to add a few more steps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I definitely think that it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and only a little bit is needed, so the bottle is sure to last for months.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is more suitable for a every other day or a few times a week but not a daily scrub.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin with some combination skin, and it does a good job at taking any dead flaky skin off without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it a few times a week and not only does it leave your face feeling clean and smooth, it has reduced my breakouts.</li>
            <li>Overall its a great product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The container is cheap with the metal threads on cap sharp.</li>
            <li>With most new products, I&#x27;ll only use it a few times a week at first until I see how my skin reacts.</li>
            <li>After opening I poured a little on my hand and was presented with a hand full of very fine sand/powder - reminded me of a shaved down batch of beach sand.</li>
            <li>This is new to the product line</li>
            <li>I have a ton of whiteheads that live on my chin</li>
            <li>I take my beauty routine pretty seriously, and that means I uses washes, exfoliates, oils, lotions and more to keep my skin looking as fresh and young as possible.</li>
            <li>This product does not have the plastic beads either which is a plus, but my biggest thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of weird chemicals, which for me is huge as I try to find skincare that is more natural.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I found it much easier to just open the whole bottle cap.</li>
            <li>is still feeling very sensitive from the scratch.  </li>
            <li>I have T zone and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I will *definitely* be reordering it when  I run out (which probably won&#x27;t be for a while as you don&#x27;t need very much each time).  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use: just use a small amount of water with it in your palm to make a paste and rub gently into your face.  </li>
            <li>It is hard finding products made from natural (and mostly organic) ingredients that really work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still pretty floored that something that&#x27;s a third of the price can perform the way this rice enzyme scrub can.</li>
            <li>First this scrub is very different from what I used before,it is a powder that you have to mix with water.once</li>
            <li>This does not irritate my sensitive skin at all!</li>
            <li>My only two complaints about the product which were more of a manufacturing issues were the fact that when I opened the box, I spilled powder everywhere that I believe was outside of the actual product.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a terrific product that produces visible and tactile benefits immediately after your first try.</li>
            <li>It does just as good of a job (if not better) and is only a third of the price.</li>
            <li>I love exfoliating my face because for some reason, my face is on hyper mode as far as producing black and white heads go.</li>
            <li>I have used scrubs for years and really the only thing that they have done is remove some of my dry, flaky skin and left it smooth.</li>
            <li>Just put a little in your hand, add some water, make into a paste, and rub on face, neck, and hands for soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li>They only lasted one day and then my skin was so soft and so much brighter.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t turn into a paste just clear with beads in it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels twice as soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>Hey Oz, how about finding a natural way to include SPF into your moisturizers?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how well this product exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li>I saw almost instance results (as far as texture).</li>
            <li>This is why I opted to use Rosewater for my mixture - not only is it gentle, but it comes out of the bottle in drops.</li>
            <li>It left my skin with a glow and was not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin  or rosacea</li>
            <li>and wow I use this product at night and in the morning</li>
            <li>Also my skin was really soft after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of OZ Natural products now</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the product from packaging to product outcome it was everything it claimed to be</li>
            <li>Others complained about the design of the top, but it does rotate to close so</li>
            <li>A lot of big name companies don&#x27;t care about the ethical treatment of animals.</li>
            <li>It is also 90% organic and 100% natural.</li>
            <li>Not harsh.</li>
            <li>OZ Natural Scrub is truly a renovation in skin care for a man or woman of any age.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This was not for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I added it to my fav skincare face wash that is very light..not a gel..and mixed it in and used.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it once and let me tell you, it made my skin supple and soft.  </li>
            <li>I tried not to used too much as I want to save as much as possible for a prolong period.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain anything that irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>It comes in a round container that the top twists open and has holes like a baby powder bottle.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s expensive even though I loved the way my skin looked after.</li>
            <li>It works well if you add it to a normal mild face cleanser to make it a little gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a ton smoother and this is the only new item to my normal routine..</li>
            <li>,I like to put it on before a shower so it rinses well with no mess.</li>
            <li>I thought what a cool product packaging it comes in a powder form and the bottle has a topper like baby powder with little holes to distribute.</li>
            <li>It is high quality products for a low price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the queen of exfoliators; I&#x27;ve probably tried every product, low to high end, on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do want to say to be careful when you are rubbing the exfoliate on your skin because you need to go very gentle or it will hurt.</li>
            <li>If your not use to a exfoliant powder it takes a little getting use to as far as how much to use and how much water to mix with it.</li>
            <li>A tiny little bit of this goes a long way, and it really leaves my skin feeling polished and smooth.</li>
            <li>You add just a TINY bit of water to it, in the palm of your hand, and then smooth it onto your face and scrub it for a few minutes</li>
            <li>At first it felt a lot rougher than other exfoliators I have used but have gotten used to it now.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is like no other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a big change in my complexion since I started using OZ Natural products.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to mix some of the scrub with my facial cleanser and WOW what a difference that made.</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t get myself to stay on top of it, it hurts and I make sure I run gently.... disappointed!!</li>
            <li>Within the 5 minutes it will dry, when it dries it sort of has a grainy white appearance again, just rinse with water gently and thoroughly</li>
            <li>It has the right amount of green tea to make your skin feel refreshed but not too oily.</li>
            <li>This is a finely ground white powder that you only need a small amount with water to make into a paste that you rub into the face.  </li>
            <li>Of all the things I can do to improve my skin, I have to admit the fastest and most dramatic changes come with exfoliants.</li>
            <li>I really hate misleading advertising and judging by the reviews, most of these women have been paid to write favorable reviews in exchange of a free bottle?  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can measure out exactly what I need; not too much/too little.</li>
            <li>I did have a tiny breakout of tiny red bumps the first time I used it, but that is due to it bringing out impurities.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see a change yet but it does leaves my skin dewy soft I like that.  </li>
            <li>I was in fact very pleasantly surprised, that my face didn&#x27;t dry up after using this scrub!</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I had high hopes for this Natural Scrub and as in the case of their other products that I have tried, I was not disappointed.</li>

            <li> I was given this product for my HONEST review!</li>
            <li> and* so effective!</li>
            <li> Those of you who have had the chance to use it probably know how good it is, and instantaneous the results are.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> ,I loved it,no irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> Took it to work for my friends to try and they loved it too.  </li>
            <li> Apricot scrub works just as good</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice with a great container.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I need to use exfoliaters for my face and I have found ones that were good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the good exfoliants that I tried.</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting item.  </li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> I love the Oz Naturals Ancient Orient Rice Enzyme Dermafoliant!</li>
            <li> I love this company!</li>
            <li> ... I&#x27;m so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> * how smooth my skin is after using this OZ Naturals scrub!!  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> this is a very good product sand is worth buying.</li>
            <li> but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I feel that it gives the skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> It does not scratch your skin off but it is a nice exfoliator</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I never did much exfoliation until I went to the spa and got this awesome exfoliation treatment</li>
            <li> I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED.</li>
            <li> Nice one.</li>
            <li> I have used Oz Naturals products before and liked them a lot so</li>
            <li> This is an extremely effective exfoliator.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> so I kind of combine our review scores.</li>
            <li> did receive this to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use with great results!</li>
            <li> The top part to get the exfoliator out was tricky to figure out because you just twist the very top part.</li>
            <li> Very fine particles which were very gentle on the skin but yet a very good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> But I gave it a try and am SUPER happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love this product!</li>
            <li> This scrub was perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator really works and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an incredible exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Wonderful natural scrub to use weekly to enhance skin.</li>
            <li> * - it&#x27;s a very fine powder</li>
            <li> Very happy overall  &amp;#34;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> I leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Makeup and lotions went on very smooth after.</li>
            <li> This scrub is very good but not get it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the shake container</li>
            <li> others have stated, the bottle top could use an upgrade.</li>
            <li> does it buff your skin and make it feel like velvet, but it has the lactic acid component most exfoliators don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product is more abrasive than I would like to use on my face.  </li>
            <li> For me, I like this more as a hand scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably my favorite exfoliant of all time is Kate Somerville&#x27;s Exfolikate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OK with a harsher scrub.</li>
            <li> I unscrewed  the top and have  been  using  </li>
            <li> I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> i love the way it makes amy face feel and look.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li> I received this exfoliate for free to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this rice powder mixture.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I opened it by unscrewing the top.</li>
            <li> Enjoy and use sparingly!</li>
            <li> I just love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> received this item free of charge for an honest review</li>
            <li> I love to use it after I remover my makeup.</li>
            <li> I think this makes whatever serum or moisturizer you put on afterwards soak in a lot better.</li>
            <li> love love love :)</li>
            <li> To begin with I love that this item is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> you have baby smooth skin!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love all the products that I&#x27;ve tried in this line.  </li>
            <li> , I feel like you get more value for the money.  </li>
            <li> Cute packaging.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free!</li>
            <li> The product spreads evenly over your skin, and when you rinse it off, it feels LOVELY.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I recommend this product and have thoroughly enjoyed the smoother skin it provides.</li>
            <li> It has Aloe in it and that is something I am allergic to but for others it may be okay.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am not one to write reviews about products because I believe that &amp;#34;tastes&amp;#34; are varied according to who you are.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice scrub to it which I do enjoy because I feel like there is a build up on my skin at times.</li>
            <li> Overall I would say that this product is great and Oz Naturals does it again!</li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> - then you leave it on for 5 minutes so that the lactic acid can work it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li> did receive this product free in return for an honest reveiw.  </li>
            <li> Make sure that you don&#x27;t clog the part where the powder comes out of.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> Every time I try something from this line I fall in love with it</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> So far, I have truly loved each one that I have tried!</li>
            <li> Makes my face and necklace feel amazing and so clean.</li>
            <li> Face was baby smooth after and it was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle exfoliator and does a good job at cleaning the skin of acne and blackheads without any irritation to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Great lovely natural products that do the job well!</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I loved how my skin felt  the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 2 months now - Love it, easy to apply to the skin at night..</li>
            <li> I am glad to have discovered this company,so far I have tried 3 of their products and I am extremely happy with this company.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more finely ground.  </li>
            <li> My face since using Oz Naturals scrub has been so much more clearer and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regular exfoliation is one of the most effective ways to repair/replace damaged skin but keep in mind that this is just the first step in the process.</li>
            <li> Mixing the OZ Naturals Scrub with your OZ Naturals facial cleanser feels really good and does a great job cleaning your skin, your face feels fresh and invigorated.  </li>
            <li> received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The rice and bamboo give a perfect blend; it&#x27;s just such a super exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best if you have some water in a bottle (dropper or spray) so that you have complete control over how much water comes out at a time.</li>
            <li> and I like how easy it is to dispense the product.</li>
            <li> Great facial scrub, I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I used this while in the shower and found that it was easy to dispense the powder into my hand</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t dissolve too easily before I could rub it onto my face.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions this item is in powder form</li>
            <li> fine powder provides mechanical exfoliation and</li>
            <li> Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> super  fresh and bright  right after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very professionally and securely packaged and it arrived to my home very quickly!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fine ground rice powder that is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m furious that this product misled me and the reviews weren&#x27;t accurate.</li>
            <li> effective.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li> ... After I use OZ exfoliate, my face always feels as smooth as a baby ....</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I enjoy OZ Naturals.  </li>
            <li> but my review is genuine.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free for review</li>
            <li> I love the way you can customize and make a fresh paste every time you use</li>
            <li> After I used this product my skin was incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> I could easily only every use this one scrub and be perfectly happy.</li>
            <li> got this as a free sample to review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 3 times a week; my face is so smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotional sample free of charge for my unbiased opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I remember correctly, I think I received this as a free product.</li>
            <li> After using this my face immediately felt so smooth, a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> However it does make your face smooth after, dries like sand on your face</li>
            <li> They sent me a free bottle of this exfoliator to try</li>
            <li> but this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I do receive free products for an accurate review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit tempted to rub this on my legs before shaving to get a smooth shave</li>
            <li> It made my skin glow and remain oil free all day.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly to buff my skins smooth, and I can use it a few times per week.</li>
            <li> but the Dermalogica one is far superior.</li>
            <li> its just so much for effective than others I have used and is so unique.</li>
            <li> Thanks, OZ, for providing clean ingredients in amazing products that WORK.  </li>
            <li> As a person who is constantly trying out new beauty products, I was really impressed with the effectiveness of it.</li>
            <li> First I don&#x27;t  like the shaker top</li>
            <li> First, I mix this in with my liquid cleanser sometimes, it feels better this way, and it works just as well</li>
            <li> wonderful product will probably use once a week as it is quite potent made my skin smooth and shiny immediately without irritating</li>
            <li> I have found though it takes very little to get an excellent and thorough clean.</li>
            <li> I think I like it more as a hand scrub than a face scrub because it really makes my hands feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love all the OZ products and this one makes your face so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Leaves my pores clean.</li>
            <li> One of the best things about this exfoliator is the ingredient list is a simple and natural one with five ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job with exfoliating my skin without leaving dry patches behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While there are a lot thing going against the product, I will admit that every time I have used it I felt my pores being unclogged and my skin feels really clean and toned.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin clean, refreshed and glowing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was very, very surprised at how well it works and how amazing my face felt after using it.</li>
            <li> so be sure to utilize the proper routine for best long term results.</li>
            <li> The Dermafoliant has Organic Rice Powder, Green Tea Powder, Lactic Acid, Provitamin B5 and even Bamboo, it is in a finely ground powder form, I know all of those things are great for my skin, and it’s even vegan and animal cruelty free which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only needed 4-5 drops to create a nice, gritty paste that was very easy to work with and scrubbed my face effectively.</li>
            <li> I still have a full tube of Exfolikate, but the truth is, when it&#x27;s gone, I think I found its replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was good enough for me until I tried this.</li>
            <li> This scrub is extremely gentle and leave your akin so smooth you can&#x27;t even believe it!</li>
            <li> Given about five minutes to activate, it rinsed leaving no residue and made my skin feel fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I really love the whole OZ Naturals line</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so rare to find a beauty product line that is both vegan and cruelty free,</li>
            <li> I like to leave it on for a couple minutes to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> So I was delighted to get to test this version by Oz naturals, a brand that I trust and have liked in the past.</li>
            <li> Then I scrubbed my face in circular motions, you do not need to scrub hard at all, this dermafoliant scrub is very effective!  </li>
            <li> I am in love with Oz Naturals new product!</li>
            <li> I however, found it to be a super scrub.</li>
            <li> After I used the exfoliator I touched my chin and for the first time in years it was smooth.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> It does clean very well and it feels smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean that I don&#x27;t want to stop touching it.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to create the paste to the way it should be (after many attempts I realized that one drop of water is the best choice), not only did I feel the texture of the paste is grittier like sand</li>
            <li> I just think that after trying brushes and little drug store packets this is by far the absolute best for exfoliating, powder and a little water, so easy to use to get that great smooth feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> and you do feel like your skin is more refreshed and new</li>
            <li> You see, I have always loved dry scrubs where I could add it to water, or my face wash or whatever else</li>
            <li> It has a soft scent and it gently removes old cells to leave your skin feeling soft and smooth,  I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I avoided my eye area as I am really cautious about that area!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not that easy to twist the top to open it.</li>
            <li> However, I love that the top is like a salt/pepper shaker with little holes in it, making it really easy to get just the right amount (nickel size) in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long way.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is very fine, the abrasers are fine in size and texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I think it is also important to note that you need to be gentle like the instructions say when you are scrubbing your face.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it made my skin.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to a lot of cosmetics so finding something that wasn&#x27;t heavy in &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is great.</li>
            <li> It was a great way to exfoliate without being a harsh and abrasive product.</li>
            <li> Now my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive for the most part.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised how much better it was than what I was using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the twisty salt shaker esq bottle cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin stays glowy &amp; fresh for days after using it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact the Oz Naturals products are natural and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to try something natural for once.</li>
            <li> and so far have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin clean and fresh, but be very gentle with the first use and avoid exposure to the sun afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently started using some of the other Oz products and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It does also work well with the face, but be sure to use a moisturizer after drying skin after shower/bath - and remember to pat dry, not rub the skin when drying.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product and would recommend to anyone who wants to use as suggested with only water, as well as those more advanced that would use it as the exfoliating</li>
            <li> Considering how much product this comes with I think 1 bottle will last a long time which is great!  </li>
            <li> on right</li>
            <li> I think it will be a new staple in my skincare routine, and I plan to give them as gifts in the future as it is perfect for the skincare ethusist who has it all or those just starting out.</li>
            <li> It rinses off very easily and your skin will feel instantly softer and smoother!</li>
            <li> found one of my mini travel bottles that wasn&#x27;t being used, and placing some OZ Naturals Best Rice Enzyme (facial scrub) in the bottle, also adding a few drops of jojoba oil, and peppermint oil, to make my own personal refresher body scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup applies more smoothly when I use this, as I don&#x27;t have dry skin bits to contend with anymore.</li>
            <li> It was super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t use it in the shower, and need to keep the powder dry when not in use, but as a straight scrub, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> yeah, it has a pleasant enough taste, as it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> When time is up the residue is gently rinsed off and patted dry and the end result is skin that feels supremely soft, supple and beautifully</li>
            <li> So if you weren&#x27;t sure if you got it all over your face, you&#x27;ll be sure once it has dried.</li>
            <li> nice facial scrub, really does the job.</li>
            <li> So far so good with the initial use of this exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Such a gentle yet effective product.</li>
            <li> ,then I let it sit for 5 min,then rinsed,my skin was very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> My face has never been so smooth and soft until I used this product!</li>
            <li> desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried to mix the powder with water, way too much water was added too quickly.</li>
            <li> And my wallet doesn&#x27;t mind it either as it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> feel my skin is not only clean but also smooth after use.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face super well and leaves it feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> I love this facial Exfoliator</li>
            <li> I love about this product is not only</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably also aware it&#x27;s not cheap, but then that&#x27;s the price of a good exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Finally  I would  have given  this a 5 star but that shaker top has to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I was so weirded out my the packaging at first.</li>
            <li> You DO NOT need to remove the lid, just twist a click and the holes will open on top like a powder shaker bottle.</li>
            <li> sure FEELS a lot younger.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Like all of the OZ naturals products this is all natural and cruelty free</li>
            <li> and it make me look and feel younger :)</li>
            <li> &gt; When I first got the product</li>
            <li> This white powder comes in an aluminum bottle with a shaker top.  </li>
            <li> I also am using this on my hands and they are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> All their products are cruelty free and natural.</li>
            <li> (so I do it before brushing my teeth, and leave it on while I brush my teeth and scoop the cat box ;-) ).  </li>
            <li> much* easier to use this way!</li>
            <li> At first I used it by just mixing with water</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and applied it every day for the first week.</li>
            <li> I personally isnt a fan of the packaging, and I wish they put a lid on top too.</li>
            <li> Though I have pretty sensitive skin, this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, so I was delighted to have a product that actually let me see pretty much immediate results without any irritation.</li>
            <li> It is true that the exfoliating process feels more potent than other exfoliators  while at the same time it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin damaged and irritated.  </li>
            <li> The scrub left my skin feeling clean, refreshed, super soft and flake free</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it with a facial exfoliator and it does absolute wonders : )</li>
            <li> This one pretty much blew me</li>
            <li> Other buyers/users commented on the texture and on the design-flaw (it reminds me of the good old day talcum powder dispenser head)</li>
            <li> I will not only be returning this for a full refund but writing a blog about it to warn others!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended - just give these products time to show results and be consistent.</li>
            <li> No perfumes and the gentle beads were effective without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really  like the way this stuff  feels on my skin...</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because of the description that it&#x27;s gentle and paste like.  </li>
            <li> This thing isn&#x27;t gentle.  </li>
            <li> skin looks fantastic after using this for the last month or so.</li>
            <li> But will continue using it thanks oznaturals</li>
            <li> Left my skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> so I was very intrigued.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> My wife did not like this product as much as I did, ergo the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Must rinse REALLY</li>
            <li> The claim is this product gently exfoliates skin and unclogs pores without irritation, drying, or stripping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used powder exfoliants before and I really like this one by OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li> So I just remove the whole lid to pour the product.</li>
            <li> I actually really like that this comes in a powder form</li>
            <li> Can be used in your whole face or just in problem areas.</li>
            <li> When I received the package, I was unsure if I would like the method of adding water, but after several uses, my skin feels smooth and gives me confidence that I have not had in years.</li>
            <li> sometimes it was just easier to take off the whole cap then to try and turn it</li>
            <li> My face is improving while adding this to my face regimen in a sense that my face feel much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the description very well when I ordered this</li>
            <li> , is the twist cap does not work very well.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals really needs to redesign the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The paste is then massaged into your skin with gentle circular motions and then you let it set for 3-5 minutes to let the lactic acid compounds penetrate the skin.  </li>
            <li> would then massage my face gently</li>
            <li> (really nothing to get upset about)</li>
            <li> After each time I&#x27;ve used it my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s been nicely cleansed/scrubbed, but rather it feels like it just scratched off a few protective layers of my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I am as pleased with this exfoliant as I am with the other Oz products I use in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I applied a retinol cream after and it went on much easier and absorbed so much better than usual.</li>
            <li> I love the asian influence in this product, as I&#x27;ve been interested in asian skincare.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial scrub, and will last a long time because you do not need to use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps me with my acne but is gentle enough it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you need an exfoliator for your face that is not irritating.</li>
            <li> Like other Oz natural products ancient orient rice enzyme dermafoliant is made of natural ingredients and free from harsh chemicals, making it great for any type of skin.</li>
            <li> , a mistake I made on my first two uses was to remove the complete lid to the bottle.</li>
            <li> like the tiny grains (they are better for resurfacing, rather than big grains in apricot scrubs.</li>
            <li> This is rough on the skin - there are far better products out there including Laura Mercier&#x27;s face scrub.  </li>
            <li> was lucky enough to get this product in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> We even threw out 2 tubes of a name brand toothpaste after discovering that particular brand used the plastic microbeads, which is known to contaminant the water supply and environment.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic, absolutely left my skin radiant and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing rice enzyme exfoliating powders for some months after reading about them in a magazine article, but the high price has kept me away.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to exfoliating powders then initial application might seem unusual - this is basically a fine powder that is sprinkled into your hands and then mixed with a small amount of warm water and rubbed together into a paste.</li>
            <li> I also think that the cap could of been made a little better as for me</li>
            <li> I used a little bit more than a nickel size and added the water.</li>
            <li> It has all natural ingredients which makes it gentle and harmless for the skin.</li>
            <li> All you do is make a paste with the granules and than rub it into your face, leave it on for a few mins and than rinse it off it could not be simpler or more</li>
            <li> the product is dried, it&#x27;s more noticeable on the skin.</li>
            <li> but I also decided to add a few more steps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I definitely think that it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and only a little bit is needed, so the bottle is sure to last for months.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is more suitable for a every other day or a few times a week but not a daily scrub.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin with some combination skin, and it does a good job at taking any dead flaky skin off without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week and not only does it leave your face feeling clean and smooth, it has reduced my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Overall its a great product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The container is cheap with the metal threads on cap sharp.</li>
            <li> With most new products, I&#x27;ll only use it a few times a week at first until I see how my skin reacts.</li>
            <li> After opening I poured a little on my hand and was presented with a hand full of very fine sand/powder - reminded me of a shaved down batch of beach sand.</li>
            <li> This is new to the product line</li>
            <li> I have a ton of whiteheads that live on my chin</li>
            <li> I take my beauty routine pretty seriously, and that means I uses washes, exfoliates, oils, lotions and more to keep my skin looking as fresh and young as possible.</li>
            <li> This product does not have the plastic beads either which is a plus, but my biggest thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of weird chemicals, which for me is huge as I try to find skincare that is more natural.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I found it much easier to just open the whole bottle cap.</li>
            <li> is still feeling very sensitive from the scratch.  </li>
            <li> I have T zone and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I will *definitely* be reordering it when  I run out (which probably won&#x27;t be for a while as you don&#x27;t need very much each time).  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use: just use a small amount of water with it in your palm to make a paste and rub gently into your face.  </li>
            <li> It is hard finding products made from natural (and mostly organic) ingredients that really work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still pretty floored that something that&#x27;s a third of the price can perform the way this rice enzyme scrub can.</li>
            <li> First this scrub is very different from what I used before,it is a powder that you have to mix with water.once</li>
            <li> This does not irritate my sensitive skin at all!</li>
            <li> My only two complaints about the product which were more of a manufacturing issues were the fact that when I opened the box, I spilled powder everywhere that I believe was outside of the actual product.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a terrific product that produces visible and tactile benefits immediately after your first try.</li>
            <li> It does just as good of a job (if not better) and is only a third of the price.</li>
            <li> I love exfoliating my face because for some reason, my face is on hyper mode as far as producing black and white heads go.</li>
            <li> I have used scrubs for years and really the only thing that they have done is remove some of my dry, flaky skin and left it smooth.</li>
            <li> Just put a little in your hand, add some water, make into a paste, and rub on face, neck, and hands for soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> They only lasted one day and then my skin was so soft and so much brighter.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t turn into a paste just clear with beads in it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels twice as soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> Hey Oz, how about finding a natural way to include SPF into your moisturizers?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how well this product exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li> I saw almost instance results (as far as texture).</li>
            <li> This is why I opted to use Rosewater for my mixture - not only is it gentle, but it comes out of the bottle in drops.</li>
            <li> It left my skin with a glow and was not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin  or rosacea</li>
            <li> and wow I use this product at night and in the morning</li>
            <li> Also my skin was really soft after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of OZ Natural products now</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the product from packaging to product outcome it was everything it claimed to be</li>
            <li> Others complained about the design of the top, but it does rotate to close so</li>
            <li> A lot of big name companies don&#x27;t care about the ethical treatment of animals.</li>
            <li> It is also 90% organic and 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Not harsh.</li>
            <li> OZ Natural Scrub is truly a renovation in skin care for a man or woman of any age.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This was not for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I added it to my fav skincare face wash that is very light..not a gel..and mixed it in and used.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it once and let me tell you, it made my skin supple and soft.  </li>
            <li> I tried not to used too much as I want to save as much as possible for a prolong period.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain anything that irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> It comes in a round container that the top twists open and has holes like a baby powder bottle.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expensive even though I loved the way my skin looked after.</li>
            <li> It works well if you add it to a normal mild face cleanser to make it a little gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ton smoother and this is the only new item to my normal routine..</li>
            <li> ,I like to put it on before a shower so it rinses well with no mess.</li>
            <li> I thought what a cool product packaging it comes in a powder form and the bottle has a topper like baby powder with little holes to distribute.</li>
            <li> It is high quality products for a low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the queen of exfoliators; I&#x27;ve probably tried every product, low to high end, on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do want to say to be careful when you are rubbing the exfoliate on your skin because you need to go very gentle or it will hurt.</li>
            <li> If your not use to a exfoliant powder it takes a little getting use to as far as how much to use and how much water to mix with it.</li>
            <li> A tiny little bit of this goes a long way, and it really leaves my skin feeling polished and smooth.</li>
            <li> You add just a TINY bit of water to it, in the palm of your hand, and then smooth it onto your face and scrub it for a few minutes</li>
            <li> At first it felt a lot rougher than other exfoliators I have used but have gotten used to it now.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is like no other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big change in my complexion since I started using OZ Natural products.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to mix some of the scrub with my facial cleanser and WOW what a difference that made.</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t get myself to stay on top of it, it hurts and I make sure I run gently.... disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Within the 5 minutes it will dry, when it dries it sort of has a grainy white appearance again, just rinse with water gently and thoroughly</li>
            <li> It has the right amount of green tea to make your skin feel refreshed but not too oily.</li>
            <li> This is a finely ground white powder that you only need a small amount with water to make into a paste that you rub into the face.  </li>
            <li> Of all the things I can do to improve my skin, I have to admit the fastest and most dramatic changes come with exfoliants.</li>
            <li> I really hate misleading advertising and judging by the reviews, most of these women have been paid to write favorable reviews in exchange of a free bottle?  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can measure out exactly what I need; not too much/too little.</li>
            <li> I did have a tiny breakout of tiny red bumps the first time I used it, but that is due to it bringing out impurities.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see a change yet but it does leaves my skin dewy soft I like that.  </li>
            <li> I was in fact very pleasantly surprised, that my face didn&#x27;t dry up after using this scrub!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I had high hopes for this Natural Scrub and as in the case of their other products that I have tried, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Normally, I&#x27;ve used typical american products and the environmentally harmful plastic beads.</li>
            <li> Like other Oz products, not only natural, but they last!</li>
            <li> Usually the exfoliator makes my skin so dry right after use</li>
            <li> For someone with sensitive skin, its hard trying/testing new products.</li>
            <li> You can wash your face then put a small amount of the dry exfoliant in your hand and add a little warm water and make a thin paste and use as normal.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin soft and supple, and gives a slightly dewy appearance.</li>
            <li> and when it was fully dry and put it back on the bottle!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that the grains are very exfoliating so don&#x27;t rub too hard.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, she found it a little too much for her delicate face.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is a good facial scrub that is way different from a conventional cream base</li>
            <li> so it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not surprised</li>
            <li> mixed with water, it turns blue-green and partially dissolves.  </li>
            <li> We will update our review with any long term observations we have with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have acne scars on both of my cheeks from long ago and hoping to give myself a at-home &amp;#34;dermabrasion&amp;#34; to even my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I started off with a clean face, I poured about the size of a nickel (per the directions) of the dermafoliant into the palm of my hand and added a little bit of water and mixed them together in the palm of my hand, to make a thin paste.</li>
            <li> It absolutely resurfaces the skin, and dare I say it, less harshly than Exfolikate.</li>
            <li> only downside is I was expecting a larger product, however, I should&#x27;ve read the size in the description tab, and a little goes a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I follow up with my other Oz products and my face is simply glowing.</li>
            <li> After five minutes, rinse it off and pat your skin dry, don&#x27;t rub as that may irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dry skin by my eyebrows and the skin under the eyebrows</li>
            <li> Although I know exfoliating is so important to skin care, I had been unable to find a product to use due to my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I personally wet my face first with lukewarm water, then shake the powder in my hand added a little bit of water to transform it into a thick</li>
            <li> and I definitely notice that my skin has been less prone to hormonal breakouts and feels smoother on the couple areas that sometimes get bumpy or rough.</li>
            <li> This is a hard combination to combat as too much acne treatment can make me scaly and too little</li>
            <li> Other than those few minor issues the product itself is above and beyond my expectations!</li>
            <li> Second, the cap is really hard to twist open and closed, so I now just leave it in the open position, with a little plastic cap over it so that no moisture gets into the powder.  </li>
            <li> I already have perpetually problematic face - an oil slick for a T zone and constant dryness everywhere else!</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s really no need as that&#x27;d be too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I would be careful.</li>
            <li> and when I touch my chin it is really rough from the whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I never really felt that scrubs had reduced breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> It is then massaged into the face with the fingers or a washcloth and left for a few minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rough on my face.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days in between, but that wasn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> but that was to be expected if its &amp;#34;rice&amp;#34; based.</li>
            <li> yes I agree that you have to be careful when pouring the powder in the palm of your hand</li>
            <li> The paste was not very grainy so it didn&#x27;t feel rough on my skin like some other exfoliators.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You need very little of the product to exfoliate your entire face.</li>
            <li> When  I applied it, it left a scratch on my face and the small area on my face</li>
            <li> decided to follow the directions of placing a small amount in my hands with a tiny puddle of water and mixing before applying to face/skin -</li>
            <li> It almost feels like a dermabrasian, rougher than any other scrub I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it is a bit messy, its powdery and can make a mess</li>
            <li> I agree that the texture of the powder is very rough.</li>
            <li> The rub felt a little rough</li>
            <li> and it is hard to mix and is not a smooth paste when mixed on wet face.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I personally think that the body should have an exfoliating rendezvous at least once a week if not twice.</li>
            <li> color when you add water changes from white to a sort of green brown color (probably from the green tea in it!)</li>
            <li> I also think it is helping with dark spots and pores.  </li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> All of my exfoliators I use post Amazonian clay mask nightly to draw out black head plugs</li>
            <li> But what amazes me is how much less time and less stress to the skin</li>
            <li> I did this in the shower, and that minimized mess and annoyance.</li>
            <li> I put a little less than a nickel size in my hand</li>
            <li> sized  amount into your hand and add a little  bit  of  water  to  create  a paste.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;You pour a little product in your hand and then a little water, make a paste and scrub your face/ body and let it sit for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That did take a little practice, though.  </li>
            <li> it was a little drying to my face</li>
            <li> it might be a little tricky on how to apply the product.</li>
            <li> , a little goes a</li>
            <li> This exfoliant comes in a powder form  that you have to mix with water to create a paste and that is one of the things I don&#x27;t like about it since it makes the process a little bit messy.</li>
            <li> The negative is that the packing is faulty and hard to open and messy to use.</li>
            <li> This scrub is just what I need for my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin, without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> and I find that because you should leave it on your face for a few mins so it can work</li>
            <li> You then massage  it in a circular  motion and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times per week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harsh like SAND from the beach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a grainy powder that you mix with water to form a paste and after you rub it in for few minutes you leave it on for another five to let the lactic acid work.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week to rid the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Received within a few days.  </li>
            <li> The container opens with the powder spilling - it is messy.</li>
            <li> It has green tea and rice in it.</li>
            <li> To me the dermafoliant sort of has a lemony, green tea scent.</li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; stink or heavy feeling to this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so its difficult to find something that will work for me</li>
            <li> It contains lactic acid,bamboo and green tea a combinations that helps to remove dead skin, brightening the skin, reducing and prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I had already been using an apricot type scrub a few times a week - and even so,  </li>
            <li> , I would buy this even if not free.  </li>
            <li> A small amount placed in the palm of your hand and add a little water.</li>
            <li> What you do is this: sprinkle a small, nickel sized amount of powder into your hand, incorporate a drop or two of water, and scrub it all over your face, then you leave it alone for about five minutes to let the lactic acid exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> your missing out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure on what items.</li>
            <li> The scrub comes in a powder that you add a small amount of water to to create a paste.  </li>
            <li> not able to use this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is packaged on a small bottle with sprinkler type cap.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> Very harsh on my face and hard to get on your face from your hand.</li>
            <li> This scrub does all the work for you, you don&#x27;t have to push hard while rubbing this in because it is abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Use this scrub on delicate cheek area of face</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions or breakouts from using this product either.</li>
            <li> Try to avoid the delicate tissue around your eyes please.</li>
            <li> but.... just go slow</li>
            <li> word of caution, go slow in circular motion on your cheeks, chin and forehead.</li>
            <li> One concern I&#x27;ve always had with exfoliating products that I have used in the past, is the fact that they always end up drying my face!</li>
            <li> I immediately became skeptical because every other exfoliator I have ever used was a liquidy grain.</li>
            <li> and I find that a little bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a product that you can control how thick or thin you want the scrub to be, because it is a powder</li>
            <li> The size is fairly small and expensive to be wasting any.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few OZ Naturals products in the past and I have never ever been disappointed with any of their products.</li>
            <li> makes my blackheads worse.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, added water and was a bit confused at the texture.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this product...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this sadly.</li>
            <li> Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that you have to leave it on your skin for five minutes before rinsing it off making this product useless if you want something faster and easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say however that the lid itself is difficult to deal with it is awkward to turn since the powder gets lodged.</li>
            <li> This is somewhat awkward to use.</li>
            <li> a Sephora VIB rouge skincare lover, who wanted a dupe for the very expensive Tatcha rice enzymes.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t contain those harmful beads that are bad for the environment.</li>
            <li> I had read about St. Ives apricot scrub being bad and all of this mumble-jumble hype bullcrap... and long-story-short, I found this.</li>
            <li> so I was totally shocked when I opened it to see it was a powder.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve purchased it for myself, and am getting this one as a gift. The rice and bamboo give a perfect blend; it&#x27;s just such a super exfoliator. My skin feels twice as soft after I use it. I feel that it gives the skin a nice glow. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I like that this is a product that you can control how thick or thin you want the scrub to be, because it is a powder and you add water to it.  It does not scratch your skin off but it is a nice exfoliator and you do feel like your skin is more refreshed and new once you wash it off. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> I am as pleased with this exfoliant as I am with the other Oz products I use in my skin care regimen. This scrub is just what I need for my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin, without being too harsh. It works perfectly to buff my skins smooth, and I can use it a few times per week. Love the shake container it is in, so you can take just what you need. Like other Oz products, not only natural, but they last! Hey Oz, how about finding a natural way to include SPF into your moisturizers? 😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing rice enzyme exfoliating powders for some months after reading about them in a magazine article, but the high price has kept me away. So I was delighted to get to test this version by Oz naturals, a brand that I trust and have liked in the past. What you do is this: sprinkle a small, nickel sized amount of powder into your hand, incorporate a drop or two of water, and scrub it all over your face, then you leave it alone for about five minutes to let the lactic acid exfoliate your skin. After five minutes, rinse it off and pat your skin dry, don&#x27;t rub as that may irritate your skin. I&#x27;ve used it twice in the last week and I definitely notice that my skin has been less prone to hormonal breakouts and feels smoother on the couple areas that sometimes get bumpy or rough. Though I have pretty sensitive skin, this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, so I was delighted to have a product that actually let me see pretty much immediate results without any irritation. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I love this facial Exfoliator its just so much for effective than others I have used and is so unique. What I do is use it twice a week and I find that because you should leave it on your face for a few mins so it can work ,I like to put it on before a shower so it rinses well with no mess. All you do is make a paste with the granules and than rub it into your face, leave it on for a few mins and than rinse it off it could not be simpler or more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:63a84f14d146e337fcbc5acc7c3ee5f]] I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how well this product exfoliates my skin. I saw almost instance results (as far as texture). It&#x27;s really easy to use and only a little bit is needed, so the bottle is sure to last for months. I plan to use it twice a week, although it does say it can be used daily if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried to mix the powder with water, way too much water was added too quickly. It&#x27;s best if you have some water in a bottle (dropper or spray) so that you have complete control over how much water comes out at a time. This is why I opted to use Rosewater for my mixture - not only is it gentle, but it comes out of the bottle in drops. I only needed 4-5 drops to create a nice, gritty paste that was very easy to work with and scrubbed my face effectively. You don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure with this. Once you scrub for a couple minutes, you just leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product is dried, it&#x27;s more noticeable on the skin. So if you weren&#x27;t sure if you got it all over your face, you&#x27;ll be sure once it has dried. It rinses off very easily and your skin will feel instantly softer and smoother! I applied a retinol cream after and it went on much easier and absorbed so much better than usual. The next morning, my skin still felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, the bottle top could use an upgrade. It makes if you attempt to take it off (powder comes out). It&#x27;s also not that easy to twist the top to open it. However, I love that the top is like a salt/pepper shaker with little holes in it, making it really easy to get just the right amount (nickel size) in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> ... After I use OZ exfoliate, my face always feels as smooth as a baby ....</li>
            <li> This is a great scrub. It felt great on the skin and was not too abrasive. It left my skin with a glow and was not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  It is easy to use: just use a small amount of water with it in your palm to make a paste and rub gently into your face.  I did have a tiny breakout of tiny red bumps the first time I used it, but that is due to it bringing out impurities.  They only lasted one day and then my skin was so soft and so much brighter.  I was asked to use it for review and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product last night. I have combination skin and battle blackheads. This is a hard combination to combat as too much acne treatment can make me scaly and too little makes my blackheads worse. All of my exfoliators I use post Amazonian clay mask nightly to draw out black head plugs so the exfoliators can buff away the plugs better.&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product is not only does it buff your skin and make it feel like velvet, but it has the lactic acid component most exfoliators don&#x27;t have. I was going to use this with my clarisonic but there&#x27;s really no need as that&#x27;d be too rough on my skin. This product does not have the plastic beads either which is a plus, but my biggest thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of weird chemicals, which for me is huge as I try to find skincare that is more natural.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is I was expecting a larger product, however, I should&#x27;ve read the size in the description tab, and a little goes a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be incorporating this into my nightly routine just before I apply coconut oil mixed with lavender.</li>
            <li> If you like scrubs, this is definitely an abrasive one!  This is like a semi-fine sand.  It is the epitome of a SCRUB.  This scrub does all the work for you, you don&#x27;t have to push hard while rubbing this in because it is abrasive.  It definitely scrubs the heck out of your skin.  I think I like it more as a hand scrub than a face scrub because it really makes my hands feel smooth.  It works well if you add it to a normal mild face cleanser to make it a little gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is more abrasive than I would like to use on my face.  After each time I&#x27;ve used it my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s been nicely cleansed/scrubbed, but rather it feels like it just scratched off a few protective layers of my skin.  I wish it was more finely ground.  For me, I like this more as a hand scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review by: Oz Naturals&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oz Naturals products for some times now. I am a huge fan! It is high quality products for a low price. Anyways, I just received the facial exfoliate today. It has the right amount of green tea to make your skin feel refreshed but not too oily. The &#x27;exfoliation&#x27; comes from bits of bamboo. I&#x27;ve never used a product with bamboo on my face before. For someone with sensitive skin, its hard trying/testing new products. We contentiously have a fear of what our skin will look like the next day. No breaks for me! I am very eager to see what the results will be a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I will do a follow up message to conclude definable results.</li>
            <li> Of all the things I can do to improve my skin, I have to admit the fastest and most dramatic changes come with exfoliants. I&#x27;m the queen of exfoliators; I&#x27;ve probably tried every product, low to high end, on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably my favorite exfoliant of all time is Kate Somerville&#x27;s Exfolikate. Those of you who have had the chance to use it probably know how good it is, and instantaneous the results are. You&#x27;re probably also aware it&#x27;s not cheap, but then that&#x27;s the price of a good exfoliant. Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that OZ Naturals Rice Enzyme scrub truly gives Exfolikate a run for the money. It absolutely resurfaces the skin, and dare I say it, less harshly than Exfolikate. Now my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive for the most part. I&#x27;m OK with a harsher scrub. But what amazes me is how much less time and less stress to the skin the OZ rice enzyme scrub is, and the result is unmistakeably as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still pretty floored that something that&#x27;s a third of the price can perform the way this rice enzyme scrub can. I still have a full tube of Exfolikate, but the truth is, when it&#x27;s gone, I think I found its replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this product to test in exchange for my unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I enjoy OZ Naturals.  This is new to the product line and I really like it.  The granules do not dissolve away while washing. Personally I like feeling the grit.</li>
            <li> So the way you use this is simple. You  shake  out  a nickel  sized  amount into your hand and add a little  bit  of  water  to  create  a paste. You then massage  it in a circular  motion and let it sit for a few minutes. First I don&#x27;t  like the shaker top it&#x27;s  annoying. I unscrewed  the top and have  been  using  that  way. Second I really  like the way this stuff  feels on my skin...kinda like seltzer on your face.  Third my skin looks  super  fresh and bright  right after use. Finally  I would  have given  this a 5 star but that shaker top has to go. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff the first time I used it. if you have sensitive skin  or rosacea I would be careful.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product. It cleans my face super well and leaves it feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> If you want to look refreshed this is the product for you. I never did much exfoliation until I went to the spa and got this awesome exfoliation treatment but that&#x27;s expensive even though I loved the way my skin looked after. So I decided to purchase a product and wow I use this product at night and in the morning my skin looks so refreshed. It&#x27;s really great and it doesn&#x27;t contain those harmful beads that are bad for the environment. Overall its a great product and a little goes a long way. I use it a few times per week.</li>
            <li> I love all the OZ products and this one makes your face so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> this OZ naturals - best face scrub is absoulty amazing. i love the way it makes amy face feel and look. this is a very good product sand is worth buying. i will be telling my friends and family about it!</li>
            <li> I really hate misleading advertising and judging by the reviews, most of these women have been paid to write favorable reviews in exchange of a free bottle?  Please take it from me...a Sephora VIB rouge skincare lover, who wanted a dupe for the very expensive Tatcha rice enzymes. I wanted to try this because of the description that it&#x27;s gentle and paste like.  And others have commented that this was a dupe for tatcha.  NO WAY!!  This thing isn&#x27;t gentle.  It&#x27;s harsh like SAND from the beach.  I followed the instructions, added water and was a bit confused at the texture. When  I applied it, it left a scratch on my face and the small area on my face is still feeling very sensitive from the scratch.  I&#x27;m furious that this product misled me and the reviews weren&#x27;t accurate. If anyone knows and tried Tatcha, they would know that this does not compare!!! I will not only be returning this for a full refund but writing a blog about it to warn others!  Do not buy!! You will regret it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Mid in with my creamy cleanser.  Use 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> This scrub really removes dead skin and softens your face. It&#x27;s a grainy powder that you mix with water to form a paste and after you rub it in for few minutes you leave it on for another five to let the lactic acid work. I love that it&#x27;s natural and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. A small amount goes a long way. Keep in mind that the grains are very exfoliating so don&#x27;t rub too hard. I was sent this sample to test but my review is genuine. It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product I was so surprised how much better it was than what I was using.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great quality exfoliate powder that you mix with water then use&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
            <li> No it did not meet my expectations..&lt;br /&gt;There is not enough consistency to the powder , does not mix well at all .</li>
            <li> This scrub was perfect for my sensitive skin. No perfumes and the gentle beads were effective without being harsh. I use it twice a week to rid the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Absolutely AMAZING ! My face since using Oz Naturals scrub has been so much more clearer and smooth. I use it with a facial exfoliator and it does absolute wonders : ) It also moisturizes my skin and makes it glow. Has a great scent too it. Not too oily nor does it break out your face. I love it !</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to state that I am a licensed esthectian in the State of Florida.&lt;br /&gt;I know quite a bit about skincare and exfoliators. This one pretty much blew me away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;The actual product is SO neat! I love the way you can customize and make a fresh paste every time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;You pour a little product in your hand and then a little water, make a paste and scrub your face/ body and let it sit for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the tiny grains (they are better for resurfacing, rather than big grains in apricot scrubs. those tend to tear and damage your skin)&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks fantastic after using this for the last month or so. It&#x27;s a ton smoother and this is the only new item to my normal routine..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I was so weirded out my the packaging at first. I&#x27;m not crazy about the twisty salt shaker esq bottle cap.&lt;br /&gt;OR it being metal. My cap is already rusty and that weirds me out. The bottle and cap are made of metal.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it could have been put in plastic or something. Anything but metal.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, love the smoothness of my skin after just one use!</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliator.  At first it felt a lot rougher than other exfoliators I have used but have gotten used to it now.  I leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see a change yet but it does leaves my skin dewy soft I like that.  But will continue using it thanks oznaturals</li>
            <li> Received within a few days.  Use this scrub on delicate cheek area of face and I love it.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Good product. Smells great and works really well. Makes the skin soft and supple, and gives a slightly dewy appearance.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have discovered this company,so far I have tried 3 of their products and I am extremely happy with this company.First this scrub is very different from what I used before,it is a powder that you have to mix with water.once mixed ,it put it on my face,then I let it sit for 5 min,then rinsed,my skin was very soft and smooth,I loved it,no irritation or redness.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use. The size is fairly small and expensive to be wasting any. You put the granular in your hand and then add water. Very harsh on my face and hard to get on your face from your hand. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Nice one. Well made and had no side effects. A sample was sent for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I was nerves before using this exfoliator because it was in power form but it is amazing. The top part to get the exfoliator out was tricky to figure out because you just twist the very top part. I put a little less than a nickel size in my hand and I added water. It didn&#x27;t turn into a paste just clear with beads in it. I applied it to my face and rubbed it in for about a minute then leave it stay on my face for 5 minutes. When I looked at my face after the 5 minutes it had white beads on my face. I washed it off with a hand towel and was amazed at my results. I have a ton of whiteheads that live on my chin and when I touch my chin it is really rough from the whiteheads. After I used the exfoliator I touched my chin and for the first time in years it was smooth. Also my skin was really soft after. This exfoliator really works and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an incredible exfoliator. I do want to say to be careful when you are rubbing the exfoliate on your skin because you need to go very gentle or it will hurt. I received this exfoliate for free to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this rice powder mixture. When it arrived I opened it by unscrewing the top. After opening I poured a little on my hand and was presented with a hand full of very fine sand/powder - reminded me of a shaved down batch of beach sand. Anyways I was offered to test this product out and give my honest/unbiased opinion based on my experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to follow the directions of placing a small amount in my hands with a tiny puddle of water and mixing before applying to face/skin - but I also decided to add a few more steps.&lt;br /&gt;I found one of my mini travel bottles that wasn&#x27;t being used, and placing some OZ Naturals Best Rice Enzyme (facial scrub) in the bottle, also adding a few drops of jojoba oil, and peppermint oil, to make my own personal refresher body scrub. I personally think that the body should have an exfoliating rendezvous at least once a week if not twice. It does also work well with the face, but be sure to use a moisturizer after drying skin after shower/bath - and remember to pat dry, not rub the skin when drying.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product and would recommend to anyone who wants to use as suggested with only water, as well as those more advanced that would use it as the exfoliating filler.&lt;br /&gt;Also, a mistake I made on my first two uses was to remove the complete lid to the bottle. ***You DO NOT need to remove the lid, just twist a click and the holes will open on top like a powder shaker bottle. Enjoy and use sparingly!</li>
            <li> This is rough on the skin - there are far better products out there including Laura Mercier&#x27;s face scrub.  Dermalogica make a one like this product - this OZ product seems like a copy of it but the Dermalogica one is far superior. Also this does not mesh well with water - it seems to stay gritty and it is hard to mix and is not a smooth paste when mixed on wet face. The container is cheap with the metal threads on cap sharp. The container opens with the powder spilling - it is messy. I could not return this as the 30 days have passed. I would not use except unless you have the skin of a rhino and want to rub it away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like no other. So simple to use. A small amount placed in the palm of your hand and add a little water. The rub felt a little rough but I have to admit my face loves this! I only use twice a week so it goes a long way.  After a good rinse my skin feels smoother than it&#x27;s ever felt! I follow up with my other Oz products and my face is simply glowing. If you don&#x27;t try this Exfoliater...your missing out! I was given this product for my HONEST review!</li>
            <li> Quality product. Left my skin smooth and supple. Wonderful natural scrub to use weekly to enhance skin. I</li>
            <li> I take my beauty routine pretty seriously, and that means I uses washes, exfoliates, oils, lotions and more to keep my skin looking as fresh and young as possible. I have used Oz Naturals products before and liked them a lot so when I heard about the Ancient Orient Rice Enzyme exfoliater, I knew I had to give it a try. You see, I have always loved dry scrubs where I could add it to water, or my face wash or whatever else I wanted to add it to to exfoliate, and this is one of those products. A tiny little bit of this goes a long way, and it really leaves my skin feeling polished and smooth. With using this and my essential oils in my moisturizer, I feel I look a lot younger than I did this time last year. If I don&#x27;t, I know my skin sure FEELS a lot younger. I just love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I received this item free of charge for an honest review</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing exfoliator. It is in powder form. It has all natural ingredients which makes it gentle and harmless for the skin. It has green tea and rice in it. It does not irritate the skin. Makes my skin so soft and smooth. It deeply cleanse the pores. I love to use it after I remover my makeup. It removes the residue of makeup from my skin. Leaves my pores clean. It also improves the texture of the skin. It reduces the lines and wrinkles on the face.&lt;br /&gt;It is not tested on the animals. Im actually a big fan of Oz naturals products.&lt;br /&gt;I feel my skin is not only clean but also smooth after use. Usually the exfoliator makes my skin so dry right after use but this exfoliator is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get this product in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of OZ Natural products now and I&#x27;m not surprised but the results this product, it is wonderful.  It has a soft scent and it gently removes old cells to leave your skin feeling soft and smooth,  I am very happy with it.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big change in my complexion since I started using OZ Natural products.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely effective exfoliator. I have never used anything like it before so I was very intrigued. The packaging is very nice and I like how easy it is to dispense the product. You need very little of the product to exfoliate your entire face. Considering how much product this comes with I think 1 bottle will last a long time which is great!  I think it is also important to note that you need to be gentle like the instructions say when you are scrubbing your face. After I used this product my skin was incredibly smooth. I really couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it made my skin. I think this makes whatever serum or moisturizer you put on afterwards soak in a lot better. Overall, I think this is a great exfoliator.  I could easily only every use this one scrub and be perfectly happy. I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions or breakouts from using this product either. Like all of the OZ naturals products this is all natural and cruelty free which is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review and to give my feedback. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is somewhat awkward to use. I feel like I can&#x27;t use it in the shower, and need to keep the powder dry when not in use, but as a straight scrub, it&#x27;s good. 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a free sample to review.</li>
            <li> Great facial scrub, I&#x27;m in love with this product. I have been using this product 3 times a week; my face is so smooth and hydrated. This is the best scrub I have ever used. Very happy leave my face glowing. I truly recommend</li>
            <li> I love the Oz Naturals Ancient Orient Rice Enzyme Dermafoliant! I started off with a clean face, I poured about the size of a nickel (per the directions) of the dermafoliant into the palm of my hand and added a little bit of water and mixed them together in the palm of my hand, to make a thin paste. Then I scrubbed my face in circular motions, you do not need to scrub hard at all, this dermafoliant scrub is very effective!  I avoided my eye area as I am really cautious about that area!! I left it on for the suggested time of 5 minutes (the 5 minutes is so that the lactic acid has time to penetrate the skin!) The Dermafoliant has Organic Rice Powder, Green Tea Powder, Lactic Acid, Provitamin B5 and even Bamboo, it is in a finely ground powder form, I know all of those things are great for my skin, and it’s even vegan and animal cruelty free which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color when you add water changes from white to a sort of green brown color (probably from the green tea in it!) Within the 5 minutes it will dry, when it dries it sort of has a grainy white appearance again, just rinse with water gently and thoroughly and that is it! The scrub left my skin feeling clean, refreshed, super soft and flake free and it make me look and feel younger :) To me the dermafoliant sort of has a lemony, green tea scent. I loved it and I highly recommend to everyone! The only downside for me was the cap was a bit tricky to operate but it will losen up over time and the sticker that covers the cap so the powder does not spill out leaves residue on the cap, but that’s not really such a big deal I took my cap off and cleaned it and when it was fully dry and put it back on the bottle! I received this as a promotional sample free of charge for my unbiased opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very professionally and securely packaged and it arrived to my home very quickly!!</li>
            <li> My wife did not like this product as much as I did, ergo the 4 stars. We&#x27;re a team--so I kind of combine our review scores. Having sensitive skin, she found it a little too much for her delicate face. I however, found it to be a super scrub. I like the fact that I can measure out exactly what I need; not too much/too little. That did take a little practice, though.  I use it once a week. Great stuff! If I remember correctly, I think I received this as a free product. That&#x27;s happened a couple of times. I&#x27;m just not sure on what items.</li>
            <li> Product does not get a &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; consistency as it says it should. Must rinse REALLY well otherwise you will have &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; remnants on face.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals Ancient Orient Rice Enzyme&lt;br /&gt; The claim is this product gently exfoliates skin and unclogs pores without irritation, drying, or stripping.&lt;br /&gt; When I first got the product I thought what a cool product packaging it comes in a powder form and the bottle has a topper like baby powder with little holes to distribute. Inside is a white powder that was odorless. The package tells you to apply a nickel size amount of powder in the palm of your hand and then add water, place on your face and let it sit. I did just that… I felt some tingling and it was drying on my face so I felt it hardening but that was no big deal..  when I removed the product from my face it was still tingly but to my surprise I wasn’t red or irritated … my skin is usually so sensitive I expected it to be red it was a little drying to my face but I think that is because I didn’t put my lady cream on right after.&lt;br /&gt; I would highly recommend it if you need an exfoliator for your face that is not irritating. I was pleasantly surprised by the product from packaging to product outcome it was everything it claimed to be</li>
            <li> Great product. It is simple to use and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. It&#x27;s a very fine ground rice powder that is very gentle on the skin. I did receive this product to review on my blog #simplysamples on blogspot.</li>
            <li> nice facial scrub, really does the job.</li>
            <li> After using this my face immediately felt so smooth, a noticeable difference. Very fine particles which were very gentle on the skin but yet a very good exfoliator. Took it to work for my friends to try and they loved it too.  I look forward to the difference this will make.</li>
            <li> My advice, read the label and leave it on for about 5 minutes. I have truly noticed a difference in my skin after using this for about a month now. I use it a few times a week and not only does it leave your face feeling clean and smooth, it has reduced my breakouts. I have used scrubs for years and really the only thing that they have done is remove some of my dry, flaky skin and left it smooth. That was good enough for me until I tried this. I never really felt that scrubs had reduced breakouts at all. I believe this one does and I attribute it to the lactic acid. I can&#x27;t say enough about OZ Naturals products. So far, I have truly loved each one that I have tried! It is hard finding products made from natural (and mostly organic) ingredients that really work.</li>
            <li> This scrub is extremely gentle and leave your akin so smooth you can&#x27;t even believe it! Just a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using three times a week! Amazing!</li>
            <li> This white powder comes in an aluminum bottle with a shaker top.  It has a neutral fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mixed with water, it turns blue-green and partially dissolves.  It is then massaged into the face with the fingers or a washcloth and left for a few minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fine powder provides mechanical exfoliation and the lactic acid provides chemical exfoliation.  It leaves the skin clean and fresh, but be very gentle with the first use and avoid exposure to the sun afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals provided exfoliator for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for!!! I was so skeptical about this product... I had read about St. Ives apricot scrub being bad and all of this mumble-jumble hype bullcrap... and long-story-short, I found this. Doesn&#x27;t sting. Doesn&#x27;t hurt. Doesn&#x27;t leave me red. Still exfoliates PERFECTLY - great texture... love love love :)</li>
            <li> I have used powder exfoliants before and I really like this one by OZ Naturals. I used this while in the shower and found that it was easy to dispense the powder into my hand and it had plenty of exfolaint so it didn&#x27;t dissolve too easily before I could rub it onto my face. I also am using this on my hands and they are smooth and soft. Others complained about the design of the top, but it does rotate to close so water doesn&#x27;t get in if you do use it in the shower. Just put a little in your hand, add some water, make into a paste, and rub on face, neck, and hands for soft smooth skin. Super easy to use with great results!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and got sucked in. Apricot scrub works just as good and it&#x27;s 3 times cheaper.</li>
            <li> Oh my... it&#x27;s like sandpaper against your face! However it does make your face smooth after, dries like sand on your face but I just can&#x27;t get myself to stay on top of it, it hurts and I make sure I run gently.... disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This scrub is very good but not get it if you have sensitive skin. I have oily skin with open pores so it works well for me. It almost feels like a dermabrasian, rougher than any other scrub I&#x27;ve tried. I use it together with my face cleaner soap, cause it will make it easier to move it around since this is just a powder.  I feel that it is more suitable for a every other day or a few times a week but not a daily scrub. Having said that I do like the way the way my face feels after I use it. It does clean very well and it feels smooth. I also think it is helping with dark spots and pores.  The negative is that the packing is faulty and hard to open and messy to use.</li>
            <li> To begin with I love that this item is cruelty free! A lot of big name companies don&#x27;t care about the ethical treatment of animals. It is also 90% organic and 100% natural. I am allergic to a lot of cosmetics so finding something that wasn&#x27;t heavy in &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is great. Easy to follow instructions this item is in powder form and you add just a dab of water to form a paste. You allow it to sit for 5 minutes and rinse and viola you have baby smooth skin! I have a lot of dry skin by my eyebrows and the skin under the eyebrows themselves this did a great job of exfoliating! Yay!! The packaging is nice with a great container. I will say however that the lid itself is difficult to deal with it is awkward to turn since the powder gets lodged. So I just remove the whole lid to pour the product. Very happy overall  &amp;#34;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> We have tried in our household to eliminate using any exfoliating products that use plastic microbeads in it.  We even threw out 2 tubes of a name brand toothpaste after discovering that particular brand used the plastic microbeads, which is known to contaminant the water supply and environment.  One of the best things about this exfoliator is the ingredient list is a simple and natural one with five ingredients.  This is a finely ground white powder that you only need a small amount with water to make into a paste that you rub into the face.  Wait about 5 minutes and then rinse off.  This is a very gentle exfoliator and does a good job at cleaning the skin of acne and blackheads without any irritation to the skin.  It makes the skin feel softer as well.  So far so good with the initial use of this exfoliate. We will update our review with any long term observations we have with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals has become my go to for skin care.  I use their face wash, toner, serum &amp; lotion, but was using a different brand for exfoliation.  They sent me a free bottle of this exfoliator to try and I LOVE it.  My skin stays glowy &amp; fresh for days after using it.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for ilovetoreview.com. I absolutely love love this product! I need to use exfoliaters for my face and I have found ones that were good but this is fantastic. Makes my face and necklace feel amazing and so clean. You can see a difference as well.</li>
            <li> I love all the products that I&#x27;ve tried in this line.  I do receive free products for an accurate review.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps me with my acne but is gentle enough it does not dry out my skin. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean that I don&#x27;t want to stop touching it. My skin also appears to be brighter and healthier looking! I actually really like that this comes in a powder form, I feel like you get more value for the money.  I LOVE the fact the Oz Naturals products are natural and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Face was baby smooth after and it was very easy to use. Not harsh. Makeup and lotions went on very smooth after. Can be used in your whole face or just in problem areas. Cute packaging. Cruelty free!</li>
            <li> My face has never been so smooth and soft until I used this product! Def a must have !</li>
            <li> OZ Natural Scrub is truly a renovation in skin care for a man or woman of any age.  The scrub comes in a powder that you add a small amount of water to to create a paste.  Given about five minutes to activate, it rinsed leaving no residue and made my skin feel fresh and smooth.  I received as a teaser from BrandBacker. When I received the package, I was unsure if I would like the method of adding water, but after several uses, my skin feels smooth and gives me confidence that I have not had in years. A definite repurchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this sadly. It&#x27;s rough on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it is as good as they say it is!  I can see why I am starting to use everything from this line.  I have used everything from high-end department stores and doctors offices wish I discovered this manufacture sooner!  I have extremely sensitive skin this does not bother me at all and I get amazing results!</li>
            <li> I love exfoliating my face because for some reason, my face is on hyper mode as far as producing black and white heads go. One concern I&#x27;ve always had with exfoliating products that I have used in the past, is the fact that they always end up drying my face! I already have perpetually problematic face - an oil slick for a T zone and constant dryness everywhere else! I have used quite a few OZ Naturals products in the past and I have never ever been disappointed with any of their products. Needless to say, I had high hopes for this Natural Scrub and as in the case of their other products that I have tried, I was not disappointed. I was in fact very pleasantly surprised, that my face didn&#x27;t dry up after using this scrub! Two thumbs up for this product! It does a great job with exfoliating my skin without leaving dry patches behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a product like this before. Normally, I&#x27;ve used typical american products and the environmentally harmful plastic beads. I&#x27;m glad to try something natural for once. The first couple of times I used it I waited a few days in between, but that wasn&#x27;t necessary. This does not irritate my sensitive skin at all! It feels like sand. You mix it with water and apply to your face and neck. I did this in the shower, and that minimized mess and annoyance. The product spreads evenly over your skin, and when you rinse it off, it feels LOVELY. I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup applies more smoothly when I use this, as I don&#x27;t have dry skin bits to contend with anymore. I&#x27;m a bit tempted to rub this on my legs before shaving to get a smooth shave ;) Anyway, I recommend this product and have thoroughly enjoyed the smoother skin it provides. I love the asian influence in this product, as I&#x27;ve been interested in asian skincare. Thanks, OZ, for providing clean ingredients in amazing products that WORK.  ***Sample Provided for Unbiased Review***</li>
            <li> This was not for my sensitive skin. It has Aloe in it and that is something I am allergic to but for others it may be okay.At the time of purchase, I did not know that it had aloe in it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Oz Naturals new product! This is a must have, especially if you are a fan of the Tachta Rice Enzyme Powder. It does just as good of a job (if not better) and is only a third of the price. If your not use to a exfoliant powder it takes a little getting use to as far as how much to use and how much water to mix with it. I have found though it takes very little to get an excellent and thorough clean. I have dry skin with some combination skin, and it does a good job at taking any dead flaky skin off without damaging my skin. As a person who is constantly trying out new beauty products, I was really impressed with the effectiveness of it. My only two complaints about the product which were more of a manufacturing issues were the fact that when I opened the box, I spilled powder everywhere that I believe was outside of the actual product. Maybe some product that didn&#x27;t get inside the bottle? Nonetheless, it wasn&#x27;t a big issue. I also think that the cap could of been made a little better as for me sometimes it was just easier to take off the whole cap then to try and turn it so I can sprinkle it into my hand. Other than those few minor issues the product itself is above and beyond my expectations! I think it will be a new staple in my skincare routine, and I plan to give them as gifts in the future as it is perfect for the skincare ethusist who has it all or those just starting out.</li>
            <li> OMG!  Ok, I am not one to write reviews about products because I believe that &amp;#34;tastes&amp;#34; are varied according to who you are. This product however is a &amp;#34;must try&amp;#34;. I was very, very surprised at how well it works and how amazing my face felt after using it. No &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; stink or heavy feeling to this product. I just think that after trying brushes and little drug store packets this is by far the absolute best for exfoliating, powder and a little water, so easy to use to get that great smooth feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> This scrub is awesome! My only problem is that it is a bit messy, its powdery and can make a mess but that was to be expected if its &amp;#34;rice&amp;#34; based. I have sensitive skin so its difficult to find something that will work for me but this definitely does. It does have a nice scrub to it which I do enjoy because I feel like there is a build up on my skin at times. Overall I would say that this product is great and Oz Naturals does it again! Great lovely natural products that do the job well! Well done! *Product was sent as a sample*</li>
            <li> I love this company! This is a newer product. It comes in a round container that the top twists open and has holes like a baby powder bottle. This is a genius way to make a exfoliant! Plus it&#x27;s very pretty. You can wash your face then put a small amount of the dry exfoliant in your hand and add a little warm water and make a thin paste and use as normal. I added it to my fav skincare face wash that is very light..not a gel..and mixed it in and used. I have T zone and very sensitive skin and this was perfect. Both woman and men or if you have acne you can use this! All their products are cruelty free and natural. That&#x27;s all I will use.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Like other Oz natural products ancient orient rice enzyme dermafoliant is made of natural ingredients and free from harsh chemicals, making it great for any type of skin. It contains lactic acid,bamboo and green tea a combinations that helps to remove dead skin, brightening the skin, reducing and prevent wrinkles. This exfoliant comes in a powder form  that you have to mix with water to create a paste and that is one of the things I don&#x27;t like about it since it makes the process a little bit messy. It is not easy to create the paste to the way it should be (after many attempts I realized that one drop of water is the best choice), not only did I feel the texture of the paste is grittier like sand and I find that a little bit uncomfortable. Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that you have to leave it on your skin for five minutes before rinsing it off making this product useless if you want something faster and easier.&lt;br /&gt;While there are a lot thing going against the product, I will admit that every time I have used it I felt my pores being unclogged and my skin feels really clean and toned. It is true that the exfoliating process feels more potent than other exfoliators  while at the same time it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin damaged and irritated.  I may keep using this product for those times when I need a deep cleansing but not during my regular exfoliating routine.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it once and let me tell you, it made my skin supple and soft.  This is a great product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best scrub in the market.</li>
            <li> Excellent Scrub. Thank you OZ Naturals. I tried not to used too much as I want to save as much as possible for a prolong period. My face is improving while adding this to my face regimen in a sense that my face feel much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the description very well when I ordered this so I was totally shocked when I opened it to see it was a powder. I immediately became skeptical because every other exfoliator I have ever used was a liquidy grain. But I gave it a try and am SUPER happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the shower. I used a little bit more than a nickel size and added the water. I worked it in my skin using circular motion and let it sit on my skin while I washed my body. As soon as I washed it off my face I could literally feel the difference in my skin. It was super soft and smooth. I was pleasantly surprised. The paste was not very grainy so it didn&#x27;t feel rough on my skin like some other exfoliators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have, which was not big enough for me to subtract a star, is the twist cap does not work very well. I found it much easier to just open the whole bottle cap. OZ Naturals really needs to redesign the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, absolutely left my skin radiant and incredibly soft.  I will keep this product in stock on my shelf!</li>
            <li> “It Works!” It was a great way to exfoliate without being a harsh and abrasive product. No smell, no grit and okay, yeah, it has a pleasant enough taste, as it is all natural.  It made my skin glow and remain oil free all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d already been using OZ Naturals products (eye gel, vitamin c, and moisturizer), and when I went to reorder those products, this scrub popped up on my screen.  I read some reviews and thought &amp;#34;I have got to try this stuff!&amp;#34;... I&#x27;m so glad that I did!  I had already been using an apricot type scrub a few times a week - and even so,  I cannot *believe* how smooth my skin is after using this OZ Naturals scrub!!  I will *definitely* be reordering it when  I run out (which probably won&#x27;t be for a while as you don&#x27;t need very much each time).  Do be warned:  this is a *powder* - it&#x27;s a very fine powder but when you use it it feels sort of like cornmeal.  You add just a TINY bit of water to it, in the palm of your hand, and then smooth it onto your face and scrub it for a few minutes - then you leave it on for 5 minutes so that the lactic acid can work it&#x27;s magic (so I do it before brushing my teeth, and leave it on while I brush my teeth and scoop the cat box ;-) ).  Update - 2 Tips:  First, I mix this in with my liquid cleanser sometimes, it feels better this way, and it works just as well (I don&#x27;t leave it on for the 5 minutes then, I just rinse it off with my cleanser).  Second, the cap is really hard to twist open and closed, so I now just leave it in the open position, with a little plastic cap over it so that no moisture gets into the powder.  It is *much* easier to use this way! (See picture.)  I really love the whole OZ Naturals line - it&#x27;s so rare to find a beauty product line that is both vegan and cruelty free, *and* so effective!</li>
            <li> wonderful product will probably use once a week as it is quite potent made my skin smooth and shiny immediately without irritating</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to exfoliating powders then initial application might seem unusual - this is basically a fine powder that is sprinkled into your hands and then mixed with a small amount of warm water and rubbed together into a paste. The paste is then massaged into your skin with gentle circular motions and then you let it set for 3-5 minutes to let the lactic acid compounds penetrate the skin.  When time is up the residue is gently rinsed off and patted dry and the end result is skin that feels supremely soft, supple and beautifully finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular exfoliation is one of the most effective ways to repair/replace damaged skin but keep in mind that this is just the first step in the process. Once the exfoliant is rinsed off, your skin is primed for the next steps of serum and moisturizer/sunscreen application so be sure to utilize the proper routine for best long term results. All in all, this is a terrific product that produces visible and tactile benefits immediately after your first try. Stick to the routine 2-3 times per week and you&#x27;ll notice vast improvements in your overall skin health and appearance (product sample provided for review).</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting item.  At first I used it by just mixing with water but I did not like the feel of it at all.  Then I decided to mix some of the scrub with my facial cleanser and WOW what a difference that made. Mixing the OZ Naturals Scrub with your OZ Naturals facial cleanser feels really good and does a great job cleaning your skin, your face feels fresh and invigorated.  This is a great facial scrub, and will last a long time because you do not need to use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free in return for an honest reveiw.  So this is it, I would buy this even if not free.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Everyone I use this I swear my face gets softer and my pores get smaller. Love this!</li>
            <li> This does the job! Leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is a  powder consistency and you just mix it with water and scrub your face with it.  I like to leave it on for a couple minutes to get the full effect. Make sure that you don&#x27;t clog the part where the powder comes out of. Such a gentle yet effective product. It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain anything that irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Although I know exfoliating is so important to skin care, I had been unable to find a product to use due to my rosacea. I tried using coconut oil with a washcloth that was recommended on one site. Great for moisturizing but didn&#x27;t do anything else. I recently started using some of the other Oz products and am very happy with the results. So I researched each of the ingredients in the Facial Scrub. And found out that they are recommended for someone with rosacea.  With most new products, I&#x27;ll only use it a few times a week at first until I see how my skin reacts. I loved how my skin felt  the first time I used it so I went ahead and applied it every day for the first week. No problems!  My skin loves this stuff. And my wallet doesn&#x27;t mind it either as it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Looks like  powder-  do not see any improvement. Do not like it !!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Every time I try something from this line I fall in love with it, I wish I found OZ Naturals sooner.</li>
            <li> not able to use this product.  I returned it to the manufacturer without any problems.  Reminded me of table salt.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is a good facial scrub that is way different from a conventional cream base exfoliants.&lt;br /&gt;First, it is packaged on a small bottle with sprinkler type cap. I personally isnt a fan of the packaging, and I wish they put a lid on top too. But anyways, it actually works in dispensing the product.&lt;br /&gt;Now it might be a little tricky on how to apply the product. I personally wet my face first with lukewarm water, then shake the powder in my hand added a little bit of water to transform it into a thick paste.&lt;br /&gt;I would then massage my face gently, I let it sit for a while as per instructions. Then rinse it off using lukewarm water.&lt;br /&gt;I would instantly feel that my skin is smoother and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a week for a period of a month and I havent finished the bottle at all, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is very fine, the abrasers are fine in size and texture.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend this product and I definitely think that it is worth every penny. It&#x27;s one of the good exfoliants that I tried. I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice now and so far have been pleased with the results.I have acne scars on both of my cheeks from long ago and hoping to give myself a at-home &amp;#34;dermabrasion&amp;#34; to even my skin texture. Other buyers/users commented on the texture and on the design-flaw (it reminds me of the good old day talcum powder dispenser head)..yes I agree that you have to be careful when pouring the powder in the palm of your hand but.... just go slow and you&#x27;ll be fine! (really nothing to get upset about)..I agree that the texture of the powder is very rough. I guess it has to be if you want to &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; your skin.. having said that, the product is not abrasive to the point that it will mar your skin.. word of caution, go slow in circular motion on your cheeks, chin and forehead. Try to avoid the delicate tissue around your eyes please. Hope this will help you and good luck!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 2 months now - Love it, easy to apply to the skin at night.. leaves your skin clean, refreshed and glowing in the morning. Using this product along with the Retinol, Vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic acid has made a difference in my acne prone skin. Highly recommended - just give these products time to show results and be consistent.</li>
