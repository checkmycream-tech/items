            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I got it 3 days ago, and I love my face is already lighter and beautiful, as of my body I guess it&#x27;ll take longer</li>
            <li>Lovely!</li>
            <li>I have to say I love it!</li>
            <li>As always, an amazing Dr. Woods product.</li>
            <li>This soap is nice at exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I like the rose scent,</li>
            <li>is going to be so nice to wake up to and come home to.</li>
            <li>But honestly one wash from this and no flames.</li>
            <li>rose as the description says.</li>
            <li>Clean your face good - however lightening was negligible.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s very strong while you&#x27;re washing, it leaves a nice, lightly rosy smell afterwards.</li>
            <li>I give this soap three stars because the shipping came quickly and the soap smelled good.</li>
            <li>the smell is really strong, I liked it</li>
            <li>so be sure you ALSO treat your acne with something else while using this soap).</li>
            <li>It lightens the skin , I love love this product.</li>
            <li>love this soap.</li>
            <li>I have placed 2 more orders.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to help with the stretch marks I received during pregnancy (one of the many joys) after I gained around 35 pounds.</li>
            <li>I liked the light scent it has.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and is gently exfoliating.</li>
            <li>i love this soap.</li>
            <li>It smells just lovely.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>love the smell hasn&#x27;t lighting my skin</li>
            <li>Smells good but did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>love the product delivery was fast!!!</li>
            <li>Soap feels good, lasts a long time and is nicely scented.</li>
            <li>well worth the double-washing if lightened skin is your goal!</li>
            <li>and it still sent my cheeks to a bright red.</li>
            <li>I love my lighter skin, really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also exfoliating, with plenty of tiny granules throughout to give your skin a good cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is a good soap overall, that I do know.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it made my skin feel, but I didn&#x27;t realize how well it was working until a friend asked what I was doing to my skin to make it look so even toned and clear.</li>
            <li>Luv this soap, it made my face and body feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth and it&#x27;s safe for the skin</li>
            <li>quick and as described</li>
            <li>If you like a true rose scent and a better than average soap ingredient list, you may want to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>It had a nice lather and texture and left my skin feeling clean with out feeling stripped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is strong will give an update on if soap really lighting face.</li>
            <li>And you feel fresh all day long which is a good feeling when weather is hot, and humid.  </li>
            <li>I love the soap because it make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>First, demographics:</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>thanks GOD!  </li>
            <li>I feel comfortable with the natural ingredients it has.</li>
            <li>maybe I should possible order more???</li>
            <li>But nothing as of the first bar</li>
            <li>but it does lather well and is filled with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not silky soft but more of a baby skin soft.</li>
            <li>I want to get lighter and this is working FAST.......</li>
            <li>Thanks god , I always keep my place...</li>
            <li>But i don&#x27;t really see a difference at all .</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait until I used the whole bar.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much Lightning.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>It really gets your skin extra clean.  </li>
            <li>Not only have the one age spot I have lightened up, this soap smells nice and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My skin is in better condition and it does lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li>actually prefer Dr. Woods unscented organic soap bar but gave this kind a try, to see if it would lighten dark spots as described.</li>
            <li>I am a 38 year old white female with naturally light skin, mild freckles, and very obvious large age spots that started at about 34 years old.</li>
            <li>For some reason though, it&#x27;s not lightening the skin evenly - the stretch marks on my left are lightening a bit faster than the right, might be the difference in my application.</li>
            <li>found thus soap by accident, I can not believe that my new routine and  my new found bleaching cream has made be look gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use the Dr woods black soap to clear up my skin and love the results and needed to clear up some discolorations on my skin and decided to purchase this soap.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also it made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth, I just wanted to lighten it up a little..</li>
            <li>My face looks less red after washing with this product, it also make my skin feel very clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t vouch for that so far</li>
            <li>But I as far as skin lightening</li>
            <li>Thus far no results.  </li>
            <li>and I have been using an Aveeno cleansing product for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>What I like about Dr Woods, is that it&#x27;s all natural &amp; nothing harmful to your body.</li>
            <li>far as the delivery, it was before on time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(if you use it everyday), so expect to buy more quicker than regular soap..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really really pleased with the results of this soap, and I am convinced it will lighten any skin you use it on (at least for white skin, your results may vary if you&#x27;re naturally darker)!</li>
            <li>I am a light skin black female.</li>
            <li>Goes on feeling fatty and gross (and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s only getting 4 stars), but rinses off easily.</li>

            <li> I live that my dark&lt;br /&gt;Markets on my stubborn dark marks are almost gone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, although it is a bit harsh and extra moisturizer will be needed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product if you are trying to clear up dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried brightening soaps &amp; it felt like they stripped my skin &amp; left my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Much &amp;#34;pinker&amp;#34; and less brown, and I&#x27;d also heartily recommend it for BODY use in addition for face (just be careful not to scrub the exfoliating beads into sensitive parts - I have to put this on my hands then spread it, as the bar itself is too sharp to slide over skin due to the exfoliating beads)!</li>
            <li> I been using this soap for a long while already</li>
            <li> I used it in less than a month of daily use, and evened out my skin imperfections (age spots) immensely!</li>
            <li> The soap does leave your skin dry after your shower, but some lotion will fix that.</li>
            <li> and if it helped my acne, but alas, it is still excellent soap that rivals the expensive face washes I&#x27;d used before for everything except acne breakouts (it wont help those at all, in fact, I think it makes them worse -</li>
            <li> After trying this soap for a few days, I can now vouch for its lightening powers, it definitely does!</li>
            <li> The other soaps helped but it was not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and they were</li>
            <li> yet it was why I bought it might work for other people it doesn&#x27;t on me</li>
            <li> My age-spots are about HALF the darkness they were, and they were severe, so dark I could no longer hide them under eye shadow on my eye lids!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t feel so fatty going on</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> Any uneven skin tones are slowly vanishing!</li>
            <li> The only bad side is this soap took forever to come.</li>
            <li> Not good for ance breakouts, additional antibacterial soap and/or a acne treatment will be needed in addition to this soap if you&#x27;re breaking out, but</li>
            <li> I know it sounds silly</li>
            <li> the burning did not stop even after I washed it off with cold water..</li>
            <li> Had some bad bruses on my chest from a heart monitor.  </li>
            <li> Terrible soap.</li>
            <li> Broke me out in a horrible rash on my leg!</li>
            <li> i noticed it helps when i am itching real bad.</li>
            <li> And my face reacted terribly to it after using it about 3 times</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got it 3 days ago, and I love my face is already lighter and beautiful, as of my body I guess it&#x27;ll take longer but I can&#x27;t wait to see the results. Love it!! Don&#x27;t fogey to wear sunscreen after use!</li>
            <li> First, demographics: I am a 38 year old white female with naturally light skin, mild freckles, and very obvious large age spots that started at about 34 years old. Now, the review: This soap actually lightens skin! Really works! Lightened my skin everywhere I used it in less than a month of daily use, and evened out my skin imperfections (age spots) immensely! Highly recommend, although it is a bit harsh and extra moisturizer will be needed! Goes on feeling fatty and gross (and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s only getting 4 stars), but rinses off easily. Not good for ance breakouts, additional antibacterial soap and/or a acne treatment will be needed in addition to this soap if you&#x27;re breaking out, but well worth the double-washing if lightened skin is your goal! My age-spots are about HALF the darkness they were, and they were severe, so dark I could no longer hide them under eye shadow on my eye lids! Additionally, it also lightened my skin &amp;#34;down below&amp;#34; (I used it there just to see if it would help since I was already in the shower and my hands were soapy). Much &amp;#34;pinker&amp;#34; and less brown, and I&#x27;d also heartily recommend it for BODY use in addition for face (just be careful not to scrub the exfoliating beads into sensitive parts - I have to put this on my hands then spread it, as the bar itself is too sharp to slide over skin due to the exfoliating beads)! I&#x27;m really really pleased with the results of this soap, and I am convinced it will lighten any skin you use it on (at least for white skin, your results may vary if you&#x27;re naturally darker)! I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t feel so fatty going on and if it helped my acne, but alas, it is still excellent soap that rivals the expensive face washes I&#x27;d used before for everything except acne breakouts (it wont help those at all, in fact, I think it makes them worse - so be sure you ALSO treat your acne with something else while using this soap).</li>
            <li> It lightens the skin , I love love this product. I am a light skin black female. I tried the marie france and sans kogic soap. The soaps work slowly.&lt;br /&gt;I use them on and off. but. I  came across this soap by accident. I have been using for a week, I swear I am 2 shades. Lighter. I live that my dark&lt;br /&gt;Markets on my stubborn dark marks are almost gone. I have tried every thing. The other soaps helped but it was not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I found thus soap by accident, I can not believe that my new routine and  my new found bleaching cream has made be look gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;I love this soap. I have placed 2 more orders. I love my lighter skin, really. I want to get lighter and this is working FAST.......</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on my face, it burned my skin... the burning did not stop even after I washed it off with cold water..I was terrified. Thanks god , I always keep my place... Benadryl.. as soon as I put Benadryl on my face, the burning on my face stopped... thanks GOD!  I am trying to get rid of freckles, this soap not working at all burned my face!</li>
            <li> Great soap.  It really gets your skin extra clean.  And you feel fresh all day long which is a good feeling when weather is hot, and humid.  I feel comfortable with the natural ingredients it has.</li>
            <li> Any uneven skin tones are slowly vanishing! Soap feels good, lasts a long time and is nicely scented.</li>
            <li> This soap is nice at exfoliation. I let it sit on my body for 3 to 5 mins.</li>
            <li> Terrible soap. All it does is exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like using this soap a lot! It makes my skin soft and smooth and it&#x27;s safe for the skin coz it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients. And its gradually whitening my skin. It also has a scrub like effect when you lather it on your skin. Will continue using this soap! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> If you like a true rose scent and a better than average soap ingredient list, you may want to give this one a try. It&#x27;s also exfoliating, with plenty of tiny granules throughout to give your skin a good cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer Dr. Woods unscented organic soap bar but gave this kind a try, to see if it would lighten dark spots as described. I just started using it so can&#x27;t vouch for that so far but it is a good soap overall, that I do know. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: After trying this soap for a few days, I can now vouch for its lightening powers, it definitely does! I wash my hands a lot throughout the day and after a couple of days, I could actually note a difference between my arms (tanned) and my hands looking lighter!</li>
            <li> I been using this soap for a long while already and it smells good ! But i don&#x27;t really see a difference at all .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles but it does the job of lightening the skin. I purchased this product to help with the stretch marks I received during pregnancy (one of the many joys) after I gained around 35 pounds. The stretch marks were around my hips and tummy, of course. I think that within a couple of uses - like maybe the 3rd use, you can actually see the difference. For some reason though, it&#x27;s not lightening the skin evenly - the stretch marks on my left are lightening a bit faster than the right, might be the difference in my application. I like the rose scent, even though it&#x27;s very strong while you&#x27;re washing, it leaves a nice, lightly rosy smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> Broke me out in a horrible rash on my leg! Had to go to the doctors and get a prescription. Will NEVER buy again.</li>
            <li> Clean your face good - however lightening was negligible.</li>
            <li> My face looks less red after washing with this product, it also make my skin feel very clean. I liked the light scent it has.</li>
            <li> Not only have the one age spot I have lightened up, this soap smells nice and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great and is gently exfoliating. I recommend 100!</li>
            <li> i love this soap. i noticed it helps when i am itching real bad. love the product delivery was fast!!!</li>
            <li> I give this soap three stars because the shipping came quickly and the soap smelled good. But I as far as skin lightening I did not see a difference at all maybe I should possible order more??? But nothing as of the first bar</li>
            <li> I love the soap because it make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I see a difference and I just started using it Tuesday!....</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I used the whole bar.  Thus far no results.  Had some bad bruses on my chest from a heart monitor.  This had no effect.  Also the bar leaves a soap film on your skin and the tub.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product if you are trying to clear up dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 2 weeks, almost gone, and I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin. It smells great and leaves my skin smelling/feeling great but it didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job. I will not buy this soap again. I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li> quick and as described</li>
            <li> Lovely! It smells just lovely. I opened it, sniffed and immediately had to try it out. It had a nice lather and texture and left my skin feeling clean with out feeling stripped.&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be so nice to wake up to and come home to.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over a month. I liked the way it made my skin feel, but I didn&#x27;t realize how well it was working until a friend asked what I was doing to my skin to make it look so even toned and clear. The effects were gradual so I hadn&#x27;t noticed myself, but someone who sees me about once a week could see a difference.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well and smells of roses which im not to fond of. Im not sure if it lightened my skin but it does lather well and is filled with natural ingredients. I would buy this again because of the ingredients and i do have a feeling this will take a few weeks to see real results.</li>
            <li> I use the Dr woods black soap to clear up my skin and love the results and needed to clear up some discolorations on my skin and decided to purchase this soap. Love, love, love. I do not use the soap everyday because it will lightening your face up really fast, but I use it gradually because I do not want to lightening my entire face just the acne marks.</li>
            <li> As always, an amazing Dr. Woods product.</li>
            <li> I must say that this soap did wonders for me. I have very sensitive skin and I have been using an Aveeno cleansing product for sensitive skin and it still sent my cheeks to a bright red. But honestly one wash from this and no flames. I know it sounds silly but I couldn&#x27;t contain my excitement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the smell is really strong, I liked it but some obviously won&#x27;t. Also it made my skin very soft. Not silky soft but more of a baby skin soft.</li>
            <li> Luv this soap, it made my face and body feel clean and fresh. The smell is strong will give an update on if soap really lighting face. The only bad side is this soap took forever to come.</li>
            <li> What I like about Dr Woods, is that it&#x27;s all natural &amp; nothing harmful to your body. I&#x27;ve tried brightening soaps &amp; it felt like they stripped my skin &amp; left my skin feeling dry. This soap is exfoliating &amp; smells like rose as the description says. I would give 5 stars, but unfortunately the soap doesn&#x27;t last more than a month (if you use it everyday), so expect to buy more quicker than regular soap.. The soap does leave your skin dry after your shower, but some lotion will fix that. I&#x27;ve noticed some fading of my scars on my face.. I haven&#x27;t seen much Lightning.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the delivery, it was before on time.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this soap &amp; I will continue to purchase. Maybe it take different people to notice the time of results!  Try it out!</li>
            <li> Smells good but did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Just started using this soap. I have to say I love it! My skin is in better condition and it does lighten dark spots. I&#x27;m 54 &amp; have some age spots. I&#x27;ve tried other products and they were so so but this soap does work well. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month. Great product &amp; will buy again!</li>
            <li> love the smell hasn&#x27;t lighting my skin yet it was why I bought it might work for other people it doesn&#x27;t on me</li>
            <li> It burns my face... My skin was smooth, I just wanted to lighten it up a little.. And my face reacted terribly to it after using it about 3 times</li>
