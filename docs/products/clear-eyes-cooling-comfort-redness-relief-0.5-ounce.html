            <li>Refreshing!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>But this is nice relief when sitting in front of a computer screen for hours.</li>
            <li>Feels really nice and cooling.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, recommended thanks!</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing on the eyes.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation, I personally love - my boyfriend hates it.</li>
            <li>whatever you do I use it now more then</li>
            <li>Love the cooling effect this has on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have both prescription &amp; OTC products but these provide the most relief.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse practitioner &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use a product unless it was safe</li>
            <li>i know many people enjoy the cooling effect and</li>
            <li>These are the only eye drops I have found that make my eyes feel this great.  </li>
            <li>but they burn the most the first time.  </li>
            <li>These really do actually cool your eyes as they say.  </li>
            <li>These eye drops work amazingly well for my husband who constantly has</li>
            <li>Clear eyes is always my favorite.</li>
            <li>They are awesome and cool my eyeballs better than other eye drops I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I use eye drops when I first wake up.</li>
            <li>Much different than most eye drops.  </li>
            <li>First of all Don&#x27;t freak out when you try it the first</li>
            <li>Works but really intense cooling effect!</li>
            <li>Got this for my mom on subscribe and save because I keep catching her in my bathroom using my extra strength redness relief also by clear eyes.</li>
            <li>That being said prepare for intense stinging for the first fifteen seconds after the drops are applied, and then soothing relief.</li>
            <li>The extra tears are great, but i don&#x27;t recommend putting the drops in well doing something, because I couldn&#x27;t use my eyes for like half a minute.</li>
            <li>I bought these Clear Eyes eye drops with &amp;#34;cooling comfort,&amp;#34; and let me tell you, the first time I pulled them out of my bag and applied them out on the sidewalk, I thought I poured whiskey in my eyes!</li>
            <li>these eyes drops are very cooling</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Better than a few others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sort of like putting normal eye drops in the refrigerator before putting them in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She says this burns a little at first, but says she likes it because it makes her sinuses feel clean</li>
            <li>Found out from my eye doctor that these drops should only be used when you have red eyes from a hangover and have a job interview or some important appointment.  </li>
            <li>but i guess my eyes are too sensitive to handle it.  </li>
            <li>so I would not say I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>She also guesstimates that the comfort lasts nearly 8 hours as claimed.</li>
            <li>This really cleared up my red eyes and gave a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>but this really goes a long way to soothing in ways others don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation is great, particularly when your eyes feel tired &amp;/or raw!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak of a cooling eye drop.</li>
            <li>The first use is a bit odd because it tingles but give it a second</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely not a long lasting cooling feeling nor is it moisturizing in any way-</li>
            <li>Our favorite eye drops are these &amp;#34;cooling comfort&amp;#34; type for dry and tired and red eyes.</li>

            <li> Our favorite eye drops are these &amp;#34;cooling comfort&amp;#34; type for dry and tired and red eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest anyone interested to just find a favorite moisturizing eye drop and stick them in the fridge before using if you want a cold rush of relief to your eyeballs... because this stuff is cold for a very short amount of time (10 seconds tops) and really has zero moisturizing properties so it is not long term comfort by any means.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is now my go to when my eyes are itchy, dry, red...</li>
            <li> I thought it would help with my dry irritated eyes but this doesn&#x27;t get the red out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just enough to provide a little extra relief for red eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel itchy and dry in the mornings when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> I am always using eye drops for irritated, dry, allergy-prone eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes get very dry, sore, and burn after hours staring at the computer (I&#x27;m a software developer).</li>
            <li> blood shot eyes due to no sleep and long work hours.</li>
            <li> Computer eyes is not really a thing.</li>
            <li> Not really a moisturizer</li>
            <li> One eye drop per eye usually does the trick as opposed to other eye drops where you need multiple drops.  </li>
            <li> It works well just like any other cleareyes product</li>
            <li> the other 2 kinda</li>
            <li> It does feel like your eyeball is cold at first</li>
            <li> girlfriend and a friend both tried it and said the same thing that the initial feeling shocking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to see for a few seconds after putting In just one drop!  </li>
            <li> It burns like crazy, then when it goes away in a few seconds, you feel like you can inhale spearmint-cold air through your eyeballs.</li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that same horrible sensation you get when they put the drops in your eyes to dilate it.&lt;br /&gt;:o</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> My eyes get very dry, sore, and burn after hours staring at the computer (I&#x27;m a software developer). These are the best eyedrops I&#x27;ve used, combining redness relief and soothing comfort.</li>
            <li> That cooling effect almost like the tea tree effect on your hair- definitely perk your eyes up!</li>
            <li> i know many people enjoy the cooling effect and all but i guess my eyes are too sensitive to handle it.  I must keep my eyes shut for about a minute before i can open them without stinging.</li>
            <li> I use eye drops when I first wake up. These burn my eyes and I won&#x27;t be purchasing them again. I have purchased eye drops that do not burn my eyes so I would not say I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought these Clear Eyes eye drops with &amp;#34;cooling comfort,&amp;#34; and let me tell you, the first time I pulled them out of my bag and applied them out on the sidewalk, I thought I poured whiskey in my eyes!

            <li> Computer eyes is not really a thing. But this is nice relief when sitting in front of a computer screen for hours. Better than a few others I&#x27;ve tried. I actually like the initial &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> These are really good eye drops for allergies.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Bought as a stocking stuffer for my wife. She says they are quite cooling.</li>
            <li> The first use is a bit odd because it tingles but give it a second and then it cools amazingly!</li>
            <li> This burns your eyes, it&#x27;s torture! Nothing cooling about this.  We both screamed when we used it.  My partner is a doctor and he couldn&#x27;t believe they were selling this product. Horrible. Should be pulled from the market. Avoid!!!</li>
            <li> My eyes feel itchy and dry in the mornings when I wake up.  These are the only eye drops I have found that make my eyes feel this great.  Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, recommended thanks!</li>

            <li> Great eye drops! They are awesome and cool my eyeballs better than other eye drops I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> All the cooling of Rohtos with none of the burn</li>
            <li> Great, but they burn the most the first time.  I&#x27;m getting use to it. The extra tears are great, but i don&#x27;t recommend putting the drops in well doing something, because I couldn&#x27;t use my eyes for like half a minute.</li>
            <li> Our favorite eye drops are these &amp;#34;cooling comfort&amp;#34; type for dry and tired and red eyes.</li>
            <li> Great cooling comfort and no stinging.</li>
            <li> these eyes drops are very cooling there&#x27;s nothing else that works this well!!! love it</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom on subscribe and save because I keep catching her in my bathroom using my extra strength redness relief also by clear eyes. She says this burns a little at first, but says she likes it because it makes her sinuses feel clean lol She also guesstimates that the comfort lasts nearly 8 hours as claimed.</li>

            <li> Found out from my eye doctor that these drops should only be used when you have red eyes from a hangover and have a job interview or some important appointment.  He told me to toss it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Clear eyes is always my favorite. The cooling sensation, I personally love - my boyfriend hates it. It works well just like any other cleareyes product except it has that wake me up whoosh effect! Recommended for people who stare at computers all day!</li>
            <li> This really cleared up my red eyes and gave a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> Not really a moisturizer but it is cooling... for all of ten seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not a long lasting cooling feeling nor is it moisturizing in any way- it&#x27;s sort of like putting normal eye drops in the refrigerator before putting them in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest anyone interested to just find a favorite moisturizing eye drop and stick them in the fridge before using if you want a cold rush of relief to your eyeballs... because this stuff is cold for a very short amount of time (10 seconds tops) and really has zero moisturizing properties so it is not long term comfort by any means.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen this product in stores so I thought I&#x27;d try it. Works great! It isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak of a cooling eye drop. It&#x27;s just enough to provide a little extra relief for red eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to see for a few seconds after putting In just one drop!  it feels like it&#x27;s freezing my eye rather than cooling!  It&#x27;s that same horrible sensation you get when they put the drops in your eyes to dilate it.&lt;br /&gt;:o(</li>
            <li> First of all Don&#x27;t freak out when you try it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;It does say COOLING.  It does feel like your eyeball is cold at first but this really goes a long way to soothing in ways others don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend and a friend both tried it and said the same thing that the initial feeling shocking.  And for some might be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my go to when my eyes are itchy, dry, red...whatever you do I use it now more then the other 2 kinda I bought to try.</li>
            <li> Love the cooling effect this has on my eyes. I bought this on accident and have not regretted it, now it&#x27;s the only eye drops I like. Feels really nice and cooling. Refreshing!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I am always using eye drops for irritated, dry, allergy-prone eyes. I have both prescription &amp; OTC products but these provide the most relief. The cooling sensation is great, particularly when your eyes feel tired &amp;/or raw! I am a nurse practitioner &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use a product unless it was safe but these are fab &amp; feel as great as the drops I paid $50 for (!!) that are prescription.</li>
            <li> Works but really intense cooling effect!</li>
            <li> I thought it would help with my dry irritated eyes but this doesn&#x27;t get the red out AND it burns when I put drops in. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
