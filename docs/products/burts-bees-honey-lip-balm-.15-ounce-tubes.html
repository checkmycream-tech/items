            <li>I loved this balm during my years dealing with Chicago winters</li>
            <li>You feel good using it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>If you are not into mint flavor, this would be a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Good quality and good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>GOOD STUFF, HELPFUL</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT IS GOOD</li>
            <li>Would be good if there&#x27;s SPF.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Lip Balm!</li>
            <li>So, that bit aside, these were exactly what I wanted, and they moisturize wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Love this chap-stick!  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found a better chap-stick on the market!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can get this in a 4-pack!</li>
            <li>My lips love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite type of chapstick!</li>
            <li>The mint one is much more pleasant to smell than the honey.</li>
            <li>It really does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li>These did not, however, I&#x27;ve gotten tubes of this kind from the store that didn&#x27;t indicate they had it, and they did.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product since I liked Nivea&#x27;s Milk and Honey lip balm.  </li>
            <li>The beeswax kind doesn&#x27;t smell like that at all.  </li>
            <li>I can very seldom find the Honey Balm and was thrilled to find it at a great price!  </li>
            <li>Kinda makes me wonder what kind of opium/meth/coke concoction is in this chap stick.</li>
            <li>The size of the container is handy -- I put it in my shirt pocket as I work at home.</li>
            <li>I try to keep it handy in case I need it.</li>
            <li>Effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Gives em a nice shine too, without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Also it has a very strong honey smell and taste.</li>
            <li>It even works better than Labello, which was always my favorite, and that&#x27;s saying a lot!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use and very cheap.</li>
            <li>This version does moisturize and is nice, but I prefer the peppermint version because it&#x27;s so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I think Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are the best natural lip balms out there.  </li>
            <li>just beware &amp; think twice before you get this controversial scent.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li>if you dislike sweet lip balms, this might be a good one for you.</li>
            <li>Love these lip butters, they go on very smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Not waxy like cheap products made with paraffin!  </li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do and is better than most lip balms.</li>
            <li>I know that honey is a great healing agent, but I didn&#x27;t really fully comprehend what that meant.  </li>
            <li>And, since I love lip color, but ANY lipstick makes my lips peel, I&#x27;m trying the tinted balm.  </li>
            <li>My favorite from all the brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>On a humorous aside, I was sitting in my apartment eating breakfast and wondered what seemed to smell of lilies or something.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, be sure to smell it if you can before you buy it.  </li>
            <li>the Honey lip balm is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips.</li>
            <li>For me, that addition makes it more chapping, and not all tubes indicate that they have mint oil in them.</li>
            <li>There may be better products out there for healing damaged skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t permeate my senses like some others (Apple, or the more medicinal) ones.</li>
            <li>I suspect this is because the Nivea is more buttery, so</li>
            <li>the coverage is more uniform.  </li>
            <li>Daughters favorite Chapstick.</li>
            <li>of course, that doesn&#x27;t change the contents of the lip balm. :)</li>
            <li>I thought it would be safe to try them, but did not end well..  </li>
            <li>I just love burt&#x27;s bees chapstick</li>
            <li>Still have all of them :)</li>
            <li>So for the most part, she just buys the petroleum based products (whether Chapstick, Blistex, or the generics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has more of a shea butter smell and taste than honey.</li>
            <li>like most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I like honey.  </li>
            <li>Unless of course you love the smell and taste of baby powder....</li>
            <li>, this is your lip balm!  :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>and I have more tubes than I can count now just because I need one on me at all time.    </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say it will be the best formula for someone ELSE&#x27;S lips, but I will never go back to anything else.    </li>
            <li>I use this every day and my lips absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>it is okay tho..still using it</li>
            <li>We were introduced to Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm by a surfer on vacation many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I love the taste of honey</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Do you know how many i bought?</li>
            <li>I enjoyed many products from Burt&#x27;s Bees, but their lip balm are just not that</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why so many people like it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it, unless you love those scents.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This had been my favorite lip balm for years, until now.</li>
            <li>more like 4 tubes wrapped in one plastic pouch.</li>
            <li>I used it got many years.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The person I gave the gift too enjoyed it</li>
            <li>The honey variety is my favorite.</li>
            <li>flavor much more than this one.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I do love this chap stick.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>If you love honey you will love this stuff.</li>
            <li>They are all better.</li>
            <li>It is OK</li>
            <li>fell in love with this ever since I received it years ago.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a sweet scent and taste on your lips, you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the original mint kind for a while before deciding to try the honey.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The obnoxiously strong smell reminds me more of almost a sickly sweet rose scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend sticking to the original!</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t seem to feel so strongly about it.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lips smell wonderful and leaves them super soft especially as much as I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be fine if you think you would like the honey flavor.  </li>
            <li>Recommended for a more conditioning, more soothing alternative to the original Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>This burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s lip balm works great to keep my lips soft and never irritates them.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product, keeps lips moist and healthy.</li>
            <li>If you have an issue with baby powder stay clear away from this, but if you don&#x27;t then its a great soothing lip balm.</li>
            <li>lip balm smells good, feels good with a thick sweet formulation, and is a great addition to the Burt&#x27;s line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought some Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for the first time a while ago and loved it because it was smooth and tasted just like honey.</li>
            <li>Not really the best lip balm, and</li>
            <li>This has a distinct rose aroma and taste.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just a unique reaction.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I love the original Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, and thought I might like the honey.</li>
            <li>The honey one is not too strong on smell which I love, and not minty like the original one is.</li>
            <li>It smells almost like baby powder to me, and it glides on so easy.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, is soft and gentle even on chapped lips, and works to protect, soothe, and heal.  </li>
            <li>It feels good and keeps my lips in great shape, firm and protected.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>Does not have a strong odor..</li>
            <li>only reason I give it a good review is because it is nice chap stick that works well.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong, but I promise you&#x27;ll get used to it.  </li>
            <li>However, it is SO strongly scented (like baby powder and honey) that I can&#x27;t wear it at all.</li>
            <li>I originally liked this scent very much, however, with continued use it became somewhat overbearing</li>
            <li>These work fine...</li>
            <li>Fine service from seller.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees; no other lip balm can compare with how good the ORIGINAL is.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth more than any cheap cheeseburger.</li>
            <li>My lips have become smooth and moist with no roughness from peeling.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not oily.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t prefer chapsticks that are really light and slippery.</li>
            <li>Goes on creamy and not greasy, velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to keep several in the house and pocket book at all times, in case you misplace one.</li>
            <li>This Honey lip balm is so moisturizing and smooth</li>
            <li>Great basic lip balm.</li>
            <li>I finally threw it out after leaving the house with it on more than one occasion, mistaking it for the good stuff.</li>
            <li>It protects well and has a good ingredient list (natural, lip-friendly ingredients).  </li>
            <li>I am and have been a HUGE fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees original chapstick for years, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it</li>
            <li>therapeutic\\&quot; lotion which contains significant honey decided to try the honey lip</li>
            <li>I originally had the peppermint formula, which was not as conditioning as I had hoped, and sometimes burns my chapped lips.</li>
            <li>But being aware of the quality of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and knowing the healing attributes of honey, we gave this lip balm a test many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the original flavor.  </li>
            <li>It works as well the original, but I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m sticking to the original.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, lasts long, tastes great.  </li>
            <li>advantage to this is that in the winter/wind the lip balm doesn&#x27;t become unbearable to wear, like it does with the original mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm as it is very nourishing and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite chapstick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad lip balm, but there&#x27;s nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>Some people may love the smell of flowers, but floral fragrances really bother me.  </li>
            <li>lip balm is like sweet angels drenching your lips in honey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too sweet.</li>
            <li>They smell good and last quite awhile after application.</li>
            <li>She love it so much.</li>
            <li>For me, the smell is not bad</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm and how it glides on easily on the lips and how soft it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li>Also this stuff blends in great with other lip products.</li>
            <li>Knowing that I&#x27;m using something totally natural is much more important to me.</li>
            <li>However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for around $10.14.</li>
            <li>However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for around $10.14.</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses it, great in the summer and winter as we spend a lot of time outside in the winter snow skiing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get this particular balm in my town and really love it.</li>
            <li>Mild honey scent and taste.</li>
            <li>This formula is far more moisturizing to my lips than the original formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years, this has a thick consistency lovely feel and nice honey scent.</li>
            <li>Each tube has been exactly what I expected and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>This was a good deal, cheaper than single purchase.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the overly sweet and crumbly limp balms I have used over the years, I like the ingredients, taste and smell of this honest one much more.</li>
            <li>Also, it was not long before I found it to be far more effective than the peppermint.  </li>
            <li>Good price for a pack of lip balm(s), the honey &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; takes some getting used to if you&#x27;re accustomed to the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s soothing for very cracked lips, lasts a long time, and comforting to know</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m calm.</li>
            <li>but i love how soft it leaves my lips.</li>
            <li>Worth the try, but I would not order the honey one again.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products because they have all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I rarely need it, but it works when I do.</li>
            <li>and I love  that its all natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right and always smooth and gentle on your lips.</li>
            <li>I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items.</li>
            <li>Surely enough, this lip balm is the original, delightful-smelling lip balm I had so many problems finding at the store.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The flaking went away almost right away.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand to have the smell literally right under my nose.  </li>
            <li>I even asked my girlfriend if she was wearing a new perfume (yes, it is that strong).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not subtle either is very strong and prevalent and odd considering how I think honey has a very strong sent too.</li>
            <li>Unlike most chap stick available, it does not contain camphor, phenol, or menthol, ingredients known to dry out lips.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products in general.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to see a 4 pack for a decent price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping that it would be a mild, gentle, moisturizing lip balm.  </li>
            <li>It does what it promises and keeps my lips nice and dry.</li>
            <li>All I want is something natural and smooth to cover lips that take a beating the sun while cycling for hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, no go whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Better off sticking to the regular Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The regular Burt&#x27;s Bees tastes better in my opinion (not that I eat the stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to call off my crusade against it.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li>Because it eliminates one reason - out of countless, surely - for</li>
            <li>Glad I saved the metal box as second order did not have the metal box.</li>
            <li>I must first say that I have not yet bought this product from Amazon, so I can&#x27;t comment on shipping transactions, etc.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Expiration: My primary concern about buying this product (since Burt&#x27;s Bees is natural) is the expiration date.</li>
            <li>all due respect to other flavors by Burt&#x27;s Bees, this one seems to hydrate the best.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth, rarely has to be reapplied, and is worth the extra dollar or so.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Balm keeps my lips soft and smooth - never dries them out.</li>
            <li>and I still love it dealing with the heat of southern California summers.</li>
            <li>Evidently, it is popular in my area too because bins for the honey are often empty during the Winter months.</li>
            <li>First, let me say I like honey.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I thought when I got them was &amp;#34;aren&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The honey balm has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>smells exactly like pure honey and the scent lingers for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>, mind you, the winter has pretty much faded away</li>
            <li>First, they don&#x27;t really seem to moisturize well at all.  </li>
            <li>Still, not bad for all natural (which the Nivea is not).</li>
            <li>However, the product should be in good quality condition for 3 years past their date.</li>
            <li>We use a wood burning stove from about October through May, and it causes your skin to be more dry.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Strong scents just about do me in, but once it was on, eh, it dissapated enough that I didn&#x27;t wipe it off</li>
            <li>To be honest, at first the smell was a little much for me.</li>
            <li>It is not over powering, but certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li>The original kind of tingles when applied and gives a weird sensation on the lips (because of the mint), but this stuff just soothes has a sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time ordered it came in a neat metal box, very retro, with the classic Burt&#x27;s bees logo on it.  </li>
            <li>It could be a great lip balm except for the overwhelming, bad scent.  </li>
            <li>Clear and calm one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or anything like that, and it makes my lips look very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>haha-</li>
            <li>and I was ready for a switch.  </li>
            <li>So there&#x27;s some anecdotal evidence for you, which is really what Amazon reviews are all about.    </li>
            <li>An environmentally responsible company with reasonable prices.[[ASIN:B002DPUXZM Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube,</li>
            <li>The scent subsides within 15 minutes, and you are left with smooth feeling lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the scent really lasts.  </li>
            <li>Straight to the garbage</li>
            <li>It became very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>But I now really appreciate the smell.</li>
            <li>To sum it all up, I highly recommend this lip product!</li>
            <li>All 4 tubes went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>Carry a very convenient.</li>
            <li>But, I feel like I have to use way too much of it for my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>This lip balm works really well.  </li>
            <li>very luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, does not come off too much at a go, and really helps prevent chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Remember-There will be lots of kisses in the upcoming Holiday Season and no one wants to kiss a pair of chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Much longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those chilly winters when your lips chap.</li>
            <li>I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees mint-flavored lip balm for years, and bought this one by accident, as the color of the tube is very close.</li>
            <li>Scent preferences are very subjective so you may disagree but</li>
            <li>It has a very peculiar and bathroomy smell to it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a grate product.</li>
            <li>Or get the Whole Foods branded ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really smell like honey, and doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; feeling the pomegranate has.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is very moist and the taste is not like, and so this time runs out, buy a tasty point.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>The taste/smell of the honey based balm is much nicer.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be somewhat mild and slightly sweet, oh, I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>Although there are other options for more buying choices, I&#x27;m still hesitant if Amazon is not the seller/shipper.</li>
            <li>The only one that kinda works is the original chap stick.</li>
            <li>Last year I accidentally purchased the honey balm when I thought I was getting another tube of the original formula.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey is a bit different than the original Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>However, from a personal preference perspective, I like the original Burt&#x27;s Bee (peppermint)</li>
            <li>and so it&#x27;ll probably take the full brunt of next winter&#x27;s scourge to give it a real testing.  </li>
            <li>The Honey version has a very similar feel as the original, the obvious difference is instead of a tingly mint sensation there is a sweet, aromatic scent and taste.  </li>
            <li>It gets old very fast.</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm, and highly recommend other products in their line</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have dry lips that crack easily like mine.</li>
            <li>had I applied it first, but, despite frequent reapplications, it did not relieve the dryness nor the chapped feeling after the fact.  </li>
            <li>I find that with Burt&#x27;s Bees, the opposite is true.</li>
            <li>this is true for most tube of lip balm out there, is that if you don&#x27;t pay attention sometimes it will fall out when its near the end, leaving you high and dry unless you brought an extra tube.</li>
            <li>I love Burt Bee&#x27;s and typically buy the mango or pomegranate flavors, but decided to buy this one since it was on sale.</li>
            <li>Only in the most severe winters do even try to use it and usually only end up buying 1 stick per year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to go through this pack as quickly as I can, and go back to buying the mango and pomegranate ones.</li>
            <li>The taste is somewhat similar, but protection wise it does not last as long.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>My kids both have sensitive reactions to so many other lip balms out there, swelling, cracked lips, that we don&#x27;t try any others.  </li>
            <li>Not the same healing honey content, but worth a try.</li>
            <li>The smell is over powering, and the heavy feeling it creates on my lips is more like an application of astringent rather than of moisturizing lip balm.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin that is prone to drying out, and I live in a cold, windy mountain town.     </li>
            <li>As a man, I don&#x27;t use lip balm much because I rarely get dry lips.</li>
            <li>As I was traveling in Europe, Burt&#x27;s bees are more expensive and hard to find, but this pack of 4 was great value, so much that I bought two.</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch to a new lip balm that did not contain petroleum, so I chose to use Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>I live in CO</li>
            <li>My husband bought this not realizing it was different from Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax lip balm, which we very much prefer.</li>
            <li>Such is the climate of New York, regardless of your exact location.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I had to wipe it off five times with a tissue paper after only the first application.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make McGil wow!</li>
            <li>I was purchasing Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm at the drugstore, when I could find it (which wasn&#x27;t nearly as often as I needed to replace a tube!)  </li>
            <li>The original in my opinion is the best because you can continuously use it without it becoming irritating or annoying.  </li>
            <li>Cold winters, warm springs, and cool falls.</li>
            <li>Second, the odor from them is positively unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>I end up tasting this honey stuff, and I like the regular, less flavorful burts bees much better.  </li>
            <li>While my skin and lips develop different levels of dryness depending on the season, one thing is for certain:</li>
            <li>I am 99.% sure that Amazon has strict standards and have yet to have a \\&quot;bad product\\&quot; from them, so when I made my purchase, I made sure Amazon.com was the company</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive lips that are very finicky about the weather and different types of chapsticks/lip balms.</li>
            <li>Clearly the formula has changed and why does it smell like baby&#x27;s powder.</li>
            <li>It also makes them so soft.  </li>
            <li>(actually it&#x27;s a natural smell) and goes away soon.</li>
            <li>And really my old lip balm smelled like bandaids.  </li>
            <li>On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects.</li>
            <li>On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>ad says it&#x27;s 99.82 natural.</li>
            <li>This one is smoother, natural, and soothing.  </li>
            <li>If only this wasn&#x27;t so much of a girlie scent, I could pawn it off on him...</li>
            <li>But in reality, it was simply a wax coating, and it really didn&#x27;t do anything in the way of moisturizing my lips.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;d kind of grown tired of the peppermint version and,</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tried many other lip balms, including other Burt&#x27;s Bees products; however the &amp;#34;Honey&amp;#34; lip balm is the one she swears by.</li>
            <li>they supposed to come in a box?&amp;#34; Apparently they are just thrown into a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t like that, I&#x27;ll just go back to the normal.  </li>
            <li>Makes me crave honey so bad! :D</li>
            <li>Only good thing, is it does moisturize your lips, but you&#x27;ll have to be willing to smell that bad smell all day.</li>
            <li>My lips sting and hurt all the time whenever there is an extreme change in temperature and burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s has never failed me before.</li>
            <li>Like, if I leave it at home by accident my lips will start to crack and hurt &amp; no other chap stick works.</li>
            <li>While the other lip balms just come right off and one has to reapply constantly, the honey in this lip balm gives it staying power.</li>
            <li>Here in the \\&quot;heartland\\&quot; you&#x27;d better not be caught without something for lips and skin in general because it&#x27;s pretty windy here and the cold is beyond description.  </li>
            <li>It smells like baby powder mixed with an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>Apparently the formulation has changed and it includes benzyl benzoate now, which I didn&#x27;t know until I received the product.</li>
            <li>The honey scent is there but is extremely subtle compared to the strong baby powder scent.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and use lots of chapstick.</li>
            <li>prefers Burt&#x27;s Bees over traditional lip balms, but as most of us that have purchased lip balms in the past know that Burt&#x27;s Bees carries a premium price vs other brands.</li>
            <li>I feel I may have been a little too bitter originally.  </li>
            <li>I expected a very subtle honey scent or no scent at all, but this one has a very strong baby powder and plastic scent.</li>
            <li>i have very dry and sensitive lips.</li>
            <li>Some of the former Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms had peppermint oil, which pained my little kid&#x27;s lips, but this product is gentle and soothing.</li>

            <li> I loved this balm during my years dealing with Chicago winters</li>
            <li> You feel good using it.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> If you are not into mint flavor, this would be a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Good quality and good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF, HELPFUL</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT IS GOOD</li>
            <li> Would be good if there&#x27;s SPF.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Lip Balm!</li>
            <li> So, that bit aside, these were exactly what I wanted, and they moisturize wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Love this chap-stick!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found a better chap-stick on the market!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can get this in a 4-pack!</li>
            <li> My lips love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite type of chapstick!</li>
            <li> The mint one is much more pleasant to smell than the honey.</li>
            <li> It really does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li> These did not, however, I&#x27;ve gotten tubes of this kind from the store that didn&#x27;t indicate they had it, and they did.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product since I liked Nivea&#x27;s Milk and Honey lip balm.  </li>
            <li> The beeswax kind doesn&#x27;t smell like that at all.  </li>
            <li> I can very seldom find the Honey Balm and was thrilled to find it at a great price!  </li>
            <li> Kinda makes me wonder what kind of opium/meth/coke concoction is in this chap stick.</li>
            <li> The size of the container is handy -- I put it in my shirt pocket as I work at home.</li>
            <li> I try to keep it handy in case I need it.</li>
            <li> Effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Gives em a nice shine too, without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Also it has a very strong honey smell and taste.</li>
            <li> It even works better than Labello, which was always my favorite, and that&#x27;s saying a lot!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to use and very cheap.</li>
            <li> This version does moisturize and is nice, but I prefer the peppermint version because it&#x27;s so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I think Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are the best natural lip balms out there.  </li>
            <li> just beware &amp; think twice before you get this controversial scent.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> if you dislike sweet lip balms, this might be a good one for you.</li>
            <li> Love these lip butters, they go on very smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Not waxy like cheap products made with paraffin!  </li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and is better than most lip balms.</li>
            <li> I know that honey is a great healing agent, but I didn&#x27;t really fully comprehend what that meant.  </li>
            <li> And, since I love lip color, but ANY lipstick makes my lips peel, I&#x27;m trying the tinted balm.  </li>
            <li> My favorite from all the brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> On a humorous aside, I was sitting in my apartment eating breakfast and wondered what seemed to smell of lilies or something.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, be sure to smell it if you can before you buy it.  </li>
            <li> the Honey lip balm is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips.</li>
            <li> For me, that addition makes it more chapping, and not all tubes indicate that they have mint oil in them.</li>
            <li> There may be better products out there for healing damaged skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t permeate my senses like some others (Apple, or the more medicinal) ones.</li>
            <li> I suspect this is because the Nivea is more buttery, so</li>
            <li> the coverage is more uniform.  </li>
            <li> Daughters favorite Chapstick.</li>
            <li> of course, that doesn&#x27;t change the contents of the lip balm. :)</li>
            <li> I thought it would be safe to try them, but did not end well..  </li>
            <li> I just love burt&#x27;s bees chapstick</li>
            <li> Still have all of them :)</li>
            <li> So for the most part, she just buys the petroleum based products (whether Chapstick, Blistex, or the generics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has more of a shea butter smell and taste than honey.</li>
            <li> like most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I like honey.  </li>
            <li> Unless of course you love the smell and taste of baby powder....</li>
            <li> , this is your lip balm!  :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> and I have more tubes than I can count now just because I need one on me at all time.    </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say it will be the best formula for someone ELSE&#x27;S lips, but I will never go back to anything else.    </li>
            <li> I use this every day and my lips absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> it is okay tho..still using it</li>
            <li> We were introduced to Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm by a surfer on vacation many years ago.  </li>
            <li> I love the taste of honey</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Do you know how many i bought?</li>
            <li> I enjoyed many products from Burt&#x27;s Bees, but their lip balm are just not that</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why so many people like it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it, unless you love those scents.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This had been my favorite lip balm for years, until now.</li>
            <li> more like 4 tubes wrapped in one plastic pouch.</li>
            <li> I used it got many years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The person I gave the gift too enjoyed it</li>
            <li> The honey variety is my favorite.</li>
            <li> flavor much more than this one.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I do love this chap stick.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> If you love honey you will love this stuff.</li>
            <li> They are all better.</li>
            <li> It is OK</li>
            <li> fell in love with this ever since I received it years ago.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a sweet scent and taste on your lips, you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the original mint kind for a while before deciding to try the honey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The obnoxiously strong smell reminds me more of almost a sickly sweet rose scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend sticking to the original!</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t seem to feel so strongly about it.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lips smell wonderful and leaves them super soft especially as much as I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be fine if you think you would like the honey flavor.  </li>
            <li> Recommended for a more conditioning, more soothing alternative to the original Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> This burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s lip balm works great to keep my lips soft and never irritates them.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product, keeps lips moist and healthy.</li>
            <li> If you have an issue with baby powder stay clear away from this, but if you don&#x27;t then its a great soothing lip balm.</li>
            <li> lip balm smells good, feels good with a thick sweet formulation, and is a great addition to the Burt&#x27;s line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought some Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for the first time a while ago and loved it because it was smooth and tasted just like honey.</li>
            <li> Not really the best lip balm, and</li>
            <li> This has a distinct rose aroma and taste.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just a unique reaction.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I love the original Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, and thought I might like the honey.</li>
            <li> The honey one is not too strong on smell which I love, and not minty like the original one is.</li>
            <li> It smells almost like baby powder to me, and it glides on so easy.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, is soft and gentle even on chapped lips, and works to protect, soothe, and heal.  </li>
            <li> It feels good and keeps my lips in great shape, firm and protected.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really strong.  </li>
            <li> The scent is way too strong.  </li>
            <li> Does not have a strong odor..</li>
            <li> only reason I give it a good review is because it is nice chap stick that works well.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong, but I promise you&#x27;ll get used to it.  </li>
            <li> However, it is SO strongly scented (like baby powder and honey) that I can&#x27;t wear it at all.</li>
            <li> I originally liked this scent very much, however, with continued use it became somewhat overbearing</li>
            <li> These work fine...</li>
            <li> Fine service from seller.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees; no other lip balm can compare with how good the ORIGINAL is.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth more than any cheap cheeseburger.</li>
            <li> My lips have become smooth and moist with no roughness from peeling.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is not oily.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t prefer chapsticks that are really light and slippery.</li>
            <li> Goes on creamy and not greasy, velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to keep several in the house and pocket book at all times, in case you misplace one.</li>
            <li> This Honey lip balm is so moisturizing and smooth</li>
            <li> Great basic lip balm.</li>
            <li> I finally threw it out after leaving the house with it on more than one occasion, mistaking it for the good stuff.</li>
            <li> It protects well and has a good ingredient list (natural, lip-friendly ingredients).  </li>
            <li> I am and have been a HUGE fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees original chapstick for years, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it</li>
            <li> therapeutic\\&quot; lotion which contains significant honey decided to try the honey lip</li>
            <li> I originally had the peppermint formula, which was not as conditioning as I had hoped, and sometimes burns my chapped lips.</li>
            <li> But being aware of the quality of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and knowing the healing attributes of honey, we gave this lip balm a test many years ago.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the original flavor.  </li>
            <li> It works as well the original, but I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m sticking to the original.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, lasts long, tastes great.  </li>
            <li> advantage to this is that in the winter/wind the lip balm doesn&#x27;t become unbearable to wear, like it does with the original mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm as it is very nourishing and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite chapstick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad lip balm, but there&#x27;s nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> Some people may love the smell of flowers, but floral fragrances really bother me.  </li>
            <li> lip balm is like sweet angels drenching your lips in honey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too sweet.</li>
            <li> They smell good and last quite awhile after application.</li>
            <li> She love it so much.</li>
            <li> For me, the smell is not bad</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm and how it glides on easily on the lips and how soft it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li> Also this stuff blends in great with other lip products.</li>
            <li> Knowing that I&#x27;m using something totally natural is much more important to me.</li>
            <li> However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for around $10.14.</li>
            <li> However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for around $10.14.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses it, great in the summer and winter as we spend a lot of time outside in the winter snow skiing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this particular balm in my town and really love it.</li>
            <li> Mild honey scent and taste.</li>
            <li> This formula is far more moisturizing to my lips than the original formula.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years, this has a thick consistency lovely feel and nice honey scent.</li>
            <li> Each tube has been exactly what I expected and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> This was a good deal, cheaper than single purchase.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the overly sweet and crumbly limp balms I have used over the years, I like the ingredients, taste and smell of this honest one much more.</li>
            <li> Also, it was not long before I found it to be far more effective than the peppermint.  </li>
            <li> Good price for a pack of lip balm(s), the honey &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; takes some getting used to if you&#x27;re accustomed to the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s soothing for very cracked lips, lasts a long time, and comforting to know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m calm.</li>
            <li> but i love how soft it leaves my lips.</li>
            <li> Worth the try, but I would not order the honey one again.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products because they have all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I rarely need it, but it works when I do.</li>
            <li> and I love  that its all natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right and always smooth and gentle on your lips.</li>
            <li> I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items.</li>
            <li> Surely enough, this lip balm is the original, delightful-smelling lip balm I had so many problems finding at the store.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The flaking went away almost right away.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand to have the smell literally right under my nose.  </li>
            <li> I even asked my girlfriend if she was wearing a new perfume (yes, it is that strong).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not subtle either is very strong and prevalent and odd considering how I think honey has a very strong sent too.</li>
            <li> Unlike most chap stick available, it does not contain camphor, phenol, or menthol, ingredients known to dry out lips.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products in general.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to see a 4 pack for a decent price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would be a mild, gentle, moisturizing lip balm.  </li>
            <li> It does what it promises and keeps my lips nice and dry.</li>
            <li> All I want is something natural and smooth to cover lips that take a beating the sun while cycling for hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, no go whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Better off sticking to the regular Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The regular Burt&#x27;s Bees tastes better in my opinion (not that I eat the stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to call off my crusade against it.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li> Because it eliminates one reason - out of countless, surely - for</li>
            <li> Glad I saved the metal box as second order did not have the metal box.</li>
            <li> I must first say that I have not yet bought this product from Amazon, so I can&#x27;t comment on shipping transactions, etc.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Expiration: My primary concern about buying this product (since Burt&#x27;s Bees is natural) is the expiration date.</li>
            <li> all due respect to other flavors by Burt&#x27;s Bees, this one seems to hydrate the best.</li>
            <li> It glides on smooth, rarely has to be reapplied, and is worth the extra dollar or so.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Balm keeps my lips soft and smooth - never dries them out.</li>
            <li> and I still love it dealing with the heat of southern California summers.</li>
            <li> Evidently, it is popular in my area too because bins for the honey are often empty during the Winter months.</li>
            <li> First, let me say I like honey.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I thought when I got them was &amp;#34;aren&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The honey balm has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> smells exactly like pure honey and the scent lingers for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> , mind you, the winter has pretty much faded away</li>
            <li> First, they don&#x27;t really seem to moisturize well at all.  </li>
            <li> Still, not bad for all natural (which the Nivea is not).</li>
            <li> However, the product should be in good quality condition for 3 years past their date.</li>
            <li> We use a wood burning stove from about October through May, and it causes your skin to be more dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Strong scents just about do me in, but once it was on, eh, it dissapated enough that I didn&#x27;t wipe it off</li>
            <li> To be honest, at first the smell was a little much for me.</li>
            <li> It is not over powering, but certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li> The original kind of tingles when applied and gives a weird sensation on the lips (because of the mint), but this stuff just soothes has a sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time ordered it came in a neat metal box, very retro, with the classic Burt&#x27;s bees logo on it.  </li>
            <li> It could be a great lip balm except for the overwhelming, bad scent.  </li>
            <li> Clear and calm one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or anything like that, and it makes my lips look very moisturized.  </li>
            <li> haha-</li>
            <li> and I was ready for a switch.  </li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s some anecdotal evidence for you, which is really what Amazon reviews are all about.    </li>
            <li> An environmentally responsible company with reasonable prices.[[ASIN:B002DPUXZM Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube,</li>
            <li> The scent subsides within 15 minutes, and you are left with smooth feeling lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the scent really lasts.  </li>
            <li> Straight to the garbage</li>
            <li> It became very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> But I now really appreciate the smell.</li>
            <li> To sum it all up, I highly recommend this lip product!</li>
            <li> All 4 tubes went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> Carry a very convenient.</li>
            <li> But, I feel like I have to use way too much of it for my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This lip balm works really well.  </li>
            <li> very luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, does not come off too much at a go, and really helps prevent chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Remember-There will be lots of kisses in the upcoming Holiday Season and no one wants to kiss a pair of chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Much longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those chilly winters when your lips chap.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees mint-flavored lip balm for years, and bought this one by accident, as the color of the tube is very close.</li>
            <li> Scent preferences are very subjective so you may disagree but</li>
            <li> It has a very peculiar and bathroomy smell to it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a grate product.</li>
            <li> Or get the Whole Foods branded ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really smell like honey, and doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; feeling the pomegranate has.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is very moist and the taste is not like, and so this time runs out, buy a tasty point.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> The taste/smell of the honey based balm is much nicer.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be somewhat mild and slightly sweet, oh, I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> Although there are other options for more buying choices, I&#x27;m still hesitant if Amazon is not the seller/shipper.</li>
            <li> The only one that kinda works is the original chap stick.</li>
            <li> Last year I accidentally purchased the honey balm when I thought I was getting another tube of the original formula.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey is a bit different than the original Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> However, from a personal preference perspective, I like the original Burt&#x27;s Bee (peppermint)</li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;ll probably take the full brunt of next winter&#x27;s scourge to give it a real testing.  </li>
            <li> The Honey version has a very similar feel as the original, the obvious difference is instead of a tingly mint sensation there is a sweet, aromatic scent and taste.  </li>
            <li> It gets old very fast.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm, and highly recommend other products in their line</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have dry lips that crack easily like mine.</li>
            <li> had I applied it first, but, despite frequent reapplications, it did not relieve the dryness nor the chapped feeling after the fact.  </li>
            <li> I find that with Burt&#x27;s Bees, the opposite is true.</li>
            <li> this is true for most tube of lip balm out there, is that if you don&#x27;t pay attention sometimes it will fall out when its near the end, leaving you high and dry unless you brought an extra tube.</li>
            <li> I love Burt Bee&#x27;s and typically buy the mango or pomegranate flavors, but decided to buy this one since it was on sale.</li>
            <li> Only in the most severe winters do even try to use it and usually only end up buying 1 stick per year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to go through this pack as quickly as I can, and go back to buying the mango and pomegranate ones.</li>
            <li> The taste is somewhat similar, but protection wise it does not last as long.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> My kids both have sensitive reactions to so many other lip balms out there, swelling, cracked lips, that we don&#x27;t try any others.  </li>
            <li> Not the same healing honey content, but worth a try.</li>
            <li> The smell is over powering, and the heavy feeling it creates on my lips is more like an application of astringent rather than of moisturizing lip balm.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin that is prone to drying out, and I live in a cold, windy mountain town.     </li>
            <li> As a man, I don&#x27;t use lip balm much because I rarely get dry lips.</li>
            <li> As I was traveling in Europe, Burt&#x27;s bees are more expensive and hard to find, but this pack of 4 was great value, so much that I bought two.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to a new lip balm that did not contain petroleum, so I chose to use Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I live in CO</li>
            <li> My husband bought this not realizing it was different from Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax lip balm, which we very much prefer.</li>
            <li> Such is the climate of New York, regardless of your exact location.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I had to wipe it off five times with a tissue paper after only the first application.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make McGil wow!</li>
            <li> I was purchasing Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm at the drugstore, when I could find it (which wasn&#x27;t nearly as often as I needed to replace a tube!)  </li>
            <li> The original in my opinion is the best because you can continuously use it without it becoming irritating or annoying.  </li>
            <li> Cold winters, warm springs, and cool falls.</li>
            <li> Second, the odor from them is positively unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> I end up tasting this honey stuff, and I like the regular, less flavorful burts bees much better.  </li>
            <li> While my skin and lips develop different levels of dryness depending on the season, one thing is for certain:</li>
            <li> I am 99.% sure that Amazon has strict standards and have yet to have a \\&quot;bad product\\&quot; from them, so when I made my purchase, I made sure Amazon.com was the company</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive lips that are very finicky about the weather and different types of chapsticks/lip balms.</li>
            <li> Clearly the formula has changed and why does it smell like baby&#x27;s powder.</li>
            <li> It also makes them so soft.  </li>
            <li> (actually it&#x27;s a natural smell) and goes away soon.</li>
            <li> And really my old lip balm smelled like bandaids.  </li>
            <li> On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects.</li>
            <li> On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> ad says it&#x27;s 99.82 natural.</li>
            <li> This one is smoother, natural, and soothing.  </li>
            <li> If only this wasn&#x27;t so much of a girlie scent, I could pawn it off on him...</li>
            <li> But in reality, it was simply a wax coating, and it really didn&#x27;t do anything in the way of moisturizing my lips.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;d kind of grown tired of the peppermint version and,</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried many other lip balms, including other Burt&#x27;s Bees products; however the &amp;#34;Honey&amp;#34; lip balm is the one she swears by.</li>
            <li> they supposed to come in a box?&amp;#34; Apparently they are just thrown into a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t like that, I&#x27;ll just go back to the normal.  </li>
            <li> Makes me crave honey so bad! :D</li>
            <li> Only good thing, is it does moisturize your lips, but you&#x27;ll have to be willing to smell that bad smell all day.</li>
            <li> My lips sting and hurt all the time whenever there is an extreme change in temperature and burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s has never failed me before.</li>
            <li> Like, if I leave it at home by accident my lips will start to crack and hurt &amp; no other chap stick works.</li>
            <li> While the other lip balms just come right off and one has to reapply constantly, the honey in this lip balm gives it staying power.</li>
            <li> Here in the \\&quot;heartland\\&quot; you&#x27;d better not be caught without something for lips and skin in general because it&#x27;s pretty windy here and the cold is beyond description.  </li>
            <li> It smells like baby powder mixed with an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> Apparently the formulation has changed and it includes benzyl benzoate now, which I didn&#x27;t know until I received the product.</li>
            <li> The honey scent is there but is extremely subtle compared to the strong baby powder scent.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and use lots of chapstick.</li>
            <li> prefers Burt&#x27;s Bees over traditional lip balms, but as most of us that have purchased lip balms in the past know that Burt&#x27;s Bees carries a premium price vs other brands.</li>
            <li> I feel I may have been a little too bitter originally.  </li>
            <li> I expected a very subtle honey scent or no scent at all, but this one has a very strong baby powder and plastic scent.</li>
            <li> i have very dry and sensitive lips.</li>
            <li> Some of the former Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms had peppermint oil, which pained my little kid&#x27;s lips, but this product is gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time i use this kind of lip balm tube.its hard to smear when i try to use it  in the mouth.can it be freezing by the cold weather?</li>
            <li> I had been using petroleum based &#x27;Chapstick&#x27; and other brands until i heard about this all natural honey lip-balm.</li>
            <li> BUT this honey lip balm really does have a very strong &amp; very unpleasant smell, you can smell it as soon as you uncap it, can&#x27;t describe the smell</li>
            <li> , it does last a very long time....</li>
            <li> cannot attest to one particular seller or another, as I usually buy it at a retail store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Buts&#x27; Bees lip balm for a long time.</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil is too strong and actually burned my daughters lips to the point of stabbing pver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for your lips, but I was not particularly fond of the scent or the flavor, and my husband HATED it.</li>
            <li> But my conclusion is the smell is pretty bad (like an old couch or old shoe).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re opposed to the peppermint in the other balm, you should definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> I only buy Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm as I do not like the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products.  </li>
            <li> But there are some people who refuse to use Petroleum-based lip balms (Chapstick/Blistex) on their lips due to the fact that it&#x27;s made from petroleum (same stuff as gasoline comes from) and some say that can cause cancer.</li>

            <li> Then I went to Las Vegas with their dry, dry heat and melting sun.  </li>
            <li> No allergic reactions, no sensitivity, and it helped heal the kids&#x27; chapped or dry lips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Michigan where we have the weather from all four seasons, so I have to use protection from heat, sun, cold,and some really dry air (winter -_-).  </li>
            <li> so I need something that is going to moisturize in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Then perhaps my body became immune to it because my lips started to peel and become horribly dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I use to have dry lips</li>
            <li> If you apply it morning, noon and night, it should keep your lips from drying out and cracking if you&#x27;re in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All of my friends use this when their lips are dry.</li>
            <li> While it was on, it felt like my lips weren&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> As soon as it wore off, my lips were just as dry and chapped as ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, so you know it&#x27;ll at least be decent.</li>
            <li> This 4 pack is very economical; it&#x27;s less expensive than buying them individually.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Honey Lip Balm keeps my lips smooth and moist all day, even after exposure to sun, wind, bitter cold and long airplane flights.  </li>
            <li> I usually get them from extreme weather like direct sun and wind.</li>
            <li> My lips actually felt a little &#x27;tighter&#x27; while wearing this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and noticed that it was drying my lips out and making them hard and rough; the very problems lip balm is supposed to ameliorate Burt&#x27;s Bees exacerbated.  </li>
            <li> I love the peppermint version, but this one has a bad odor to me.</li>
            <li> I smelled the empty flower vase.  </li>
            <li> However, I have to be careful not to get the variety that contains mint oil.</li>
            <li> I never would have expected this to smell like that.  </li>
            <li> The end price per stick is roughly $2.54, so you save over 50 cents per stick.</li>
            <li> The end price per stick is roughly $2.54, so you save over 50 cents per stick.</li>
            <li> I had seen Burt&#x27;s Bees nearby and was tempted on several occasions, but it wasn&#x27;t until I decided to &#x27;splurge&#x27; that I discovered what I had been missing:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just, plain and simple, a balm for one&#x27;s lips.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees, on the other hand, is a harder wax that tends to chip off from time to time as you apply it.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that this smells of baby powder and petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> While some people complain about the smell, I prefer to see I&#x27;m using a product without the chemicals we found in other products.  </li>
            <li> I can also get them due to stress and hormones.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned before in my past reviews, buying anything with an expiration date online sometimes becomes a concern for me simply because you don&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re buying is something that&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for months (or years) after the expiration date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or drying, it goes on with a satin feel, and keeps my lips moisturized longer than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> s***ty.&lt;br /&gt;i like burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Had to switch from the vaseline and petroleum based lip balms due to allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, this one doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as my other BB chapsticks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to Burt&#x27;s Bees corporate page, it is stated that there is a shelf life (due to natural ingredients) but they are unable to provide an expiration date.</li>
            <li> Obviously, being a guy, he still had a few left by this time, so I took back a random one.  </li>
            <li> Say goodbye to weird tasting cherry &#x27;balm&#x27; and pick up a tube of this real stuff.</li>
            <li> As I said previously, my fiance loves Burt&#x27;s Bees but it can be quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I said previously, my fiance loves Burt&#x27;s Bees but it can be quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is it one less dollar you could be spending at some dollar menu?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I, like several others, did not notice that this was not the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> This makes sense to me since I know a little bit about the healing power&#x27;s of honey.</li>
            <li> It was usually a little over $1 and had been a long-trusted brand.</li>
            <li> The honey smell is subtle and the balm lasts quite long.</li>
            <li> The sent was bad, but worth it if it meant I wouldn&#x27;t be peeling all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used Burt&#x27;s Bees peppermint lip balm for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I use their products year round and</li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago, and I&#x27;ll probably be through this in no time.  </li>
            <li> Still, once every few months i&#x27;ll come across this product and buy it for a change.  </li>
            <li> After years of using ChapStik it started to irritate my mouth but within a few days of using Burt&#x27;s Bees the rash cleared up and the rest is history.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on the stiff side</li>
            <li> I usually give these out to friends as little gifts.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for anyone who lives in cold climates.</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe, but it is a sour, musky smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really overpowering and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> next day, I noticed that my lips were actually a bit softer and the cracks didn&#x27;t hurt quite as bad.  </li>
            <li> My fiance on the other hand, suffers from severe dry/chapped lips and usually goes through several sticks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Offered my stick to my wife and she couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to put it on her lips.</li>
            <li> This is indeed unfortunate, but I really only wear it outdoors.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> and I would purchase it again as I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I tried their other lip balms without honey, but still the same.&lt;br /&gt;I paid premium price for this product and it performs worse than ChapStick in protecting my lips.  </li>
            <li> I still hate the smell at first, but I use the balm almost every day now.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on it was a little shocking to have SWEET on me lips as opposed to the peppermint tingle.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> But lately, we are finding it not carried in stores anymore</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the height of a cold, I have used this lip balm on my red, irritated nose to help sooth it.</li>
            <li> one complaint, and</li>
            <li> it leaves a thick layer on my lips</li>
            <li> It has a really thick texture and smells a lot like baby powder.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty bad for selling at three times the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a honey-esque taste, though subtle.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle taste of honey.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Stock up before winter&#x27;s cold weather begins to dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> By the third day, the scent didn&#x27;t seem so bad and my lips were almost healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is too dry with an unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I must say other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products did give me cold sores..</li>
            <li> The Honey variety tastes and smells like baby powder and vaseline, which is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> but not great.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that I have 3 unused tubes of this stuff.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m literally addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the smell  and feeling...</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> As of now, I wasted 3 bucks (expensive for lip balm!)</li>
            <li> It smells horrible to me, and I&#x27;ve used the normal burt&#x27;s bees lip balm for 15 years.  </li>
            <li> The fruity varieties are persistently fragrant and become annoying to me, but I don&#x27;t notice the honey while it is on other than its soothing effect.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of baby powder...which isn&#x27;t a bad smell in the least, but not a scent I want on my lips.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my lips needed some tlc when I returned home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its just a weird smell that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I used a similar Burt&#x27;s bee lip balm before and it was good,but this \\&quot;honey\\&quot; scent smells absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> So, that&#x27;s disturbing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if they changed their product or if I ordered the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make a different version of this without the terrible perfume (and also without peppermint like the beeswax version).</li>
            <li> I think peppermint stinks and burns.</li>
            <li> stood out in the wind and cold for an afternoon, and my lips had become chapped.  </li>
            <li> I must also say that I am a sufferer of cold sores.</li>
            <li> The story is that I used to use a lip balm that then I swore by for protecting me from cold sores, and it did work for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> I kept thinking I couldn&#x27;t change lip balms because I thought everything else would give me a cold sore.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just misunderstood what I was getting, but it tastes bad, doesn&#x27;t heal chapped lips, and has no SPF.  </li>
            <li> This stuff, however, stinks horribly and smells nothing like honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead it tastes like baby powder...which I hate.</li>
            <li> I found it awful.</li>
            <li> - but, this honey stuff it terrible!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Just... Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Moisturizes my lips well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used.  Not waxy like cheap products made with paraffin!  Burt&#x27;s Honey Lip Balm keeps my lips smooth and moist all day, even after exposure to sun, wind, bitter cold and long airplane flights.  It even works better than Labello, which was always my favorite, and that&#x27;s saying a lot!  Has a delightful honey scent.</li>
            <li> i have very dry and sensitive lips. This burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s lip balm works great to keep my lips soft and never irritates them.  It really does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for men and women. Smoothes on and isn&#x27;t waxy. Some of the former Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms had peppermint oil, which pained my little kid&#x27;s lips, but this product is gentle and soothing. Does what it is supposed to do and is better than most lip balms.</li>
            <li> I like it because it has beeswax in it but does NOT have peppermint oil in it. I think peppermint stinks and burns.</li>
            <li> I know that honey is a great healing agent, but I didn&#x27;t really fully comprehend what that meant.  Then I went to Las Vegas with their dry, dry heat and melting sun.  Needless to say, my lips needed some tlc when I returned home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased a pack of lip balms for my husband at christmas time.  Obviously, being a guy, he still had a few left by this time, so I took back a random one.  It happened to be this one with the honey in it.  I noticed this after I put it on.  I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of it.  Strong scents just about do me in, but once it was on, eh, it dissapated enough that I didn&#x27;t wipe it off right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I noticed that my lips were actually a bit softer and the cracks didn&#x27;t hurt quite as bad.  I figured since it was actually doing something, I&#x27;d put it back on again.  Ugh!  The sent was bad, but worth it if it meant I wouldn&#x27;t be peeling all day.  By the third day, the scent didn&#x27;t seem so bad and my lips were almost healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold!  I still hate the smell at first, but I use the balm almost every day now.  And, since I love lip color, but ANY lipstick makes my lips peel, I&#x27;m trying the tinted balm.  Not the same healing honey content, but worth a try.</li>
            <li> lasts a while and smells great the taste isn&#x27;t all that pleasant but i love how soft it leaves my lips.</li>
            <li> Great lip moisturizer. My favorite from all the brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These work fine...but, I&#x27;m not tickled with the flavour...maybe it&#x27;ll just take me some time to get used to it. Best price I&#x27;ve found, tho, for this brand, was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used Burt&#x27;s Bees peppermint lip balm for a few years.  Here in the \\&quot;heartland\\&quot; you&#x27;d better not be caught without something for lips and skin in general because it&#x27;s pretty windy here and the cold is beyond description.  Anyway, I&#x27;d kind of grown tired of the peppermint version and, so, having recently bought the \\&quot;thoroughly therapeutic\\&quot; lotion which contains significant honey decided to try the honey lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having consumed my fair share of honey, I was quite taken by the wonderful whiff of honey I detected as I uncapped the balm. I do not, ergo, agree with the preceding reviewer&#x27;s description of the item&#x27;s smell as one of baby powder and vaseline(?).  Also, it was not long before I found it to be far more effective than the peppermint.  My lips have become smooth and moist with no roughness from peeling. This makes sense to me since I know a little bit about the healing power&#x27;s of honey. And, I&#x27;ve only used it for about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, mind you, the winter has pretty much faded away and so it&#x27;ll probably take the full brunt of next winter&#x27;s scourge to give it a real testing.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ll continue to use it through the warm weather for therapeutic value and the great smell. Sniff-- aaaahhhhhh.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Lip Balm! It has a great soothing Honey smell that I get compliments on every time I apply it. Does a great job keeping my lips conditioned! Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products in general.  I purchased the 4-pack thinking that I would share them with my three teenage kids.  I couldn&#x27;t give them away.  The kids don&#x27;t like the smell.  I think it&#x27;s okay but not great.  I will be using the four pack for years.  Hmmm.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to a new lip balm that did not contain petroleum, so I chose to use Burt&#x27;s Bees. I originally had the peppermint formula, which was not as conditioning as I had hoped, and sometimes burns my chapped lips. By accident, I purchased the Honey version and must say, it was just what I was looking for! The honey balm provides you lips with moisture and protection.     Since I was acclimated to the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees, the smell of the honey balm took some getting used to, but it is in no way an offensive odor. After years of using this formula, I don&#x27;t smell it or taste it at all.     Recommended for a more conditioning, more soothing alternative to the original Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> This does not smell like honey. It smells like baby powder mixed with an old lady&#x27;s perfume. It gets old very fast. I only have it 1 star because it does work as a Chapstick. The smell though… the smell gets 0/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offered my stick to my wife and she couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to put it on her lips.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would be a mild, gentle, moisturizing lip balm.  All I want is something natural and smooth to cover lips that take a beating the sun while cycling for hours at a time.  Sadly, no go whatsoever.  First, they don&#x27;t really seem to moisturize well at all.  My lips actually felt a little &#x27;tighter&#x27; while wearing this stuff.  Second, the odor from them is positively unacceptable.  While some may like it, I found the Honey lip balm to smell nothing of honey.  Instead, it reeked of flowers.  On a humorous aside, I was sitting in my apartment eating breakfast and wondered what seemed to smell of lilies or something.  I smelled the empty flower vase.  I smelled around the table.  I even asked my girlfriend if she was wearing a new perfume (yes, it is that strong).  As it turns out, it was my lips with this &#x27;balm&#x27; on them.  What&#x27;s worse is that I have 3 unused tubes of this stuff. Argh.  Anyway, be sure to smell it if you can before you buy it.  I found it awful.</li>
            <li> My kids both have sensitive reactions to so many other lip balms out there, swelling, cracked lips, that we don&#x27;t try any others.  But being aware of the quality of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and knowing the healing attributes of honey, we gave this lip balm a test many years ago.  The results were excellent!  No allergic reactions, no sensitivity, and it helped heal the kids&#x27; chapped or dry lips.  So we routinely purchased it from local stores.  But lately, we are finding it not carried in stores anymore (figures!) so I was very happy to find it at Amazon, and have now taken to \\&quot;bulk\\&quot; purchases of items I need, and this was no exception!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am and have been a HUGE fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees original chapstick for years, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it and I have multiple tubes so I always have one with me (home, car, purse, etc.) - but, this honey stuff it terrible! It tastes like soap! I&#x27;d recommend sticking to the original!</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees; no other lip balm can compare with how good the ORIGINAL is. I agree with the other reviewer that this smells of baby powder and petroleum jelly. The smell is over powering, and the heavy feeling it creates on my lips is more like an application of astringent rather than of moisturizing lip balm. I finally threw it out after leaving the house with it on more than one occasion, mistaking it for the good stuff. Better off sticking to the regular Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> As I understand it, people must just get this stuff because of the marketing.  My girlfriend loves the regular burt&#x27;s bees lip balm, so I started using it occasionally.  She kept stealing it from me, though, so I bought a 4-pack.  I thought \\&quot;I like honey,\\&quot; so I went for this one.  The Honey variety tastes and smells like baby powder and vaseline, which is not pleasant.  The regular Burt&#x27;s Bees tastes better in my opinion (not that I eat the stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stood out in the wind and cold for an afternoon, and my lips had become chapped.  The next day, I received and applied this Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm.  It didn&#x27;t solve the problem.  It may have kept them from getting so chapped, had I applied it first, but, despite frequent reapplications, it did not relieve the dryness nor the chapped feeling after the fact.  And finally, it has no sun protection, from what I can determine.  Maybe I just misunderstood what I was getting, but it tastes bad, doesn&#x27;t heal chapped lips, and has no SPF.  It&#x27;s just, plain and simple, a balm for one&#x27;s lips.  Maybe it&#x27;s a chick thing I don&#x27;t understand.  I&#x27;m sticking to carmex and chapstick after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reluctant update:  I feel I may have been a little too bitter originally.  I still can&#x27;t stand the taste of the stuff.  I can&#x27;t even handle smelling it on someone else nearby.  But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just a unique reaction.  Most people don&#x27;t seem to feel so strongly about it.  I prefer the original flavor.  You might like the honey flavor.  I&#x27;m willing to call off my crusade against it.  It&#x27;s just lip balm.  I&#x27;m calm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Michigan where we have the weather from all four seasons, so I have to use protection from heat, sun, cold,and some really dry air (winter -_-).  I use their products year round and the Honey lip balm is definitely my favorite.  It smells almost like baby powder to me, and it glides on so easy.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or anything like that, and it makes my lips look very moisturized.  It also makes them so soft.  I can&#x27;t stop putting it on.  I got this a few days ago, and I&#x27;ll probably be through this in no time.  don&#x27;t worry though, it does last a very long time.... I just put it on too often haha- I go through a lip balm a month, sometimes two hah    But yeah, don&#x27;t hesitate making the choice to buy this.  It&#x27;s simply amazing!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms.  The original in my opinion is the best because you can continuously use it without it becoming irritating or annoying.  The Honey version has a very similar feel as the original, the obvious difference is instead of a tingly mint sensation there is a sweet, aromatic scent and taste.  I originally liked this scent very much, however, with continued use it became somewhat overbearing and I was ready for a switch.  Still, once every few months i&#x27;ll come across this product and buy it for a change.  If you don&#x27;t mind a sweet scent and taste on your lips, you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li> I will admit this is a great chap stick. It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly. It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips. I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items. It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li> This lip balm moisturizes my lips, but it seems so dense when I compare it to the peppermint version. This version does moisturize and is nice, but I prefer the peppermint version because it&#x27;s so refreshing. If you&#x27;re opposed to the peppermint in the other balm, you should definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> I tried liking this. I applied it several times to give it another chance. But my conclusion is the smell is pretty bad (like an old couch or old shoe). Its just a weird smell that doesn&#x27;t go away. Only good thing, is it does moisturize your lips, but you&#x27;ll have to be willing to smell that bad smell all day. I am throwing this out too.</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick on the market. However, I have to be careful not to get the variety that contains mint oil. For me, that addition makes it more chapping, and not all tubes indicate that they have mint oil in them. These did not, however, I&#x27;ve gotten tubes of this kind from the store that didn&#x27;t indicate they had it, and they did. So, that bit aside, these were exactly what I wanted, and they moisturize wonderfully. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t offer any pseudoscience on the merits of beeswax over petrolatum, but it&#x27;s been my experience that the petro-based chapsticks require you to apply balm constantly. I find that with Burt&#x27;s Bees, the opposite is true. So there&#x27;s some anecdotal evidence for you, which is really what Amazon reviews are all about.    Some reviewers have noted that this product doesn&#x27;t help with their chapped lips. I could see that as a possibility. There may be better products out there for healing damaged skin. I think of this balm as a preventive measure. I put this on before I go out, and I never get chapped lips. I have very fair skin that is prone to drying out, and I live in a cold, windy mountain town.     Because it eliminates one reason - out of countless, surely - for girls to not want to kiss me, Burt&#x27;s Bees has my undying devotion.    Shores</li>
            <li> Unlike the overly sweet and crumbly limp balms I have used over the years, I like the ingredients, taste and smell of this honest one much more.It doesn&#x27;t permeate my senses like some others (Apple, or the more medicinal) ones. It does what it promises and keeps my lips nice and dry. Love this lip balm, and highly recommend other products in their line (I also use their shampoo and body products.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product since I liked Nivea&#x27;s Milk and Honey lip balm.  The taste is somewhat similar, but protection wise it does not last as long.  Whereas with Nivea I could apply once and it would last all day, with Burt&#x27;s Bees I need to occasionally reapply.  I suspect this is because the Nivea is more buttery, so the coverage is more uniform.  Burt&#x27;s Bees, on the other hand, is a harder wax that tends to chip off from time to time as you apply it.  Still, not bad for all natural (which the Nivea is not).</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, keeps lips moist and healthy. An environmentally responsible company with reasonable prices.[[ASIN:B002DPUXZM Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube, .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> Some people may love the smell of flowers, but floral fragrances really bother me.  I never would have expected this to smell like that.  But it does, and it&#x27;s really strong.  The beeswax kind doesn&#x27;t smell like that at all.  This one and the pomegranate one both do.  Back to beeswax for me!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to lip balm. Unlike most chap stick available, it does not contain camphor, phenol, or menthol, ingredients known to dry out lips. The trade off is a lack of tingle when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a honey-esque taste, though subtle. It smells a bit like baby power. It is not over powering, but certainly noticeable. The scent subsides within 15 minutes, and you are left with smooth feeling lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the height of a cold, I have used this lip balm on my red, irritated nose to help sooth it. It does the trick as well as petroleum jelly, without the undesired greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a Burt&#x27;s Bees fanboy, but I do recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot attest to one particular seller or another, as I usually buy it at a retail store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the original mint kind for a while before deciding to try the honey. It works as well the original, but I don&#x27;t like the smell at all. It reminds me of baby powder...which isn&#x27;t a bad smell in the least, but not a scent I want on my lips.</li>
            <li> The scent is way too strong.  It is hard to describe, but it is a sour, musky smell.  I think patchouli is the closest thing to it.  And the scent really lasts.  I literally had to wipe this off my lips.  Straight to the garbage can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like the consistency of the lip balm.  It goes on smoothly and is not oily.  It lasts.  It protects well and has a good ingredient list (natural, lip-friendly ingredients).  It could be a great lip balm except for the overwhelming, bad scent.  Too bad they don&#x27;t make a different version of this without the terrible perfume (and also without peppermint like the beeswax version).</li>
            <li> While some people complain about the smell, I prefer to see I&#x27;m using a product without the chemicals we found in other products.  For me, the smell is not bad (actually it&#x27;s a natural smell) and goes away soon. Knowing that I&#x27;m using something totally natural is much more important to me.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite chapstick! I like that it leaves a thick layer on my lips, I don&#x27;t prefer chapsticks that are really light and slippery. I live in CO so I need something that is going to moisturize in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Daughters favorite Chapstick. We tried the one with mint in it..please do not let children use it. The peppermint oil is too strong and actually burned my daughters lips to the point of stabbing pver</li>
            <li> The honey version is the best ever lip balm.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle taste of honey.  Does not have a strong odor.. I never leave home without my lip balm in my pocket! First time ordered it came in a neat metal box, very retro, with the classic Burt&#x27;s bees logo on it.  Glad I saved the metal box as second order did not have the metal box. of course, that doesn&#x27;t change the contents of the lip balm. :)</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee Honey Lip Balm is the best. Best for chap lips and been using this products for years and would recommend this Lip Balm to anyone with chap lips. 100 % please..</li>
            <li> I must first say that I have not yet bought this product from Amazon, so I can&#x27;t comment on shipping transactions, etc. Though I thought to write a review that I hope to be helpful for people considering this product!  Burt&#x27;s Bees honey lip balm is the only thing I currently put on my lips. It is wonderful! I usually only put it on when I know I&#x27;m going outside in the wind or sun. It definitely protects my lips. I must also say that I am a sufferer of cold sores. I usually get them from extreme weather like direct sun and wind. I can also get them due to stress and hormones. The story is that I used to use a lip balm that then I swore by for protecting me from cold sores, and it did work for quite sometime. Then perhaps my body became immune to it because my lips started to peel and become horribly dry and flaky. It became very embarrassing. I kept thinking I couldn&#x27;t change lip balms because I thought everything else would give me a cold sore. Then I tried this Burt&#x27;s Bees honey lip balm. Wow! The flaking went away almost right away. My lips finally got the nourishment and protection they needed.  I must say other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products did give me cold sores.. the tinted lip balms and the SPF lip balm. I thought it would be safe to try them, but did not end well..  To be honest, at first the smell was a little much for me. It reminded me of something like laundry soap.. But I now really appreciate the smell. However, my boyfriend does not like the smell! This is indeed unfortunate, but I really only wear it outdoors. And really my old lip balm smelled like bandaids.  To sum it all up, I highly recommend this lip product!</li>
            <li> I just love burt&#x27;s bees chapstick so I figured since I keep loosing mine, I&#x27;ll get a pack of 4 so I stash one in the car, my purse, and around the house. Still have all of them :)</li>
            <li> I only buy Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm as I do not like the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products.  I can very seldom find the Honey Balm and was thrilled to find it at a great price!  Each tube has been exactly what I expected and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I used a similar Burt&#x27;s bee lip balm before and it was good,but this \\&quot;honey\\&quot; scent smells absolutely disgusting. I had to wipe it off five times with a tissue paper after only the first application. Do not buy this \\&quot;honey\\&quot; scent, buy the beeswax instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, so you know it&#x27;ll at least be decent. It&#x27;s great for your lips, but I was not particularly fond of the scent or the flavor, and my husband HATED it. He actually threw it away, so I couldn&#x27;t use it again! Lol. I guess I&#x27;m sticking to the original. ;)</li>
            <li> As a man, I don&#x27;t use lip balm much because I rarely get dry lips. Only in the most severe winters do even try to use it and usually only end up buying 1 stick per year. My fiance on the other hand, suffers from severe dry/chapped lips and usually goes through several sticks a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She prefers Burt&#x27;s Bees over traditional lip balms, but as most of us that have purchased lip balms in the past know that Burt&#x27;s Bees carries a premium price vs other brands. So for the most part, she just buys the petroleum based products (whether Chapstick, Blistex, or the generics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expiration: My primary concern about buying this product (since Burt&#x27;s Bees is natural) is the expiration date. As I mentioned before in my past reviews, buying anything with an expiration date online sometimes becomes a concern for me simply because you don&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re buying is something that&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for months (or years) after the expiration date. I am 99.% sure that Amazon has strict standards and have yet to have a \\&quot;bad product\\&quot; from them, so when I made my purchase, I made sure Amazon.com was the company that my item was *SOLD FROM*. Although there are other options for more buying choices, I&#x27;m still hesitant if Amazon is not the seller/shipper. Looking at the Burt&#x27;s Bees balms I have received, I immediately started searching for a date and saw the stamp \\&quot;3221101\\&quot; on all my lip balms. So any consumer, especially me would have thought that maybe 32211 &#x3D; March 22, 2011. But is this an expiration date or a manufacturered date? I started doing some investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Burt&#x27;s Bees corporate page, it is stated that there is a shelf life (due to natural ingredients) but they are unable to provide an expiration date. However, the product should be in good quality condition for 3 years past their date. Further explanation shows that the number stamp I see on my lip balms is actually a lot code that consists of the date it was manufactured and the last 2 digits being the lot code. HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year. So my number of 3221101 is actually:&lt;br /&gt; 322 Julian Date (actually November 18th in Gregorian)&lt;br /&gt; 11 &#x3D; 2011&lt;br /&gt; 01 &#x3D; Batch Number&lt;br /&gt;So based on their explanation, my tubes were made on Nov 18, 2011 and will last until Nov 18, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beeswax vs Petroleum: This is an ongoing debate that has advocates for each side. The effects of each are the same (helps moisturize/seal moisture) on your lips. But there are some people who refuse to use Petroleum-based lip balms (Chapstick/Blistex) on their lips due to the fact that it&#x27;s made from petroleum (same stuff as gasoline comes from) and some say that can cause cancer. On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects. But since there is the danger of the honeybees declining in population, it may not be around forever and in turn, is usually more expensive than petroleum based lip balms. As I said previously, my fiance loves Burt&#x27;s Bees but it can be quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Around here in Nashville, TN, Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is over $3 per stick + tax. Compared to the .99 cent generic petroleum-based lip balms or $1.29 for a brand name like Chapstick, it&#x27;s no wonder why you would reach for the $1.29 option. However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for around $10.14. The end price per stick is roughly $2.54, so you save over 50 cents per stick. So if you&#x27;re looking to save money and like Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, just buy it from Amazon unless you can get it cheaper locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!d and the last 2 digits being the lot code.

            <li> Cold winters, warm springs, and cool falls. Such is the climate of New York, regardless of your exact location. While my skin and lips develop different levels of dryness depending on the season, one thing is for certain: I am never without this lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect to other flavors by Burt&#x27;s Bees, this one seems to hydrate the best. For years I only purchased Chap Stick. It was usually a little over $1 and had been a long-trusted brand. I had seen Burt&#x27;s Bees nearby and was tempted on several occasions, but it wasn&#x27;t until I decided to &#x27;splurge&#x27; that I discovered what I had been missing: heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm is like sweet angels drenching your lips in honey. It glides on smooth, rarely has to be reapplied, and is worth the extra dollar or so. Say goodbye to weird tasting cherry &#x27;balm&#x27; and pick up a tube of this real stuff. Is it one less dollar you could be spending at some dollar menu? Yes, but I assure you it&#x27;s worth more than any cheap cheeseburger.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm as it is very nourishing and goes on smooth. It has more of a shea butter smell and taste than honey.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I, like several others, did not notice that this was not the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I like honey.  This stuff, however, stinks horribly and smells nothing like honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obnoxiously strong smell reminds me more of almost a sickly sweet rose scent.  All 4 tubes went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the honey lip balm.  Seems to be the only lip care product that she feels keeps her lips from drying out.  She&#x27;s tried many other lip balms, including other Burt&#x27;s Bees products; however the &amp;#34;Honey&amp;#34; lip balm is the one she swears by.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm ever! After years of using ChapStik it started to irritate my mouth but within a few days of using Burt&#x27;s Bees the rash cleared up and the rest is history.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Hard to find</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it keeps your lips from drying out and I got a great bargain also on my purchase, thank you!</li>
            <li> The product package is not as shown in the picture. When I tracked the product number online, I found these lip balms were produced in 2008. Do not buy it!</li>
            <li> The seasons of the year I use it in the. Really very good. Carry a very convenient. I will use it forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad lip balm, but there&#x27;s nothing special about it. It doesn&#x27;t make McGil wow! The smell is great! But, I feel like I have to use way too much of it for my satisfaction. Not sure that I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart and just wanted to warn people about the misleading &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; implication on the packaging of this product. I expected it to be somewhat mild and slightly sweet, oh, I don&#x27;t know, maybe I thought it would taste like HONEY......Instead it tastes like baby powder...which I hate. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would want to smell baby powder all day, let alone taste it in your mouth! Horrible. Just... Horrible. I suppose it&#x27;s the lanolin that makes it smell/taste like this, I will definitely watch for this ingredient in the future! As of now, I wasted 3 bucks (expensive for lip balm!) so I thought I would try and save some others the money and frustration. Unless of course you love the smell and taste of baby powder....then by all means have at it, this is your lip balm!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a great relationship with burts bee&#x27;s lip balms. I have extremely sensitive lips that are very finicky about the weather and different types of chapsticks/lip balms. My lips sting and hurt all the time whenever there is an extreme change in temperature and burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s has never failed me before. This honey flavor is no exception. It soothes my lips without any irritation but it does smell like baby powder! It&#x27;s not subtle either is very strong and prevalent and odd considering how I think honey has a very strong sent too. The honey scent is there but is extremely subtle compared to the strong baby powder scent. If you have an issue with baby powder stay clear away from this, but if you don&#x27;t then its a great soothing lip balm.</li>
            <li> This lip balm works really well.  I use to have dry lips and this solved the problem.  I don&#x27;t like the taste or feel of lipstick.</li>
            <li> Good price for a pack of lip balm(s), the honey &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; takes some getting used to if you&#x27;re accustomed to the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s soothing for very cracked lips, lasts a long time, and comforting to know it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve used this for many years, this has a thick consistency lovely feel and nice honey scent.</li>
            <li> Love this chap-stick!  Haven&#x27;t found a better chap-stick on the market!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this chap stick for...5-ish years? I like it, works great. BUT I&#x27;m literally addicted to it. Like, if I leave it at home by accident my lips will start to crack and hurt &amp; no other chap stick works. The only one that kinda works is the original chap stick. Seriously. Not cool. So, that&#x27;s disturbing. Kinda makes me wonder what kind of opium/meth/coke concoction is in this chap stick. If Burts bees stops making this stuff they&#x27;ll have addicts like me quite upset!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it a good review is because it is nice chap stick that works well.</li>
            <li> I can never find the lip balm with honey in my local stores so I came to Amazon to get the four pack of them. While the other lip balms just come right off and one has to reapply constantly, the honey in this lip balm gives it staying power. Honey also has healing properties which is perfect for chapped lips in the winter. But heck I use this daily, year-round. Also this stuff blends in great with other lip products.</li>
            <li> Literally the only lip balm that works for me. It&#x27;s not greasy or drying, it goes on with a satin feel, and keeps my lips moisturized longer than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll probably never stop buying this product.</li>
            <li> Last year I accidentally purchased the honey balm when I thought I was getting another tube of the original formula.  When I put it on it was a little shocking to have SWEET on me lips as opposed to the peppermint tingle.  It was the best accident I could have ever asked for.  I absolutely LOVE this lip balm.  It moisturizes, lasts long, tastes great.  If you don&#x27;t like honey, you OBVIOUSLY won&#x27;t like this balm.  This is used daily and I have more tubes than I can count now just because I need one on me at all time.    The scent is strong, but I promise you&#x27;ll get used to it.  This formula is far more moisturizing to my lips than the original formula.  That&#x27;s not to say it will be the best formula for someone ELSE&#x27;S lips, but I will never go back to anything else.    An added bonus?  I&#x27;ve been told my lips taste amazing!!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey is a bit different than the original Burt&#x27;s Bees.  The original kind of tingles when applied and gives a weird sensation on the lips (because of the mint), but this stuff just soothes has a sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advantage to this is that in the winter/wind the lip balm doesn&#x27;t become unbearable to wear, like it does with the original mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm smells good, feels good with a thick sweet formulation, and is a great addition to the Burt&#x27;s line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm. Smells really great, just like honey. Goes on creamy and not greasy, velvety smooth. Feels great on your lips and protects as well. very luxurious feeling. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them , best lip balm I have ever put on my lips!ill buy more !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can get this in a 4-pack! This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. I use this every day and my lips absolutely love it. Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Balm keeps my lips soft and smooth - never dries them out. I loved this balm during my years dealing with Chicago winters and I still love it dealing with the heat of southern California summers. The honey and bees wax is a great combination. It&#x27;s not greasy and there&#x27;s no overpowering scent or taste. My lips love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I thought this was the one Burt&#x27;s bees that i was looking for but it was not..it is okay tho..still using it</li>
            <li> We were introduced to Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm by a surfer on vacation many years ago.  Our whole family uses it, great in the summer and winter as we spend a lot of time outside in the winter snow skiing.</li>
            <li> We use a wood burning stove from about October through May, and it causes your skin to be more dry. Someone recommended this Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. I love the taste of honey so thought why not try the honey version? I love it. It&#x27;s not too sweet. It stays on your lips for awhile. The size of the container is handy -- I put it in my shirt pocket as I work at home. If you apply it morning, noon and night, it should keep your lips from drying out and cracking if you&#x27;re in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to buy several at once. It&#x27;s great to keep several in the house and pocket book at all times, in case you misplace one. I don&#x27;t like to go a day without applying this, so don&#x27;t want to run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ad says it&#x27;s 99.82 natural. You feel good using it.</li>
            <li> I love the peppermint version, but this one has a bad odor to me. Worth the try, but I would not order the honey one again.</li>
            <li> seriously...this lip balm smells kinda s***ty.&lt;br /&gt;i like burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s other products. but this one is a mistake. i have never had honey that smelled like this.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm at the drugstore, when I could find it (which wasn&#x27;t nearly as often as I needed to replace a tube!)  When I found this great deal from this seller at Amazon, I snapped them up. Surely enough, this lip balm is the original, delightful-smelling lip balm I had so many problems finding at the store.  It smells wonderful, is soft and gentle even on chapped lips, and works to protect, soothe, and heal.  I have multiple tubes going at once (one by my bed, one in my purse, one in my car, etc) and will be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> Do you know how many i bought? 16!! I like this lip and will give them as a gift to my friends</li>
            <li> I enjoyed many products from Burt&#x27;s Bees, but their lip balm are just not that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know why so many people like it.  It is too dry with an unpleasant smell.  I tried their other lip balms without honey, but still the same.&lt;br /&gt;I paid premium price for this product and it performs worse than ChapStick in protecting my lips.  That&#x27;s pretty bad for selling at three times the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I love the original Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, and thought I might like the honey. However, it is SO strongly scented (like baby powder and honey) that I can&#x27;t wear it at all. It&#x27;s really overpowering and unpleasant. I don&#x27;t recommend it, unless you love those scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Buts&#x27; Bees lip balm for a long time. This Honey lip balm is so moisturizing and smooth I love it.</li>
            <li> This had been my favorite lip balm for years, until now. Apparently the formulation has changed and it includes benzyl benzoate now, which I didn&#x27;t know until I received the product. It has the same smell, feel, and effectiveness as before but the addition of benzyl benzoate makes me not like it anymore. I try to avoid estrogen mimickers (xenoestrogens) so this isn&#x27;t a product for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Doesn&#x27;t come in traditional packaging- more like 4 tubes wrapped in one plastic pouch. I thought I ordered the peppermint but got the honey instead. This was my reading error.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, does not come off too much at a go, and really helps prevent chapped lips. Highly recommended if you have dry lips that crack easily like mine.</li>
            <li> Nice smell! Clear and calm one.</li>
            <li> I have one of these in every room, my purse and in the car!  I am addicted to the smell  and feeling...</li>
            <li> Love these lip butters, they go on very smooth and moisturizing. I keep them in my purse, in my pocket and at work. They smell good and last quite awhile after application. Would definately buy these again?</li>
            <li> Had to switch from the vaseline and petroleum based lip balms due to allergic reactions.  This one is smoother, natural, and soothing.  Good product.</li>
            <li> 아직은 사용전입니다. 배송은 정확히 왔네요. 많은 사람들이 인정하는 제품이니 나에게도 좋을것이라 생각합니다. 행복하세요~~</li>
            <li> The formulation for this lip balm sold via Amazon is not the standard Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm formulation.  It tastes and smells ultra waxy and leaves your lips feeling tacky/sticky instead of moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to use and very cheap.It is very nice for my lip care in the winter.I used it got many years.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Highly Recommended. Stock up before winter&#x27;s cold weather begins to dry out your lips. Remember-There will be lots of kisses in the upcoming Holiday Season and no one wants to kiss a pair of chapped lips. Fine service from seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using  Bert&#x27;s bees for some time now, as well as Caudalie lip balms. As I was traveling in Europe, Burt&#x27;s bees are more expensive and hard to find, but this pack of 4 was great value, so much that I bought two. The honey smell is subtle and the balm lasts quite long. Much longer than others I&#x27;ve tried. no matter what brands I try , I always keep coming back to them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this particular balm in my town and really love it. Perfect for those chilly winters when your lips chap. Highly recommend this for anyone who lives in cold climates. Will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for honey flavor. This has a distinct rose aroma and taste.</li>
            <li> We spend a lot of time outdoor in the un and wind. This is pleasant tasting and helps prevent chapped lips</li>
            <li> I love Burt Bee&#x27;s and typically buy the mango or pomegranate flavors, but decided to buy this one since it was on sale. I expected a very subtle honey scent or no scent at all, but this one has a very strong baby powder and plastic scent. I don&#x27;t want the smell of a baby&#x27;s butt on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, this one doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as my other BB chapsticks. I&#x27;m just going to go through this pack as quickly as I can, and go back to buying the mango and pomegranate ones. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I find it makes my lips happy and moist.  I don&#x27;t have to apply it constantly as it seems to last some time.  I try to keep it handy in case I need it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt, which was essential since this was a Christmas present.  The person I gave the gift too enjoyed it and I would purchase it again as I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm because it is soothing and not waxy. The honey variety is my favorite. Evidently, it is popular in my area too because bins for the honey are often empty during the Winter months. The fruity varieties are persistently fragrant and become annoying to me, but I don&#x27;t notice the honey while it is on other than its soothing effect.</li>
            <li> The quality of Burt&#x27;s Bee products is always great which is why this review has 4 stars. However, from a personal preference perspective, I like the original Burt&#x27;s Bee (peppermint) flavor much more than this one. If you are not into mint flavor, this would be a good alternative.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal, cheaper than single purchase.  I love the scent.  That&#x27;s why I buy the honey flavor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees mint-flavored lip balm for years, and bought this one by accident, as the color of the tube is very close. This supposed honey scent soooo close to my nose can be a migraine trigger... However, my husband is allergic to mint. If only this wasn&#x27;t so much of a girlie scent, I could pawn it off on him...</li>
            <li> I do love this chap stick. it&#x27;s on the stiff side so it&#x27;s not all goopy and melty. It smells like honey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time i use this kind of lip balm tube.its hard to smear when i try to use it  in the mouth.can it be freezing by the cold weather?</li>
            <li> Good quality and good price.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;She will like it.&lt;br /&gt;And I will buy this again for my friends&#x27; present.</li>
            <li> Mild honey scent and taste. Effective moisturizer. No gloss/shine.  Softer than ChapStick. Holds up well in your pocket. Great basic lip balm.</li>
            <li> This 4 pack is very economical; it&#x27;s less expensive than buying them individually. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products because they have all natural ingredients. The honey balm has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine swore by this stuff and I decided to give it a try after I ran out of Chapstick and the drugstore was out of the Strawberry flavor I like. I used it for a few days and noticed that it was drying my lips out and making them hard and rough; the very problems lip balm is supposed to ameliorate Burt&#x27;s Bees exacerbated.  ChapStick for life!</li>
            <li> First, let me say I like honey.  Flavor and smell.  This doesn&#x27;t register as smelling like honey to me.  It smells horrible to me, and I&#x27;ve used the normal burt&#x27;s bees lip balm for 15 years.  I couldn&#x27;t stand to have the smell literally right under my nose.  Obviously, some people like it.  I&#x27;m a guy, and I could not stand it!  May try the pomegranate and if I don&#x27;t like that, I&#x27;ll just go back to the normal.  Was just looking for a change.</li>
            <li> I think Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are the best natural lip balms out there.  BUT this honey lip balm really does have a very strong &amp; very unpleasant smell, you can smell it as soon as you uncap it, can&#x27;t describe the smell but I can&#x27;t bear to use this balm at all.  Scent preferences are very subjective so you may disagree but just beware &amp; think twice before you get this controversial scent.</li>
            <li> I bought some Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for the first time a while ago and loved it because it was smooth and tasted just like honey. I was excited to see a 4 pack for a decent price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they changed their product or if I ordered the wrong thing. Either way, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this lip balm. It has a really thick texture and smells a lot like baby powder. Nothing like honey. Ick.</li>
            <li> The first thing I thought when I got them was &amp;#34;aren&#x27;t they supposed to come in a box?&amp;#34; Apparently they are just thrown into a clear plastic bag. Anyways, I opened one of them up, and tried it. I was immediately disoriented. Honey doesn&#x27;t smell like that. It has a very peculiar and bathroomy smell to it. I am not happy with this purchase. Instead I would recommend getting the Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm with Vitamin E &amp; Peppermint.  The mint one is much more pleasant to smell than the honey.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm is the preferred item that my wife likes, purchased for her for Christmas. Fast delivery and a grate product.</li>
            <li> I found this b/c I was looking for something great and thought about how Burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s makes some really great skin care things and that&#x27;s where I found this yay my lips r saved! ^_^</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and I use it religiously. If you love honey you will love this stuff. Makes my lips smell wonderful and leaves them super soft especially as much as I use it.</li>
            <li> This has a floral scent which is a bummer. I was expecting a honey flavor not a flower scented chap stick. Go with the Acai Berry Burt&#x27;s Bees or the Pomegranate Burt&#x27;s Bees. Or get the Whole Foods branded ones. They are all better.</li>
            <li> Yum!  smells exactly like pure honey and the scent lingers for quite a while.  Makes me crave honey so bad! :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a matter of taste, but personally i dont like this flavour.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really smell like honey, and doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; feeling the pomegranate has. if you dislike sweet lip balms, this might be a good one for you.</li>
            <li> All of my friends use this when their lips are dry. I rarely need it, but it works when I do. I usually give these out to friends as little gifts.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this not realizing it was different from Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax lip balm, which we very much prefer. They need to make a bigger difference in the labels so they don&#x27;t all look the same. It is OK but I would never buy it again, that&#x27;s just my preference. Also it has a very strong honey smell and taste. I don&#x27;t like the flavor at all.</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF, HELPFUL TO LIPS.&lt;br /&gt;MY MOM LOVES IT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS GOOD TO LIPS.&lt;br /&gt;PURE NATURE STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BUY TI AGAIN SOON.</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my lips super soft and moisturized. It just feels great on. Gives em a nice shine too, without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I end up tasting this honey stuff, and I like the regular, less flavorful burts bees much better.  I&#x27;m sure it would be fine if you think you would like the honey flavor.  My wife doesn&#x27;t mind it, but she doesn&#x27;t prefer it either.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is very moist and the taste is not like, and so this time runs out, buy a tasty point.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake thinking mmmmm honey.&lt;br /&gt;AND IT SMELLS AND TASTES LIKE BABY POWDER!&lt;br /&gt;I threw the tube away immediately and washed my lips off.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how that is \\&quot;honey\\&quot; but AVOID THIS.&lt;br /&gt;You will regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A--- would not buy again!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is very moisturizing and I love  that its all natural. It&#x27;s also fairly tasteless which I find nice.</li>
            <li> While it was on, it felt like my lips weren&#x27;t dry. But in reality, it was simply a wax coating, and it really didn&#x27;t do anything in the way of moisturizing my lips. As soon as it wore off, my lips were just as dry and chapped as ever. Not really the best lip balm, and I have found Shea butter ones to do the trick the best.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm and how it glides on easily on the lips and how soft it makes my lips feel. Problem this lip balm tasted and smelled nothing like honey. Clearly the formula has changed and why does it smell like baby&#x27;s powder.</li>
            <li> fell in love with this ever since I received it years ago. The scent of honey is almost similar to when you&#x27;re drinking honey. Keeps the lips moisturized. Would be good if there&#x27;s SPF.</li>
            <li> You save a lot buying a four pack online, especially when you wear a lot of Chapstick like I do. The honey one is not too strong on smell which I love, and not minty like the original one is. It&#x27;s just right and always smooth and gentle on your lips.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is well known for making a great product, and this is no exception. It keeps my lips moisturized in the desert sun as well as in snow and ice; and the taste is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint, and this is true for most tube of lip balm out there, is that if you don&#x27;t pay attention sometimes it will fall out when its near the end, leaving you high and dry unless you brought an extra tube.</li>
            <li> Bought this product recently and could not be happier. I had been using petroleum based &#x27;Chapstick&#x27; and other brands until i heard about this all natural honey lip-balm. It feels good and keeps my lips in great shape, firm and protected. The taste/smell of the honey based balm is much nicer.</li>
            <li> I buy it for my wife. She love it so much. I think she will be happy when receive these items.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and use lots of chapstick. This is my all time favorite type of chapstick! I won&#x27;t use anything else on a regular basis. The consistency is perfect (1st ingredient is beeswax, which I like) and it smells so good! Keep in mind that it does not contain an SPF.</li>
