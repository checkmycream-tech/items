            <li>The quality of the soap is good.  </li>
            <li>The glycerin content is good and softens the whiskers (and skin).  </li>
            <li>Both are good</li>
            <li>my wife loved the smell of it though.</li>
            <li>This is a good, affordable product.</li>

            <li>A good product, very nice lather and very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>To this point I have been very satisfied with Col. Conk.</li>
            <li>Good soap- smells nice.  </li>
            <li>This shave soap lathers up incredibly well and the unique almond smell leaves</li>
            <li>Col. Conk comes out on top!</li>
            <li>This is one of thoe items-- and the almond glycerine is lightly scented and is great for shaving.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave with a nice scent and dosen&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely</li>
            <li>Not as nice on the skin as I had hoped</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma</li>
            <li>It lathers nice and hydrates the skin well.  </li>
            <li>The shave soap has a nice almond</li>
            <li>The best part of this particular soap, though, is the scent.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and smells good.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the famous Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>It did not lather up well, but I was using an ok brush so that might have something to do with it.  </li>
            <li>Probably would not buy again though, go to ebay where there is much more selection for a better price.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all the Conk soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, putting up there along with my favorite soaps and creams.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent for shave soap.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this many times before.</li>
            <li>this stuff works very well, and has made switching from an electric razor a great experience.</li>
            <li>The low price is the best part.</li>
            <li>Was hoping to get more suds from the bar.</li>
            <li>I also hoped there would be more Almond smell.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep track of your lather!&lt;br</li>
            <li>one of my favorite scents of shaving soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure beats buying some drugstore aerosol soap every month.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have much of a scent and didn&#x27;t create a great lather.</li>
            <li>then most others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Conk soap has just the right amount of lather to it for a good coverage and shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They quickly provide a great lather; it soften one&#x27;s beard quickly &amp; leaves one&#x27;s skin feeling moisturized without feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>The almond scent has a nice lather and a sweet smelling scent to it.</li>
            <li>My first experience with this type of shaving and it has been a good one.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>It gave me a much better shave than my canned, aerosol stuff, and it&#x27;s great knowing that it&#x27;s all completely natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>About the only thing I really liked about this product was that it smelled great.</li>
            <li>The cent is not overbearing, the soap provides a nice lather, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, inexpensive and will last a good number of shaves!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with this that I might try some other flavors.  </li>
            <li>Soap is pretty good, lather is great, rinses easily from my face and razor, but I&#x27;m not big on this smell.</li>
            <li>They are easily malleable  </li>
            <li>The soap develops lather easily.  </li>
            <li>This soap has a lovely almond scent that wears off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this and other soaps purchased to go with a shaving set gift this Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;The scents are not overpowering and the skin feels clean after use.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and free of irritation.</li>
            <li>Great performance and solid value.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I suppose it was probably good in it&#x27;s day but better soaps have been created in recent years.</li>
            <li>I feel Col Conk is a great value considering the expense of many of the other soaps and creams out there</li>
            <li>This soap has a light, pleasant sent and produces a nice lather with little effort.</li>
            <li>This soap is light, smells good (like almond extract), and whips up into a nice lather with a little effort.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened it I was pleased.  </li>
            <li>This shaving soap is sensitive to the skin, smells good and keeps you feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>He loves it so much he  bought more scents.</li>
            <li>you smelling great afterwards, unlike other chemical-filled soaps and shaving</li>
            <li>Col. Conk is mild on the face and I&#x27;ve never felt any discomfort using it.    </li>
            <li>This product will last through many, many shaves.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried using different amounts of water with it by soaking my brush and shaking out the water more and more until I found the amount that gave me the best lather, but It still is not enough, which is why I definitely prefer to lather up my brush with this, then with shaving cream, and then apply to my face.</li>
            <li>The soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either, which is something I experienced with some much higher priced alternatives...</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your skin soft, not dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always pleased at how thick and creamly it lathers up and the almond smell is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>GOOD STUFF MAKES MY FACE FEEL SMOOTH AND SOFTENS BEARD EVEN WHEN I LET IT GO FOR A FEW DAYS</li>
            <li>Men do have their ritual and since they need to scrape their face daily (or sometimes weekly), they do need nice things</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because the ingredients are better then most other soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all but the amber and have to say that they are pretty good little performers.  </li>
            <li>After completing an A-B-A test, the Bay Rum definitely lathers up better for some reason.  </li>
            <li>I used this soap tonight for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably try more scents in the future when this one runs out.</li>
            <li>the evaluate a second time with more use.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was just my lack of experience</li>
            <li>First time user of Col. Conk products</li>
            <li>Love this soap it lathers different</li>
            <li>I got a good Shave and figured I would stick with it a few weeks and see the results.</li>
            <li>This is my second soap tried - the first was the Van der Hagen that comes in the cheap Walmart kit.</li>
            <li>(you only need a little bit to get a great lather).  </li>
            <li>When I bought this shave soap I was just getting into wetshaving, and so I was doing quite a bit of research and experimentation into the various products available.</li>
            <li>And it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>This makes working up a lather much easier.  </li>
            <li>but you really need to work it so it doesn&#x27;t burn after you shave.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and is a fairly slick soap.</li>
            <li>Got a decent shave out of it and did not irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild, it definitely is not overwhelming!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I found the ALMOND scent to be better than some of the more expensive soaps that I have tried.</li>
            <li>The price is too high when compared to the shave and price the lower priced Van Der Hagen Luxury.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Lime and Bay Rum fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the almond shave soap.  </li>
            <li>Other soaps have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>It was okay but really dried my face out.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, subtle almond scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and actually fades after a while.</li>
            <li>&quot; It was not only the fastest shave I ever got, my skin feels tight, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the lime and bay rum scents, but this one is less masculine.</li>
            <li>I just mix with a tiny bit of water and use the lather right off the soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few variations on how much water and which brush I use, and I still cannot get a fantastic lather.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>You can use it right out of the plastic container and it holds together well, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Needs a bigger bowl or mug rather than the small wooden dish to get good lather.</li>
            <li>Double Edge Classic Blades, Badger Silver Hair Brush and Col. Conk&#x27;s Almond Glycerine Soap!</li>
            <li>These last a while.. so this is very affordable.</li>
            <li>The lather is nice and thick or you can thin it out to give better control when trying to shave around a mustache edge.  </li>
            <li>After the 20 seconds sit the bowl on the counter and let the soap cool down and it will harden and conform to the shape of the bowl.</li>
            <li>This could be due to its being new and used for the first time.</li>
            <li>I changed to a Double Edge Safety Razor that my Dad used and even purchased a Badger Hair Brush trying to get a decent shave but</li>
            <li>My new Shaving regiment now consist of my dad&#x27;s 50 year old Double Edge Razor, Wilkenson Sword</li>
            <li>After reading a few of the reviews on Shaving Soap, I tried the only Shave Soap available at my nearest Walgreens called Van Der Hagen for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>My razor and brush rinsed off so easily with no soap scum or residue that the Shaving Crèmes and Gels use to leave</li>
            <li>The rest are OK as shaving creams go, but are not great.</li>
            <li>If you shave your whole face you might want to try one of the other soaps for a longer lasting lather.</li>
            <li>The only other Conk I tried was Bay Rum, which I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of scent-wise, but it lathered equally as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, and thought I&#x27;d start of with the Almond soap from Col. Conk.</li>

            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either, which is something I experienced with some much higher priced alternatives...</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves your skin soft, not dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always pleased at how thick and creamly it lathers up and the almond smell is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF MAKES MY FACE FEEL SMOOTH AND SOFTENS BEARD EVEN WHEN I LET IT GO FOR A FEW DAYS</li>
            <li> Men do have their ritual and since they need to scrape their face daily (or sometimes weekly), they do need nice things</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the ingredients are better then most other soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all but the amber and have to say that they are pretty good little performers.  </li>
            <li> After completing an A-B-A test, the Bay Rum definitely lathers up better for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I used this soap tonight for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try more scents in the future when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> the evaluate a second time with more use.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was just my lack of experience</li>
            <li> First time user of Col. Conk products</li>
            <li> Love this soap it lathers different</li>
            <li> I got a good Shave and figured I would stick with it a few weeks and see the results.</li>
            <li> This is my second soap tried - the first was the Van der Hagen that comes in the cheap Walmart kit.</li>
            <li> (you only need a little bit to get a great lather).  </li>
            <li> When I bought this shave soap I was just getting into wetshaving, and so I was doing quite a bit of research and experimentation into the various products available.</li>
            <li> And it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> This makes working up a lather much easier.  </li>
            <li> but you really need to work it so it doesn&#x27;t burn after you shave.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely and is a fairly slick soap.</li>
            <li> Got a decent shave out of it and did not irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li> The scent is mild, it definitely is not overwhelming!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I found the ALMOND scent to be better than some of the more expensive soaps that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The price is too high when compared to the shave and price the lower priced Van Der Hagen Luxury.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Lime and Bay Rum fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the almond shave soap.  </li>
            <li> Other soaps have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> It was okay but really dried my face out.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, subtle almond scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and actually fades after a while.</li>
            <li> &quot; It was not only the fastest shave I ever got, my skin feels tight, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the lime and bay rum scents, but this one is less masculine.</li>
            <li> I just mix with a tiny bit of water and use the lather right off the soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few variations on how much water and which brush I use, and I still cannot get a fantastic lather.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> You can use it right out of the plastic container and it holds together well, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Needs a bigger bowl or mug rather than the small wooden dish to get good lather.</li>
            <li> Double Edge Classic Blades, Badger Silver Hair Brush and Col. Conk&#x27;s Almond Glycerine Soap!</li>
            <li> These last a while.. so this is very affordable.</li>
            <li> The lather is nice and thick or you can thin it out to give better control when trying to shave around a mustache edge.  </li>
            <li> After the 20 seconds sit the bowl on the counter and let the soap cool down and it will harden and conform to the shape of the bowl.</li>
            <li> This could be due to its being new and used for the first time.</li>
            <li> I changed to a Double Edge Safety Razor that my Dad used and even purchased a Badger Hair Brush trying to get a decent shave but</li>
            <li> My new Shaving regiment now consist of my dad&#x27;s 50 year old Double Edge Razor, Wilkenson Sword</li>
            <li> After reading a few of the reviews on Shaving Soap, I tried the only Shave Soap available at my nearest Walgreens called Van Der Hagen for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> My razor and brush rinsed off so easily with no soap scum or residue that the Shaving Crèmes and Gels use to leave</li>
            <li> The rest are OK as shaving creams go, but are not great.</li>
            <li> If you shave your whole face you might want to try one of the other soaps for a longer lasting lather.</li>
            <li> The only other Conk I tried was Bay Rum, which I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of scent-wise, but it lathered equally as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, and thought I&#x27;d start of with the Almond soap from Col. Conk.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard (European decent) and \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and from the age of 45 to present, shaving has been a complete nightmare.</li>
            <li> At only a few dollars throw one on your next order or even if you need that small bump to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li> The lather of this soap didn&#x27;t last long enough to shave.  </li>
            <li> This simple glycerine soap does nearly everything that the high-priced triple-milled soaps do -- at about half the price.</li>
            <li> and like others have stated the lather does not last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is not some sort of miracle soap, and I definitely prefer to lather with this AND Shaving cream (I like the Poraso/Bigelow w/ menthol, but whatever is fine), because I feel as though no it provides a very thin coating when you apply it to your face</li>
            <li> And the puck lasts a long time</li>
            <li> The same with PTFE: it&#x27;s used as a non-stick coating for pans and other cookware.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the ingredient that keeps my skin from feeling dry --</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said it left my skin moist and didn&#x27;t lead to the dry skin other soaps have given me.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, I have just opened my second container of the almond, and have gone through a few other different soaps from Col. Conk.</li>
            <li> leave your skin feeling dry as a camels rear end!</li>
            <li> I have used Col. Conk&#x27;s regular Glycerine Shave Soap previously.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend them for anyone to at least try once, you may be pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard and sensitive skin, give the Almond Col Conks Glycerin Soap a try.</li>
            <li> It makes a good lather, but unfortunately it applies very thinly.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and was expecting a lot from this shave soap when I placed my order.  </li>
            <li> If that scent is not to your liking or appeals to you, try their other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s common for me to lather my entire face, and by the time I&#x27;ve finished shaving one side, the other has no lather on it at all.</li>
            <li> I used this after finishing the bad soap I originally bought from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> As I tend to shave rather quickly it is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I seem to always mess my face up when I shave, a little less with this but still looking for perfection.</li>
            <li> After using the Col. Conk Almond soap for a few years, I decided to try the Bay Rum soap.  </li>
            <li> everyday</li>
            <li> but i was not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> Col Conk Almond Shaving Soap has very little smell - which I like.  </li>
            <li> If you really soap up your stubble it isn&#x27;t to bad</li>
            <li> Not much more you can ask for.</li>
            <li> I bought the small one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I ordered the Almond Col Conks Glycerin Soap based on a review from &#x27;ALEX\\&quot; and his comparison of the ingredients, \\&quot;Glycerin, Almond Fragrance, Avocado Oil, Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I find if you mix it in a bowl it becomes to thin.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with this soap.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The quality of the soap is good.  The glycerin content is good and softens the whiskers (and skin).  The best part of this particular soap, though, is the scent.  I like it better than the famous Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> This simple glycerine soap does nearly everything that the high-priced triple-milled soaps do -- at about half the price. I&#x27;m always pleased at how thick and creamly it lathers up and the almond smell is very light and refreshing. Col. Conk is mild on the face and I&#x27;ve never felt any discomfort using it.    I believe this soap -- along with the Col. Conk amber and bay rum all include avocado oil. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the ingredient that keeps my skin from feeling dry -- but I like it.     Definitely an \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; soap that continues to preform well. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> A good product, very nice lather and very smooth shave.  The aroma is not over-powering.  The price is too high when compared to the shave and price the lower priced Van Der Hagen Luxury.</li>
            <li> After using the Col. Conk Almond soap for a few years, I decided to try the Bay Rum soap.  After completing an A-B-A test, the Bay Rum definitely lathers up better for some reason.  Both are good but I prefer the Bay Rum Col. Conk.</li>
            <li> This soap has a light, pleasant sent and produces a nice lather with little effort. The shave is smooth and free of irritation. This product will last through many, many shaves. Great performance and solid value.</li>
            <li> I used this soap tonight for the first time.  It did not lather up well, but I was using an ok brush so that might have something to do with it.  Got a decent shave out of it and did not irritate my face at all.  The scent is not overpowering at all.  Probably would not buy again though, go to ebay where there is much more selection for a better price.</li>
            <li> This is a very good soap at a very good price! Can&#x27;t beat it. Nice close shave with a nice scent and dosen&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry as a camels rear end!</li>
            <li> About the only thing I really liked about this product was that it smelled great. I have very sensitive skin and it just didn&#x27;t provide the necessary protection from razor burn that I would expect.</li>
            <li> A  pleasant smell, lathers well, and  feels good.  Not much more you can ask for.</li>
            <li> This shaving soap is sensitive to the skin, smells good and keeps you feeling fresh all day. Not to mention, inexpensive and will last a good number of shaves!</li>
            <li> My favorite of all the Conk soaps.  I&#x27;ve tried all but the amber and have to say that they are pretty good little performers.  I would recommend them for anyone to at least try once, you may be pleasantly surprised.  At only a few dollars throw one on your next order or even if you need that small bump to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li> the lather was great compared to Van Der Hagen but i was not a huge fan of the smell. my wife loved the smell of it though.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and quickly. I love the smell, putting up there along with my favorite soaps and creams. The only other Conk I tried was Bay Rum, which I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of scent-wise, but it lathered equally as well. I feel Col Conk is a great value considering the expense of many of the other soaps and creams out there I&#x27;ve tried (over 24). I&#x27;ll probably try more scents in the future when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Men do have their ritual and since they need to scrape their face daily (or sometimes weekly), they do need nice things and once they find a product they like, they stick with it. This is one of thoe items-- and the almond glycerine is lightly scented and is great for shaving. Someone here loves it.  He loves it so much he  bought more scents. These last a while.. so this is very affordable.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent for shave soap. It lathers up nicely and I get a real nice shave using it. The soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either, which is something I experienced with some much higher priced alternatives...</li>
            <li> Col. Conk is a staple of my morning shaving routine. The almond scent has a nice lather and a sweet smelling scent to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, and thought I&#x27;d start of with the Almond soap from Col. Conk. I was not disappointed! It has a very nice, subtle almond scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, and actually fades after a while. It gave me a much better shave than my canned, aerosol stuff, and it&#x27;s great knowing that it&#x27;s all completely natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a comparison, here&#x27;s the ingredient list for the Gillete Fusion Hydragel:&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients Water (Aqua/Eau); Palmitic Acid; Triethanolamine; Stearic Acid; Isopentane; Glyceryl Oleate; Glycerin; Isobutane; Sorbitol; Hydroxyethylcellulose; PTFE; Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange Peel) Oil; PEG-90M; Tocopheryl Acetate; PEG-23M; Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer; Citrus Medica Limonium (Lemon) Peel Oil; PVM/MA Copolymer; Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice; Citrus Aurantium (Lime) Oil + Inactive Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEG-90M...that alone scares me, but got completely freaked when I found that the Environment Canada Domestic Substance List states that this chemical is \\&quot;expected to be toxic or harmful\\&quot;. The same with PTFE: it&#x27;s used as a non-stick coating for pans and other cookware. Geez.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, here&#x27;s the ingredient list from Col. Conk&#x27;s Almond Glycerine Soap:&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin, Almond Fragrance, Avocado Oil, Vitamin E. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that list, there&#x27;s definitely no contest. Col. Conk comes out on top!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving soap.I have purchased this many times before. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and was expecting a lot from this shave soap when I placed my order.  It has exceeded all of those expectations!  The lather is nice and thick or you can thin it out to give better control when trying to shave around a mustache edge.  As other reviewers said it left my skin moist and didn&#x27;t lead to the dry skin other soaps have given me.</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF MAKES MY FACE FEEL SMOOTH AND SOFTENS BEARD EVEN WHEN I LET IT GO FOR A FEW DAYS</li>
            <li> Soap is pretty good, lather is great, rinses easily from my face and razor, but I&#x27;m not big on this smell. I love the lime and bay rum scents, but this one is less masculine.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, I have just opened my second container of the almond, and have gone through a few other different soaps from Col. Conk. While not an expert this stuff works very well, and has made switching from an electric razor a great experience.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Lime and Bay Rum fragrances.  The rest are OK as shaving creams go, but are not great.</li>
            <li> This is the best mug soap I have tried..excellent..would not go back to aerosol cans ever.</li>
            <li> Seriously! It smells great and leaves your skin soft, not dry. I&#x27;ve tried just about every scent this company puts out and this is #1! If you are a man, buy this for your face! If you are not a man, but this for your man&#x27;s face! If you are not a man and you don&#x27;t have a man, find a man... with a face... and buy this for his face!</li>
            <li> I have used Col. Conk&#x27;s regular Glycerine Shave Soap previously.  I consider the almond shave soap a great variation!&lt;br /&gt;First, Col. Conk&#x27;s shave soap products are great.  They are easily malleable  (via microwave of 20 seconds) to conform to one&#x27;s shaving soap cup/bowl.  They quickly provide a great lather; it soften one&#x27;s beard quickly &amp; leaves one&#x27;s skin feeling moisturized without feeling oily.  The scent is mild, it definitely is not overwhelming!&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend the almond shave soap.  If that scent is not to your liking or appeals to you, try their other products.</li>
            <li> This is a good, affordable product. I prefer the almond scent to any of the others, and it is also glycerine based, so it&#x27;s got that going for it. This is not some sort of miracle soap, and I definitely prefer to lather with this AND Shaving cream (I like the Poraso/Bigelow w/ menthol, but whatever is fine), because I feel as though no it provides a very thin coating when you apply it to your face (I use a badger brush). I tried using different amounts of water with it by soaking my brush and shaking out the water more and more until I found the amount that gave me the best lather, but It still is not enough, which is why I definitely prefer to lather up my brush with this, then with shaving cream, and then apply to my face. After I started doing that method is when I had the best, closest, shaves. Another good thing is that I feel like I have had this soap forever, and that it never runs out. You can use it right out of the plastic container and it holds together well, and lasts a long time. All around good product.</li>
            <li> Col Conk Almond Shaving Soap has very little smell - which I like.  Other soaps have a strong odor.  The soap develops lather easily.  The low price is the best part.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. The cent is not overbearing, the soap provides a nice lather, and the price was right. Its a great product.</li>
            <li> Not as nice on the skin as I had hoped</li>
            <li> When I bought this shave soap I was just getting into wetshaving, and so I was doing quite a bit of research and experimentation into the various products available. To this point I have been very satisfied with Col. Conk. This shave soap lathers up incredibly well and the unique almond smell leaves you smelling great afterwards, unlike other chemical-filled soaps and shaving gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> It was Ok. Was hoping to get more suds from the bar. This could be due to its being new and used for the first time. I also hoped there would be more Almond smell. Note: I bought the small one. I would like to use it again the evaluate a second time with more use.</li>
            <li> My first experience with this type of shaving and it has been a good one. This soap is light, smells good (like almond extract), and whips up into a nice lather with a little effort. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened it I was pleased.  It has a nice aroma, that isn&#x27;t over powering.  It lathers nice and hydrates the skin well.  And the puck lasts a long time (you only need a little bit to get a great lather).  I&#x27;m so impressed with this that I might try some other flavors.  And it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> This soap has a lovely almond scent that wears off fairly quickly. It makes a good lather, but unfortunately it applies very thinly. At first I thought this was just my lack of experience but I have read reviews that had similar issues. It&#x27;s common for me to lather my entire face, and by the time I&#x27;ve finished shaving one side, the other has no lather on it at all. I&#x27;ve tried a few variations on how much water and which brush I use, and I still cannot get a fantastic lather. I&#x27;ve learned to do one side of my face at a time, and it works out for me. One bar of this soap has lasted me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great soap to use for any manly shaver! Just make sure you keep track of your lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Quite pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;Thin lather</li>
            <li> Good soap- smells nice.  Needs a bigger bowl or mug rather than the small wooden dish to get good lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving since I&#x27;m 15 and have always dreaded the morning choir. I started out using a disposable razor and Barbasol Cream up until the age of 45 when I started to \\&quot;grey\\&quot; and experience breakouts and ingrown hairs. I have a very thick beard (European decent) and \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and from the age of 45 to present, shaving has been a complete nightmare. I changed to a Double Edge Safety Razor that my Dad used and even purchased a Badger Hair Brush trying to get a decent shave but the one one constant was the continued use of different Gels and Crèmes. After reading a few of the reviews on Shaving Soap, I tried the only Shave Soap available at my nearest Walgreens called Van Der Hagen for Sensitive Skin. I got a good Shave and figured I would stick with it a few weeks and see the results. In the mean time I ordered the Almond Col Conks Glycerin Soap based on a review from &#x27;ALEX\\&quot; and his comparison of the ingredients, \\&quot;Glycerin, Almond Fragrance, Avocado Oil, Vitamin E. That&#x27;s it.\\&quot; It was not only the fastest shave I ever got, my skin feels tight, clean and smooth. My razor and brush rinsed off so easily with no soap scum or residue that the Shaving Crèmes and Gels use to leave and I finally figured out that that was also left on my face probably causing the breakouts. My new Shaving regiment now consist of my dad&#x27;s 50 year old Double Edge Razor, Wilkenson Sword Double Edge Classic Blades, Badger Silver Hair Brush and Col. Conk&#x27;s Almond Glycerine Soap! If you have a thick beard and sensitive skin, give the Almond Col Conks Glycerin Soap a try. I purchased 3 Bucks for about $15 on Amazon...</li>
            <li> one of my favorite scents of shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Col. Conk soap has just the right amount of lather to it for a good coverage and shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; type, their products do not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;shave everyday and you&#x27;ll always feel keen!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This soap is quite pleasant to use. It does take a bit to get a good lather from the cup and like others have stated the lather does not last a very long time. As I tend to shave rather quickly it is not a problem for me. I prefer this scent over all the Col. Conk shave soaps so I think that is why I rate this one the highest. If you shave your whole face you might want to try one of the other soaps for a longer lasting lather.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years now and this is only like my fourth order. Not only do I like it, but it lasts a looong time. Sure beats buying some drugstore aerosol soap every month.</li>
            <li> My wife got this for me for Valentines day but I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredient of avocado as it closes my throat and I can not breathe.There should be  a warning about that on the package. Maybe my wife is trying to tell me something LOL. I didn&#x27;t even try it since I don&#x27;t want any problems. I will send it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews on this item that state the lather isn&#x27;t that great. I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re talking about. I just started shaving with a safety razor, brush and shave soap so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not doing everything perfectly but I have no problem with lather. This is my second soap tried - the first was the Van der Hagen that comes in the cheap Walmart kit. It was okay but really dried my face out. With the Col. Conk I get just a tingle of dryness at the end but overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The shave soap has a nice almond scent.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a plastic salsa bowl from my local big box store and dropped the soap puck into the salsa bowl and put it into the microwave for 20 seconds. Your melt time may vary depending on the wattage of your microwave. What this does for you is it melts the soap puck into the shape of the bowl so you don&#x27;t have to deal with a puck of soap sliding all over the place in the bowl. After the 20 seconds sit the bowl on the counter and let the soap cool down and it will harden and conform to the shape of the bowl. This makes working up a lather much easier.  It lathers up nicely and is a fairly slick soap. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with this soap. It didn&#x27;t have much of a scent and didn&#x27;t create a great lather. I suppose it was probably good in it&#x27;s day but better soaps have been created in recent years.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this and other soaps purchased to go with a shaving set gift this Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;The scents are not overpowering and the skin feels clean after use.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for shave soap, and it produces a nice lather.  I can&#x27;t go back to shave gels and creams.</li>
            <li> The lather of this soap didn&#x27;t last long enough to shave.  If you really soap up your stubble it isn&#x27;t to bad but you really need to work it so it doesn&#x27;t burn after you shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth and smells good.  I seem to always mess my face up when I shave, a little less with this but still looking for perfection.</li>
            <li> First time user of Col. Conk products and I found the ALMOND scent to be better than some of the more expensive soaps that I have tried. Next time I will be ordering the variety 4 pack.</li>
            <li> Love this soap it lathers different then most others I&#x27;ve used, I don&#x27;t use the my bowl I just mix with a tiny bit of water and use the lather right off the soap. I find if you mix it in a bowl it becomes to thin. I have had great results with my skin not being irritated after shaving I think it&#x27;s because the ingredients are better then most other soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. I used this after finishing the bad soap I originally bought from Walgreens. It smells great, Lathers perfectly and really helps me feel like I have the perfect shave. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
