            <li>Dr. Hauschka never disappoints - I just wish it was a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li>You can use any cream from Walmart that is better plus</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this hand cream and found it okay</li>
            <li>I like using the cream it soaks into your skin so much better than a lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is quite simply the best hand cream ever made.  </li>
            <li>I so wanted to love this -</li>
            <li>What a lovely product.  </li>
            <li>so you can easily squeeze every drop of goodness out.</li>
            <li>this cream applies and gets absorbed very easily.</li>
            <li>The lotion works ok, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The smell was fine, sort of like baby powder, reminds me of Johnson and Johnson products.</li>
            <li>Besides I found out, that I don&#x27;t have to use it ever day, but may be twice or 3 times a week to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>fabulous stuff - immediate relief for sore, cracked hands -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly with no oily residue</li>
            <li>The smell is light and not too much perfume.</li>
            <li>totally worth it</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is natural to the product (not perfumed) that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is the fact that with time, it does not loose</li>
            <li>and I can use my mouse and keyboard right away without wiping my hands first.</li>
            <li>Tried many different brands, and nothing worked for me.</li>
            <li>But thanks to Amazon, on can typically find it fairly discounted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a slightly herbal scent that makes this product feel special and authentic.</li>
            <li>I am very sensible and was looking for a cream with no smell since I get headaches yet</li>
            <li>It really protects the skin, my hands just soak it up.</li>
            <li>lotion absorbs fast without leaving a greasy oily feel.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I really like it&lt;br /&gt;esp at bedtime.</li>
            <li>It is a long skinny tube that fits in your purse or cosmetic bag easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effectiveness like so many other products that i have tried...</li>
            <li>I have tried even more expensive designer creams, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it keeps my hands nice and soft, absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Makes your hands so soft and supple, with carefully selected natural ingredients designed to support healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>so it seems very natural.</li>
            <li>However, my hands felt quite soft after just one use.</li>
            <li>It takes just a tiny amount, but leaves my hands very soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The tube is small enough to fit in your purse or you might want to keep it on your bedside table.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than other hand moisturizers, but I find that it is worth the extra money.</li>

            <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s only one that works for me for years. I have eczema on my hands, and just tend to dryness and sensitivity all the time. Tried many different brands, and nothing worked for me. Either creates a reaction or doesn&#x27;t moisturizes properly. This cream is not cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t take too much each time. Besides I found out, that I don&#x27;t have to use it ever day, but may be twice or 3 times a week to be comfortable. Less in Summer actually. It lasts me usually for 3-4 month each tube.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was at a Christmas party and the host had this product out for guests in the bathroom. I liked it so much I ordered it the next day! The fragrance is amazing, like I just walked into a spa! It&#x27;s a slightly herbal scent that makes this product feel special and authentic. It takes just a tiny amount, but leaves my hands very soft and refreshed. I was not previously a regular user of hand cream nor do I have very dry hands, but now using this product has become a little uplifting routine in my day.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to hand cream. I suffer from hand eczema and have found this cream to be the only hand lotion that calms and helps heal my dry, cracked red hands. Yes, it is expensive, but you get what you pay for. The smell is light and not too much perfume. Highly recommend. Dr. Hauschka products are amazing. Yes, expensive, but you are paying for high quality product that does not harm you with toxins, chemicals, etc.</li>
            <li> I was reading an article on beauty products that celebrities use and had to try it.  The lotion is not greasy, made my hands soft and smells wonderful.  It is a long skinny tube that fits in your purse or cosmetic bag easily.  The tube is flexible like a toothpaste tube so you can easily squeeze every drop of goodness out.</li>
            <li> Has reduced the wrinkles and lines on my hands 10X..LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff..my favorite hand cream</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream! I am very sensible and was looking for a cream with no smell since I get headaches yet something that works for my skin. this cream applies and gets absorbed very easily. Dr. Hauschka never disappoints - I just wish it was a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is the fact that with time, it does not loose it&#x27;s effectiveness like so many other products that i have tried...</li>
            <li> I read about this in US weekly as someone recommended.  The scent probably throws me off a bit.  It&#x27;s unique.  Some may like, but smells a little old lady to me. Not quite lavender but something a kin.  The lotion works ok, nothing special.  I prefer L&#x27;Occitane for scent and results.</li>
            <li> This cream is not worth the money. You can use any cream from Walmart that is better plus this has an offensive fragrance.</li>
            <li> fabulous stuff - immediate relief for sore, cracked hands - and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> My brother that is a Cancer survivor loves this! It sits on his night table for use everyday!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this hand cream and found it okay, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase but it wasn&#x27;t terrible. The smell was fine, sort of like baby powder, reminds me of Johnson and Johnson products. The problem for me is the oily and sticky feeling that it left on my hands, which lasted quite a while after use. However, my hands felt quite soft after just one use.</li>
            <li> nice texture, great smell.  totally worth it</li>
            <li> I like using the cream it soaks into your skin so much better than a lotion.  I don&#x27;t like lotions because of all the alcohol in them.  This cream aids winter cracking skin.  I use it at night when I get a chance to keep it on longer periods at a time....thank you Dr. Hauschka.</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the best hand cream ever made.  Expensive, but worth it.  It really protects the skin, my hands just soak it up. No left-over greasiness. Lovely rose scent. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s hand cream is soothing and deeply moisturizing. After a few days of using it I noticed my hands were looking younger and softer. This cream absorbs fast and is not greasy or heavy in any way. The fragrance in the cream seems based on essential oils so it seems very natural. This cream is fairly expensive but is a fun luxury. The tube is small enough to fit in your purse or you might want to keep it on your bedside table. If you put it on before bed you may find the scent of the essential oils relaxes you a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this - it keeps my hands nice and soft, absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way. But it has a very strong herbal scent to it and the scent lingers. If they could add lavender or something this would be great, but as it is right now, I won&#x27;t be buying this again. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, this product is great. Also, don&#x27;t be shocked but its an off white/tan color... Not white. So don&#x27;t think the product is &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; due to the color of the cream.</li>
            <li> My hands are always dry even in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion absorbs fast without leaving a greasy oily feel.&lt;br /&gt;Also like the size that allows me to put it in my bag.</li>
            <li> I have used this hand cream for years. It is more expensive than other hand moisturizers, but I find that it is worth the extra money. It absorbs quickly with no oily residue and I can use my mouse and keyboard right away without wiping my hands first. It has a light scent that is natural to the product (not perfumed) that dissipates quickly. I also like the aluminum tube. I have tried even more expensive designer creams, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff - that my wife turned me on to.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that the product is so costly. But thanks to Amazon, on can typically find it fairly discounted.</li>
            <li> I read where someone keeps this by their bedside and had a grandmother who used it for years.  I really like it&lt;br /&gt;esp at bedtime.</li>
            <li> What a lovely product.  Makes your hands so soft and supple, with carefully selected natural ingredients designed to support healthy skin.  Dr. Hauschka is truly the best of the best!</li>
