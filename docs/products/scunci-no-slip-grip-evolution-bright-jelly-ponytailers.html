            <li>These are great!</li>
            <li>Really excellent product.</li>
            <li>It used to take me up to an hour to make the perfect bun before it fell out, but these make putting my hair up a breeze.</li>
            <li>Happy shopping!</li>
            <li>i was really impressed.</li>
            <li>Even the best cloth bands slip or loosen eventually.</li>
            <li>This tie is PERFECT for my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is the best on the market.</li>

            <li>B003DKO83E Scunci No-slip Grip Evolution Bright Jelly Ponytailers (Pack of 14)]]</li>
            <li>Having a good routine for your hair will help with its body sleekness and shine, which in turn will help keep your hair from being pulled when you tie it up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With these, I just loop twice and they are good to go.</li>
            <li>However, if you want a \\&quot;set it and forget\\&quot; it type of ponytailer, I think these are about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>which is good, because that&#x27;s when a couple of these started breaking on me.</li>
            <li>It hold well even when I am doing sports, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I will never use these on their hair again, and we&#x27;ve given them a fair try.  </li>
            <li>These things hurt trying to get out, and I lost a good bit of hair.</li>
            <li>This resulted in a good amount of stretch on the hairband.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be a good alternative to those that slip out.</li>
            <li>Great scrunches, that are able to hold hair in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These ties are not for everyone but the people they are for will love them!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best ponytail holders.  </li>
            <li>Tried these from a friend and just had to have my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These ponytail holders are really one of the best for holding power.</li>
            <li>Quick ship great price very pleased with purchase and seller.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t worth it!!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these awesome hair ties to anyone.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea for a hair tie plus there is a great variety of colors I preferably like the clear ones as well as the assorted colored ones to match any color of outfit you are wearing.</li>
            <li>Love love these!</li>
            <li>Also I use good quality product in my hair, to keep it smooth as I mentioned: I use argan oil, sometimes some \\&quot;Tigi Catwalk Your Highness Thickening Gel</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every hair band under the sun and these are by far the best in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>But, they do make cute bracelets for the kids - remember the jelly kind we used to wear growing up?</li>
            <li>Would of liked to be able to select what I wanted</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and these scrunchies stay in.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen the opaque ones, but I bought the super bright ones and my girls LOVE those.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many hair ties throughout my life.</li>
            <li>Creme\\&quot; - my favorite gel of all time - and</li>
            <li>With these ties I have no such problem because of their excellent hold.</li>
            <li>love these ponytailers.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more, but from a store instead of Amazon</li>
            <li>No slip - ok, sure I buy that.</li>
            <li>in all, I love these.</li>
            <li>I love these hair tides, however the company changed</li>
            <li>They also never lose that tightness like most hair ties eventually do</li>
            <li>I purchased a 14 pack of these hair ties to use at the gym, hoping they would hold my ponytail in better when I work out.</li>
            <li>The Goody brand hair ties that are fabric with rubber strips are way better and don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I love these hair ties.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times i had the elastic snap, leading up to the cloth stretching on my hair ties.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same ones going on two years and they are still perfect.</li>
            <li>I am highly impressed with them and came back to get more.</li>
            <li>one sentence: this product is nothing better than a chunkier rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one sentence: this product is nothing better than a chunkier rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They stay in, and I love them</li>
            <li>My favorite</li>
            <li>I think they stay in place better.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see them on amazon.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money; you can re-use over and over again!!</li>
            <li>For PERFORMANCE: I give these a full five stars!  </li>
            <li>Love these but thought they would be clear and they are brightly colored ones...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked them so much I picked up two more packs today to have extras.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>strong grip, but does not tangle with hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>The non-jelly ones have always been fine.  </li>
            <li>I know the fine print says the colors may vary on these</li>
            <li>The ties are great as they do not slip easily; now, if only they could have an on and off switch</li>
            <li>A huge chunk of her hair stuck to them</li>
            <li>They are grippy and great for my hair, especially at the gym.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth which helps, and when I tie it up</li>
            <li>It was such a great product</li>
            <li>They hold the hair securely and do not break the hair.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for the clear but got some brightly colored ones.  </li>
            <li>These are also higher quality than the Goody ones, which I have found stretch out and break much more easily.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made of a smooth, kind of powdery-feeling rubber, so they don&#x27;t snag hair like those old \\&quot;no-slip\\&quot; hair ties with the rubber stripes, but they still don&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li>No, they don&#x27;t pull out of hair super smoothly</li>
            <li>These held up great in the pool as well as out and about on dry land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only issue I have is that the grip is so good that when I try to remove it, sometimes it pulls out hair with it.</li>
            <li>These are the best, for thick or for thinner/finer hair.  </li>
            <li>These are my absolute favorite hair ties now.</li>
            <li>so I would suggest untying them to spare as much hair as you can :)  </li>
            <li>You might still lose a hair or two, but, not bad.</li>
            <li>main drawback of these is that, while they are easy to put in, they don&#x27;t slip out easily because of their rubbery texture.</li>
            <li>These are seriously the best hair bands I have ever used.</li>
            <li>These are a huge waste of money - they stay put great, but prepare to lose a chunk of hair every time you try to pull one of these out of your hair.</li>
            <li>If you do not remember jelly sandals, you can liken the product to a super bounce ball.</li>
            <li>When an ad/package says no slip 1 would expect it to be exactly that!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To put it bluntly, these bands do a great job of keeping your ponytail tight and in place.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer indicates that these bands are \\&quot;jelly\\&quot;, and to a certain extent this is an accurate name.</li>
            <li>I am seriously better off with the regular hair ties that stretch quickly, snap and when used tangle in your hair!</li>
            <li>I just placed an order of like 15 more packs of these; I&#x27;ll never use another kind of hair tie as long as I live!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a rare occasion where I&#x27;m wearing a magenta shirt.</li>
            <li>Well as much as I would have liked the clear ones (as pictured)</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t kid-like, but they are fun and flirty.</li>
            <li>These are worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t remove them the right way you will rip out your hair</li>
            <li>I received the multicolored pack and used one right away.  </li>
            <li>They hold my hair in place like no other and don&#x27;t budge at all, even during the most strenuous workouts or bumpiest jogs.</li>
            <li>The colors that arrived were bright pinks and purples that, literally, glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li>This are my favorite kind of  hair ties because they never snag my hair and are very tight!</li>
            <li>Today I picked up the colored ones (but not super bright like the picture</li>
            <li>so I gave her one, since I have a whole pack rarely in use.</li>
            <li>First when i bought them, i dint like them.</li>
            <li>These ponytail holders started making me like my hair :)  Only think is with the color options .. but im forgiving that..</li>
            <li>far as how they work - they&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li>The only downfall to these is that they can&#x27;t just be slid or rolled off your ponytail like most ties, as they will pull and tangle in your hair.</li>
            <li>i first bought this product at Walgreens for the first</li>
            <li>What I received was a bunch of colored hair ties - fit for a 10 year old not for a grown woman.  </li>
            <li>Pretty fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>, the durability of these bands is mediocre, at best.</li>
            <li>When I went to adjust the band after looping it, I pulled it out just a bit to snug it up to the first loop in my ponytail and it just snapped.</li>
            <li>That being said, with the amount that these cost and that most hairbands can survive this standard adjustment with no problems results in this is the first strike against Sc&amp;uuml;nci&#x27;s The Evolution product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort</li>
            <li>They may be innovative, but they will also rip out enough hair to build a wig with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They may be innovative, but they will also rip out enough hair to build a wig with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so well-I absolutely love them-they never slip, never break and they last forever!!!</li>
            <li>I like the pretty colors that they come.</li>
            <li>after using these I had to get my hair layered because it broke off so much hair!</li>
            <li>(I have light hair and wanted it to blend in) but they came in multiple bold colors.</li>
            <li>Evolution does have a slightly tacky feel to it and, should you get any dust or dirt on the band, a quick trip through a faucet and light rubbing will clean it off.</li>
            <li>Also, as a blonde it is nice to have the clear colors</li>
            <li>If you want a good hair elastic, stick to a different scunci product like the flat, fabric covered elastics.</li>
            <li>If I use regular hair ties I always have to use more than one tie (3-5 ties depending on my activities) because I like to tie my hair high.</li>
            <li>I love how they go back to their normal shape after you take them out.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for my 2 ft long THICK straight hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely not for fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li>you have lots of fine hair this will damage your hair, stick to regular hair bands, might also tangle in curly hair.</li>
            <li>These really hold your hair in place, which is awesome if you need to keep long hair back and in place while active.</li>
            <li>With other hair ties, I have to loop them around my ponytail 3 times for a secure hold, which causes them to stretch out quickly or snap.</li>
            <li>These are very sturdy; my son wears them on his wrists because regular gummy bracelets are always huge.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, I really like these.</li>
            <li>These really are no-slip, so I&#x27;ve never had a problem like that with these.</li>
            <li>These do their job but they really pull your hair.  </li>
            <li>so I could remove them without much</li>
            <li>They really keep the hair up - bun, braid, ponytail.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stretch out, they don&#x27;t move unless you want them to, and they are very stretchy and durable.</li>
            <li>I used this and when I went to take them out she cried so much.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to try the jelly to see how I like them.</li>
            <li>I also use these to do a fast up-do for a fancy evening out...</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, they really REALLY rip at your hair when trying to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every time I tried to use one, when you remove it, no matter how gently, it breaks off and pulls out tons of hair.</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it says &amp;#34;no damage&amp;#34; to your hair, but it really demaged mine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair, but what I do have is sleek and slippery.  </li>
            <li>However, I feel that on my hair it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; as much as a rubber band</li>
            <li>I can gently roll it off, or I&#x27;ll just twist off each loop (like tying your hair in reverse).  </li>
            <li>yeah - when removing the bands, you can&#x27;t just take the whole thing and pull it out or it WILL pull some hair out.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so resilient and grip your hair very well.</li>
            <li>I actually still have some from my old pack, but I got more when the semester started just in case.</li>
            <li>If you are old enough to remember the 1980&#x27;s, they bring to mind a softer, more elastic version of the material used to make jelly sandals.</li>
            <li>Most elastic hairbands are not tight enough to hold my hair all together.</li>
            <li>The cons are not worth it if regular hair ties work just as well, unless you just really like the bright gel colors.</li>
            <li>also more durable than those other fabric elastics</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really pull them out like the older style ones</li>
            <li>you have lots of hair and have trouble finding hair ties that stay strong, or use many hair ties, I definitely recommend these hair ties as the ones for you.</li>
            <li>I used the black ones by scunci, but they&#x27;re only good for one use before they expand then eventually break.</li>
            <li>, these are amazing and well worth the pain of removal (and loss of a few extra hairs) when you need a high-performance hair holder...</li>
            <li>I bought these at Walgreens near my apartment and  saw them when they first came out and decided to try them out.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that is very straight and smooth and most regular hair ties</li>
            <li>I do love having luscious wild locks, but using normal ties just 1) would stretch out, leaving my hair loose and looking frizzy or 2)</li>
            <li>I have heavy thick hair, these are perfect for me</li>
            <li>I am careful to make sure to pull ALL the hair through and clear of band interference.</li>
            <li>They hold their shape pretty well and don&#x27;t get too terribly stretched out...which is rare with ponytail holders.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last long either, because those letters are on them, they rip easily!</li>
            <li>In fact, I feel like that rubbery gelly type texture snags more than their normal black ones.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Evolution hair band has only one positive: it does stay in place and keep your ponytail as you first styled it.</li>
            <li>The Evolution hair band has only one positive: it does stay in place and keep your ponytail as you first styled it.</li>
            <li>I received the clear ones, I really hoped for some colors instead.</li>
            <li>Yes I still break them occasionally, they are not indestructible, but these work and stay secure ALL DAY LONG (another first).</li>
            <li>but I really needed to clear ones that are pictures and not the neon ones I got.</li>
            <li>(though I can&#x27;t give a real testimonial about the longest time I&#x27;ve ever had one individual tie without stretching or breaking because I tend to either lose them first or my cats steal them).</li>
            <li>I feel like the telephone hair ties are more gentle than this, but I am not sure about the hold for those.</li>
            <li>AND they last so much longer than non-jelly hair ties, plus the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>Now, to be clear, this only happened once, and it had more to do with me pulling it up to straighten the band as opposed to the initial use.</li>
            <li>If I could choose, I would certainly give it the full 5 due to functionality as well as style.</li>
            <li>Not only do they rip faster(specifically right by the logo) and it also NOW pulls my hair when ever i take them off.</li>
            <li>Took them home, tried them out, took them right back for a refund.</li>
            <li>I thought I would see if I could find any new non-slip hair ties.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for clear bands but ended up with bright colors (purple, teal, pink, black).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these hair ties for at least four years now and they are my absolute FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>The grip is so good that I have to be careful putting them on and taking them off, because they sometimes catch my hair and break a few strands.</li>
            <li>They have a very soft feel, but I still debated on getting them since they were &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>: 1) how fat your fingers are and, 2) that you do not stretch them very far.</li>
            <li>More durable  and  very  little  hair  </li>
            <li>But, They don&#x27;t come clear as shown in the picture which i wished for!</li>
            <li>This is not only damaging to hair but also really HURTS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different brands that claim to be no-slip, but these really do what they are labeled!</li>
            <li>If you are willing to take the risk and don&#x27;t care what they look like, this is a terrific product.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;DD1 - straight silky long hair, not thin or think</li>
            <li>The material used is the kind often used for sticky pads; the pads that they usually sell in office supply stores that have a rubberized back to stick on your dashboard.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have very straight and slick hair; most hair ties I&#x27;ve used have to be either very tight, grippy, or both to hold on, otherwise my ponytails will droop and start flopping around pretty</li>
            <li>I have very thick, wavy hair and these work amazing.</li>
            <li>So they show a picture of clear bands, and I get the UGLIEST colors you can imagine.  </li>
            <li>The picture is of all clear.</li>
            <li>The item pictured had clear ponytail holders, which is what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>Might as well use a regular old rubber band with how much hair it pulls out.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would be clear</li>
            <li>I did not notice this and thought I was getting what is pictured, CLEAR.</li>
            <li>These bands are constructed of a soft rubber-type material and are much thicker than your standard scrunchie.</li>
            <li>I got the clear ones somewhere else.</li>
            <li>Well I thought I was ordering the clear ponytail holders....</li>
            <li>They do not have much \\&quot;give\\&quot; and could possibly snap before you pull it over your hair.</li>
            <li>They do not have much \\&quot;give\\&quot; and could possibly snap before you pull it over your hair.</li>
            <li>I have a bazillion pony tail holders for myself and my 5 year old girls.  </li>
            <li>I can understand why some people would say these rip their hair, but as long as you are careful putting it up you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I am used to most other brands of scrunchies just sliding down my hair smoothly with little snagging.</li>
            <li>The band itself goes on easily with no twist needed, but using your fingers (especially if you have a cut on the finger tip, like I did) results in the band squeezing rather tightly until you feed it over your ponytail.</li>
            <li>BUT, I&#x27;ve noticed that when I&#x27;m running or moving quickly, these will slip slightly and I&#x27;ll have to tighten the ponytail.</li>
            <li>As anyone with long hair knows, using certain types of material to tie up your hair can result in pulling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these, they are the only hair bands I buy (for years now!).</li>
            <li>And I like to wear a high ponytail vs. a low one</li>
            <li>/&gt;Background on our hair:&lt;br /&gt;Me - long fine hair, straight yet \\&quot;kinky\\&quot;, not thin or thick volume - in the middle</li>
            <li>This means less adjusting your hair and more work/time for other things.</li>
            <li>This means less adjusting your hair and more work/time for other things.</li>
            <li>I love scunci products, and these do stay in your hair fairly well, but when I would take them out it would roll my hair up around the elastic and tangle it horribly.  </li>
            <li>Such staying power does mean that these hair ties have a hard time wanting to leave your hair, however - so once again, if you don&#x27;t like just a little pinch of pain, either be prepared to suck it up, or find a wussier, less fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to lose hair ties, especially for me, so I end up having to buy more every six months anyway...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still the best ties for me, and I am really tough on my stuff, so the fact that only three bands have broken on me thus far is a miracle (I also tried to melt one, so it&#x27;s no wonder</li>
            <li>I will never buy any other hair band as long as these are on the market, and that&#x27;s saying a lot for me because I&#x27;m not typically brand loyal</li>
            <li>I finally pulled out to try and snap the scrunchie and it popped remarkably quickly; meaning, it took less force</li>
            <li>I finally pulled out to try and snap the scrunchie and it popped remarkably quickly; meaning, it took less force</li>
            <li>I like the clear color idea because I am blonde, but I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>they break just as frequently as the regular bands.  </li>
            <li>She has more thin and wavy hair</li>
            <li>set (assorted colors)... which is frustrating considering I paid more to get the opaque set over the assorted color set.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these hair bands, I have thick, Asian hair and these are the only hair bands that keeps it in place.</li>
            <li>I have lots of thick, long, strong hair (I am Asian), and using normal elastic hair ties</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of other rubber bands and they all slip out of place after a while.&lt;br /&gt;However, they really hurt when you take them out, no matter how careful or gentle I am.</li>
            <li>I wore one when running my first half marathon (no ponytail tugging) and always wear them when I paint</li>
            <li>I got one all clear, one blacks/browns, one light rainbow (pinks, purples, blues), and one dark colors (green, turqoise).  </li>
            <li>They are more elastic so they break less often than regular hair ties (often while trying to make another round the elastics snap in my hand), and can stay tighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t fly out and slap my hand (or someone near me), but it was rather annoying having to pick it out of my hair.</li>
            <li>This was tedious, but ultimately proved effective.</li>
            <li>For medium to fine hair, a single twist is usually sufficient.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I would recommend every woman who uses ties to at least try these, if you don&#x27;t like them there are many other types out there -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing the same one every day for two weeks, and it still feels new-- traditional hair ties tend to loosen up significantly after a few days of use (I typically do 3 twists), and I usually have to bust out a fresh one after a month or</li>
            <li>Couple this with the fact that my hair is very thick, very straight and very silken</li>
            <li>High ponytails have always been a problem for me because regular hair ties slip down, creating a low ponytail and loose bangs which really get in the way of my vision.</li>
            <li>I highly  recommend these to other Heavenly Handspinning Vespera owners.</li>
            <li>Hell for that matter a rubber band would be more suitable than these pieces of crap!    </li>
            <li>(you need to carefully remove it from hair) but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a secure ponytail, even through working out/running.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is because my hair is super long, but I had to stop using them.</li>
            <li>Good and bad.</li>
            <li>I expected  the clear when I ordered  but got colored  if I had known</li>

            <li> These are great!</li>
            <li> Really excellent product.</li>
            <li> It used to take me up to an hour to make the perfect bun before it fell out, but these make putting my hair up a breeze.</li>
            <li> Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> i was really impressed.</li>
            <li> Even the best cloth bands slip or loosen eventually.</li>
            <li> This tie is PERFECT for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I picked these up thinking that they would be the best hairbands ever....</li>
            <li> work very good!</li>
            <li> and they work GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best hair ties ever.</li>
            <li> these are the best.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very happy with what was sent.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE HAIR BANDS!!!!</li>
            <li> These things are AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!!!</li>
            <li> i was so happy.</li>
            <li> However, they make great &amp;#34;broccoli band&#x27; style &amp;#34;wallets&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These hair ties are great.  </li>
            <li> These are great</li>
            <li> These are amazing!</li>
            <li> B003DKO83E Scunci No-slip Grip Evolution Bright Jelly Ponytailers (Pack of 14)]]</li>
            <li> Having a good routine for your hair will help with its body sleekness and shine, which in turn will help keep your hair from being pulled when you tie it up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With these, I just loop twice and they are good to go.</li>
            <li> However, if you want a \\&quot;set it and forget\\&quot; it type of ponytailer, I think these are about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> which is good, because that&#x27;s when a couple of these started breaking on me.</li>
            <li> It hold well even when I am doing sports, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I will never use these on their hair again, and we&#x27;ve given them a fair try.  </li>
            <li> These things hurt trying to get out, and I lost a good bit of hair.</li>
            <li> This resulted in a good amount of stretch on the hairband.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be a good alternative to those that slip out.</li>
            <li> Great scrunches, that are able to hold hair in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These ties are not for everyone but the people they are for will love them!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best ponytail holders.  </li>
            <li> Tried these from a friend and just had to have my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These ponytail holders are really one of the best for holding power.</li>
            <li> Quick ship great price very pleased with purchase and seller.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these awesome hair ties to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea for a hair tie plus there is a great variety of colors I preferably like the clear ones as well as the assorted colored ones to match any color of outfit you are wearing.</li>
            <li> Love love these!</li>
            <li> Also I use good quality product in my hair, to keep it smooth as I mentioned: I use argan oil, sometimes some \\&quot;Tigi Catwalk Your Highness Thickening Gel</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every hair band under the sun and these are by far the best in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> But, they do make cute bracelets for the kids - remember the jelly kind we used to wear growing up?</li>
            <li> Would of liked to be able to select what I wanted</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and these scrunchies stay in.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen the opaque ones, but I bought the super bright ones and my girls LOVE those.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many hair ties throughout my life.</li>
            <li> Creme\\&quot; - my favorite gel of all time - and</li>
            <li> With these ties I have no such problem because of their excellent hold.</li>
            <li> love these ponytailers.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more, but from a store instead of Amazon</li>
            <li> No slip - ok, sure I buy that.</li>
            <li> in all, I love these.</li>
            <li> I love these hair tides, however the company changed</li>
            <li> They also never lose that tightness like most hair ties eventually do</li>
            <li> I purchased a 14 pack of these hair ties to use at the gym, hoping they would hold my ponytail in better when I work out.</li>
            <li> The Goody brand hair ties that are fabric with rubber strips are way better and don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I love these hair ties.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times i had the elastic snap, leading up to the cloth stretching on my hair ties.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same ones going on two years and they are still perfect.</li>
            <li> I am highly impressed with them and came back to get more.</li>
            <li> one sentence: this product is nothing better than a chunkier rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one sentence: this product is nothing better than a chunkier rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They stay in, and I love them</li>
            <li> My favorite</li>
            <li> I think they stay in place better.  </li>
            <li> Glad to see them on amazon.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money; you can re-use over and over again!!</li>
            <li> For PERFORMANCE: I give these a full five stars!  </li>
            <li> Love these but thought they would be clear and they are brightly colored ones...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked them so much I picked up two more packs today to have extras.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> strong grip, but does not tangle with hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> The non-jelly ones have always been fine.  </li>
            <li> I know the fine print says the colors may vary on these</li>
            <li> The ties are great as they do not slip easily; now, if only they could have an on and off switch</li>
            <li> A huge chunk of her hair stuck to them</li>
            <li> They are grippy and great for my hair, especially at the gym.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth which helps, and when I tie it up</li>
            <li> It was such a great product</li>
            <li> They hold the hair securely and do not break the hair.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for the clear but got some brightly colored ones.  </li>
            <li> These are also higher quality than the Goody ones, which I have found stretch out and break much more easily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of a smooth, kind of powdery-feeling rubber, so they don&#x27;t snag hair like those old \\&quot;no-slip\\&quot; hair ties with the rubber stripes, but they still don&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> No, they don&#x27;t pull out of hair super smoothly</li>
            <li> These held up great in the pool as well as out and about on dry land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only issue I have is that the grip is so good that when I try to remove it, sometimes it pulls out hair with it.</li>
            <li> These are the best, for thick or for thinner/finer hair.  </li>
            <li> These are my absolute favorite hair ties now.</li>
            <li> so I would suggest untying them to spare as much hair as you can :)  </li>
            <li> You might still lose a hair or two, but, not bad.</li>
            <li> main drawback of these is that, while they are easy to put in, they don&#x27;t slip out easily because of their rubbery texture.</li>
            <li> These are seriously the best hair bands I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These are a huge waste of money - they stay put great, but prepare to lose a chunk of hair every time you try to pull one of these out of your hair.</li>
            <li> If you do not remember jelly sandals, you can liken the product to a super bounce ball.</li>
            <li> When an ad/package says no slip 1 would expect it to be exactly that!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To put it bluntly, these bands do a great job of keeping your ponytail tight and in place.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer indicates that these bands are \\&quot;jelly\\&quot;, and to a certain extent this is an accurate name.</li>
            <li> I am seriously better off with the regular hair ties that stretch quickly, snap and when used tangle in your hair!</li>
            <li> I just placed an order of like 15 more packs of these; I&#x27;ll never use another kind of hair tie as long as I live!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a rare occasion where I&#x27;m wearing a magenta shirt.</li>
            <li> Well as much as I would have liked the clear ones (as pictured)</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t kid-like, but they are fun and flirty.</li>
            <li> These are worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t remove them the right way you will rip out your hair</li>
            <li> I received the multicolored pack and used one right away.  </li>
            <li> They hold my hair in place like no other and don&#x27;t budge at all, even during the most strenuous workouts or bumpiest jogs.</li>
            <li> The colors that arrived were bright pinks and purples that, literally, glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li> This are my favorite kind of  hair ties because they never snag my hair and are very tight!</li>
            <li> Today I picked up the colored ones (but not super bright like the picture</li>
            <li> so I gave her one, since I have a whole pack rarely in use.</li>
            <li> First when i bought them, i dint like them.</li>
            <li> These ponytail holders started making me like my hair :)  Only think is with the color options .. but im forgiving that..</li>
            <li> far as how they work - they&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li> The only downfall to these is that they can&#x27;t just be slid or rolled off your ponytail like most ties, as they will pull and tangle in your hair.</li>
            <li> i first bought this product at Walgreens for the first</li>
            <li> What I received was a bunch of colored hair ties - fit for a 10 year old not for a grown woman.  </li>
            <li> Pretty fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> , the durability of these bands is mediocre, at best.</li>
            <li> When I went to adjust the band after looping it, I pulled it out just a bit to snug it up to the first loop in my ponytail and it just snapped.</li>
            <li> That being said, with the amount that these cost and that most hairbands can survive this standard adjustment with no problems results in this is the first strike against Sc&amp;uuml;nci&#x27;s The Evolution product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort</li>
            <li> They may be innovative, but they will also rip out enough hair to build a wig with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They may be innovative, but they will also rip out enough hair to build a wig with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so well-I absolutely love them-they never slip, never break and they last forever!!!</li>
            <li> I like the pretty colors that they come.</li>
            <li> after using these I had to get my hair layered because it broke off so much hair!</li>
            <li> (I have light hair and wanted it to blend in) but they came in multiple bold colors.</li>
            <li> Evolution does have a slightly tacky feel to it and, should you get any dust or dirt on the band, a quick trip through a faucet and light rubbing will clean it off.</li>
            <li> Also, as a blonde it is nice to have the clear colors</li>
            <li> If you want a good hair elastic, stick to a different scunci product like the flat, fabric covered elastics.</li>
            <li> If I use regular hair ties I always have to use more than one tie (3-5 ties depending on my activities) because I like to tie my hair high.</li>
            <li> I love how they go back to their normal shape after you take them out.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my 2 ft long THICK straight hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely not for fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li> you have lots of fine hair this will damage your hair, stick to regular hair bands, might also tangle in curly hair.</li>
            <li> These really hold your hair in place, which is awesome if you need to keep long hair back and in place while active.</li>
            <li> With other hair ties, I have to loop them around my ponytail 3 times for a secure hold, which causes them to stretch out quickly or snap.</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy; my son wears them on his wrists because regular gummy bracelets are always huge.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, I really like these.</li>
            <li> These really are no-slip, so I&#x27;ve never had a problem like that with these.</li>
            <li> These do their job but they really pull your hair.  </li>
            <li> so I could remove them without much</li>
            <li> They really keep the hair up - bun, braid, ponytail.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stretch out, they don&#x27;t move unless you want them to, and they are very stretchy and durable.</li>
            <li> I used this and when I went to take them out she cried so much.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to try the jelly to see how I like them.</li>
            <li> I also use these to do a fast up-do for a fancy evening out...</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, they really REALLY rip at your hair when trying to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every time I tried to use one, when you remove it, no matter how gently, it breaks off and pulls out tons of hair.</li>
            <li> really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it says &amp;#34;no damage&amp;#34; to your hair, but it really demaged mine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hair, but what I do have is sleek and slippery.  </li>
            <li> However, I feel that on my hair it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; as much as a rubber band</li>
            <li> I can gently roll it off, or I&#x27;ll just twist off each loop (like tying your hair in reverse).  </li>
            <li> yeah - when removing the bands, you can&#x27;t just take the whole thing and pull it out or it WILL pull some hair out.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so resilient and grip your hair very well.</li>
            <li> I actually still have some from my old pack, but I got more when the semester started just in case.</li>
            <li> If you are old enough to remember the 1980&#x27;s, they bring to mind a softer, more elastic version of the material used to make jelly sandals.</li>
            <li> Most elastic hairbands are not tight enough to hold my hair all together.</li>
            <li> The cons are not worth it if regular hair ties work just as well, unless you just really like the bright gel colors.</li>
            <li> also more durable than those other fabric elastics</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really pull them out like the older style ones</li>
            <li> you have lots of hair and have trouble finding hair ties that stay strong, or use many hair ties, I definitely recommend these hair ties as the ones for you.</li>
            <li> I used the black ones by scunci, but they&#x27;re only good for one use before they expand then eventually break.</li>
            <li> , these are amazing and well worth the pain of removal (and loss of a few extra hairs) when you need a high-performance hair holder...</li>
            <li> I bought these at Walgreens near my apartment and  saw them when they first came out and decided to try them out.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is very straight and smooth and most regular hair ties</li>
            <li> I do love having luscious wild locks, but using normal ties just 1) would stretch out, leaving my hair loose and looking frizzy or 2)</li>
            <li> I have heavy thick hair, these are perfect for me</li>
            <li> I am careful to make sure to pull ALL the hair through and clear of band interference.</li>
            <li> They hold their shape pretty well and don&#x27;t get too terribly stretched out...which is rare with ponytail holders.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long either, because those letters are on them, they rip easily!</li>
            <li> In fact, I feel like that rubbery gelly type texture snags more than their normal black ones.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Evolution hair band has only one positive: it does stay in place and keep your ponytail as you first styled it.</li>
            <li> The Evolution hair band has only one positive: it does stay in place and keep your ponytail as you first styled it.</li>
            <li> I received the clear ones, I really hoped for some colors instead.</li>
            <li> Yes I still break them occasionally, they are not indestructible, but these work and stay secure ALL DAY LONG (another first).</li>
            <li> but I really needed to clear ones that are pictures and not the neon ones I got.</li>
            <li> (though I can&#x27;t give a real testimonial about the longest time I&#x27;ve ever had one individual tie without stretching or breaking because I tend to either lose them first or my cats steal them).</li>
            <li> I feel like the telephone hair ties are more gentle than this, but I am not sure about the hold for those.</li>
            <li> AND they last so much longer than non-jelly hair ties, plus the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> Now, to be clear, this only happened once, and it had more to do with me pulling it up to straighten the band as opposed to the initial use.</li>
            <li> If I could choose, I would certainly give it the full 5 due to functionality as well as style.</li>
            <li> Not only do they rip faster(specifically right by the logo) and it also NOW pulls my hair when ever i take them off.</li>
            <li> Took them home, tried them out, took them right back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I thought I would see if I could find any new non-slip hair ties.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for clear bands but ended up with bright colors (purple, teal, pink, black).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these hair ties for at least four years now and they are my absolute FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> The grip is so good that I have to be careful putting them on and taking them off, because they sometimes catch my hair and break a few strands.</li>
            <li> They have a very soft feel, but I still debated on getting them since they were &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> : 1) how fat your fingers are and, 2) that you do not stretch them very far.</li>
            <li> More durable  and  very  little  hair  </li>
            <li> But, They don&#x27;t come clear as shown in the picture which i wished for!</li>
            <li> This is not only damaging to hair but also really HURTS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands that claim to be no-slip, but these really do what they are labeled!</li>
            <li> If you are willing to take the risk and don&#x27;t care what they look like, this is a terrific product.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;DD1 - straight silky long hair, not thin or think</li>
            <li> The material used is the kind often used for sticky pads; the pads that they usually sell in office supply stores that have a rubberized back to stick on your dashboard.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have very straight and slick hair; most hair ties I&#x27;ve used have to be either very tight, grippy, or both to hold on, otherwise my ponytails will droop and start flopping around pretty</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair and these work amazing.</li>
            <li> So they show a picture of clear bands, and I get the UGLIEST colors you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> The picture is of all clear.</li>
            <li> The item pictured had clear ponytail holders, which is what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Might as well use a regular old rubber band with how much hair it pulls out.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would be clear</li>
            <li> I did not notice this and thought I was getting what is pictured, CLEAR.</li>
            <li> These bands are constructed of a soft rubber-type material and are much thicker than your standard scrunchie.</li>
            <li> I got the clear ones somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Well I thought I was ordering the clear ponytail holders....</li>
            <li> They do not have much \\&quot;give\\&quot; and could possibly snap before you pull it over your hair.</li>
            <li> They do not have much \\&quot;give\\&quot; and could possibly snap before you pull it over your hair.</li>
            <li> I have a bazillion pony tail holders for myself and my 5 year old girls.  </li>
            <li> I can understand why some people would say these rip their hair, but as long as you are careful putting it up you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I am used to most other brands of scrunchies just sliding down my hair smoothly with little snagging.</li>
            <li> The band itself goes on easily with no twist needed, but using your fingers (especially if you have a cut on the finger tip, like I did) results in the band squeezing rather tightly until you feed it over your ponytail.</li>
            <li> BUT, I&#x27;ve noticed that when I&#x27;m running or moving quickly, these will slip slightly and I&#x27;ll have to tighten the ponytail.</li>
            <li> As anyone with long hair knows, using certain types of material to tie up your hair can result in pulling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these, they are the only hair bands I buy (for years now!).</li>
            <li> And I like to wear a high ponytail vs. a low one</li>
            <li> /&gt;Background on our hair:&lt;br /&gt;Me - long fine hair, straight yet \\&quot;kinky\\&quot;, not thin or thick volume - in the middle</li>
            <li> This means less adjusting your hair and more work/time for other things.</li>
            <li> This means less adjusting your hair and more work/time for other things.</li>
            <li> I love scunci products, and these do stay in your hair fairly well, but when I would take them out it would roll my hair up around the elastic and tangle it horribly.  </li>
            <li> Such staying power does mean that these hair ties have a hard time wanting to leave your hair, however - so once again, if you don&#x27;t like just a little pinch of pain, either be prepared to suck it up, or find a wussier, less fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to lose hair ties, especially for me, so I end up having to buy more every six months anyway...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still the best ties for me, and I am really tough on my stuff, so the fact that only three bands have broken on me thus far is a miracle (I also tried to melt one, so it&#x27;s no wonder</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other hair band as long as these are on the market, and that&#x27;s saying a lot for me because I&#x27;m not typically brand loyal</li>
            <li> I finally pulled out to try and snap the scrunchie and it popped remarkably quickly; meaning, it took less force</li>
            <li> I finally pulled out to try and snap the scrunchie and it popped remarkably quickly; meaning, it took less force</li>
            <li> I like the clear color idea because I am blonde, but I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> they break just as frequently as the regular bands.  </li>
            <li> She has more thin and wavy hair</li>
            <li> set (assorted colors)... which is frustrating considering I paid more to get the opaque set over the assorted color set.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these hair bands, I have thick, Asian hair and these are the only hair bands that keeps it in place.</li>
            <li> I have lots of thick, long, strong hair (I am Asian), and using normal elastic hair ties</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of other rubber bands and they all slip out of place after a while.&lt;br /&gt;However, they really hurt when you take them out, no matter how careful or gentle I am.</li>
            <li> I wore one when running my first half marathon (no ponytail tugging) and always wear them when I paint</li>
            <li> I got one all clear, one blacks/browns, one light rainbow (pinks, purples, blues), and one dark colors (green, turqoise).  </li>
            <li> They are more elastic so they break less often than regular hair ties (often while trying to make another round the elastics snap in my hand), and can stay tighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t fly out and slap my hand (or someone near me), but it was rather annoying having to pick it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This was tedious, but ultimately proved effective.</li>
            <li> For medium to fine hair, a single twist is usually sufficient.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I would recommend every woman who uses ties to at least try these, if you don&#x27;t like them there are many other types out there -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the same one every day for two weeks, and it still feels new-- traditional hair ties tend to loosen up significantly after a few days of use (I typically do 3 twists), and I usually have to bust out a fresh one after a month or</li>
            <li> Couple this with the fact that my hair is very thick, very straight and very silken</li>
            <li> High ponytails have always been a problem for me because regular hair ties slip down, creating a low ponytail and loose bangs which really get in the way of my vision.</li>
            <li> I highly  recommend these to other Heavenly Handspinning Vespera owners.</li>
            <li> Hell for that matter a rubber band would be more suitable than these pieces of crap!    </li>
            <li> (you need to carefully remove it from hair) but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a secure ponytail, even through working out/running.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is because my hair is super long, but I had to stop using them.</li>
            <li> Good and bad.</li>
            <li> I expected  the clear when I ordered  but got colored  if I had known</li>
            <li> But this wasn&#x27;t has gentle to my hair as I wanted, maybe because I have long hair (my hair is down to my waist)?</li>
            <li> THESE on the other hand, are like really expensive but AMAZING rubber bands.</li>
            <li> I threw them away and will just buy the clear, white or black hair ties from my local target.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long enough not to be short but short enough not to be long.</li>
            <li> and I was having major problems with ponytail holders slipping and also breaking-these work</li>
            <li> usually pull my hair back when it is wet, so the tackiness was not obvious at first.</li>
            <li> The other con I see is that they are more expensive than regular hair ties, 2 or 3 times more expensive at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t slip and slide, last a really long time</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> they last so long</li>
            <li> Only this time, since the rubber had stretched a bit, I doubled the loop.</li>
            <li> The only other thing that might prevent this from happening is to remove it in the shower (when your hair is wet), but it seems kind of silly to have to soak your hair anytime</li>

            <li> I have straight, thick hair, and as a student, I like knowing that I&#x27;m putting my hair up in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t make me want to fix it later.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick that i break regular hair bands after two to three uses, but I can use one of these babies for a month straight of daily use.</li>
            <li> No other hair band can tame it and stretch far enough for me to gather all my hair in a single pony tail or bun.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it said colors may vary so now I have clear and black.</li>
            <li> I use my clear and black ones all of the time.</li>
            <li> this pack came as clear and black...</li>
            <li> These hold hair well, but are pretty tight with little give.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair my entire life (and its pretty thick) which means I wear pony tails a lot!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you think these are clear.</li>
            <li> I can put my hair in a ponytail or a bun with these and it holds all day long.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have metal pieces for your hair to get stuck on, but you do have to be careful to take them out the same way you put them in instead of trying to slide it out like you can do with the fabric ones.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get stretched out or break.  </li>
            <li> There are far too few positives to outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Saveyour money and buy some No-Slip, cloth scrunchies instead.d stretched a bit, I doubled the loop.</li>
            <li> And yes, mine were multi-colored, not clear.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;d be left with having to wear my hair down with that dent in it from having it up all day or scramble to find a rubber band or something and have it rip my hair off later.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing these from my local drugstore because I wanted the solid black ones</li>
            <li> When it says \\&quot;no slip\\&quot;, it really does mean \\&quot;no slip\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I will buy them as long as they keep making them!</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and two daughters after trying multiple other brands and types.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays put all day long!</li>
            <li> Not only do they pull out my hair every time I try to remove them (and yes, I am trying to be very careful and unwind the band)</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s usually really hard to keep a high ponytail.  </li>
            <li> totally worth the price tag, especially considering that i will not need to be replacing broken ones as often!</li>
            <li> If you use two hands and remove each round one at a time, it is non quite painless, but say equal to the discomfort of pulling off regular hair ties with one hand (without unwrapping).</li>
            <li> I have really thick naturally kinky hair that used to work its way out regular ponytail holders.</li>
            <li> Not to be racist, but what I mean by Asian hair is (I am Asian), very straight, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say every single time I use them, a couple hairs come off with the tie.</li>
            <li> If you are not careful you will snap a few hair strands.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use enough ties, they always &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; or go down after a while, then I have to readjust my ties every now and then.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick, and these are the only ones that actually hold my hair where I want it ALL DAY LONG!  </li>
            <li> Only problem is the color of the bands are unpredictable.</li>
            <li> If I used less and did any physical activity (running, jumping, etc)</li>
            <li> and they last forever; out of the pack I only had one break in the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> So far, they haven&#x27;t stretched out and they don&#x27;t pull my thick hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of a single rounded, rubber silicone piece with a powdery/satin feel (no seams to break!).</li>
            <li> I dont have to wring it ten times around my hair to get a tight ponytail.</li>
            <li> Even using extra care, however; there was quite a bit of my hair wrapped tightly around the band.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I frequently stock up on them since they are hard to find at times and always sold out.  </li>
            <li> Received the black, blue, pink, and purple pack!</li>
            <li> They hold my hair firmly but not so much that it&#x27;s hard to get the tie out or anything.</li>
            <li> Forget about your ponytail inching further down your head as the day goes on!</li>
            <li> But minus 3 stars for the PAIN.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re careful that can be avoided.</li>
            <li> Pink, purple, teal...</li>
            <li> Just be careful while taking them out, because they will snag on your hair.</li>
            <li> and I can go for a run, and not worry about my ponytail slipping and hair falling all over my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to worry about these slipping even after I put styling products on my hair.</li>
            <li> Read the ad carefully and you will see COLORS MAY VARY.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll just stick to regular fabric covered elastics that slide out and break after a few uses</li>
            <li> Pink, teal blue,black and purple.  </li>
            <li> do have a tendency of pulling hair if you aren&#x27;t careful as they are like thicker rubber</li>
            <li> /&gt;The durability of these hairbands is entirely contingent upon two factors</li>
            <li> saw it said colors may vary, so I was curious what I&#x27;d end up with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;DD2 - straight with some wave toward the end (not silky or kinky), maybe on the thin side for volume</li>
            <li> it is impossible to remove this item without your hair becoming entangled with The Evolution.</li>
            <li> it is impossible to remove this item without your hair becoming entangled with The Evolution.</li>
            <li> If you have normal or thin hair and regular hair ties work for you (you use two or less hair ties to make your pony tail stay), then I suggest using other material-ed ties.</li>
            <li> I usually throw it up in a big loose bun</li>
            <li> It does not come off easily and it is virtually impossible to remove it without pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> It does not come off easily and it is virtually impossible to remove it without pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> I would  of saved myself the trouble  and went with the black and white pack I saw.</li>
            <li> Other bands get too stretched out after a few wears or tear at my hair when I take them out.</li>
            <li> They stretch at a muchhhhh slower rate than any other band.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have the rubber bits, so no worries here, and they don&#x27;t stretch out like other ponytail holders.</li>
            <li> I have long, heavy hair, and the fabric covered ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as I expected!</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> That has never happened with any other hair ties.</li>
            <li> I wrap it twice on a ponytail and get a hold not too tight and not too loose.</li>
            <li> I have to say though, if you have to wrap your hair multiple times or are tired of your hair ties breaking only to throw them away</li>
            <li> It has four colors:  black, pink, purple and teal.  </li>
            <li> I have straight thick hair (each strand is thick)</li>
            <li> I get tired of the regular no tangle bands that stretch, and eventually slip down on your hair/tail (especially during athletic events).  </li>
            <li> Foregoing this method I then slid a finger between the ponytailer and used my thumb to pull it down my hair, my other hand pulling my ponytail up.</li>
            <li> My hair is also really long and on &#x27;too lazy to do my hair&#x27; days</li>
            <li> so I do not have dark bands contrasting my hair color.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these are the only hair elastics that stay put.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s love and hate.</li>
            <li> this logo pops out and it brings down the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re serious about no slipping - they can pull out a few hairs when you remove them.  </li>
            <li> A bad hair day isn&#x27;t worth the pain of removing these things!</li>
            <li> so I really like that these hold my hair up tight - its very annoying when you are running and your high pony becomes a low pony.</li>
            <li> If you tend to only put your hair up for short amounts of time throughout the day, the removal of these can get tedious.</li>
            <li> the previous non-slip ones).</li>
            <li> a marathon, a black tie event, when your hands are covered in paint.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned previously, the diameter of these are already stretching a bit around my ring finger.</li>
            <li> no quick adjustments to tighten your ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was so much hair caught between the two layers of the scrunchie that it was simply too painful to remove, and it had become quite entangled within my hair.</li>

            <li> They need to be less breakable.</li>
            <li> The photo indicates that all the rubber bands will be transparent, but my item areived with half transparent and half black ties.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t get to choose the colors which can be somewhat lame since the colors range from a regular black to a hot pink and purple.</li>
            <li> no more stretching, slipping or breaking.</li>
            <li> Also, it is true, they are painful to take off--if you use one hand.</li>
            <li> Since I have thin fingers I was able to twist the band once to double it around the base of my ponytail.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to wrap this around my hair 4 or 5 times to get a fairly tight hold.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately their new batch that we tried come with their logo added to band.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the product I received, and that you will receive if you order this item, which all went in the trash except for the few black bands that were part of the set.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick; regular elastics always stretched out and slowly slipped off.</li>
            <li> However, it does pull a little when removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i think they company got a little to vain with adding their 3Dmensional logo to their product.</li>
            <li> If you decide to move them to fix a little bit, you have to start over.</li>
            <li> Usually the other scrunchies with made out of elastics fall as soon as I put them in.</li>
            <li> Mine came in black, pink, green and purple - which I&#x27;m not very happy about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and have very thick, sleek hair.</li>
            <li> Bad, bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tacky nature of this ponytailer that makes it great for an all-day hold is also its curse when time to remove it.</li>
            <li> but I got the wrong colors (multi-colored instead of clear).</li>
            <li> keep a few on my gear stick in the car</li>
            <li> Every time I removed it, it would pull off a few strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> They do not pull any hair when removing and have a firm grip.  </li>
            <li> It hurts me to take it out of my hair and my kids are crying by the time I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> yet they go missing when I need them).  </li>
            <li> These Scunci ponytail holders are one of the few that don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Probably not your everyday ponytail holder, but a must-have in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, which means YES I do need to be CAREFUL when taking this out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, it is not like a rubber-band</li>
            <li> Since I have thick wavy hair  and have a problem of hair ties always breaking on me and wont hold my hair taut because ordinary hair ties stretch and remain stretched out to the point they give way and break.</li>
            <li> they could make them in black, it would be a plus!</li>
            <li> I found these and thought I&#x27;d give them a try - they feel grippy, stretchy, and have no metal band in them or glued join that would break off, unlike other common styles of tie.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I tried sliding it down; that pulled the fine baby hairs on my neck very painfully.</li>
            <li> I tried sliding it down; that pulled the fine baby hairs on my neck very painfully.</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews say they are painful to take out and that they pull out your hair, and that does happen the first few times you wear them.</li>
            <li> it is not easy to remove and, in fact, can be downright painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and very thick</li>
            <li> I loved the idea that my girls didn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;yank\\&quot; their ponytails to tighten them all day, but unfortunately, like other reviewers have shared, these are the worst ponytail holders I have ever bought my girls.  </li>
            <li> I have used many hair accessories in my day, but these are the worst!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Evolution No Slip Grip hairbands are small yet chunky, with each one sliding over my ring finger as the largest diameter before it begins to stretch.</li>
            <li> However; once my hair dried I grasped my hair to tighten up the ponytail: OWW!</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong, but they break DAILY.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve let it grow to my waist in the past years.</li>
            <li> , i usually buy what ever is cheapest.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> I use them for their intended purpose and they do hold extremely well in my hair, but I have to pull the band out very slowly because they grip so well.  </li>
            <li> They seriously don&#x27;t budge all day but prepare to lose a few hairs taking them out.</li>
            <li> The elastic makes my hair stick to it and hard to come off.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained that they were hard on your hair and pull when removing.</li>
            <li> This seems common sense</li>
            <li> hopefully, considering that there are at least 3 buyers who have this problem, Amazon will fix the issue.  </li>
            <li> do, however, have a complaint</li>
            <li> Whenever I examine one after taking it out of my hair, there&#x27;s at least a dozen hairs on there, some torn out at the root,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used just can&#x27;t contain my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly type 3A hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and I have always had problems with hair ties slowly coming</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I like these because they hold my daughter&#x27;s thick hair, but she hates them.  </li>
            <li> I used to stretch and/or break hair bands ALL the time with my thick mane, but not since switching to these.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair</li>
            <li> Well if you truly have thick hair, you should not be tender headed.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, you can sometimes get by with not having to twist the band.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have thick hair and that could play a factor into my difficulty with these; I am dubious at recommending them at all, though.</li>

            <li> not sure if it was a detail I missed in the description but what arrived didn&#x27;t match the image provided!</li>
            <li> and I read other reviewers receiving the wrong colors.  </li>
            <li> I do have to unwrap them to take them out or they will pull out my hair (because they grip so well), but that is a small price to pay for not having to readjust my ponytail all day!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, these small ponytailers will be painful for anyone who has larger hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, these small ponytailers will be painful for anyone who has larger hands.</li>
            <li> These are seriously must haves for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted clear and am not happy I got ugly neon colors that I will not wear.  </li>
            <li> So I again opted for the two-handed removal technique, with a double roll this too, was impossible.</li>
            <li> So I again opted for the two-handed removal technique, with a double roll this too, was impossible.</li>
            <li> because no metal and don&#x27;t slip, but seriously wtf...they break a LOT.</li>
            <li> These even stay in when I&#x27;m partying and chasing squirrels while making mad monkey noises.</li>
            <li> I was worried the material would hold to my hair too tightly and be uncomfortable but that&#x27;s not the case at all.</li>
            <li> very small - not great for thick hair</li>
            <li> They stick to your hair so they definitely won&#x27;t slip out, but that also explains why they are so painful to take out - have yet to do it without pulling hair out too.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and these pull really bad.  </li>
            <li> (my hair needs a lot of moisture, being so curly and thick!).</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but it&#x27;s annoying to not get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a runner and have thin hair</li>
            <li> They couldnt be worse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s design and put their logo on them and ever since then the product became much worse.</li>
            <li> but I do find this completely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> some from broken hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use these until they break, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li> you have thin hair, these grab and will yank out hairs - not recommended.</li>
            <li> replace broken hairties than go bald.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so annoyed with this repeatedly happening...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is where The Evolution fails, and I mean it is like an egg bomb in the hallway.</li>
            <li> break after a couple uses - usually at the worst possible time!</li>
            <li> If you attempt to slide it down it will roll, pulling your hair with it and tearing it out mercilessly.</li>
            <li> I ordered these specifically because I thought I would be receiving clear, but I got a terrible neon pack.</li>
            <li> The rubberized coating on the band grasped the baby hairs near the base of my hairline and tugged mercilessly.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair and other elastics just slide out of my hair, which drives me insane.</li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with those colors</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, to address issue of receiving the wrong color items.  </li>
            <li> and that is, there&#x27;s about a quart of an inch in length where, if one pulls in the wrong way, the tie will snap rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> I find this difficult to believe.</li>
            <li> However, as others have said, you get random colors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult for me to keep my hair up.</li>
            <li> Terrible for thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s so bad about these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> It is like using one of those tan office rubber bands, and if you&#x27;ve ever used one of those in your hair before you know how painful it is.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an efficient (albeit painful) way to go bald, get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others have said, while they stay in place, they are incredibly painful to remove and lead to lots of breakage.  </li>
            <li> The get caught up in my hair and end up (painfully) pulling it out.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using on myself them but stupidly kept them around for emergencies</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate that?&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> i hate them.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recall the description stating I might receive a color, which I did, and which I hate.  </li>
            <li> I hate when vendors do this.</li>
            <li> But I received colors, which I hate.</li>
            <li> I do understand why on others it can pull hair or be painful, but it works for me!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed with these hairbands.  </li>
            <li> I just bought THE WORST HAIR THING IN THE WORLD.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> WORST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you want to break your hair off and have a terrible headache buy these.</li>
            <li> And I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again anyway, because they are awful!.</li>
            <li> These are terrible!  </li>
            <li> These were terrible for me as a hair tie.</li>
            <li> They are simply awful to get out.  </li>
            <li> I felt horrible.  </li>
            <li> These hair ties are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Awful</li>

            <li> I would rate 5 stars but I got the wrong colors (multi-colored instead of clear). Not a big deal, but it&#x27;s annoying to not get what you paid for. Aside from that, I really like these. They are grippy and great for my hair, especially at the gym. Elastics tend to slide out when I&#x27;m running.</li>
            <li> These guys are a must for me. They hold up well over time, and give my hair the support it needs. Other bands get too stretched out after a few wears or tear at my hair when I take them out. These guys hold up longer, and keep my hair in place. I&#x27;ve got a lot of hair, and these guys do the work.</li>
            <li> I have heavy thick hair, these are perfect for me but if you don&#x27;t remove them the right way you will rip out your hair</li>
            <li> I have tried so many hair ties throughout my life. Never found the greatest of all time until these!&lt;br /&gt;Every style of hair tie I&#x27;ve ever used just can&#x27;t contain my thick hair. I do love having luscious wild locks, but using normal ties just 1) would stretch out, leaving my hair loose and looking frizzy or 2) break after a couple uses - usually at the worst possible time! Then I&#x27;d be left with having to wear my hair down with that dent in it from having it up all day or scramble to find a rubber band or something and have it rip my hair off later. Don&#x27;t you hate that?&lt;br /&gt;Then I found these and thought I&#x27;d give them a try - they feel grippy, stretchy, and have no metal band in them or glued join that would break off, unlike other common styles of tie.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. They don&#x27;t slip and slide, last a really long time (though I can&#x27;t give a real testimonial about the longest time I&#x27;ve ever had one individual tie without stretching or breaking because I tend to either lose them first or my cats steal them). They stretch at a muchhhhh slower rate than any other band. I&#x27;ve only ever had ONE break on me, and I&#x27;ve used them 4-5 days a week for two years now. Not the same hairstyle every day and often different bands if I misplace them but I buy a pack or two every 1-3 months and this is what I do: keep a few on my gear stick in the car so if I lose the one on my head or purse or forget one, they&#x27;re handy.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t rip my hair out. My hair is smooth which helps, and when I tie it up I am careful to make sure to pull ALL the hair through and clear of band interference. This seems common sense but today I had my mother and my boyfriend braid my hair and when they tied it, they didn&#x27;t try to tie it cleanly enough so it hurt pulling off the bands. I can understand why some people would say these rip their hair, but as long as you are careful putting it up you should be fine. Also I use good quality product in my hair, to keep it smooth as I mentioned: I use argan oil, sometimes some \\&quot;Tigi Catwalk Your Highness Thickening Gel Creme\\&quot; - my favorite gel of all time - and I use a boar bristle brush to distribute oils from my scalp throughout to my ends (my hair needs a lot of moisture, being so curly and thick!). Having a good routine for your hair will help with its body sleekness and shine, which in turn will help keep your hair from being pulled when you tie it up.&lt;br /&gt;These ties are not for everyone but the people they are for will love them! My sister doesn&#x27;t like them, and she has limp oily straight hair, but I don&#x27;t know if her dislike is because of her hair type or what. Anyway, I would recommend every woman who uses ties to at least try these, if you don&#x27;t like them there are many other types out there - but there is nothing quite like this! I will buy them as long as they keep making them!</li>
            <li> These are amazing! They&#x27;re made of a smooth, kind of powdery-feeling rubber, so they don&#x27;t snag hair like those old \\&quot;no-slip\\&quot; hair ties with the rubber stripes, but they still don&#x27;t move. Forget about your ponytail inching further down your head as the day goes on! I just placed an order of like 15 more packs of these; I&#x27;ll never use another kind of hair tie as long as I live! (Ignore any low reviews - those are only about some color confusion with Amazon, not about the actual product.)</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly type 3A hair. Most elastic hairbands are not tight enough to hold my hair all together. These are great! Only problem is the color of the bands are unpredictable. I was hoping for clear bands but ended up with bright colors (purple, teal, pink, black).</li>
            <li> Use them for drop shot weight holders</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is very straight and smooth and most regular hair ties I use, I have to wind it 3 times around my hair before staying. With these, I just loop twice and they are good to go. BUT, I&#x27;ve noticed that when I&#x27;m running or moving quickly, these will slip slightly and I&#x27;ll have to tighten the ponytail. For that I give it 5 stars. But minus 3 stars for the PAIN. They hurt when I&#x27;m taking them off. To unwind the tie, it pulls and tugs on my hair. I&#x27;d say every single time I use them, a couple hairs come off with the tie. My mom was looking for a hair tie to use so I gave her one, since I have a whole pack rarely in use. She has more thin and wavy hair and it hurts for her too, so she gave it back to me.</li>
            <li> Really excellent product. I&#x27;m asian and have very thick, sleek hair. High ponytails have always been a problem for me because regular hair ties slip down, creating a low ponytail and loose bangs which really get in the way of my vision. With these ties I have no such problem because of their excellent hold. Only issue I have is that the grip is so good that when I try to remove it, sometimes it pulls out hair with it. But if you&#x27;re careful that can be avoided. Regardless I can&#x27;t recommend them enough.</li>
            <li> First when i bought them, i dint like them. I cast them away thinking they just pull hair while removing them.   Continued using the assorted colored cloth/thread ones.   Then dont know why one day i used these again. And they held my plait without any movement.   Gosh i was so happy. These ponytail holders started making me like my hair :)  Only think is with the color options .. but im forgiving that..</li>
            <li> scunci - no-slip-grip I just bought THE WORST HAIR THING IN THE WORLD. scunci - no-slip-grip. It YANKED MY HAIR OUT! BEWARE!!!! TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!! WORST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So they show a picture of clear bands, and I get the UGLIEST colors you can imagine.  Pink, purple, teal... and I am a man.  Useless.  I&#x27;m reviewing the product I received, and that you will receive if you order this item, which all went in the trash except for the few black bands that were part of the set.</li>
            <li> Finally found out what the name of these were and ordered them as soon as possible. Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t get to choose the colors which can be somewhat lame since the colors range from a regular black to a hot pink and purple. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with those colors but it&#x27;s a rare occasion where I&#x27;m wearing a magenta shirt. If I could choose, I would certainly give it the full 5 due to functionality as well as style.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have very straight and slick hair; most hair ties I&#x27;ve used have to be either very tight, grippy, or both to hold on, otherwise my ponytails will droop and start flopping around pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these ponytailers. They&#x27;re made of a single rounded, rubber silicone piece with a powdery/satin feel (no seams to break!). They hold my hair in place like no other and don&#x27;t budge at all, even during the most strenuous workouts or bumpiest jogs. I&#x27;ve been wearing the same one every day for two weeks, and it still feels new-- traditional hair ties tend to loosen up significantly after a few days of use (I typically do 3 twists), and I usually have to bust out a fresh one after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback of these is that, while they are easy to put in, they don&#x27;t slip out easily because of their rubbery texture. You have to take extra care when pulling these out, otherwise they will snag and snap your hair. If you tend to only put your hair up for short amounts of time throughout the day, the removal of these can get tedious. However, if you want a \\&quot;set it and forget\\&quot; it type of ponytailer, I think these are about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> The picture is of all clear. I didn&#x27;t realize it said colors may vary so now I have clear and black. Oh well.</li>
            <li> These hair ties did not arrive opaque as described here. Mine came in black, pink, green and purple - which I&#x27;m not very happy about. I wanted opaque so I never had to worry about matching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how they work - they&#x27;re fantastic. I was worried the material would hold to my hair too tightly and be uncomfortable but that&#x27;s not the case at all. They hold my hair firmly but not so much that it&#x27;s hard to get the tie out or anything. I have very thick, wavy hair and these work amazing. I will be buying more, but from a store instead of Amazon so I can get the color I want.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my 2 ft long THICK straight hair. I used the black ones by scunci, but they&#x27;re only good for one use before they expand then eventually break. THESE on the other hand, are like really expensive but AMAZING rubber bands. It used to take me up to an hour to make the perfect bun before it fell out, but these make putting my hair up a breeze. Just be careful while taking them out, because they will snag on your hair. They are made out of rubber, what do you expect? I got the 14 pck at Walgreens for under 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> these are the hair elastics i have been waiting forever for.    strong grip, but does not tangle with hair.  held my ponytail all day!  also more durable than those other fabric elastics (mine were always breaking at the seams).    totally worth the price tag, especially considering that i will not need to be replacing broken ones as often!</li>
            <li> No slip - ok, sure I buy that. But no snag? It definitely snags. In fact, I feel like that rubbery gelly type texture snags more than their normal black ones. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> These are seriously the best hair bands I have ever used. My biggest problem with regular elastic hair bands is that the elastic always breaks inside or they aren&#x27;t as stretchy as you need them to be. No problems like that with these! I&#x27;m a runner and have thin hair but A LOT of hair so I really like that these hold my hair up tight - its very annoying when you are running and your high pony becomes a low pony. These really are no-slip, so I&#x27;ve never had a problem like that with these. My hair is also really long and on &#x27;too lazy to do my hair&#x27; days I usually throw it up in a big loose bun - these bands will hold that bun all day without me worrying about re-doing it. I highly recommend these, they are the only hair bands I buy (for years now!).</li>
            <li> These do their job but they really pull your hair.  This is not only damaging to hair but also really HURTS!</li>
            <li> These hold hair well, but are pretty tight with little give.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!!!</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best ponytail holders.  When it says \\&quot;no slip\\&quot;, it really does mean \\&quot;no slip\\&quot;. I put it on once, and never have to readjust it. However, it does pull a little when removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to address issue of receiving the wrong color items.  I, too, ordered the Opaque set and received the [[ASIN:B003DKO83E Scunci No-slip Grip Evolution Bright Jelly Ponytailers (Pack of 14)]] set (assorted colors)... which is frustrating considering I paid more to get the opaque set over the assorted color set.  However, this is strictly Amazon&#x27;s fault, and buyers shouldn&#x27;t reflect this on the PRODUCT rating.  Contact Amazon and file for a return... hopefully, considering that there are at least 3 buyers who have this problem, Amazon will fix the issue.  But if not, get your money back from Amazon or have them re-send you the correct ones.  Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these awesome hair ties to anyone. But, They don&#x27;t come clear as shown in the picture which i wished for!</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and I have always had problems with hair ties slowly coming out(even the previous non-slip ones). With other hair ties, I have to loop them around my ponytail 3 times for a secure hold, which causes them to stretch out quickly or snap. These I only have to loop twice and there hasn&#x27;t been any noticealbe stretching since I bought them.   The only downfall to these is that they can&#x27;t just be slid or rolled off your ponytail like most ties, as they will pull and tangle in your hair.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f2048ab5a5e90339a64450b77aa793bc]]When i first bought this product at Walgreens for the first i was really impressed. They lasted twice the amount of time without breaking and they never pulled my hair. Unfortunately their new batch that we tried come with their logo added to band. this logo pops out and it brings down the quality of the product. Not only do they rip faster(specifically right by the logo) and it also NOW pulls my hair when ever i take them off. It was such a great product but i think they company got a little to vain with adding their 3Dmensional logo to their product. Will be adding a video of one of the rips i encountered.</li>
            <li> these are damaging as can be i hate them. If i could give them zero stars i would. If you want to break your hair off and have a terrible headache buy these. They couldnt be worse.</li>
            <li> If you have thick,straight and silky hair expect these to be a big pain in the butt! I am seriously better off with the regular hair ties that stretch quickly, snap and when used tangle in your hair! Hell for that matter a rubber band would be more suitable than these pieces of crap!    My hair is long enough not to be short but short enough not to be long. Couple this with the fact that my hair is very thick, very straight and very silken this is a total bust of a product!    When an ad/package says no slip 1 would expect it to be exactly that! No friggin slip!</li>
            <li> Only ones I&#x27;ll use.  They&#x27;re serious about no slipping - they can pull out a few hairs when you remove them.  But I&#x27;d rather that than constantly having to tighten my ponytail.</li>
            <li> If you have a low tolerance for pain, don&#x27;t use these. I have straight, thick hair, and as a student, I like knowing that I&#x27;m putting my hair up in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t make me want to fix it later. Even the best cloth bands slip or loosen eventually. These even stay in when I&#x27;m partying and chasing squirrels while making mad monkey noises. Such staying power does mean that these hair ties have a hard time wanting to leave your hair, however - so once again, if you don&#x27;t like just a little pinch of pain, either be prepared to suck it up, or find a wussier, less fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to lose hair ties, especially for me, so I end up having to buy more every six months anyway... which is good, because that&#x27;s when a couple of these started breaking on me. I actually still have some from my old pack, but I got more when the semester started just in case. They&#x27;re still the best ties for me, and I am really tough on my stuff, so the fact that only three bands have broken on me thus far is a miracle (I also tried to melt one, so it&#x27;s no wonder it eventually snapped... about a month later).&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love these. But they do definitely hurt a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and two daughters after trying multiple other brands and types.  These are the best, for thick or for thinner/finer hair.  They do tangle during removal if you do not take your time, so that&#x27;s why they get 4 out of 5 stars.  Would recommend to anyone that has children with ponytails that won&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> The item pictured had clear ponytail holders, which is what I thought I was getting. I received a multi-color pack.&lt;br /&gt;They hold hair back well, but they get tangled when you try to take them out.</li>
            <li> I love these hair tides, however the company changed it&#x27;s design and put their logo on them and ever since then the product became much worse. Now my hair gets ripped off when I slide it off my ponytail because it gets caught in those letters. I wish they made them the way they used to. They don&#x27;t last long either, because those letters are on them, they rip easily! I go through two a week</li>
            <li> Not to be racist, but what I mean by Asian hair is (I am Asian), very straight, thick hair. If I use regular hair ties I always have to use more than one tie (3-5 ties depending on my activities) because I like to tie my hair high. If I don&#x27;t use enough ties, they always &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; or go down after a while, then I have to readjust my ties every now and then. This can be inconvinient when I&#x27;m playing sports (esp. basketball). When I use this scunci, I only need to use one, and I never need to readjust it; no matter if I&#x27;m playing basketball, running, etc. This tie is PERFECT for my hair. But like everybody said, you can&#x27;t just pull it when you wanna take it off. You have to reverse what you do when you put it on.</li>
            <li> The ties are great as they do not slip easily; now, if only they could have an on and off switch so I could remove them without much care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have a complaint and that is, there&#x27;s about a quart of an inch in length where, if one pulls in the wrong way, the tie will snap rendering it useless. This is where the branding of the tie is. I am not a brand specialist but I do find this completely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I ordered these specifically because I thought I would be receiving clear, but I got a terrible neon pack. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you think these are clear.</li>
            <li> Love these but thought they would be clear and they are brightly colored ones... Disappointed!</li>
            <li> These really hold your hair in place, which is awesome if you need to keep long hair back and in place while active. I&#x27;ve used lots of other rubber bands and they all slip out of place after a while.&lt;br /&gt;However, they really hurt when you take them out, no matter how careful or gentle I am. Whenever I examine one after taking it out of my hair, there&#x27;s at least a dozen hairs on there, some torn out at the root, some from broken hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use these until they break, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li> It hold well even when I am doing sports, so that&#x27;s good. But this wasn&#x27;t has gentle to my hair as I wanted, maybe because I have long hair (my hair is down to my waist)? Every time I removed it, it would pull off a few strands of my hair. I feel like the telephone hair ties are more gentle than this, but I am not sure about the hold for those.</li>
            <li> Tried these from a friend and just had to have my own. They really keep the hair up - bun, braid, ponytail. Love love these!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these hair bands, I have thick, Asian hair and these are the only hair bands that keeps it in place. AND they last so much longer than non-jelly hair ties, plus the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> This product is the best on the market. They hold the hair securely and do not break the hair. They last a long time.</li>
            <li> Yes, they stay put, but so does a regular rubber band and the effect is about the same. Totally ripped my hair out when I tried to remove it. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> These are the only elastics I use, anymore. I have a lot of thick hair and other elastics just slide out of my hair, which drives me insane. I&#x27;ve stocked up on these in case I can&#x27;t find them in the future.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every hair band under the sun and these are by far the best in my opinion.  They do not pull any hair when removing and have a firm grip.  Also, as a blonde it is nice to have the clear colors so I do not have dark bands contrasting my hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands that claim to be no-slip, but these really do what they are labeled! I have purchased the brand before, and had problems with the rubber no slip break off and stretch out. This one doesn&#x27;t have the rubber bits, so no worries here, and they don&#x27;t stretch out like other ponytail holders. I have thick hair and I can go for a run, and not worry about my ponytail slipping and hair falling all over my face. I would highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;If they could make them in black, it would be a plus!</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy; my son wears them on his wrists because regular gummy bracelets are always huge.  I use them for their intended purpose and they do hold extremely well in my hair, but I have to pull the band out very slowly because they grip so well.  I received the clear ones, I really hoped for some colors instead.</li>
            <li> these were way cheaper at walmart- $2.98. And I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again anyway, because they are awful!. It hurts me to take it out of my hair and my kids are crying by the time I&#x27;m done. It is like using one of those tan office rubber bands, and if you&#x27;ve ever used one of those in your hair before you know how painful it is. I bought these because it said there was no damage done to your hair- I find this difficult to believe. Do not buy! Buy the ouchless hair rubber bands instead.</li>
            <li> These are terrible!  I have used many hair accessories in my day, but these are the worst!  They don&#x27;t slip because they stick to the hair, wrap around it and pull it out!  Very disappointing.  I like the clear color idea because I am blonde, but I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> These were terrible for me as a hair tie. Might as well use a regular old rubber band with how much hair it pulls out. However, they make great &amp;#34;broccoli band&#x27; style &amp;#34;wallets&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t pick the color. I did not like that at all. It still hurts my hair when I remove the hair tie. The elastic makes my hair stick to it and hard to come off.</li>
            <li> The colors that arrived were bright pinks and purples that, literally, glow in the dark.  The ad says that,&amp;#34;colors my vary&amp;#34;.  If you are willing to take the risk and don&#x27;t care what they look like, this is a terrific product.  I use my clear and black ones all of the time.</li>
            <li> I have really thick naturally kinky hair that used to work its way out regular ponytail holders. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about these slipping even after I put styling products on my hair.</li>
            <li> This are my favorite kind of  hair ties because they never snag my hair and are very tight! I dont have to wring it ten times around my hair to get a tight ponytail. Twice and I&#x27;m done! They also never lose that tightness like most hair ties eventually do</li>
            <li> More durable  and  very  little  hair  pulling .</li>
            <li> Quick ship great price very pleased with purchase and seller.</li>
            <li> I picked these up thinking that they would be the best hairbands ever....no more stretching, slipping or breaking. However, I was very disappointed with these hairbands.  Not only do they pull out my hair every time I try to remove them (and yes, I am trying to be very careful and unwind the band) they break just as frequently as the regular bands.  I would definitely not recommend this hairband.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea that my girls didn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;yank\\&quot; their ponytails to tighten them all day, but unfortunately, like other reviewers have shared, these are the worst ponytail holders I have ever bought my girls.  I will never use these on their hair again, and we&#x27;ve given them a fair try.  They pull out their hair as well as entangle their hair around the jelly holder itself.  They are simply awful to get out.  But, they do make cute bracelets for the kids - remember the jelly kind we used to wear growing up?</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these are the only hair elastics that stay put.  However, as others have said, you get random colors.  I&#x27;ve ordered 4 packs of these over recent years.  I got one all clear, one blacks/browns, one light rainbow (pinks, purples, blues), and one dark colors (green, turqoise).  So if you&#x27;re picky about colors, be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair, these grab and will yank out hairs - not recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these hair ties for at least four years now and they are my absolute FAVORITE. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them. My hair is very thick; regular elastics always stretched out and slowly slipped off. A lot of the reviews say they are painful to take out and that they pull out your hair, and that does happen the first few times you wear them. You get used to them, though, I promise you, and can take them out with literally no pain. These are seriously must haves for me. I always always always have two on my wrist. They don&#x27;t stretch out, they don&#x27;t move unless you want them to, and they are very stretchy and durable.</li>
            <li> The picture is misleading. I bought these thinking they would be clear (I have light hair and wanted it to blend in) but they came in multiple bold colors.</li>
            <li> These hair ties are great.  So far, they haven&#x27;t stretched out and they don&#x27;t pull my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I only use these pony tail holders now. I have long, heavy hair, and the fabric covered ones don&#x27;t hold it up well. I can put my hair in a ponytail or a bun with these and it holds all day long. They don&#x27;t have metal pieces for your hair to get stuck on, but you do have to be careful to take them out the same way you put them in instead of trying to slide it out like you can do with the fabric ones. These are also higher quality than the Goody ones, which I have found stretch out and break much more easily.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and these pull really bad.  I stopped using on myself them but stupidly kept them around for emergencies (hair ties are like socks- have a ton yet they go missing when I need them).  One day my waist- length haired daughter needed a hair tie and we were in a hurry.  I used this and when I went to take them out she cried so much.  I felt horrible.  A huge chunk of her hair stuck to them (same thing that happened to me, but this time I could actually see the damage unfolding).  They&#x27;re definitely not for fine textured hair.  At that point I pitched them all.  A bad hair day isn&#x27;t worth the pain of removing these things! The non-jelly ones have always been fine.  Would not recommend!</li>
            <li> I like these because they hold my daughter&#x27;s thick hair, but she hates them.  They do wind around the hair and you end up pulling a lot out.  Decide what you want - hold which they do, or some pain</li>
            <li> I love scunci products, and these do stay in your hair fairly well, but when I would take them out it would roll my hair up around the elastic and tangle it horribly.  I have very long hair and so I suppose that was part of the problem.  The last time I used one, I had to ask for help to get out the big knot of tangled hair and elastic.  If you want a good hair elastic, stick to a different scunci product like the flat, fabric covered elastics.</li>
            <li> Read the ad carefully and you will see COLORS MAY VARY.  I did not notice this and thought I was getting what is pictured, CLEAR. What I received was a bunch of colored hair ties - fit for a 10 year old not for a grown woman.  I threw them away and will just buy the clear, white or black hair ties from my local target.  I really wanted to try the jelly to see how I like them.</li>
            <li> I have lots of thick, long, strong hair (I am Asian), and using normal elastic hair ties I would need four or five to keep my pony tail in place. If I used less and did any physical activity (running, jumping, etc) my pony tail would loosen. With these no slip grip I can use two hair ties and they stay stronger than four regular hair ties. They are more elastic so they break less often than regular hair ties (often while trying to make another round the elastics snap in my hand), and can stay tighter.&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that they are made of rubber, so they cannot be rolled, and once in, they stay in place. If you decide to move them to fix a little bit, you have to start over. Also, it is true, they are painful to take off--if you use one hand. If you use two hands and remove each round one at a time, it is non quite painless, but say equal to the discomfort of pulling off regular hair ties with one hand (without unwrapping). The other con I see is that they are more expensive than regular hair ties, 2 or 3 times more expensive at least.&lt;br /&gt;If you have lots of hair and have trouble finding hair ties that stay strong, or use many hair ties, I definitely recommend these hair ties as the ones for you. If you have normal or thin hair and regular hair ties work for you (you use two or less hair ties to make your pony tail stay), then I suggest using other material-ed ties. The cons are not worth it if regular hair ties work just as well, unless you just really like the bright gel colors.</li>
            <li> I expected  the clear when I ordered  but got colored  if I had known I would  of saved myself the trouble  and went with the black and white pack I saw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult for me to keep my hair up. These Scunci ponytail holders are one of the few that don&#x27;t slip. The grip is so good that I have to be careful putting them on and taking them off, because they sometimes catch my hair and break a few strands. Unloop them, don&#x27;t try to roll them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ponytail holders are really one of the best for holding power. When I want a ponytail guaranteed to stay up, I use these.</li>
            <li> For PERFORMANCE: I give these a full five stars!  These are the only thing to use when you need your hair tied back in a big way.  I wore one when running my first half marathon (no ponytail tugging) and always wear them when I paint (no need to wipe hair out of my face).  I also use these to do a fast up-do for a fancy evening out...I wrap and pin hair to cover the rubber band, and that up-do is UP for the NIGHT.  Pretty fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For QUALITY: I give these three stars.  They hold their shape pretty well and don&#x27;t get too terribly stretched out...which is rare with ponytail holders.  HOWEVER, they really REALLY rip at your hair when trying to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, these are amazing and well worth the pain of removal (and loss of a few extra hairs) when you need a high-performance hair holder...a marathon, a black tie event, when your hands are covered in paint.  Probably not your everyday ponytail holder, but a must-have in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 14 pack of these hair ties to use at the gym, hoping they would hold my ponytail in better when I work out. Every time I tried to use one, when you remove it, no matter how gently, it breaks off and pulls out tons of hair. I&#x27;m not sure if this is because my hair is super long, but I had to stop using them. The Goody brand hair ties that are fabric with rubber strips are way better and don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> These are a huge waste of money - they stay put great, but prepare to lose a chunk of hair every time you try to pull one of these out of your hair. The jelly rubber these are made of is clingy and only seems to stay put because it clings and tangles itself into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just stick to regular fabric covered elastics that slide out and break after a few uses - I&#x27;d rather re-make my pony tail and. replace broken hairties than go bald.</li>
            <li> Received the black, blue, pink, and purple pack! Love these. Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> These have been life changing. I used to stretch and/or break hair bands ALL the time with my thick mane, but not since switching to these. Yes I still break them occasionally, they are not indestructible, but these work and stay secure ALL DAY LONG (another first). No, they don&#x27;t pull out of hair super smoothly (you need to carefully remove it from hair) but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a secure ponytail, even through working out/running.</li>
            <li> I received the colored ones.  Pink, teal blue,black and purple.  I love these hair ties.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times i had the elastic snap, leading up to the cloth stretching on my hair ties.  Which then lead to me throwing them away.  These are great they last so long and I don&#x27;t need to wrap this around my hair 4 or 5 times to get a fairly tight hold.  I wrap it twice on a ponytail and get a hold not too tight and not too loose.I have thick curly hair, which means YES I do need to be CAREFUL when taking this out of my hair.  If you are not careful you will snap a few hair strands.  I have to say though, if you have to wrap your hair multiple times or are tired of your hair ties breaking only to throw them away these are a well invested purchase.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for the clear but got some brightly colored ones.  Would of liked to be able to select what I wanted</li>
            <li> Great scrunches, that are able to hold hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;They do have a tendency of pulling hair if you aren&#x27;t careful as they are like thicker rubber bands.&lt;br /&gt;Also this pack came as clear and black... not sure if it was a detail I missed in the description but what arrived didn&#x27;t match the image provided!</li>
            <li> work very good! A+++++++</li>
            <li> These pull out your hair, especially after a workout. Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> I got these to use as drive bands on my electric spinning wheel and they work GREAT!!! I highly  recommend these to other Heavenly Handspinning Vespera owners.</li>
            <li> I bought these a while back from a store in town. Took them home, tried them out, took them right back for a refund. They have a very soft feel, but I still debated on getting them since they were &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34;. I should have stuck to my instincts. These things hurt trying to get out, and I lost a good bit of hair. I&#x27;ll stick to the fabric covered bands from now on.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair ties ever. If you have thick hair these are the best. They do not stretch out and they last forever; out of the pack I only had one break in the past 6 months. Some reviewers complained that they were hard on your hair and pull when removing. Well if you truly have thick hair, you should not be tender headed. Plus if you take time to remove they do not pull at all. Well worth the money; you can re-use over and over again!!</li>
            <li> Grips hair and pulls it out.  Terrible for thick hair.</li>
            <li> These are the only ponytail holders I use now.  My hair is long and thick, and these are the only ones that actually hold my hair where I want it ALL DAY LONG!  Even while running or playing volleyball, my hair stays put.  They don&#x27;t get stretched out or break.  I&#x27;ve had the same ones going on two years and they are still perfect.</li>
            <li> Love them! Dont pull my hair</li>
            <li> I bought these at Walgreens near my apartment and  saw them when they first came out and decided to try them out. I am highly impressed with them and came back to get more. Since I have thick wavy hair  and have a problem of hair ties always breaking on me and wont hold my hair taut because ordinary hair ties stretch and remain stretched out to the point they give way and break. I love how they go back to their normal shape after you take them out. I always keep several in my purse and I frequently stock up on them since they are hard to find at times and always sold out.  This is a great idea for a hair tie plus there is a great variety of colors I preferably like the clear ones as well as the assorted colored ones to match any color of outfit you are wearing. Thank you scuncii for making these. These are my absolute favorite hair ties now.</li>
            <li> These hair ties are terrible.  They stick to your hair so they definitely won&#x27;t slip out, but that also explains why they are so painful to take out - have yet to do it without pulling hair out too.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing these from my local drugstore because I wanted the solid black ones and I read other reviewers receiving the wrong colors.  My review is for the quality of the bands.  I&#x27;ve had long hair my entire life (and its pretty thick) which means I wear pony tails a lot! And I like to wear a high ponytail vs. a low one so I&#x27;m always adjusting and tightening the traditional hair ties.  So during my weekly peruse of Amazon I thought I would see if I could find any new non-slip hair ties.  THESE BABIES ROCK! They seriously don&#x27;t budge all day but prepare to lose a few hairs taking them out. You can&#x27;t really pull them out like the older style ones so I would suggest untying them to spare as much hair as you can :)  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as I expected!</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recall the description stating I might receive a color, which I did, and which I hate.  I wanted clear and am not happy I got ugly neon colors that I will not wear.  Waste of money! I hate when vendors do this. I know I should be rating the product and not the vendor but I&#x27;m so annoyed with this repeatedly happening...maybe with enough low ratings, vendors will get a clue and change their policy</li>
            <li> As anyone with long hair knows, using certain types of material to tie up your hair can result in pulling. Rubber bands, for instance, will knot your hair and get caught; oftentimes you need to use scissors to cut the rubber band off for fear of ripping out a sizeable chunk of your hair. Scunci, the brand ubiquitous with hair accessories (even lending its name for the term \\&quot;scrunchie\\&quot;, a type of hair band), recently introduced a product of jelly ponytailers; since I had a coupon I figured that I would try them out. The size of the package that I purchased was only a six-count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Evolution No Slip Grip hairbands are small yet chunky, with each one sliding over my ring finger as the largest diameter before it begins to stretch. The manufacturer indicates that these bands are \\&quot;jelly\\&quot;, and to a certain extent this is an accurate name. If you are old enough to remember the 1980&#x27;s, they bring to mind a softer, more elastic version of the material used to make jelly sandals. If you do not remember jelly sandals, you can liken the product to a super bounce ball. The softness aspect of these hairbands feel a bit like pasta cooked to al dente.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The durability of these hairbands is entirely contingent upon two factors: 1) how fat your fingers are and, 2) that you do not stretch them very far. As I mentioned previously, the diameter of these are already stretching a bit around my ring finger. Since I have thin fingers I was able to twist the band once to double it around the base of my ponytail. The tightness of these results in the jellly remaining in your hair all day without you needing to readjust it. However, this is only praise that I can bestow upon this product. There are far too few positives to outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s so bad about these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it bluntly, these bands do a great job of keeping your ponytail tight and in place. If your hair is thick, you can sometimes get by with not having to twist the band. For medium to fine hair, a single twist is usually sufficient. The band itself goes on easily with no twist needed, but using your fingers (especially if you have a cut on the finger tip, like I did) results in the band squeezing rather tightly until you feed it over your ponytail. If you have any type of cut, bruise, or even just have larger fingers than I do, you may struggle with this part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the durability of these bands is mediocre, at best. I used a moderate amount of force to twist the band to loop a second time over my ponytail. This resulted in a good amount of stretch on the hairband. When I went to adjust the band after looping it, I pulled it out just a bit to snug it up to the first loop in my ponytail and it just snapped. Fortunately, it is not like a rubber-band so it didn&#x27;t fly out and slap my hand (or someone near me), but it was rather annoying having to pick it out of my hair. Now, to be clear, this only happened once, and it had more to do with me pulling it up to straighten the band as opposed to the initial use. That being said, with the amount that these cost and that most hairbands can survive this standard adjustment with no problems results in this is the first strike against Sc&amp;uuml;nci&#x27;s The Evolution product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where The Evolution fails, and I mean it is like an egg bomb in the hallway. These bands are constructed of a soft rubber-type material and are much thicker than your standard scrunchie. Maybe two times larger than the size of a Cheerio&#x27;s cereal piece. The material used is the kind often used for sticky pads; the pads that they usually sell in office supply stores that have a rubberized back to stick on your dashboard. For these hairbands, it is the back of these pads, the tacky part, that comprise The Evolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Evolution does have a slightly tacky feel to it and, should you get any dust or dirt on the band, a quick trip through a faucet and light rubbing will clean it off. Though not as sticky the backing pad you use in your car for a cell phone, there is definitely a grip in these jellies. And that is where this explanatory detour has lead. The killing point of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hurt like heck to remove and sometimes, just to adjust them. If you are looking for an efficient (albeit painful) way to go bald, get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually pull my hair back when it is wet, so the tackiness was not obvious at first. I used a single loop and, as promised, it gripped my hair tightly and I was able to go about my day without feeling the usual loosening that happens with my cloth/elastic ponytailers. However; once my hair dried I grasped my hair to tighten up the ponytail: OWW! The rubberized coating on the band grasped the baby hairs near the base of my hairline and tugged mercilessly. I had to reach back, pull them out of the death-grasp of the scrunchie, and then try to adjust it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: strike one... no quick adjustments to tighten your ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my day ended, and I went to pull out the The Evolution. I am used to most other brands of scrunchies just sliding down my hair smoothly with little snagging. So I tried this method with The Evolution. Bad, bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tacky nature of this ponytailer that makes it great for an all-day hold is also its curse when time to remove it. If you attempt to slide it down it will roll, pulling your hair with it and tearing it out mercilessly. Foregoing this method I then slid a finger between the ponytailer and used my thumb to pull it down my hair, my other hand pulling my ponytail up. This was tedious, but ultimately proved effective. Even using extra care, however; there was quite a bit of my hair wrapped tightly around the band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strike two... it is not easy to remove and, in fact, can be downright painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried again last night and the same horror occurred. Only this time, since the rubber had stretched a bit, I doubled the loop. Bad idea. I tried sliding it down; that pulled the fine baby hairs on my neck very painfully. So I again opted for the two-handed removal technique, with a double roll this too, was impossible. There was so much hair caught between the two layers of the scrunchie that it was simply too painful to remove, and it had become quite entangled within my hair. I finally pulled out to try and snap the scrunchie and it popped remarkably quickly; meaning, it took less force than I thought it would to get it to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strike three and yerrrrrrrrrrr out!... it is impossible to remove this item without your hair becoming entangled with The Evolution. It will pull out clump after clump, no matter what you do. The only other thing that might prevent this from happening is to remove it in the shower (when your hair is wet), but it seems kind of silly to have to soak your hair anytime that you want to pull out your ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one sentence: this product is nothing better than a chunkier rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sc&amp;uuml;nci&#x27;s The Evolution hair band has only one positive: it does stay in place and keep your ponytail as you first styled it. This means less adjusting your hair and more work/time for other things. However, the pain that this hairband can produce is nothing short of mind-blowing. It does not come off easily and it is virtually impossible to remove it without pulling out hair. In some cases the scrunchie can become so enmeshed with your hair you will need to cut out the band. They may be innovative, but they will also rip out enough hair to build a wig with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, these small ponytailers will be painful for anyone who has larger hands. They do not have much \\&quot;give\\&quot; and could possibly snap before you pull it over your hair. Granted, I have thick hair and that could play a factor into my difficulty with these; I am dubious at recommending them at all, though.

            <li> My dog found one of these on the ground while we were out walking one day, so I washed it and used it.  Well, then it broke and I just HAD to get a replacement.  It holds a ponytail really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it said colors may vary, so I was curious what I&#x27;d end up with.  Well as much as I would have liked the clear ones (as pictured), I&#x27;m very happy with what was sent.  It has four colors:  black, pink, purple and teal.  They aren&#x27;t kid-like, but they are fun and flirty.</li>
            <li> Got these in the multi-colored variety.  As others have said, while they stay in place, they are incredibly painful to remove and lead to lots of breakage.  No thanks!</li>
            <li> Good and bad. They stay in, and I love them dont get me wrong, but they break DAILY. I go through them 247. They need to be less breakable. My favorite because no metal and don&#x27;t slip, but seriously wtf...they break a LOT. So, it&#x27;s love and hate.</li>
            <li> very small - not great for thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair stays put all day long! That has never happened with any other hair ties. I do have to unwrap them to take them out or they will pull out my hair (because they grip so well), but that is a small price to pay for not having to readjust my ponytail all day!</li>
            <li> I know the fine print says the colors may vary on these but I really needed to clear ones that are pictures and not the neon ones I got. Ugh... thank goodness I got the clear ones somewhere else.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and very thick and I was having major problems with ponytail holders slipping and also breaking-these work so well-I absolutely love them-they never slip, never break and they last forever!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE HAIR BANDS!!!! I have straight thick hair (each strand is thick) and i&#x27;ve let it grow to my waist in the past years. No other hair band can tame it and stretch far enough for me to gather all my hair in a single pony tail or bun. These things are AWESOME. My hair is so thick that i break regular hair bands after two to three uses, but I can use one of these babies for a month straight of daily use. I will never buy any other hair band as long as these are on the market, and that&#x27;s saying a lot for me because I&#x27;m not typically brand loyal, i usually buy what ever is cheapest. These are worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have lots of fine hair this will damage your hair, stick to regular hair bands, might also tangle in curly hair.</li>
            <li> it says &amp;#34;no damage&amp;#34; to your hair, but it really demaged mine.</li>
            <li> These hair ties did not work well for me. The get caught up in my hair and end up (painfully) pulling it out. If you look at them after I take them out, they&#x27;re like a graveyard for my lost hairs. I won&#x27;t be buying them again. And yes, mine were multi-colored, not clear.</li>
            <li> I received the multicolored pack and used one right away.  I need to tie my mid-back hair up for the gym and it&#x27;s usually really hard to keep a high ponytail.  I don&#x27;t have much hair, but what I do have is sleek and slippery.  This definitely stays put, but like some others have mentioned, it is a lot like a regular ol&#x27; rubber band.  However, I feel that on my hair it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; as much as a rubber band and it&#x27;s easier for me to remove.  I can gently roll it off, or I&#x27;ll just twist off each loop (like tying your hair in reverse).  I do understand why on others it can pull hair or be painful, but it works for me!</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these because my last set was worn and I needed a brand that would stay in place. I thought this product would be a good alternative to those that slip out. They do stay in place, that was never the problem. When I go to remove it, it rolls into itself, tearing at my hair. Taking these things out hurts and pulls out my hair! Don&#x27;t waste your money on these! They aren&#x27;t worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Well I thought I was ordering the clear ponytail holders.... But I received colors, which I hate.</li>
            <li> I bought these in a local store.  I have a bazillion pony tail holders for myself and my 5 year old girls.  I get tired of the regular no tangle bands that stretch, and eventually slip down on your hair/tail (especially during athletic events).  These held up great in the pool as well as out and about on dry land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background on our hair:&lt;br /&gt;Me - long fine hair, straight yet \\&quot;kinky\\&quot;, not thin or thick volume - in the middle&lt;br /&gt;DD1 - straight silky long hair, not thin or think volume - in the middle&lt;br /&gt;DD2 - straight with some wave toward the end (not silky or kinky), maybe on the thin side for volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked them so much I picked up two more packs today to have extras.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen the opaque ones, but I bought the super bright ones and my girls LOVE those.  Today I picked up the colored ones (but not super bright like the picture above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah - when removing the bands, you can&#x27;t just take the whole thing and pull it out or it WILL pull some hair out.  You need to unwind the band - basically reversing the process.  You might still lose a hair or two, but, not bad.</li>
            <li> get these for my daughters.  They seem to prefer them to the regular cloth hair ties.  I think they stay in place better.  I can&#x27;t find them in the stores.  Glad to see them on amazon.</li>
            <li> The photo indicates that all the rubber bands will be transparent, but my item areived with half transparent and half black ties. It didn&#x27;t make a difference to me, but thought I&#x27;d share that the pic is different than then item I received.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so resilient and grip your hair very well.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and these scrunchies stay in. Usually the other scrunchies with made out of elastics fall as soon as I put them in. Also, I have put them around my ponytail three times around and then if they do stay in they wear out so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have to have x-rays and CT scans often so it is a nuisance to have to take them out when those tests are done. But I can leave these in. I like the pretty colors that they come.</li>
            <li> Awful....tears your hair out...breaks your hair off...My hair used to be all the same length...after using these I had to get my hair layered because it broke off so much hair!</li>
