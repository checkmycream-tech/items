            <li>So far I love it! !</li>

            <li>Does it clean the skin ?</li>
            <li>My face feels seriously clean after using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just 1 use, your skin feels so clean and pores feel CLEAR which is an amazing feeling after wearing makeup all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clensure RC Professional Skin Care Rotating Facial Cleansing Brush Sponge System is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I received this and the very first time I used it to cleanse my face with the sponge attachment, the sponge came off as soon as I turned it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle, gentle on face.</li>
            <li>Is it better than the clarisonics that I&#x27;ve owned, no way near close.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the perfect product for anyone who wants to get a deep clean after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price either!!</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li>Really helped my acne go away with  my cleanser! ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>The sponge on the head came apart with first use</li>
            <li>I have had problems with blackheads my entire life and have never been able to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly that without breaking my wallet.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it&#x27;s now a regular part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clensure RC Rotating Facial Cleansing Brush Sponge System for about 3 weeks now, and can say that it absolutely has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping was equally amazing, I did the next day delivery and got it next day in a snowstorm.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>My face feels much cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>I use this with my Origins: Checks and Balances foaming cleanser, but really you can use it with any type of foaming</li>
            <li>Cleans really well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Came very  promptly as well.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing action is very gentle but works well.  </li>
            <li>I rather just pop in a new battery and use it when I&#x27;m ready instead of waiting for it to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>Brush head very soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Obviously, the manual brush wins on battery usage, except that it makes my arm</li>
            <li>I live for proactive, but this little scrubber does a better job,</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive so a major</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give a five stars but the high isn&#x27;t much of a difference from low to high power.</li>
            <li>recommended for everyone who wants a facial brush but doesn&#x27;t want to break their bank!</li>
            <li>I can tell it removes my make up completely.</li>
            <li>The softest by far is the manual brush.</li>
            <li>It works with 2 AA Batteries, and the brush head is so soft.</li>
            <li>Has two options for high or low.</li>
            <li>I only wish it came with a few more brushes (same size), because I don&#x27;t feel like these will outlast the machine</li>
            <li>If you have very delicate, sensitive skin, it might suit better.</li>

            <li>and I was using it very carefully since it was the first time .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and scars my entire life, I am 26 years old and still struggling.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to press very hard at all and since my skin is older and dry it really cleans very well.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very dissatisfied! I received this and the very first time I used it to cleanse my face with the sponge attachment, the sponge came off as soon as I turned it on. The brush attachment works just fine. I will never purchase from this company again. I can&#x27;t use the sponge at all.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> Really helped my acne go away with  my cleanser! ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact and easy to use.  But on the negative side, I was disappointed in the brush bristles and sponge... very soft, too soft for my needs.  I couldn&#x27;t see that even with the spinning, either attachment was any more effective than a good cleanser.  I didn&#x27;t find it worked that well in the exfoliating department. If you have very delicate, sensitive skin, it might suit better.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  You don&#x27;t have to press very hard at all and since my skin is older and dry it really cleans very well.  I bought my daughter one also and she loves her too.</li>
            <li> The sponge on the head came apart with first use and I was using it very carefully since it was the first time .  The brush is okay and does the job as advertised</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Nice gadget to cleanse face.Easy to handle, gentle on face. Has two options for high or low. I&#x27;d give a five stars but the high isn&#x27;t much of a difference from low to high power.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive so a major plus! I have not bought any other so I cannot compare to more expensive ones. I searched around before buying this one though. I liked that it came with the sponge and the brush. It works great! I use the sponge in the morning and for makeup removal and the brush for deep cleaning a couple times a week in the evening. I have had problems with blackheads my entire life and have never been able to get rid of them. In a couple weeks of using this, the ones on my nose are even starting to come out. I&#x27;m quite happy!</li>
            <li> Better than Clarisonic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this product after my clarisonic mia2  brush broke.  I used it for less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison with Clarisonic Mia2, I like this Clensure bruch better because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s a lot, I mean A LOT, cheaper!!!!  I paid my clarisonic brush over $100+  I can buy 5 of these!!!&lt;br /&gt;2.  The brush head has a circular motion where as clarisonic brush I had to make the circular motions myself.  My face feels much cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;3.  It&#x27;s battery operated.  My clarisonic brush broke and wouldn&#x27;t recharge.  I think it&#x27;s because it was wet and I had to recharge every so often.  I rather just pop in a new battery and use it when I&#x27;m ready instead of waiting for it to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It&#x27;s smaller in size.  I travel a lot and this is way better to carry it around with me and I don&#x27;t have to carry a charger with it.&lt;br /&gt;5.  It comes with not just the brush but a sponge!  I like using the sponge because it does get my make up off easily and it&#x27;s a cute mini size sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommended for everyone who wants a facial brush but doesn&#x27;t want to break their bank!</li>
            <li> So far I love it! ! I can tell it removes my make up completely. I have suffered from acne for as long as I can remember. I hope to continue to see results!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical because I tried a similar product called Olay Pro-X but these 2 items are entirely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush on this device is MUCH softer and feels good on my skin and the fact that it comes with a microdermabrasion sponge makes it so much better! I use this with my Origins: Checks and Balances foaming cleanser, but really you can use it with any type of foaming cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just 1 use, your skin feels so clean and pores feel CLEAR which is an amazing feeling after wearing makeup all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect product for anyone who wants to get a deep clean after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price either!!</li>
            <li> I love it, great price and came at expected time. I can feel the difference in my skin already from using it with my proactive!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine bought me a similar item five years ago as a gift. I used it very little and I didn&#x27;t see the point. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and scars my entire life, I am 26 years old and still struggling. After watching a commercial for a cleaner like this I started searching. I purchased this because of reviews and price. After only four days of using it I&#x27;m so impressed by my skin! Buy this, use it, my skin glows and I&#x27;ve never been so impressed by my complexion.</li>
            <li> Great product as described. Cleans really well and my face feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, good price, fast shipping. Love it!</li>
            <li> Using this with proactiv is perfect!</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a wonderful cleansing brush.  I only wish it came with a few more brushes (same size), because I don&#x27;t feel like these will outlast the machine and I don&#x27;t know where to get anymore.</li>
            <li> Excellent value! I never had one of these before and I read so many reviews before deciding on this one. Great item, super soft brush and sponge that rotate for you! Excellent packaging and fast shipping! Love it.</li>
            <li> This product leaves skin feeling smooth and clean.  The scrubbing action is very gentle but works well.  Well packaged and comfortable to hold- I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> Does it clean the skin ? if you put your cleanser on and let the brush turns it will do some cleaning.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the power or lack of. Is it better than the clarisonics that I&#x27;ve owned, no way near close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that many who are looking at this wonder how it compares to the Clarisonic, just as I originally did. I purchased the Clensure unit, a Clarisonic Mia, and a manual facial cleaning brush [[ASIN:B00DBRP3A6 MIU COLORÂ® Facial Cleaning Exfoliate Brush, Facial Skin Care Tool, Pore Cleaner Brush with High Grade Pine Brush Holder and Soft Bristle]]. I&#x27;ve used all three of these products with the oil cleansing method, so I can&#x27;t speak to how detergents foam up with each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles: The Clensure and the Clarisonic are rather close in softness; I think the Clarisonic brush might be a touch softer, and it is slightly larger than the Clensure brush. The softest by far is the manual brush. It is wonderfully soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: I like that the Clensure has replaceable batteries, though I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to determine how long they will last. I do not like the rechargeable battery on the Clarisonic. I use it for a few minutes a day, and it takes the rest of the day to recharge. Obviously, the manual brush wins on battery usage, except that it makes my arm tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motion: Here&#x27;s where it becomes obvious that the Clensure and the Clarisonic are two different types of device. The Clensure brush rotates, spinning around in circles. It literally drives itself across my face, and I feel like it tugs my skin. It also grabs at my hair if I get too close to my hairline and pulls it out from under my headband. The Clarisonic, on the other hand, seems to vibrate. It does not tug at my skin; rather, it seems to massage my skin as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the manual brush better than the Clensure, but I like the Clarisonic best of all. However, I would recommend the Clensure to use with microdermabrasion creams. I think it would work well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Brush head very soft and gentle on the skin. Two speeds a plus! Really like it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This brush is powerless. If any pressure applied to the bristles, the brush stops spinning. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as lower cost device during Christmas ad campaign for expensive alternatives.  I relied on reviews to pick this unit and am glad I did.  My wife loves it.  Says it makes her skin feel great and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clensure RC Rotating Facial Cleansing Brush Sponge System for about 3 weeks now, and can say that it absolutely has made a huge difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve always had small pimples in the same areas of my face that would continually come and go. After about a week of using this, no more breakouts!  My face feels seriously clean after using it. I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great price. Have used it twice now &amp; have seen  great results. Can only hope with time that it will vastly improve my complextion.</li>
            <li> Clensure RC Professional Skin Care Rotating Facial Cleansing Brush Sponge System is a very good product. It is small, and lightweight which is exactly what I needed. It works with 2 AA Batteries, and the brush head is so soft. I have combination skin, and wanted a brush that could take off all the excess oil, sweat, make-up and impurities at the end of the day. This brush does exactly that without breaking my wallet. Its a great buy and I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wish the heads were bigger. They were tiny when I opened thenpqckage. However for the price I paid, the brushes have done well for cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent price. Came very  promptly as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s now a regular part of my beauty regimen. Shipping was equally amazing, I did the next day delivery and got it next day in a snowstorm. I was surprised and pleased. I&#x27;ll be using this seller again.</li>
            <li> I live for proactive, but this little scrubber does a better job,</li>
