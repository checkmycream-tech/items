            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>BUT it is a cute color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think twice before getting many.  </li>
            <li>Love opi gelcolor</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I did okay</li>
            <li>My wife was very happy with this polish &amp; has purchased several colors since.</li>
            <li>OPI has such a great selection of gelcolor colors, I keep finding more I want!</li>
            <li>I love love love this shade of blue.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most darker gel colors, I was able to get complete coverage in just 2 coats.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you shake it very well before you use it too.</li>
            <li>: as with all dark polishes, you really need to apply this perfectly or it will be very noticeable.</li>
            <li>This color is fun to wear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice aqua blue color, like the ocean.</li>
            <li>It drips right off the nail.</li>
            <li>Its like a dark ocean blue this one is a creme with no shimmer, application was perfect, no shrinking.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable &amp; shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>The first coat will be streaky though it evens out.</li>
            <li>this is the exact color i used both times.  </li>
            <li>I did not like this one at first, but it grew on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>The color is pretty</li>
            <li>Super shine, long wear, yet easy removal with the OPI or Sephora wraps</li>
            <li>I think a bright pink glitter will be pretty too, will try that next.</li>
            <li>don’t get a whole bunch.  </li>
            <li>If you do, you will have a much easier time applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This polish is very watery.</li>
            <li>i bought 2 led nail polish lamps, neither one worked,  had the same results with both, one cheap other one much better.  </li>
            <li>Other than this misleading photo, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning</li>
            <li>If using on your toes, be sure to give yourself a full pedicure in advance, removing any dead skin cells near your nail beds.</li>
            <li>and it ends up being a flat blue that is actually pretty cute by itself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews I was hoping for more blue.</li>
            <li>It applies more like regular polish than some of the other gel-polish products out there.</li>
            <li>More like a royal dark, royal blue.  </li>
            <li>and if you take it in to a professional, they should do even</li>
            <li>I would recommend doing at least three coats to  make it so it doesn&#x27;t chip as easily.  </li>
            <li>I have found that some of the newer OPI gel colors tend to chip and wear away well before the two week mark and sometimes adding a third coat really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>Blue Gel color is hard to find but Amazon made my shopping easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually more like a dark blue (not as dark as Navy though), not the grayish blue it appears.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a deep, flat, cerulean blue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gel is super thick though, so you need to be careful about the amount you put on your nail, but</li>
            <li> but it is flat.</li>
            <li> this is a darker color than it appears to be than shown solid no glitter dark blue</li>
            <li> Soak your toes and scrape off cuticles and all that other junk prior to application.</li>
            <li> after sending the second one back i was wondering what was the common denominator.  </li>
            <li> The color is blue green, almost khaki.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in that because I own \\&quot;Yodel\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a dark teal.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it was either cut with acetone or just watered down.</li>
            <li> Really pretty Bluish cold if your looking for something</li>
            <li> This polish seems to chip &amp; peel less than the cheaper polish she has tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> So hard to visualize the color from the online picture.</li>
            <li> The density of color is insane, and you will definitely not need a separate coat, as you do with almost every other color.</li>
            <li> I have other opi gel polishes and none are this bad.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color is blue green, almost khaki. Not my favorite. Based on other reviews I was hoping for more blue.</li>
            <li> I love love love this shade of blue.  It&#x27;s almost like a dark teal.  Unlike most darker gel colors, I was able to get complete coverage in just 2 coats.  I had some white tips and some glittery acrylic tips on when I painted over them with this color - and you would never know.  It applies more like regular polish than some of the other gel-polish products out there.</li>
            <li> This color is awesome. It&#x27;s a teal blue. Shake well, or else it will be gloopy. I used two coats. The picture I posted is with flash, but it does look a bit different in different lights and I like that. It lasts about 10 days for me.</li>
            <li> This color is a great color that I have had a lot of compliments on.  I would recommend doing at least three coats to  make it so it doesn&#x27;t chip as easily.  I have found that some of the newer OPI gel colors tend to chip and wear away well before the two week mark and sometimes adding a third coat really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> Its like a dark ocean blue this one is a creme with no shimmer, application was perfect, no shrinking. The first coat will be streaky though it evens out.</li>
            <li> The picture looks NOTHING like the color when you get it-BUT it is a cute color.&lt;br /&gt;If rub alcohol on your nail after it has been cured it takes the gloss off and it ends up being a flat blue that is actually pretty cute by itself.&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 compliments on the color in one day!</li>
            <li> i bought 2 led nail polish lamps, neither one worked,  had the same results with both, one cheap other one much better.  nail polish came out the same in both.  after sending the second one back i was wondering what was the common denominator.  this nail polish.  i would bet it was this nail polish.  i can’t send it back or the many colors i also purchased that are un opened because it is hazardous material.  this is the exact color i used both times.  think twice before getting many.  just try out one.  don’t get a whole bunch.  and don’t get this one.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So hard to visualize the color from the online picture. Did not like this blue.  Not the color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Really pretty Bluish cold if your looking for something different!&lt;br /&gt;Works as its supposed to.  I have had a bottle of OPI gel not work so great.</li>
            <li> I did not like this one at first, but it grew on me. Great toe nail color!! It&#x27;s pretty but it is flat. I added silver glitter to give it some depth. I think a bright pink glitter will be pretty too, will try that next.</li>
            <li> Blue Gel color is hard to find but Amazon made my shopping easy.  You save time and it only takes one click.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> The color is not like the photo</li>
            <li> Love opi gelcolor this is a darker color than it appears to be than shown solid no glitter dark blue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard gel polish required multiple coats to get an opaque finish. Let me know, that is NOT a problem here. The density of color is insane, and you will definitely not need a separate coat, as you do with almost every other color. I think the color shown in the photo is a bit misleading. It&#x27;s actually more like a dark blue (not as dark as Navy though), not the grayish blue it appears. More like a royal dark, royal blue.  Other than this misleading photo, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: as with all dark polishes, you really need to apply this perfectly or it will be very noticeable. If using on your toes, be sure to give yourself a full pedicure in advance, removing any dead skin cells near your nail beds. Address error with specialty pointed cotton swabs and nail polish remover. Soak your toes and scrape off cuticles and all that other junk prior to application. If you do, you will have a much easier time applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: BEST&lt;br /&gt;Removal: BEST&lt;br /&gt;Application: Good&lt;br /&gt;Color: So-So</li>
            <li> Good product, prompt delivery&lt;br /&gt;Fun peacock blue. I got lots of compliments wearing it&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a number of gel polishes but OPI is the best. Super shine, long wear, yet easy removal with the OPI or Sephora wraps</li>
            <li> This polish is very watery. Seems like it was either cut with acetone or just watered down. I have other opi gel polishes and none are this bad. It drips right off the nail.</li>
            <li> This color is fun to wear.  It is a little hard to apply.  You will need to put on multiple layers to get the tru color.  Make sure you shake it very well before you use it too.</li>
            <li> I am wearing this color as I type this and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The gel is super thick though, so you need to be careful about the amount you put on your nail, but I did okay and if you take it in to a professional, they should do even better.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a deep, flat, cerulean blue. Does that make sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people were unimpressed with it, but I think it was a great addition to my blues collection.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of OPI get polish. The color is pretty but I won&#x27;t buy OPI again. Only Gelish brand for me!</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy with this polish &amp; has purchased several colors since. The price was reasonable &amp; shipping was quick. This polish seems to chip &amp; peel less than the cheaper polish she has tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Perfect for AV&#x27;s colored nails.</li>
            <li> Very similar to Yodel me on my Cell.  A little disappointed in that because I own \\&quot;Yodel\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a nice aqua blue color, like the ocean.</li>
            <li> Love this color! OPI has such a great selection of gelcolor colors, I keep finding more I want! Looking forward to my next pick.</li>
            <li> This is just the color I was looking for.  I have had many compliments and inquiries about it!! Thank you</li>
