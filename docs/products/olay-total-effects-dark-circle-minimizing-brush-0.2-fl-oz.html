            <li>Good luck !</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and the cream made my skin under my eyes look bright orange.</li>
            <li>The coverage wasn&#x27;t great -</li>
            <li>Great product, reduces puffiness....</li>
            <li>Anti-Aging Eye Cream is a great idea and could have been a great product</li>
            <li>it would have been great to have fewer undereye lines.</li>
            <li>This is great for the days that I&#x27;m looking like</li>
            <li>happy happy..</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product online.  </li>
            <li>Goes on very nicely but does nothing to improve under eye area.</li>
            <li>I use it under my concealer and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>She loved this product and her eyes have regained their brightness and he lines have diminished greatly.  </li>
            <li>The color is perfect for my light skin.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet run out of this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks to be fair and give it a chance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned Caucasian with auburn hair.</li>
            <li>, I kept on using it because it did make me look good (and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about?)</li>
            <li>This product is really good</li>
            <li>I loved the product &amp; I will buy again.</li>
            <li>does a good job of covering</li>
            <li>Perhaps some of the comments about a concealer being just as good and cheaper, and not understanding the need for the brush, etc.</li>
            <li>This worked fairly well in the summer, if/when the rest of my face was tan, but as we all know, we aren&#x27;t even supposed to get a tan if we can help it.</li>
            <li>Olay is good and the type of brush is good.</li>
            <li>Works, looks good on, feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great eye cream for more of a tinted moisturizer with added glow.</li>
            <li>Non oily, with a very light and pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and think it works wonders!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite ever items and of course Olay is discontinuing it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>It works great for me as a lightly tinted under-eye</li>
            <li>The description says it&#x27;s good for most skin tones</li>
            <li>The one thing I haven&#x27;t noted in the reviews is that it has a nice cooling effect when applied, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t even cover them that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a night shift worker, this will come in handy around 4am.</li>
            <li>If you read the tube it says, avoid contact with eyes, which I find amusing for an eye product.</li>
            <li>I felt as though I was doing more harm than good by pulling on the skin tissue under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>I normally use YSL Touche Eclat which is a miracle in a tube but for the price and for work and errands, this Olay product is great!</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re talking about a really good cream then you&#x27;re shelling out $25 - $50 easy.</li>
            <li>had a light fair colored tint to it.</li>
            <li>First, the disclosure -- I am a 49-year-old woman whom no product will make beautiful.  </li>
            <li>She reports it spreads very smoothly and the color works for her.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth</li>
            <li>I feel confident about my look while wearing this product; I love how it brightens my eye area and seemingly takes years off.  </li>
            <li>I love you.  </li>
            <li>Are there are more than 5 stars?</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>She has purchased this product again once she ran out, so I can safely recommend it as it has been deemed worthwhile in our house.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay products for over 30 years and love them all.  </li>
            <li>I guess a Regenerist product would be more appropriate for that, but I was hopeful to have some line minimizing which has not happened</li>
            <li>She said it does this by moisurizing skin and providing a number of vitamins that are healthy for the skin.  </li>
            <li>my concealer worked much better than this.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely love a product that does what this one promises.  </li>
            <li>and I love to share if they want to listen, so</li>
            <li>Shiseido, Burt&#x27;s Bees and Estee Lauder are great for eye products, as much as I adore Olay products</li>
            <li>this seems a bit bizarre from them, not a concealer and not a cream, a nothing in between!</li>
            <li>read some of the many reviews where women did not like this product</li>
            <li>I also advise drink lot of water that helps the most.</li>
            <li>It makes me look more awake in the morning.</li>
            <li>Read more at [...]</li>
            <li>It is olay what more can I say.</li>
            <li>Love this product,</li>
            <li>Says it works on most skin tones</li>
            <li>My favorite under-eye concealer.  </li>
            <li>I love the product,but I didn&#x27;t like the brush.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Touching the brush to the skin repeatedly seems like a bit of a health concern.</li>
            <li>For me, this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>but it sure beats wasting your money on junk.</li>
            <li>maybe if i tried it for an extended period of time it would&#x27;ve worked more on that, but hey--good for what it DID do.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products and just love love love</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Olay....</li>
            <li>Even though I purchased two of these, I wasn&#x27;t able to use even one.  </li>
            <li>There are much better products out there which I prefer.</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>but I kept using it just to see if I would be able to see a change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I love all Olay products and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I do use it on top of a heavier concealer if I am going for a more structured day, but by itself if I am just running errands, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love this, repeat purchase it</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is way too bright for human skin and just gives you bright flesh colored circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>The plunger/brush makes it so easy to use and store. :)</li>
            <li>My suggestion to the Olay Company: simplify the name to more accurately indicate what the product is, an Anti-Aging Eye Cream and Concealer, and note on the box specifically who it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li>I love it and wish it was actually available in Australia.</li>
            <li>but i love it as a light concealer.</li>
            <li>Love the application feels smooth going on brush.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a good size, not too much, but not a ripoff stingy amount of product.  </li>
            <li>It gives that gentle tingling feeling you get from a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>my colleagues, on the other hand, think this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>, it has no odor, a slight brightening affect, perfect for warm or dark or olive tones, but I imagine fair and light would love it also, highly recommend, you feel like it is a good product as you apply it!</li>
            <li>The brush enables the cream to be applied easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>No, this is not meant to be a heavy eye cream, but I think it does a good job at what it says it should do, and will be great for travel as well.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily with the brush.  </li>
            <li>I am very loyal to my make up products</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for dark circles or acne spots.</li>
            <li>product is easy to use, click the end (like with a pen) and use the brush applicator to smooth the flesh colored cream under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with the start of any fine lines I do have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the Olay applicator is easy to use and the cream glides on smoothly with no tugging or pulling.  </li>
            <li>the convienent stick can fit easily in my make-up bag</li>
            <li>The consistency is fine but the product sank into and emphasized the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>And anything that is so easy I can use it in the car wins my vote!    </li>
            <li>I used another brush to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>You will need to use your fingers or a make-up sponge to completely smooth the cream under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s honestly so light in consistency, it blended well.</li>
            <li>When I bought it at the store, that is what the package advertising made it sound like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it because it was free, but I would not recommend a purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a neutral tan, which works on me (I&#x27;m an African-American with light skin)</li>
            <li>Just apply lightly and don&#x27;t over do it .</li>
            <li>However, I think this is primarily an under eye concealer.  </li>
            <li>B0017OJPAE Neutrogena 3-in-1 Concealer For Eyes, SPF 20, Light 10, 0.37-Ounces (10.4 g)]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a great believer in skin care, and this product seems to have the necessary ingredients.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give a smooth finish and the colors just weren&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I use the brush to distribute as much as I can, then I blend really lightly with my finger, it almost seems to just absorb right into my skin like a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty huge - for the under-eyes, and the amount that comes out is way too much to be able to blend in easily.  </li>
            <li>I love how I can click the bottom and just the right amount is dispensed into the brush tip applicator.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product, as I love the Olay/Covergirl concealers, but at a price tag of $20 this is a RIP OFF!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my job requires me to look healthy and energetic when I&#x27;m meeting high clients.  </li>
            <li>so when I saw this product I got excited.  </li>
            <li>I punched the button and was able to use it the first time.  </li>
            <li>First, I was under the impression that this would be more of an anti-aging cream.  </li>
            <li>I was quite excited to see this product advertised.</li>
            <li>Applicator is divine, brush-liquid great for touchups during the day and product lasts a long time before emptying.  </li>
            <li>eyes still puffy, wrinkled, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of a product that would treat and conceal at the same time.</li>
            <li>about the only good think I can claim.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re in the market for a good concealer, then I would definitely recommend this for that use.  </li>
            <li>Initially I really wasn&#x27;t too sure</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>product might work better for an older woman whose skin has thinned and developed more wrinkles, requiring a thinner concealing product that won&#x27;t settle into fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Olay Total Effects comes in only one color and it would work best with medium skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Well lo and behold, within 3 weeks, I genuinely saw a real difference in my light crow&#x27;s feet and</li>
            <li>I am one of the lucky ones that does not have crow&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li>does NOT cover well when applied, does not give adequate coverage under my eyes.</li>
            <li>That said, this Total Effects brush is perhaps the best value I&#x27;ve come across for instant, visible results.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s great if the tint is a match for your skin type but its too dark for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking for a product that&#x27;s easy and quick to use, and would take the place of painstakingly dotting concealer around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Olay usually makes excellent anti aging creams are reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This truly is a wonderful product it covers dark circles, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>This is the first Olay product I have ever purchased that I do NOT like!</li>
            <li>Anti-aging Eye Cream may possibly work okay for somebody with a dark/fakish orange tan skin tone, but it definitely did not work for my fair skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I sweep it below my eyes and across my upper lids, blend it in with my fingertip and looks like I had a nice nap.</li>
            <li>cuz other wise</li>
            <li>This product delivers just the right amount of moisture and slightest hint of coverage that make up could provide without the look of make up.</li>
            <li>I like the way it works with the built in brush applicator which dispenses just the right amount of product when you press the button on the end of it.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, the color, consistency, brush, etc. are just right</li>
            <li>Because the Olay Total Effect 7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush is one of the best products ever!   </li>
            <li>In summary, I found it simultaneously gloppy and drying, and it is waaay too dark, even though I am not that fair.  </li>
            <li>It is tinted and is too dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to dark for my fair to medium complexion</li>
            <li>It probably would work better for someone with a little more color in their skin.</li>
            <li>But, still, for mornings following nights when I&#x27;ve had one too many, it is useful.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I even used it lightly over my entire face with just a light dusting of mineral powder over it to look polished for work.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and it  made me look like I was in the yellowish stage of recovering from two black eyes.  </li>
            <li>The brush is nice and big and allows for easy, mess-free application; the cream itself is instantly absorbed into the surrounding eye areas, instantly brightening &amp; toning under eye circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the price because I haven&#x27;t been able to find ALL of those good things in any other single product.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how easily this blends in with my skin tone, and I may even be able to replace it with my regular tube concealer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not Olay 7 works on them, but for fine lines, I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, it was gloppy as another reviewer described.</li>
            <li>This product is just like the redheaded stepchild in your otherwise stellar line of products.</li>
            <li>need to apply make up over this cream to hide it unless your skin tone is the exact match of the cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to moisturize pretty well -</li>
            <li>The circles are still pretty visible.</li>
            <li>I think the advertising is very misleading!</li>
            <li>I have now found that Rodan &amp; Fields eye cream really works instead on the eye area for anti-age, puffiness, &amp; concealing!</li>
            <li>I LOVE Olay Total Effects</li>
            <li>First of all, it is VERY orangey!</li>
            <li>and I would switch from the higher priced department store product to this one in a minute.  </li>
            <li>I have the same reaction as most of them.</li>
            <li>I first used this product a couple of years ago when I was in the USA</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t conceal my underye circles and I definitely needed an undereye cream and concealer on top of it.</li>
            <li>First, the advertising leads one to believe that the brush eliminates the need to blend or dab, but the directions call for exactly that.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it consistently as a result, so</li>
            <li>I wish that I had read the reviews on this first</li>
            <li>This is the first under eye concealer that doesn&#x27;t collect in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Have looked all over for another one as I have used up my first one.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have found it on amazon (should have looked here first.)  </li>
            <li>I first purchased it six months ago, when it ran out</li>
            <li>My sister tried it too to see if maybe i just had a rare reaction and the same thing happened to her as well as 2 major fine huge lines under her eyes like me that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li>In fact, I love Olay 7 so much, I&#x27;m ordering two of these eye creams now and sending them to my mother-in-law, who will bring them with her to London next week as I can&#x27;t find this product here.</li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>The tone is, as others report, distinctly orange, and in my case darker than my normal skin color.</li>
            <li>This Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush is really a nice product.  </li>
            <li>It glides easily and instantly provides a glow to the undereye area.</li>
            <li>this might be worth looking at, but as I said before, there are much better products for hiding dark</li>
            <li>It does seem to have moisturizing properties and for skin of a certain age</li>
            <li>As Olay explained to me over the phone after I submitted questions, this product is targeted toward those experiencing beginning signs of aging such as fine lines and dryness.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for several weeks, and it is fine as a concealer, but I have not noticed any decrease in under eye circles or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not giving it a very high review because I did not care for the brush applicator.</li>
            <li>When the product came, I immediately realized that it was developed for a much more limited and specific consumer (Caucasian women with medium-to-light skin), and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to do with it ...</li>
            <li>Considering I really only bought this to use up the rest of the money from a gift card, it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth, isn&#x27;t noticeable when it&#x27;s on..</li>
            <li>.20 ounces of a product is just not that much product in a rather clunky applicator.  </li>
            <li>It looks like I&#x27;m in the majority here of reviewers who don&#x27;t really care for this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was going to be a great product, but it was too thin to use as a cover-up</li>
            <li>The color is expected to work for \\&quot;most people,\\&quot; and it comes in just this one shade.      </li>
            <li>Although I can get away with it, I&#x27;d be so much happier with a selection of shades.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say it has helped much.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken \\&quot;before\\&quot; pics to show you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The cream is really a liquid...like a liquid foundation.     </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t customize how much liquid comes out on the brush</li>
            <li>and I often wound up with too much liquid for application.     </li>
            <li>I really did want to like this.  </li>
            <li>I have medium light Asian skin with a peachy undertone.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for this product.  </li>
            <li>Also very moisturizing</li>
            <li>but when I used less and applied it with a lighter hand, I was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>I use an eye treatment first, let it dry then use this as a concealer lightly patting it on under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>As many of the other reviewers have stated, yes, this is more like a concealer and not really what I&#x27;d call a cream.</li>
            <li>My favorite part was the $3 coupon I got for Olay&#x27;s other products that I am eagerly waiting to buy.</li>
            <li>I love some of the other Olay products and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this Eye Cream.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products and am an active user and purchaser of them.  </li>
            <li>The product felt okay, but the shade was much too dark for my skin, and by the time I blended it in</li>
            <li>The price is too high and it requires too much work.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend applied cream to thin out and make look more natural though making it less effective in hiding circles.</li>
            <li>It can also be used on minor blemishes/acne/dark spots as a light concealer.  </li>
            <li>The product was okay as a concealer (admittedly a tad bit on the dark side)</li>
            <li>You have to wonder how they could have such a huge miss because this one clearly isn&#x27;t hitting the marks.</li>
            <li>With a closer color match, the product would blend in better and be less obtrusive which I believe is the goal of a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did rub in smoothly and my skin actually felt soft, but that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Its great to conceal any dark spots and dark circles.</li>
            <li>and I think Olay perhaps did not do a good job in packaging description and failed to set the right customer expectations.</li>
            <li>I love this product for dealing with my dark circles!</li>
            <li>I have very light colorerd skin (pale and pasty</li>
            <li>I have very dark circles under my eyes, and this has been my favorite product for years now.  </li>
            <li>A real hassle on busy mornings and led me to question why they would have the eye cream come out on a brush.  </li>
            <li>Also, the directions go on to say that after each use, you should wipe the brush clean with a tissue AND let the brush dry thoroughly before replacing the cap--</li>
            <li>I figured that when it dried, it may be a bit more opaque.</li>
            <li>This CC Cream looks so good on and around my eyes that I wear it alone with only mascara - no more eyeliner pencil or eye shadow whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I love to mix their serums with my everyday foundations</li>
            <li>In my own case, my dark circles are likely hereditary rather than age-related, but still, I was hoping that this product would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a line minimizer, then shell out a few more bucks for an Olay Regenerist product.</li>
            <li>With so many eye and face products on the market I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time on this, not recommended from my experience.     </li>
            <li>When the product is sufficiently blended and absorbed into the skin, the eye area does not look any different</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite the consistency of concealer or anything you&#x27;d normally use on your face.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer it than the normal eye shadows correctors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 yrs and have normal aging skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of lightening those dark circles that make you look like the living dead.</li>
            <li>you see, I&#x27;m a Caucasian man with a somewhat pale complexion whose \\&quot;treatment regimen\\&quot; consists of nothing more than a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer with sports sunblock.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually think the color of the cream is really right for me.</li>
            <li>but unlike in other reviews, the consistency of this product is really light and mine</li>
            <li>A lot of eye creams I&#x27;ve used before have created little light colored bead like spots which I&#x27;ve been told is from too much moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Loved the consistency and brush applicator, but unfortunately was too dark for me, a selection of colors would be fabulous!</li>
            <li>before I went to work - otherwise, people would have been trying to help me, the newly elderly woman, across the street and give me their seat on the bus.   </li>
            <li>Within a week dryness was gradually disappearing, while new moisture is replacing it.</li>
            <li>This did make it easy to blend, and it did seem to have a slightly moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li>It never really seemed clean to me, even after I cleaned it with alcohol on a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eyes...</li>
            <li>You might want to try it at a retail store first to see if it can blend properly for your skin</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve been using the Olay pen, I feel like I look rested and my fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a week now and enjoy the job it does on lightening the dark under eye circles.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly light skinned and have dark circles on a daily basis no matter how much sleep I get.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that is has to dry, before I lightly dust with powder over it.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and permanent dark undereye circles; like other reviewers, I found this product mysteriously below-standard for an Olay product.  </li>
            <li>However, the brush remained quite hard, almost more like a palette knife than a brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and not jarring to the undereye but how hygenic is this method of product delivery.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and at nearly 1/4&#x27;s of a BUCK, it&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
            <li>I found the brush a bit unwieldy to use; it was easier for me to apply the product directly to my finger and then use my finger to dot the product under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The brush is a waste since you must smooth the product in with a finger or sponge after application.  </li>
            <li>Anti-aging Eye Cream absolutely does work but by initially appearing to be \\&quot;just a concealer\\&quot;, women feel they are misled and assume that&#x27;s all there is to the product.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The brush really works so there is no residue on your fingers to need to wash off in the middle of applying makeup.     </li>
            <li>It covers circles well, and blends into skin to make a natural look.</li>
            <li>I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer something that simply squirts a bit on a disposable sponge or your fingertip for application.</li>
            <li>It is soft for my eyes, and knowing that I have a sensitive skin, this product does not produce damages or irritations in my eyes.</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel soft ---and</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just missing the point and there is someone who actually likes this better, but it was just not for me</li>
            <li>I was worried that the flesh colored cream was a little too dark but it blended nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is no worse than most other concealers and not better.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the reviews first and saved the $26.99 I spent on this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46, have few fine lines around my eyes and find this product totally diminishes them!</li>
            <li>I have light skin with blue eyes and very dark circles.  </li>
            <li>and I saw a huge difference in only a few days of usage.</li>
            <li>However, I was interested mainly because I have struggled with dark circles for years, dating back to my 20s.  </li>
            <li>There are no messy bottles to open and close.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had read reviews before I spent too much on this Olay product.  </li>
            <li>really well - I keep one of the empty ones to help even out the color under my eyes.</li>
            <li>next odd thing was that the liquid was much darker than my normal complexion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Opening the product for the first time was odd.  </li>
            <li>other reviewers have noted, way too much product comes out at a time, so even with the brush, you&#x27;ll still need to use your fingers and/or dab some off with a tissue.</li>
            <li>But like I said in the other Oil of Olay products, I like this company but they carry to much STUFF</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to note a decrease in wrinkles yet, but fortunately that&#x27;s not a huge issue for me yet.    </li>
            <li>the record, I am 58 years old, have been wearing makeup for 45 years but using actual skin care or anti-aging products for maybe the last 5 years ... and am often mistaken to be 10 years younger.r.</li>
            <li>but I disagree so strongly with the negative reviews that I felt compelled to write!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead, I got something that helps to cover dark circles, but really has no noticeable effect regarding minimizing them.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was looking for a miracle, or expecting too much, but while this product hid my dark circles they realy</li>
            <li>Maybe you could wash the brush frequently, but that is another step to the beauty routine that seems unnecessary to me when other products do a better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the color was too dark for under my eyes (fair skinned) and served only to create under eye circles.      </li>
    </ol>

            <li> happy happy..</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product online.  </li>
            <li> Goes on very nicely but does nothing to improve under eye area.</li>
            <li> I use it under my concealer and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> She loved this product and her eyes have regained their brightness and he lines have diminished greatly.  </li>
            <li> The color is perfect for my light skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet run out of this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks to be fair and give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned Caucasian with auburn hair.</li>
            <li> , I kept on using it because it did make me look good (and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about?)</li>
            <li> This product is really good</li>
            <li> I loved the product &amp; I will buy again.</li>
            <li> does a good job of covering</li>
            <li> Perhaps some of the comments about a concealer being just as good and cheaper, and not understanding the need for the brush, etc.</li>
            <li> This worked fairly well in the summer, if/when the rest of my face was tan, but as we all know, we aren&#x27;t even supposed to get a tan if we can help it.</li>
            <li> Olay is good and the type of brush is good.</li>
            <li> Works, looks good on, feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream for more of a tinted moisturizer with added glow.</li>
            <li> Non oily, with a very light and pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and think it works wonders!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite ever items and of course Olay is discontinuing it!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> It works great for me as a lightly tinted under-eye</li>
            <li> The description says it&#x27;s good for most skin tones</li>
            <li> The one thing I haven&#x27;t noted in the reviews is that it has a nice cooling effect when applied, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t even cover them that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a night shift worker, this will come in handy around 4am.</li>
            <li> If you read the tube it says, avoid contact with eyes, which I find amusing for an eye product.</li>
            <li> I felt as though I was doing more harm than good by pulling on the skin tissue under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> I normally use YSL Touche Eclat which is a miracle in a tube but for the price and for work and errands, this Olay product is great!</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re talking about a really good cream then you&#x27;re shelling out $25 - $50 easy.</li>
            <li> had a light fair colored tint to it.</li>
            <li> First, the disclosure -- I am a 49-year-old woman whom no product will make beautiful.  </li>
            <li> She reports it spreads very smoothly and the color works for her.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth</li>
            <li> I feel confident about my look while wearing this product; I love how it brightens my eye area and seemingly takes years off.  </li>
            <li> I love you.  </li>
            <li> Are there are more than 5 stars?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> She has purchased this product again once she ran out, so I can safely recommend it as it has been deemed worthwhile in our house.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for over 30 years and love them all.  </li>
            <li> I guess a Regenerist product would be more appropriate for that, but I was hopeful to have some line minimizing which has not happened</li>
            <li> She said it does this by moisurizing skin and providing a number of vitamins that are healthy for the skin.  </li>
            <li> my concealer worked much better than this.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely love a product that does what this one promises.  </li>
            <li> and I love to share if they want to listen, so</li>
            <li> Shiseido, Burt&#x27;s Bees and Estee Lauder are great for eye products, as much as I adore Olay products</li>
            <li> this seems a bit bizarre from them, not a concealer and not a cream, a nothing in between!</li>
            <li> read some of the many reviews where women did not like this product</li>
            <li> I also advise drink lot of water that helps the most.</li>
            <li> It makes me look more awake in the morning.</li>
            <li> Read more at [...]</li>
            <li> It is olay what more can I say.</li>
            <li> Love this product,</li>
            <li> Says it works on most skin tones</li>
            <li> My favorite under-eye concealer.  </li>
            <li> I love the product,but I didn&#x27;t like the brush.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Touching the brush to the skin repeatedly seems like a bit of a health concern.</li>
            <li> For me, this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> but it sure beats wasting your money on junk.</li>
            <li> maybe if i tried it for an extended period of time it would&#x27;ve worked more on that, but hey--good for what it DID do.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and just love love love</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love Olay....</li>
            <li> Even though I purchased two of these, I wasn&#x27;t able to use even one.  </li>
            <li> There are much better products out there which I prefer.</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> but I kept using it just to see if I would be able to see a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I love all Olay products and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> I do use it on top of a heavier concealer if I am going for a more structured day, but by itself if I am just running errands, etc.  </li>
            <li> I love this, repeat purchase it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is way too bright for human skin and just gives you bright flesh colored circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> The plunger/brush makes it so easy to use and store. :)</li>
            <li> My suggestion to the Olay Company: simplify the name to more accurately indicate what the product is, an Anti-Aging Eye Cream and Concealer, and note on the box specifically who it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li> I love it and wish it was actually available in Australia.</li>
            <li> but i love it as a light concealer.</li>
            <li> Love the application feels smooth going on brush.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a good size, not too much, but not a ripoff stingy amount of product.  </li>
            <li> It gives that gentle tingling feeling you get from a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> my colleagues, on the other hand, think this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> , it has no odor, a slight brightening affect, perfect for warm or dark or olive tones, but I imagine fair and light would love it also, highly recommend, you feel like it is a good product as you apply it!</li>
            <li> The brush enables the cream to be applied easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> No, this is not meant to be a heavy eye cream, but I think it does a good job at what it says it should do, and will be great for travel as well.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily with the brush.  </li>
            <li> I am very loyal to my make up products</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for dark circles or acne spots.</li>
            <li> product is easy to use, click the end (like with a pen) and use the brush applicator to smooth the flesh colored cream under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with the start of any fine lines I do have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the Olay applicator is easy to use and the cream glides on smoothly with no tugging or pulling.  </li>
            <li> the convienent stick can fit easily in my make-up bag</li>
            <li> The consistency is fine but the product sank into and emphasized the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> And anything that is so easy I can use it in the car wins my vote!    </li>
            <li> I used another brush to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> You will need to use your fingers or a make-up sponge to completely smooth the cream under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s honestly so light in consistency, it blended well.</li>
            <li> When I bought it at the store, that is what the package advertising made it sound like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it because it was free, but I would not recommend a purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a neutral tan, which works on me (I&#x27;m an African-American with light skin)</li>
            <li> Just apply lightly and don&#x27;t over do it .</li>
            <li> However, I think this is primarily an under eye concealer.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a great believer in skin care, and this product seems to have the necessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give a smooth finish and the colors just weren&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> and I use the brush to distribute as much as I can, then I blend really lightly with my finger, it almost seems to just absorb right into my skin like a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty huge - for the under-eyes, and the amount that comes out is way too much to be able to blend in easily.  </li>
            <li> I love how I can click the bottom and just the right amount is dispensed into the brush tip applicator.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product, as I love the Olay/Covergirl concealers, but at a price tag of $20 this is a RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my job requires me to look healthy and energetic when I&#x27;m meeting high clients.  </li>
            <li> so when I saw this product I got excited.  </li>
            <li> I punched the button and was able to use it the first time.  </li>
            <li> First, I was under the impression that this would be more of an anti-aging cream.  </li>
            <li> I was quite excited to see this product advertised.</li>
            <li> Applicator is divine, brush-liquid great for touchups during the day and product lasts a long time before emptying.  </li>
            <li> eyes still puffy, wrinkled, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of a product that would treat and conceal at the same time.</li>
            <li> about the only good think I can claim.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re in the market for a good concealer, then I would definitely recommend this for that use.  </li>
            <li> Initially I really wasn&#x27;t too sure</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> product might work better for an older woman whose skin has thinned and developed more wrinkles, requiring a thinner concealing product that won&#x27;t settle into fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Olay Total Effects comes in only one color and it would work best with medium skin tones.  </li>
            <li> Well lo and behold, within 3 weeks, I genuinely saw a real difference in my light crow&#x27;s feet and</li>
            <li> I am one of the lucky ones that does not have crow&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li> does NOT cover well when applied, does not give adequate coverage under my eyes.</li>
            <li> That said, this Total Effects brush is perhaps the best value I&#x27;ve come across for instant, visible results.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s great if the tint is a match for your skin type but its too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking for a product that&#x27;s easy and quick to use, and would take the place of painstakingly dotting concealer around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Olay usually makes excellent anti aging creams are reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This truly is a wonderful product it covers dark circles, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> This is the first Olay product I have ever purchased that I do NOT like!</li>
            <li> Anti-aging Eye Cream may possibly work okay for somebody with a dark/fakish orange tan skin tone, but it definitely did not work for my fair skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I sweep it below my eyes and across my upper lids, blend it in with my fingertip and looks like I had a nice nap.</li>
            <li> cuz other wise</li>
            <li> This product delivers just the right amount of moisture and slightest hint of coverage that make up could provide without the look of make up.</li>
            <li> I like the way it works with the built in brush applicator which dispenses just the right amount of product when you press the button on the end of it.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, the color, consistency, brush, etc. are just right</li>
            <li> Because the Olay Total Effect 7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush is one of the best products ever!   </li>
            <li> In summary, I found it simultaneously gloppy and drying, and it is waaay too dark, even though I am not that fair.  </li>
            <li> It is tinted and is too dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to dark for my fair to medium complexion</li>
            <li> It probably would work better for someone with a little more color in their skin.</li>
            <li> But, still, for mornings following nights when I&#x27;ve had one too many, it is useful.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I even used it lightly over my entire face with just a light dusting of mineral powder over it to look polished for work.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and it  made me look like I was in the yellowish stage of recovering from two black eyes.  </li>
            <li> The brush is nice and big and allows for easy, mess-free application; the cream itself is instantly absorbed into the surrounding eye areas, instantly brightening &amp; toning under eye circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the price because I haven&#x27;t been able to find ALL of those good things in any other single product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how easily this blends in with my skin tone, and I may even be able to replace it with my regular tube concealer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not Olay 7 works on them, but for fine lines, I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, it was gloppy as another reviewer described.</li>
            <li> This product is just like the redheaded stepchild in your otherwise stellar line of products.</li>
            <li> need to apply make up over this cream to hide it unless your skin tone is the exact match of the cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize pretty well -</li>
            <li> The circles are still pretty visible.</li>
            <li> I think the advertising is very misleading!</li>
            <li> I have now found that Rodan &amp; Fields eye cream really works instead on the eye area for anti-age, puffiness, &amp; concealing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Olay Total Effects</li>
            <li> First of all, it is VERY orangey!</li>
            <li> and I would switch from the higher priced department store product to this one in a minute.  </li>
            <li> I have the same reaction as most of them.</li>
            <li> I first used this product a couple of years ago when I was in the USA</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t conceal my underye circles and I definitely needed an undereye cream and concealer on top of it.</li>
            <li> First, the advertising leads one to believe that the brush eliminates the need to blend or dab, but the directions call for exactly that.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it consistently as a result, so</li>
            <li> I wish that I had read the reviews on this first</li>
            <li> This is the first under eye concealer that doesn&#x27;t collect in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Have looked all over for another one as I have used up my first one.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have found it on amazon (should have looked here first.)  </li>
            <li> I first purchased it six months ago, when it ran out</li>
            <li> My sister tried it too to see if maybe i just had a rare reaction and the same thing happened to her as well as 2 major fine huge lines under her eyes like me that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> In fact, I love Olay 7 so much, I&#x27;m ordering two of these eye creams now and sending them to my mother-in-law, who will bring them with her to London next week as I can&#x27;t find this product here.</li>
            <li> a positive note</li>
            <li> The tone is, as others report, distinctly orange, and in my case darker than my normal skin color.</li>
            <li> This Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush is really a nice product.  </li>
            <li> It glides easily and instantly provides a glow to the undereye area.</li>
            <li> this might be worth looking at, but as I said before, there are much better products for hiding dark</li>
            <li> It does seem to have moisturizing properties and for skin of a certain age</li>
            <li> As Olay explained to me over the phone after I submitted questions, this product is targeted toward those experiencing beginning signs of aging such as fine lines and dryness.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks, and it is fine as a concealer, but I have not noticed any decrease in under eye circles or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving it a very high review because I did not care for the brush applicator.</li>
            <li> When the product came, I immediately realized that it was developed for a much more limited and specific consumer (Caucasian women with medium-to-light skin), and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to do with it ...</li>
            <li> Considering I really only bought this to use up the rest of the money from a gift card, it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth, isn&#x27;t noticeable when it&#x27;s on..</li>
            <li> .20 ounces of a product is just not that much product in a rather clunky applicator.  </li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;m in the majority here of reviewers who don&#x27;t really care for this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was going to be a great product, but it was too thin to use as a cover-up</li>
            <li> The color is expected to work for \\&quot;most people,\\&quot; and it comes in just this one shade.      </li>
            <li> Although I can get away with it, I&#x27;d be so much happier with a selection of shades.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say it has helped much.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken \\&quot;before\\&quot; pics to show you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cream is really a liquid...like a liquid foundation.     </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t customize how much liquid comes out on the brush</li>
            <li> and I often wound up with too much liquid for application.     </li>
            <li> I really did want to like this.  </li>
            <li> I have medium light Asian skin with a peachy undertone.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this product.  </li>
            <li> Also very moisturizing</li>
            <li> but when I used less and applied it with a lighter hand, I was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use an eye treatment first, let it dry then use this as a concealer lightly patting it on under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> As many of the other reviewers have stated, yes, this is more like a concealer and not really what I&#x27;d call a cream.</li>
            <li> My favorite part was the $3 coupon I got for Olay&#x27;s other products that I am eagerly waiting to buy.</li>
            <li> I love some of the other Olay products and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and am an active user and purchaser of them.  </li>
            <li> The product felt okay, but the shade was much too dark for my skin, and by the time I blended it in</li>
            <li> The price is too high and it requires too much work.</li>
            <li> Easy to blend applied cream to thin out and make look more natural though making it less effective in hiding circles.</li>
            <li> It can also be used on minor blemishes/acne/dark spots as a light concealer.  </li>
            <li> The product was okay as a concealer (admittedly a tad bit on the dark side)</li>
            <li> You have to wonder how they could have such a huge miss because this one clearly isn&#x27;t hitting the marks.</li>
            <li> With a closer color match, the product would blend in better and be less obtrusive which I believe is the goal of a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did rub in smoothly and my skin actually felt soft, but that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Its great to conceal any dark spots and dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I think Olay perhaps did not do a good job in packaging description and failed to set the right customer expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this product for dealing with my dark circles!</li>
            <li> I have very light colorerd skin (pale and pasty</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles under my eyes, and this has been my favorite product for years now.  </li>
            <li> A real hassle on busy mornings and led me to question why they would have the eye cream come out on a brush.  </li>
            <li> Also, the directions go on to say that after each use, you should wipe the brush clean with a tissue AND let the brush dry thoroughly before replacing the cap--</li>
            <li> I figured that when it dried, it may be a bit more opaque.</li>
            <li> This CC Cream looks so good on and around my eyes that I wear it alone with only mascara - no more eyeliner pencil or eye shadow whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I love to mix their serums with my everyday foundations</li>
            <li> In my own case, my dark circles are likely hereditary rather than age-related, but still, I was hoping that this product would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a line minimizer, then shell out a few more bucks for an Olay Regenerist product.</li>
            <li> With so many eye and face products on the market I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time on this, not recommended from my experience.     </li>
            <li> When the product is sufficiently blended and absorbed into the skin, the eye area does not look any different</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite the consistency of concealer or anything you&#x27;d normally use on your face.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer it than the normal eye shadows correctors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 yrs and have normal aging skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of lightening those dark circles that make you look like the living dead.</li>
            <li> you see, I&#x27;m a Caucasian man with a somewhat pale complexion whose \\&quot;treatment regimen\\&quot; consists of nothing more than a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer with sports sunblock.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually think the color of the cream is really right for me.</li>
            <li> but unlike in other reviews, the consistency of this product is really light and mine</li>
            <li> A lot of eye creams I&#x27;ve used before have created little light colored bead like spots which I&#x27;ve been told is from too much moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Loved the consistency and brush applicator, but unfortunately was too dark for me, a selection of colors would be fabulous!</li>
            <li> before I went to work - otherwise, people would have been trying to help me, the newly elderly woman, across the street and give me their seat on the bus.   </li>
            <li> Within a week dryness was gradually disappearing, while new moisture is replacing it.</li>
            <li> This did make it easy to blend, and it did seem to have a slightly moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li> It never really seemed clean to me, even after I cleaned it with alcohol on a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eyes...</li>
            <li> You might want to try it at a retail store first to see if it can blend properly for your skin</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve been using the Olay pen, I feel like I look rested and my fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week now and enjoy the job it does on lightening the dark under eye circles.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly light skinned and have dark circles on a daily basis no matter how much sleep I get.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that is has to dry, before I lightly dust with powder over it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and permanent dark undereye circles; like other reviewers, I found this product mysteriously below-standard for an Olay product.  </li>
            <li> However, the brush remained quite hard, almost more like a palette knife than a brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and not jarring to the undereye but how hygenic is this method of product delivery.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and at nearly 1/4&#x27;s of a BUCK, it&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
            <li> I found the brush a bit unwieldy to use; it was easier for me to apply the product directly to my finger and then use my finger to dot the product under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a waste since you must smooth the product in with a finger or sponge after application.  </li>
            <li> Anti-aging Eye Cream absolutely does work but by initially appearing to be \\&quot;just a concealer\\&quot;, women feel they are misled and assume that&#x27;s all there is to the product.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy on your skin.  </li>
            <li> The brush really works so there is no residue on your fingers to need to wash off in the middle of applying makeup.     </li>
            <li> It covers circles well, and blends into skin to make a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer something that simply squirts a bit on a disposable sponge or your fingertip for application.</li>
            <li> It is soft for my eyes, and knowing that I have a sensitive skin, this product does not produce damages or irritations in my eyes.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel soft ---and</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just missing the point and there is someone who actually likes this better, but it was just not for me</li>
            <li> I was worried that the flesh colored cream was a little too dark but it blended nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is no worse than most other concealers and not better.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews first and saved the $26.99 I spent on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46, have few fine lines around my eyes and find this product totally diminishes them!</li>
            <li> I have light skin with blue eyes and very dark circles.  </li>
            <li> and I saw a huge difference in only a few days of usage.</li>
            <li> However, I was interested mainly because I have struggled with dark circles for years, dating back to my 20s.  </li>
            <li> There are no messy bottles to open and close.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had read reviews before I spent too much on this Olay product.  </li>
            <li> really well - I keep one of the empty ones to help even out the color under my eyes.</li>
            <li> next odd thing was that the liquid was much darker than my normal complexion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Opening the product for the first time was odd.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers have noted, way too much product comes out at a time, so even with the brush, you&#x27;ll still need to use your fingers and/or dab some off with a tissue.</li>
            <li> But like I said in the other Oil of Olay products, I like this company but they carry to much STUFF</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to note a decrease in wrinkles yet, but fortunately that&#x27;s not a huge issue for me yet.    </li>
            <li> the record, I am 58 years old, have been wearing makeup for 45 years but using actual skin care or anti-aging products for maybe the last 5 years ... and am often mistaken to be 10 years younger.r.</li>
            <li> but I disagree so strongly with the negative reviews that I felt compelled to write!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead, I got something that helps to cover dark circles, but really has no noticeable effect regarding minimizing them.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was looking for a miracle, or expecting too much, but while this product hid my dark circles they realy</li>
            <li> Maybe you could wash the brush frequently, but that is another step to the beauty routine that seems unnecessary to me when other products do a better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color was too dark for under my eyes (fair skinned) and served only to create under eye circles.      </li>
            <li> Regular concealer (even the liquid kind) is too thick for the delicate under-eye skin.  </li>
            <li> It is neither thick enough to truly conceal nor is it anything more than a small bit of foundation placed into the tube.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have a nice light reflecting property that helps cover my very bad dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The applicator feels decent -- not to stiff, and fairly big.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t much like the applicator, which resembled a small paintbrush and seemed to \\&quot;glop\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to attest to any anti-aging effects</li>
            <li> It might work as an effective concealer for those with just a hint of redness or uneven skin tone under the eyes, but for my dark, stubborn circles, this thin concealer definitely did not provide enough coverage.  </li>
            <li> The best things I&#x27;ve found for hiding dark circles are yellow cover up products, followed by a little base and/or powder.</li>
            <li> I have 54-year old tired, aging eyes that perk right up after applying Olay Total Effects Dark Circle Minimizing CC Cream.  </li>
            <li> *Due to too much liquid and the \\&quot;brush&#x27;s\\&quot; stiff bristles, I ultimately needed to use my finger to apply, which nullifies the point for the brush.    </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have a issue with my laugh lines but those dark circles always made me look so tired!</li>
            <li> Left the area around my eyes feeling dry!  </li>
            <li> Hard to apply- brush, consistency and releases too much formula.   </li>
            <li> I always felt silly painting it on with that huge brush and would find the need for eye cream in the end anyways,</li>
            <li> I am starting to get lines around my eyes and felt it was time to possibly try something that would work for both the dark circles and the lines.  </li>
            <li> This is a rather strange product, I have been using it for over a month now and quite frankly I don&#x27;t see any difference, when I get lots of sleep my face smoothes out in hours</li>
            <li> Maybe it would have helped in the long run, but I couldn&#x27;t take the short-term effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the looks of the applicator, and being a male and not familiar with these kinds of products, I may be incorrect in my experience, especially  </li>
            <li> This means I have to leave the brush out on my bathroom counter to dry before capping and putting away.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry.  </li>
            <li> and it is confusing to figure out what to purchase for a particular problem</li>
            <li> When I came back to look at myself in the mirror, I had two dark beige-tan dry, crinkly circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes but was more than disappointed that I wasted my money trying this.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Olay, I could now choose between a pale face and tan eye circles or skip the product and go back to a pale face and dark eye</li>
            <li> I was eager to recieve and try this Total Effects Anti-Aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when I put this underneath my eyes, it actually emphasized what dark circles I did have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34, and just starting to notice dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dark, a yellow tinted makeup is what this resembles...</li>
            <li> This product did the opposite as promised it gave me dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have very deep dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The first time I wore it 2 people asked me if I was tired that day.</li>
            <li> I apply the cream all over my upper eyelids, under my eyes, and feather it down in a triangular shape under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and it is already bone dry!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that this went on as a dried concealer that for my fair/light skin looked quite dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product coloring worked well with my white though slightly olive tinted skin color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the negative reviews regarding this.  </li>
            <li> , You need a professional to do the shopping for you, at least for me, this is the case, I followed the directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, but it did not do anything  noticeable.</li>
            <li> Be careful of getting too close to your eyes or it might sting.  </li>
            <li> Each day you wipe this across your skin, even if the skin has just been washed prior to, it just feels to me that after a few days of this your wand is just not that hygenic.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cream when my eyes are feeling tired and itchy from allergies</li>
            <li> expected it to be colorless, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed some difference in the appearance of circles when using it, but not a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> Try if you&#x27;re really curious</li>
            <li> The clicking mechanism releases big globs of product on the brush tip, which results in a gloppy, messy application if you attempt to use the brush.</li>
            <li> I agree - this product is a total waste.  </li>
            <li> The box sat around in a drawer for a few months until about two weeks ago, when I finally decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> and hey, I did try to apply it carefully.)  </li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s not very practical when you&#x27;re on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The container was almost empty.  </li>
            <li> Also its not really blending well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was right, and I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> As part of the very long product name notes, it&#x27;s meant to minimize the dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> This seemed to be a little too dark for my skin tone, and it was also kind of a thick liquid - so difficult to blend in.  </li>
            <li> My undereye circles are there, but not terribly dark, and this stuff actually seemed to make them worse</li>
            <li> my under eye dark circles in addition to my biggest problem area .... the very dark shadow areas between my inner eye and the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> I have tried it several times and it does nothing, except very slightly conceal dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have lots of cosmetics where one has to advance the liquid into the applicator portion, so turning the base to get the liquid onto the brush was easy enough.  </li>
            <li> I like other Olay products.</li>
            <li> There are no touch ups needed as this cream has never pooled or creased and it lasts until I wash it off, usually about eight hours later.  </li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Again, Olay says this product is not for everybody due to differences in skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there are any regular eye concealers out</li>
            <li> What to say that other critics haven&#x27;t already said?</li>
            <li> Despite being too dark, it still let the circles shine through.</li>
            <li> I can verify that it minimizes the dark circles under my eyes since it works as under eye</li>
            <li> A dark circle minimizer?  </li>
            <li> Made my dark circles look darker.  </li>
            <li> I never can get rid of the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> box for this product touts a \\&quot;Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush.\\</li>
            <li> and this is not too dark for me if I blend it in a bit.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a moisturizer and dark circle treatment product.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my aging eyes or the dark circles under them.  </li>
            <li> * Reducing the appearance of dark circles  *</li>
            <li> do not get dark circles often, so I did try it and</li>
            <li> I think you need to customize when it comes to dark circles for skin tones.</li>
            <li> For almost $19 it certainly is not worth the money or the headache of trying to use this product.  </li>
            <li> It claims to minmize dark circles..</li>
            <li> Also, the color is too dark for me.      </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because dark circles aren&#x27;t a realy problem for me --</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on like brown paint which is probably how they can justify calling it a dark circle</li>
            <li> Anti-aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my fingertip to blend the cream over my dark circles</li>
            <li> and I think the color is just too dark.</li>
            <li> It does not minimize lines or hide dark circles.</li>
            <li> NO dark circles under eyes or in that delicate area between eye &amp; nose!</li>
            <li> If you have dark circles under your eyes and dab some foundation on them, the circles will be somewhat masked for a while.  </li>
            <li> I  like the dark circle minimizing brush</li>
            <li> It smooths under the eye and fades dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Anti-aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush</li>
            <li> , I hoped it would help minimize the dark circles under my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the dark circles to have  miminized -I would reccommend this product to anyone out there</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to use another instrument (your fingers or sponge) to apply properly since the brush alone leaves the cream too thick.  </li>
            <li> far as the product itself goes, it has a fairly thin consistency.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work any better than the base I already wear, so in my opinion it is a</li>
            <li> had \\&quot;eye &#x27;opes\\&quot; for this product but felt let down.</li>
            <li> I looked like I had aged about 25 years!!</li>
            <li> I do not think that there&#x27;s a word to describe this stuff other than YUCK!  </li>
            <li> This actually seems like a sorry excuse for a concealer in a fancy applicator that doesn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Cuban, so I have a medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li> This helps make them less raccoonier.</li>
            <li> As a concealer I feel the shade is a little dark for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too dark (and orange) for me.  </li>
            <li> It was not a good feeling from the second I put it on.  </li>
            <li> It is not a true eye cream, but a beige tinted liquid concealer.  </li>
            <li> -it took a little time to get use to the stick and how to use it.  </li>
            <li> Both are a little pricier than Olay -</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel a little oily</li>
            <li> I am incredibly disappointed in this failure from Olay, as their products are usually of much better quality.</li>
            <li> Too messy any way you look at</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and can no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li> My mom always told me to trust Olay, but I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> * Hydrating to firm skin&#x27;s appearance   </li>
            <li> and I feel it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This product is way too oily, too orange, too messy to apply, &amp; does nothing to help as an eye circle concealer.  </li>
            <li> There are a few problems with this:     </li>
            <li> This is not really a cream, at least not one that you would expect anyway.</li>
            <li> figured it might take a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think maybe the instructions need to include make a few softening swipes on a piece of cardboard or something.  </li>
            <li> A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it is NOT orange, nor is the brush harsh, etc., etc.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> so I discard outdated facial mascara, creams, makeup etc.  </li>
            <li> In any case, the rest of the year, I had a pale face.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t really have dark circles too badly</li>
            <li> while I have not seen any dramatic improvement, I think there are subtle benefits, possibly due to the regular use of an under-eye moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush every day for the past few weeks and</li>
            <li> It also burned slightly when I put it on, and I had a hard time imagining that this drying, burning feeling would provide therapy to my undereye area over time.  </li>
            <li> so I say don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money, this doesn&#x27;t look or feel like eye cream</li>
            <li> The product must be distributed through the wand and out into a brush that reminds me of a small paint brush.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if somehow theres been differences in ingredients somewhere</li>
            <li> :/    </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I was never a huge fan of Olay products ... until this!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, and as much as I hate to waste the money, it&#x27;s going into the trash.</li>
            <li> I suppose the blue circles were less noticeable, because one could not stop staring at the how bad the product looked on my face.</li>
            <li> Brush is so hard that it feels like it scratches.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to quit using all of Olay products now as it&#x27;s hard to believe what Olay claims on  label.</li>
            <li> are from women who haven&#x27;t yet hit the age where they realize that every tiny little tug on the under-eye area is bad for it.  </li>
            <li> The description failed to mention that it was tinted, and so I expected it to be an invisible anti-aging eye cream that would work on all skin tones and races, as well as both sexes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the dark circle minimizing.</li>
            <li> It is also less expensive online.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would just act as a concealer, at least, but it did not!</li>
            <li> I tried it for a while and saw no remarkable anti-aging effects.  </li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife, and she used it to rejuvenate the appearance of tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with concealers before sinking into my wrinkles and caking all around and just making my tired eyes look worse.</li>
            <li> Didnn&#x27;t notice any change in my dark circles :(</li>
            <li> no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what this should be doing, but I have used Olay products before and this is by far the worst product made by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> suppose if you don&#x27;t wear any base and just want to put a little something under the eyes</li>
            <li> This is like liquid foundation in a ill designed tube.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m just not impressed and don&#x27;t feel that it covers undereye darkness whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not  impressed Olay, and trust me</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> And exremely expensive.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought this.</li>
            <li> The saddest part is it totally failed as a concealer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> , I read the box twice trying to see what this is, they don&#x27;t call it an eye cream making it look and feel like a vague gimmick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a concealer with a weird orange tint.</li>
            <li> The tint is wrong, it&#x27;s expensive for the amount you get and, even if you did want to apply it, it&#x27;s difficult to use.</li>
            <li> But it was uncomfortable to try to use until it had softened up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really sorry it wasn&#x27;t the answer for me...  </li>
            <li> fairly useless</li>
            <li> , I thought the brush was a bit awkward for application.</li>
            <li> but this is just plain awful.</li>
            <li> silly me!  </li>
            <li> Colleagues asked me if I had a bad night.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a bad concealer.  </li>
            <li> Day after used gave me a bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> If they marketed this as a concealer and lowered the price, it wouldn&#x27;t be bad.</li>
            <li> Painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m another disappointed user.  </li>
            <li> , this shows just HOW disappointed I am.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> So very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Since I have it in my drawer I have been using is as a tone evening  base for my eyelids before applying shadow.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I still had to use my finger to rub it in when I tried it (before having to remove it because of the terrible color).  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loved the consistency and brush applicator, but unfortunately was too dark for me, a selection of colors would be fabulous!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Left the area around my eyes feeling dry!  Had to switch to a different eye cream because the area around my eyes became sore. Didnn&#x27;t notice any change in my dark circles :(</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product! I have light-med skin (closer to medium now that it is summer) so I assumed the tone would work for my skin.  I loved the idea of a product that would treat and conceal at the same time. Ugh! I like other Olay products. What happened here?    When I first applied it, it was gloppy as another reviewer described. I used another brush to smooth it out.  The coverage wasn&#x27;t great - I could still see my blue circles peeking through. I figured that when it dried, it may be a bit more opaque. I was right, and I was wrong.  When I came back to look at myself in the mirror, I had two dark beige-tan dry, crinkly circles under my eyes. I looked like I had aged about 25 years!! I suppose the blue circles were less noticeable, because one could not stop staring at the how bad the product looked on my face. Thank goodness I checked it again before I went to work - otherwise, people would have been trying to help me, the newly elderly woman, across the street and give me their seat on the bus.   In summary, I found it simultaneously gloppy and drying, and it is waaay too dark, even though I am not that fair.  Despite being too dark, it still let the circles shine through.</li>
            <li> Great product, reduces puffiness....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the negative reviews.  I love this product!  I have 54-year old tired, aging eyes that perk right up after applying Olay Total Effects Dark Circle Minimizing CC Cream.  The color is perfect for my light skin.  This CC Cream looks so good on and around my eyes that I wear it alone with only mascara - no more eyeliner pencil or eye shadow whatsoever.  I feel confident about my look while wearing this product; I love how it brightens my eye area and seemingly takes years off.  There are no touch ups needed as this cream has never pooled or creased and it lasts until I wash it off, usually about eight hours later.  The brush applicator works perfectly for me.  I apply the cream all over my upper eyelids, under my eyes, and feather it down in a triangular shape under my eyes.  It blends perfectly with my tarte Amazonian clay foundation.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have used this Olay Total Effects for 8 weeks and I do not see any noticeable improvement despite the 7-in-1 anti-aging properties.  I can verify that it minimizes the dark circles under my eyes since it works as under eye concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use, click the end (like with a pen) and use the brush applicator to smooth the flesh colored cream under your eyes.  Be careful of getting too close to your eyes or it might sting.  You will need to use your fingers or a make-up sponge to completely smooth the cream under your eyes.  I was worried that the flesh colored cream was a little too dark but it blended nicely.  Olay Total Effects comes in only one color and it would work best with medium skin tones.  You might want to try it at a retail store first to see if it can blend properly for your skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to rinse the brush end off after each use.  This requires an extra step that adds time to my daily routine.  A real hassle on busy mornings and led me to question why they would have the eye cream come out on a brush.  You&#x27;ll need to use another instrument (your fingers or sponge) to apply properly since the brush alone leaves the cream too thick.  Why not a regular tube of cream?  Also, I have reservation about rinsing the brush off after use and placing the cap back on since it might prove a breeding ground for bacteria.  This means I have to leave the brush out on my bathroom counter to dry before capping and putting away.  Too messy any way you look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the anti-aging properties do not work for me, I cannot justify using this strictly as a concealer.  The price is too high and it requires too much work.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and am an active user and purchaser of them.  I love to mix their serums with my everyday foundations so when I saw this product I got excited.  A dark circle minimizer?  I think not.  This is like liquid foundation in a ill designed tube.  The product must be distributed through the wand and out into a brush that reminds me of a small paint brush.  The bristles are soft and not jarring to the undereye but how hygenic is this method of product delivery.  Each day you wipe this across your skin, even if the skin has just been washed prior to, it just feels to me that after a few days of this your wand is just not that hygenic.  Lets also talk about the consistency of this stuff.  It&#x27;s liquid like a liquid foundation. It is neither thick enough to truly conceal nor is it anything more than a small bit of foundation placed into the tube.  I haven&#x27;t yet run out of this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks to be fair and give it a chance.  But I&#x27;m just not impressed and don&#x27;t feel that it covers undereye darkness whatsoever.  I wish there was a way to remove and wash the brush after each use.  .20 ounces of a product is just not that much product in a rather clunky applicator.  I&#x27;m just not  impressed Olay, and trust me I love you.  This product is just like the redheaded stepchild in your otherwise stellar line of products.</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;m in the majority here of reviewers who don&#x27;t really care for this product. I&#x27;ve used it faithfully for awhile now and can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s made any lasting improvements in my appearance. As a concealer I feel the shade is a little dark for me. And, it&#x27;s pretty expensive. I&#x27;m happier with my lighter, cheaper, concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 3 weeks. It does a pretty good job of lightening those dark circles that make you look like the living dead. Getting rid of those circles makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and can no longer find it in stores. Thank heavens for the internet! It is also less expensive online.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my job requires me to look healthy and energetic when I&#x27;m meeting high clients.  Here are my results:    1. Hard to apply- brush, consistency and releases too much formula.   2. Painful process- Brush is so hard that it feels like it scratches.  3.Left my under-eye are sore and inflamed.    4. Made my dark circles look darker.  5. Colleagues asked me if I had a bad night.     I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and at nearly 1/4&#x27;s of a BUCK, it&#x27;s a rip off. My mom always told me to trust Olay, but I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted... Wish I could buy another.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it is just what I need.  I never can get rid of the dark circles.  I punched the button and was able to use it the first time.  Not bad.  Went to use it the 2nd time and punched the button over and over and do not get anything out of it.  Doesn&#x27;t seem like it should only work once.  Yes, I did rinse the brush after that 1st use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m another disappointed user.  I have fair skin and permanent dark undereye circles; like other reviewers, I found this product mysteriously below-standard for an Olay product.  The tone is, as others report, distinctly orange, and in my case darker than my normal skin color. It seems neither to cover nor treat the undereye circles.  Out it goes.</li>
            <li> Are there are more than 5 stars? Because the Olay Total Effect 7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush is one of the best products ever!   It glides easily and instantly provides a glow to the undereye area. I began to notice an improvement almost immediately.  Within a week dryness was gradually disappearing, while new moisture is replacing it. One simple click gives just enough product to moisturize, brighten and cover-up.  Oh yeah, Olay!</li>
            <li> At 42, I&#x27;m probably at the low end of the target consumer age range for this product.  However, I was interested mainly because I have struggled with dark circles for years, dating back to my 20s.  In my own case, my dark circles are likely hereditary rather than age-related, but still, I was hoping that this product would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box for this product touts a \\&quot;Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush.\\&quot;  This brush serves as the applicator:  you click the end of the pen to cause the eye cream to flow into the brush, use the brush to apply the product under the eyes, and then (as per the directions), use your finger to blend any excess.  I found the brush a bit unwieldy to use; it was easier for me to apply the product directly to my finger and then use my finger to dot the product under my eyes.  Also, the directions go on to say that after each use, you should wipe the brush clean with a tissue AND let the brush dry thoroughly before replacing the cap--how impractical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself goes, it has a fairly thin consistency.  This did make it easy to blend, and it did seem to have a slightly moisturizing effect.  It might work as an effective concealer for those with just a hint of redness or uneven skin tone under the eyes, but for my dark, stubborn circles, this thin concealer definitely did not provide enough coverage.  Furthermore, after using the product for several weeks, I did not notice any cumulative benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product might work better for an older woman whose skin has thinned and developed more wrinkles, requiring a thinner concealing product that won&#x27;t settle into fine lines.  But for me, I will stick with my existing concealer, [[ASIN:B002LFVFLA Maybelline Superstay Concealer - Ivory]] (I use the Cream).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  From the packaging you don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s its a concealer plus eye treatment.  A lot of eye creams make me break out and this does not.  It seems to have a nice light reflecting property that helps cover my very bad dark circles.  I have very light colorerd skin (pale and pasty I like to say) and this is not too dark for me if I blend it in a bit.  I really like this cream when my eyes are feeling tired and itchy from allergies, it gives a cooling soothing feeling.</li>
            <li> Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream may possibly work okay for somebody with a dark/fakish orange tan skin tone, but it definitely did not work for my fair skin tone.  I have light skin with blue eyes and very dark circles.  I am starting to get lines around my eyes and felt it was time to possibly try something that would work for both the dark circles and the lines.  This product sounded perfect.  Wrong.  The tint is dark/orangish and definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It seemed to make my circles look even darker, and I didn&#x27;t think that was possible.   I would like the brush applicator if it was softer.  I still had to use my finger to rub it in when I tried it (before having to remove it because of the terrible color).  It did rub in smoothly and my skin actually felt soft, but that&#x27;s about the only good think I can claim.  Like I said, it may work for somebody with a darker skintone or maybe for somebody who gets spray tanned or something.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife, and she used it to rejuvenate the appearance of tired eyes. She loved this product and her eyes have regained their brightness and he lines have diminished greatly.  She has purchased this product again once she ran out, so I can safely recommend it as it has been deemed worthwhile in our house.</li>
            <li> Not sure if somehow theres been differences in ingredients somewhere but unlike in other reviews, the consistency of this product is really light and mine had a light fair colored tint to it. The color initially worried me because I have medium olive skin but it&#x27;s honestly so light in consistency, it blended well. I&#x27;ve had problems with concealers before sinking into my wrinkles and caking all around and just making my tired eyes look worse. But since I&#x27;ve been using the Olay pen, I feel like I look rested and my fine lines are less noticeable. One click at the bottom of the pen dispenses enough for both eyes and I use the brush to distribute as much as I can, then I blend really lightly with my finger, it almost seems to just absorb right into my skin like a good moisturizer. A lot of eye creams I&#x27;ve used before have created little light colored bead like spots which I&#x27;ve been told is from too much moisturizing. This product delivers just the right amount of moisture and slightest hint of coverage that make up could provide without the look of make up. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was going to be a great product, but it was too thin to use as a cover-up and when I tried to blend it, it disappeared or became crepey.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a moisturizer and dark circle treatment product.  When I bought it at the store, that is what the package advertising made it sound like.  It&#x27;s actually a bad concealer.  I bought it before I read all the reviews....silly me!  It won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tinted moisturizer that you put on with a brush. And exremely expensive. I have tried it several times and it does nothing, except very slightly conceal dark circles. eyes still puffy, wrinkled, nothing special. I am sorry I bought this.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my aging eyes or the dark circles under them.  I wish I had read the reviews first and saved the $26.99 I spent on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for over 30 years and love them all.  I was eager to recieve and try this Total Effects Anti-Aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First what I like about it:  I like the way it works with the built in brush applicator which dispenses just the right amount of product when you press the button on the end of it.  There are no messy bottles to open and close.  Also, it&#x27;s a good size, not too much, but not a ripoff stingy amount of product.  It works great for me as a lightly tinted under-eye concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month now and I have yet to experience any anti-aging effects.  It doesn&#x27;t tighten or change the skin around the eyes at all.  I guess a Regenerist product would be more appropriate for that, but I was hopeful to have some line minimizing which has not happened even slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a good concealer, then I would definitely recommend this for that use.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a line minimizer, then shell out a few more bucks for an Olay Regenerist product.</li>
            <li> As Olay explained to me over the phone after I submitted questions, this product is targeted toward those experiencing beginning signs of aging such as fine lines and dryness.  The representative told me this product will forestall the process of getting deep wrinkles.  She said it does this by moisurizing skin and providing a number of vitamins that are healthy for the skin.  But she said it won&#x27;t have this affect for those with deep wrinkles.      The Olay rep said layers of skin shrivel when they lose moisture, and she said to picture a balloon shriveling when losing air.  The product will \\&quot;plump out the skin,\\&quot; she said.  She named all the vitamins.  This included vitaniacin, E and some Bs.      Olay did not have a number or name for the color. The color is expected to work for \\&quot;most people,\\&quot; and it comes in just this one shade.      From Olay&#x27;s website:  * Reducing the appearance of dark circles  * Minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles  * Massaging to instantly reduce the look of puffiness  * Hydrating to firm skin&#x27;s appearance   * Renewing skin&#x27;s texture  * Evening skin tone  * Moisturizing to counteract dryness    My wife likes this product.  She reports it spreads very smoothly and the color works for her.  She uses this product, every day actually.  Again, Olay says this product is not for everybody due to differences in skin.</li>
            <li> As many of the other reviewers have stated, yes, this is more like a concealer and not really what I&#x27;d call a cream. The color &amp; texture of this is like a medium colored yellow based foundation. I&#x27;m fair skinned &amp; I don&#x27;t really have dark circles too badly and when I put this underneath my eyes, it actually emphasized what dark circles I did have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with the start of any fine lines I do have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It was not a good feeling from the second I put it on.  Within ten minutes, my eyes were swelling and burned all day.  The saddest part is it totally failed as a concealer.  I like some Olay products but this is just plain awful.</li>
            <li> Anti aging-no&lt;br /&gt;Dark Circle- no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what this should be doing, but I have used Olay products before and this is by far the worst product made by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not get dark circles often, so I did try it and my concealer worked much better than this. I think you need to customize when it comes to dark circles for skin tones.</li>
            <li> I just returned a tube of this product and got another.  Got it home, it doesn&#x27;t work either.  I am now going back to return this one too....I give up.  Why make a product that won&#x27;t come out of the tube.  You need to push on the end to get the product to come out and nothing comes out.  For almost $19 it certainly is not worth the money or the headache of trying to use this product.  Good luck !</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me and I feel it was a waste of money.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> It claims to minmize dark circles.. but it doesn&#x27;t at all! I was hoping that it would just act as a concealer, at least, but it did not! No effect at all! So very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely love a product that does what this one promises.  Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t it.  Olay Total Effects would work acceptably as an under eye concealer but for the fact that it comes only in one shade and that one a bit orangey.  It&#x27;s a little too dark (and orange) for me.  Although I can get away with it, I&#x27;d be so much happier with a selection of shades.  With a closer color match, the product would blend in better and be less obtrusive which I believe is the goal of a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the Olay applicator is easy to use and the cream glides on smoothly with no tugging or pulling.  It does seem to have moisturizing properties and for skin of a certain age, that&#x27;s a big plus.  I&#x27;ve been using this brush every day for the past few weeks and while I have not seen any dramatic improvement, I think there are subtle benefits, possibly due to the regular use of an under-eye moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Eye Cream is a great idea and could have been a great product but it falls short and remains simply o.k.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks, and it is fine as a concealer, but I have not noticed any decrease in under eye circles or wrinkles.  It is not a true eye cream, but a beige tinted liquid concealer.  The brush is a waste since you must smooth the product in with a finger or sponge after application.  Also, the color is too dark for me.      I&#x27;ll use it because it was free, but I would not recommend a purchase.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this cream is the applicator.I love how I can click the bottom and just the right amount is dispensed into the brush tip applicator. It is so easy/fun to apply over the entire eye area. With that said...I&#x27;m not impressed with the dark circle minimizing. Its just a concealer and that&#x27;s great if the tint is a match for your skin type but its too dark for me. Since I have it in my drawer I have been using is as a tone evening  base for my eyelids before applying shadow. It seems to be working well for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34, and just starting to notice dark circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;m really looking for a product that&#x27;s easy and quick to use, and would take the place of painstakingly dotting concealer around my eyes.  This does the trick okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected it to be colorless, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a neutral tan, which works on me (I&#x27;m an African-American with light skin) but I would not recommend to darker skinned individuals.  The applicator feels decent -- not to stiff, and fairly big.  I also like the push up feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like, though, is the fact that using the brush doesn&#x27;t negate the need to distribute the product around my eye with a sponge or finger.  I still have to spend a bit of time patting the product in, while trying not to rub my eyes.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to do that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed some difference in the appearance of circles when using it, but not a whole lot.  Maybe it&#x27;s because dark circles aren&#x27;t a realy problem for me -- yet.  But, still, for mornings following nights when I&#x27;ve had one too many, it is useful.</li>
            <li> Olay usually makes excellent anti aging creams are reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this one misses the mark. It&#x27;s a tinted cream that leaves a brown streak under the eyes with use.&lt;br /&gt;You need to apply make up over this cream to hide it unless your skin tone is the exact match of the cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like brown paint which is probably how they can justify calling it a dark circle minimizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY. Don&#x27;t buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: my wife helped me with this review</li>
            <li> I have used the Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush for a couple of weeks now. It seems to moisturize pretty well - I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles around my eyes but the skin seems to be softer since I&#x27;ve been using it.     The brush enables the cream to be applied easily and evenly. I&#x27;ve used my fingertip to blend the cream over my dark circles but I can&#x27;t say it has helped much. The circles are still pretty visible. I don&#x27;t actually think the color of the cream is really right for me. The description says it&#x27;s good for most skin tones but I am very fair and I think the color is just too dark. It probably would work better for someone with a little more color in their skin. I wish it came in a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> This is a rather strange product, I have been using it for over a month now and quite frankly I don&#x27;t see any difference, when I get lots of sleep my face smoothes out in hours and I&#x27;m only thirty so I say don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money, this doesn&#x27;t look or feel like eye cream, the fluid looks like liquid foundation and it&#x27;s dark, a yellow tinted makeup is what this resembles... I always felt silly painting it on with that huge brush and would find the need for eye cream in the end anyways, so what&#x27;s the point, I read the box twice trying to see what this is, they don&#x27;t call it an eye cream making it look and feel like a vague gimmick. Try if you&#x27;re really curious but it&#x27;s nothing I would recommend to any of my friends and I love to share if they want to listen, so this says a lot. With so many eye and face products on the market I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time on this, not recommended from my experience.     Shiseido, Burt&#x27;s Bees and Estee Lauder are great for eye products, as much as I adore Olay products this seems a bit bizarre from them, not a concealer and not a cream, a nothing in between!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and think it works wonders! I&#x27;m 46, have few fine lines around my eyes and find this product totally diminishes them! In fact, I love Olay 7 so much, I&#x27;m ordering two of these eye creams now and sending them to my mother-in-law, who will bring them with her to London next week as I can&#x27;t find this product here. I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not Olay 7 works on them, but for fine lines, I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
            <li> This is the first Olay product I have ever purchased that I do NOT like! It is tinted and is too dark for my fair skin. It actually accentuates the under eye area. The first time I wore it 2 people asked me if I was tired that day. I am a fair skinned Caucasian with auburn hair. I think the advertising is very misleading!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the negative reviews regarding this.  Maybe I purchased it knowing there is no miracle out there.     The one thing I haven&#x27;t noted in the reviews is that it has a nice cooling effect when applied, which is a plus.  It also contains caffeine, which minimized puffiness.  I&#x27;m not sure there are any regular eye concealers out that do this.      I&#x27;m fairly light skinned and have dark circles on a daily basis no matter how much sleep I get.  I was surprised at how easily this blends in with my skin tone, and I may even be able to replace it with my regular tube concealer.  It can also be used on minor blemishes/acne/dark spots as a light concealer.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to note a decrease in wrinkles yet, but fortunately that&#x27;s not a huge issue for me yet.    No, this is not meant to be a heavy eye cream, but I think it does a good job at what it says it should do, and will be great for travel as well.</li>
            <li> This product is neither a moisturizer, nor a concealer. It does not minimize lines or hide dark circles. The clicking mechanism releases big globs of product on the brush tip, which results in a gloppy, messy application if you attempt to use the brush. When the product is sufficiently blended and absorbed into the skin, the eye area does not look any different that before the product was applied.  This actually seems like a sorry excuse for a concealer in a fancy applicator that doesn&#x27;t work as expected. I am incredibly disappointed in this failure from Olay, as their products are usually of much better quality.</li>
            <li> This product is way too oily, too orange, too messy to apply, &amp; does nothing to help as an eye circle concealer.  Wish I had read reviews before I spent too much on this Olay product.  I have now found that Rodan &amp; Fields eye cream really works instead on the eye area for anti-age, puffiness, &amp; concealing!</li>
            <li> I was never a huge fan of Olay products ... until this! I LOVE Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream! Initially I really wasn&#x27;t too sure and it seemed to dark for my fair to medium complexion but when I used less and applied it with a lighter hand, I was pretty satisfied. Still I thought to myself ... so this is a concealer and that&#x27;s it? I really don&#x27;t have a issue with my laugh lines but those dark circles always made me look so tired! The product was okay as a concealer (admittedly a tad bit on the dark side) but I guess I was expecting instant miracles. hahahaha!&lt;br /&gt;Well, I kept on using it because it did make me look good (and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about?) and sometimes I even used it lightly over my entire face with just a light dusting of mineral powder over it to look polished for work. Well lo and behold, within 3 weeks, I genuinely saw a real difference in my light crow&#x27;s feet and my under eye dark circles in addition to my biggest problem area .... the very dark shadow areas between my inner eye and the bridge of my nose. I&#x27;ve been using the product faithfully for a month and those are gone. GONE I tell you GONE! NO dark circles under eyes or in that delicate area between eye &amp; nose! The crow&#x27;s feet have either plumped out or smoothed out or something. I really wish I had taken \\&quot;before\\&quot; pics to show you.&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the many reviews where women did not like this product and I think Olay perhaps did not do a good job in packaging description and failed to set the right customer expectations. Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream absolutely does work but by initially appearing to be \\&quot;just a concealer\\&quot;, women feel they are misled and assume that&#x27;s all there is to the product. Perhaps if Olay made use of some before and after photos .... ?&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I am 58 years old, have been wearing makeup for 45 years but using actual skin care or anti-aging products for maybe the last 5 years ... and am often mistaken to be 10 years younger.r.</li>
            <li> I want to reduce the darkness under my eyes and this did the trick. Just apply lightly and don&#x27;t over do it . you don&#x27;t want to look like a raccoon. I also advise drink lot of water that helps the most.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product, as I love the Olay/Covergirl concealers, but at a price tag of $20 this is a RIP OFF! First of all, it is VERY orangey! I had to mix it with another concealer. And secondly, I haven&#x27;t had this for a week and it is already bone dry! I pump and pump and pump and no product comes out! I was hoping for something with anti-aging ingredients but I suppose I&#x27;ll just stick to my Garnier Anti-Dark Circle Roller... :/    I&#x27;ve never submitted a product review, this shows just HOW disappointed I am.</li>
            <li> This Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush is really a nice product.  It goes on easily with the brush.  It is not heavy on your skin.  Once blended, it is undetectable.  I am one of the lucky ones that does not have crow&#x27;s feet so I cannot speak to the line minimizing.  I have used it for a week now and enjoy the job it does on lightening the dark under eye circles.      I am very loyal to my make up products and I would switch from the higher priced department store product to this one in a minute.  The brush really works so there is no residue on your fingers to need to wash off in the middle of applying makeup.     A good product that works!!!     A Guest review for Zeb Kantrowitz</li>
            <li> I wish this worked for me.  First, I was under the impression that this would be more of an anti-aging cream.  However, I think this is primarily an under eye concealer.  Unfortunately, the color was too dark for under my eyes (fair skinned) and served only to create under eye circles.      Also, I didn&#x27;t like the way you have to apply it.  You press the end to get the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; to come to the brush&#x27;s surface.  You then brush it on under your eyes.  There are a few problems with this:     *The cream is really a liquid...like a liquid foundation.     *You can&#x27;t customize how much liquid comes out on the brush and I often wound up with too much liquid for application.     *Due to too much liquid and the \\&quot;brush&#x27;s\\&quot; stiff bristles, I ultimately needed to use my finger to apply, which nullifies the point for the brush.    I really did want to like this.  My favorite part was the $3 coupon I got for Olay&#x27;s other products that I am eagerly waiting to buy.</li>
            <li> I love some of the other Olay products and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this Eye Cream. I am very fair skinned and the cream made my skin under my eyes look bright orange. Also as an eye cream it just didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. I&#x27;ll stick with Neutrogena All in One Concealer.[[ASIN:B0017OJPAE Neutrogena 3-in-1 Concealer For Eyes, SPF 20, Light 10, 0.37-Ounces (10.4 g)]]</li>
            <li> Day after used gave me a bad allergic reaction. My eyes swelled and have been like that for 2 days now.</li>
            <li> If you have dark circles under your eyes and dab some foundation on them, the circles will be somewhat masked for a while.  This product will do the same thing.  It is no worse than most other concealers and not better. I tried it for a while and saw no remarkable anti-aging effects.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I love this product for dealing with my dark circles!</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream for more of a tinted moisturizer with added glow. It does the trick to eliminate under eye circles. It makes me look more awake in the morning. And anything that is so easy I can use it in the car wins my vote!    Read more at [...]</li>
            <li> The olay total effects was given as a gift to my daughter-She loves it.  I  like the dark circle minimizing brush-it took a little time to get use to the stick and how to use it.  Overall all the Olay products are excellant.</li>
            <li> This product is really good</li>
            <li> It is olay what more can I say. Love this product,</li>
            <li> This truly is a wonderful product it covers dark circles, and it looks natural. I will definitely buy this product again.also I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> What to say that other critics haven&#x27;t already said? I have the same reaction as most of them. This is not really a cream, at least not one that you would expect anyway. It&#x27;s a concealer with a weird orange tint. Says it works on most skin tones but I can&#x27;t see how. The tint just makes emphasizes the darkness instead of minimizing it. You have to wonder how they could have such a huge miss because this one clearly isn&#x27;t hitting the marks. The tint is wrong, it&#x27;s expensive for the amount you get and, even if you did want to apply it, it&#x27;s difficult to use.</li>
            <li> My favorite under-eye concealer.  I have very dark circles under my eyes, and this has been my favorite product for years now.  It covers circles well, and blends into skin to make a natural look.</li>
            <li> Considering I really only bought this to use up the rest of the money from a gift card, it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth, isn&#x27;t noticeable when it&#x27;s on.. I loved the product &amp; I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the product,but I didn&#x27;t like the brush. The brush became caked with the cream and it looked and felton felt gross.</li>
            <li> Not a cover up at all. Does not minimize anything.  Goes on very nicely but does nothing to improve under eye area.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I use it all over my face to cover up imperfections and fill in lines. Very smooth</li>
            <li> I first used this product a couple of years ago when I was in the USA and it does what it says. It smooths under the eye and fades dark circles.  I love it and wish it was actually available in Australia.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product and it just didn&#x27;t agree with me at all.  First, the disclosure -- I am a 49-year-old woman whom no product will make beautiful.  I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin.  I was hoping for a reduction in under-eye lines, figured it might take a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the product for the first time was odd.  I have lots of cosmetics where one has to advance the liquid into the applicator portion, so turning the base to get the liquid onto the brush was easy enough.  However, the brush remained quite hard, almost more like a palette knife than a brush.  I think maybe the instructions need to include make a few softening swipes on a piece of cardboard or something.  Maybe it could be done before the liquid was in the brush even, I don&#x27;t know.  But it was uncomfortable to try to use until it had softened up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next odd thing was that the liquid was much darker than my normal complexion.  There isn&#x27;t a choice in colors for the cream.  My undereye circles are there, but not terribly dark, and this stuff actually seemed to make them worse (I think it&#x27;s supposed to just cover them up).  It also burned slightly when I put it on, and I had a hard time imagining that this drying, burning feeling would provide therapy to my undereye area over time.  I&#x27;ve only managed to use it twice.  Maybe it would have helped in the long run, but I couldn&#x27;t take the short-term effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really sorry it wasn&#x27;t the answer for me...  it would have been great to have fewer undereye lines.</li>
            <li> I was quite excited to see this product advertised. It seems just what I needed for my aging skin and problem with undereye circles.     I was surprised to find that this went on as a dried concealer that for my fair/light skin looked quite dark. It didn&#x27;t conceal my underye circles and I definitely needed an undereye cream and concealer on top of it. I had really high hopes but was more than disappointed that I wasted my money trying this.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was disappointed with this product. When I selected the Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream Line and Dark Circle Minimizing Brush, I hoped it would help minimize the dark circles under my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I got something that helps to cover dark circles, but really has no noticeable effect regarding minimizing them. To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t even cover them that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is a fleshy tone, for one. The best things I&#x27;ve found for hiding dark circles are yellow cover up products, followed by a little base and/or powder. This product didn&#x27;t work any better than the base I already wear, so in my opinion it is a fairly useless product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you don&#x27;t wear any base and just want to put a little something under the eyes this might be worth looking at, but as I said before, there are much better products for hiding dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I thought the brush was a bit awkward for application. I much prefer something that simply squirts a bit on a disposable sponge or your fingertip for application. Touching the brush to the skin repeatedly seems like a bit of a health concern. Maybe you could wash the brush frequently, but that is another step to the beauty routine that seems unnecessary to me when other products do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the applicator seems to be a bit of a gimmick to me, something to make the product stand out from competing products. Maybe I&#x27;m just missing the point and there is someone who actually likes this better, but it was just not for me and I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have medium light Asian skin with a peachy undertone. For me, this product is fantastic! I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to attest to any anti-aging effects but i love it as a light concealer. This is great for the days that I&#x27;m looking like I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep. I sweep it below my eyes and across my upper lids, blend it in with my fingertip and looks like I had a nice nap. It blends well on me so I don&#x27;t have a tell tale foundation line either. As a night shift worker, this will come in handy around 4am. I normally use YSL Touche Eclat which is a miracle in a tube but for the price and for work and errands, this Olay product is great!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. the convienent stick can fit easily in my make-up bag and I saw a huge difference in only a few days of usage.</li>
            <li> I agree - this product is a total waste.  Obagi Medical Elastiderm Eye Treatment or Hydroxatone Instant Effect 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer is definitely the way to go.  Both are a little pricier than Olay - but it sure beats wasting your money on junk.</li>
            <li> does a good job of covering</li>
            <li> does NOT cover well when applied, does not give adequate coverage under my eyes. Have to use extra concealer over it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a great believer in skin care, and this product seems to have the necessary ingredients. It gives that gentle tingling feeling you get from a good exfoliator. I&#x27;m not giving it a very high review because I did not care for the brush applicator. It never really seemed clean to me, even after I cleaned it with alcohol on a cotton pad. I think I&#x27;d rather use my finger.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin?  First, the advertising leads one to believe that the brush eliminates the need to blend or dab, but the directions call for exactly that.  The color is not one-size fits all.  I have fair skin and it  made me look like I was in the yellowish stage of recovering from two black eyes.  If you read the tube it says, avoid contact with eyes, which I find amusing for an eye product. The consistency is fine but the product sank into and emphasized the fine lines around my eyes.  I had high hopes for this product, and as much as I hate to waste the money, it&#x27;s going into the trash.</li>
            <li> This seemed to be a little too dark for my skin tone, and it was also kind of a thick liquid - so difficult to blend in.  I haven&#x27;t used it consistently as a result, so I can&#x27;t say if it works for anti-aging.  The brush is pretty huge - for the under-eyes, and the amount that comes out is way too much to be able to blend in easily.  I think it would just be easier to take the product out of a tube or something.</li>
            <li> thought i&#x27;d try this for the heck of it. after maybe a month of dabbing it under my eyes, i noticed that the skin was softer and seemed \\&quot;healthier\\&quot;, but the bas under theyes didn&#x27;t go away. maybe if i tried it for an extended period of time it would&#x27;ve worked more on that, but hey--good for what it DID do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product before it came out on the market, through Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program.  The description failed to mention that it was tinted, and so I expected it to be an invisible anti-aging eye cream that would work on all skin tones and races, as well as both sexes.  When the product came, I immediately realized that it was developed for a much more limited and specific consumer (Caucasian women with medium-to-light skin), and I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to do with it ... you see, I&#x27;m a Caucasian man with a somewhat pale complexion whose \\&quot;treatment regimen\\&quot; consists of nothing more than a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer with sports sunblock.  The box sat around in a drawer for a few months until about two weeks ago, when I finally decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I didn&#x27;t much like the applicator, which resembled a small paintbrush and seemed to \\&quot;glop\\&quot; the product on my face (and hey, I did try to apply it carefully.)  The product felt okay, but the shade was much too dark for my skin, and by the time I blended it in I felt as though I was doing more harm than good by pulling on the skin tissue under my eyes.  I used it for five days in a row, but finally came to the conclusion that it just wasn&#x27;t meant for me.  Had it not been tinted, I would have given it a longer trial period, just to see what it did for my skin.  My suggestion to the Olay Company: simplify the name to more accurately indicate what the product is, an Anti-Aging Eye Cream and Concealer, and note on the box specifically who it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li> This product did the opposite as promised it gave me dark circles and wrinkles. For 4 days I have tried everything under the Sun to get my eyes back to normal , get the dark rings away and wrinkles and I cant . I Am traumatized I never thought make up could do that . I even followed directions .....:/ My sister tried it too to see if maybe i just had a rare reaction and the same thing happened to her as well as 2 major fine huge lines under her eyes like me that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite ever items and of course Olay is discontinuing it!  So disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and just love love love this one ----works really well - I keep one of the empty ones to help even out the color under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was looking for a miracle, or expecting too much, but while this product hid my dark circles they realy didn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product coloring worked well with my white though slightly olive tinted skin color.  Easy to blend applied cream to thin out and make look more natural though making it less effective in hiding circles.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all. I wish that I had read the reviews on this first and I would not have purchased it. A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I love Olay....But this stuff?  I do not think that there&#x27;s a word to describe this stuff other than YUCK!  It&#x27;s not quite the consistency of concealer or anything you&#x27;d normally use on your face.  I&#x27;m half Cuban, so I have a medium skin tone.  I looked like a Cuban Racoon!  This stuff is way too bright for human skin and just gives you bright flesh colored circles under your eyes.  HOWEVER,,,,,,,,I did use this product to fill in some scratches I had on my hardwood floor.  You know what?  It worked great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review about anything but I disagree so strongly with the negative reviews that I felt compelled to write!  I LOVE this product!  In my experience, it is NOT orange, nor is the brush harsh, etc., etc.  Perhaps some of the comments about a concealer being just as good and cheaper, and not understanding the need for the brush, etc. are from women who haven&#x27;t yet hit the age where they realize that every tiny little tug on the under-eye area is bad for it.  Regular concealer (even the liquid kind) is too thick for the delicate under-eye skin.  In my opinion, the color, consistency, brush, etc. are just right and it&#x27;s worth the price because I haven&#x27;t been able to find ALL of those good things in any other single product.</li>
            <li> If they marketed this as a concealer and lowered the price, it wouldn&#x27;t be bad. As part of the very long product name notes, it&#x27;s meant to minimize the dark circles under your eyes. This worked fairly well in the summer, if/when the rest of my face was tan, but as we all know, we aren&#x27;t even supposed to get a tan if we can help it. In any case, the rest of the year, I had a pale face. Thanks to Olay, I could now choose between a pale face and tan eye circles or skip the product and go back to a pale face and dark eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, way too much product comes out at a time, so even with the brush, you&#x27;ll still need to use your fingers and/or dab some off with a tissue. That means it&#x27;s not very practical when you&#x27;re on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had \\&quot;eye &#x27;opes\\&quot; for this product but felt let down.</li>
            <li> The container was almost empty.  I only had the chance to use it 4 times.  I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this product.  It didn&#x27;t give a smooth finish and the colors just weren&#x27;t for me.  Even though I purchased two of these, I wasn&#x27;t able to use even one.  There are much better products out there which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see any difference using this versus not using it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting money on any brand of creams that state it will help.</li>
            <li> Its great to conceal any dark spots and dark circles. Its a must in every make up bag. Olay is good and the type of brush is good. Just that it has to be washed cuz other wise it has a funky smell.</li>
            <li> love it..happy happy..</li>
            <li> I wish this product was easier to find! Have been using this eye cream for years! I use it under my concealer and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> I  used it for two weeks. Did Not work girl me. I think some products work for some and not for other&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it depends on your skin type</li>
            <li> Most women know just how outrageously expensive eye creams can be.. and if you&#x27;re talking about a really good cream then you&#x27;re shelling out $25 - $50 easy. That said, this Total Effects brush is perhaps the best value I&#x27;ve come across for instant, visible results. The brush is nice and big and allows for easy, mess-free application; the cream itself is instantly absorbed into the surrounding eye areas, instantly brightening &amp; toning under eye circles and puffiness. Non oily, with a very light and pleasant fragrance. I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish I could read the reviews before bought it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this junky if it&#x27;s NOT CREAM, the fact is IT IS NOT CREAM and I don&#x27;t understand why it claims CREAM?  I&#x27;m going to quit using all of Olay products now as it&#x27;s hard to believe what Olay claims on  label.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel a little oily but I kept using it just to see if I would be able to see a change in my skin. After a couple weeks theres been no change. Also its not really blending well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using this product since once year now and I prefer it than the normal eye shadows correctors. It is soft for my eyes, and knowing that I have a sensitive skin, this product does not produce damages or irritations in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 yrs and have normal aging skin around my eyes.  This is the first under eye concealer that doesn&#x27;t collect in my wrinkles. Also very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, it did not cover well and it settled in lines, I just didn&#x27;t like the way it went on.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eyes...this products causes my eyes to tear and sting...my colleagues, on the other hand, think this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works, looks good on, feels good on skin. Love the application feels smooth going on brush.</li>
            <li> I understood the product to be a concealer, not for treatment and I like the product.  Have looked all over for another one as I have used up my first one.  Can&#x27;t find it at any of the stores!  I use an eye treatment first, let it dry then use this as a concealer lightly patting it on under my eyes.  Let it dry.  I also use it as a concealer for some of my age spots around my face.  Love the product. Now that I have found it on amazon (should have looked here first.)  I will order several.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that is has to dry, before I lightly dust with powder over it.</li>
            <li> I love all Olay products and this is no exception.  I have very deep dark circles under my eyes.  This helps make them less raccoonier.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Nourishing ingredients.  Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I like Oil of Olay. I grew up with this company through my mom, who would make me get &amp;#34;oil of Olay lotion&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Night cream&amp;#34;. for her. Moms are always correct in their decisons. Also my mom did not age at all, and I contributed it to Oil of Olay,But like I said in the other Oil of Olay products, I like this company but they carry to much STUFF and it is confusing to figure out what to purchase for a particular problem, You need a professional to do the shopping for you, at least for me, this is the case, I followed the directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, but it did not do anything  noticeable. I like the looks of the applicator, and being a male and not familiar with these kinds of products, I may be incorrect in my experience, especially  if this products is to take months or years to show any signs.</li>
            <li> Olay Product ordered was okay.&lt;br /&gt; I gave it 3 stars because It&#x27;s been three weeks using the product and I have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for dark circles or acne spots. Applicator is divine, brush-liquid great for touchups during the day and product lasts a long time before emptying.  I do use it on top of a heavier concealer if I am going for a more structured day, but by itself if I am just running errands, etc.  I love this, repeat purchase it, it has no odor, a slight brightening affect, perfect for warm or dark or olive tones, but I imagine fair and light would love it also, highly recommend, you feel like it is a good product as you apply it!</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel soft ---and the dark circles to have  miminized -I would reccommend this product to anyone out there</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product online.  I first purchased it six months ago, when it ran out I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores.  Has Olay discontinued it?  I didn&#x27;t see an expiration date on this purchase and I don&#x27;t know how to read bar codes.  My skin is sensitive so I discard outdated facial mascara, creams, makeup etc.  I do like the product.  The plunger/brush makes it so easy to use and store. :)</li>
