            <li>This works great but leaves a light coating for a while until it soaks</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t, just stick with a nice aftershave scent you like.</li>

            <li>It works real good and fast too.</li>

            <li>The scent is pleasant without being too strong like a lot of products made for men.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as great as many others, but it&#x27;s neutral and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Smells real clean, but clogs your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful balm that leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated, and grandpa is pleased with the way it goes on without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>nice package, does a fine job, but not too fond of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the lotion</li>
            <li>The product was more lotion than liquid and did not burn at all.</li>
            <li>I was using Proraso for a while because I enjoyed</li>
            <li>Gillette after shave gel is much better.</li>
            <li>and I love the brand.</li>
            <li>The Balm is very liquidly, the smell is not that great...</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing when applied to the face after shaving.</li>
            <li>After using this item my face felt more neutral than hydrated.</li>
            <li>lotion would be much better for your skin than this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My husband love the smell and the texture.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Does an OKAY job of soothing my skin</li>
            <li>I love Dove chocolates, Dove soaps and now Dove balm.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shave</li>
            <li>Did not burn, went on smoothly, nice clean smell (but not overpowering).  </li>
            <li>This stuff is alcohol free, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and has a nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>shave balm smells pretty good and it is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>When I found out that Dove Men + Care made an after shave balm and at a reasonable price, I checked it out and found it to be really good.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice, but not overly powerful</li>
            <li>is some super feminine &amp; very strong scented stuff.</li>
            <li>The Dove Men+Care is good stuff and really helps with razor burn - very soothing, and the scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have taken many steps towards reducing the pain it causes with trimmers, fresh razors, better shaving creams, etc.  </li>
            <li>And the scent is very mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I easily get razor burn, and sometimes it feels like someone used a sander on my face.  </li>
            <li>Easy to carry , no spilling like aftershaves.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the feminine part of the scent or why they&#x27;d make it so strong either.</li>
            <li>Very fast absorbent liquid, which also has a nice, not-too-strong amount fragrance.  </li>
            <li>He liked it a lot, indicating that it soaks in very well and does make his skin feel more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Yes it hydrates and soothes fine</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth feels like its healing does not smell girly</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li>This Dove product had a light scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic aftershave-balm for the money.</li>
            <li>I have found, though, that a good aftershave is a must to maintain healthy and unreddened skin following a shave.  </li>
            <li>I find this type of post-shave product more pleasant to use than the harsh, strong smelling alcohol based ones tend to me so that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin stays moisturized and clean smelling for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use by squeezing the container and getting the right amount in your palm to apply to your face in a soothing and comforting manner.</li>
            <li>Also found this to be my favorite balm bc viscous and really improves my skin conditioning.</li>
            <li>Knowing that Dove&#x27;s products are usually of a good quality, I picked up a bottle of this stuff at the local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>The dove is more like a moisturizing lotion than a real shave balm or aftershave.  </li>
            <li>But perhaps that&#x27;s why it does such a good job of moisturizing the skin after a shave.</li>
            <li>Dove Post Shave Balm is a good remedy for those times when you realize you didn&#x27;t apply enough foam</li>
            <li>It smells fresh n clean.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin looking or feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Use to love using this product until I purchased a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed Dove&#x27;s line of new men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product I can honestly say that I was completely surprised.</li>
            <li>If you have irritation after shaving and/or dry skin, this seems good to use</li>
            <li>It does not dry his face out and the product is in a nice sized bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li>it did a great job without the heavy burn of alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light fragrance is very unobjectionable (although he would prefer unscented, as he finishes with a cologne).  </li>
            <li>However, its performance wins out against any negatives.  </li>
            <li>but the bottle is designed to make you use far more than you need, which negates any cost savings you think you may be getting.  </li>
            <li>Just enough of a minty bite to feel nice.</li>
            <li>The Dove Men Care Post Shave Balm is a different kind of aftershave balm.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, has a nice barely noticeable smell to it and really softens your skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing, no burn, suitable to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So I couldn&#x27;t recommend this to you for long-time use, especially if you have a sensitive skin, more and more..</li>
            <li>This was one of the first shave balms I purchased, mainly because I have used this brand before and was looking for something alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>It stings a little more than the Nivea offering, but I like it better.</li>
            <li>Dove Men Care Hydrate Post Shave Balm absorbs quickly and is very soothing after a close electric shave.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in trying some new cheap aftershave</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The price can&#x27;t be beat and will last for many shaves to come.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; too.</li>
            <li>There is no burning and my skin feels really smooth and soft after use.</li>
            <li>This post-shave balm works exactly as advertised -- soothing my post-shave skin and softening it with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve used Dove post shave balm.</li>
            <li>This is more of a lotion than a traditional alcohol based aftershave.</li>
            <li>This is a comfortable, soothing after-shave balm that restores the skin and moisturizes while acting as a mild astringent.  </li>
            <li>Has a much stronger smell than I would like to have right under my nose.</li>
            <li>Large mistake.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I very much favor this after shave balm and recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>would re-order again will re-order again thanks.</li>
            <li>I buy the whole line for my husband.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I used to use after shave balm all of the time but stopped when the prices got to be too much for me to justify.</li>
            <li>This product works very well at soothing and preventing redness.  </li>
            <li>Soothes the face every so gently without feeling like you covered your face in moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have the burning/cooling sensation of aftershave, so if you&#x27;re into that, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>It really does everything it advertises.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am not a big fan of the fragrance, it is fairly light</li>
            <li>Light and not overpowering it works well on the facial skin.</li>
            <li>He really likes this lotion</li>
            <li>The shave balm is ok, and I was drawn to try it out because it&#x27;s a much lower cost/ounce than other balms.  </li>
            <li>it is not a bad product but it strays too far from the traditional aftershave to be really useful.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit light and maybe not very masculine smelling, but it does not linger very long and is easily masked by cologne.</li>
            <li>Quality went down the drain compared to before, time to find a better choice.</li>
            <li>The Hydrate is currently one of my favorite personal care products.  </li>
            <li>I also used it after a long day surfing on my sunburned nose / cheeks / forehead and appreciated the mild cooling</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that the scent is not too strong like the other products.</li>
            <li>This stuff has great ingredients, but also unfortunately contains an toxic ingridient (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate).</li>
            <li>the heavy cologne smell I&#x27;ve found in most products marketed to men.</li>
            <li>My least favorite part about many other shave balms is that they take forever to wash off but that&#x27;s not the case here.</li>
            <li>so I need more than the average person who only shaves just their face, and I still end up with too much.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new shave balm, give this one a try.</li>
            <li>I go when I need a quick dry shave.</li>
            <li>A few minutes later after it has been absorbed, I follow up with the Hydrate Face Lotion, which is also a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>With the Dove post shave balm he now shaves comfortably since his skin is no longer rough and dry thanks to Dove.</li>
            <li>it works well for my 16 year old son</li>
            <li>Feels ok, but not thrilled with the smell</li>
            <li>Common Afta is better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into my third bottle of this in five months of scraping my cheeks with a Hart straight razor.</li>
            <li>but I much prefer Nivea overall.</li>
            <li>Some with sensitive skin may like this</li>
            <li>but frankly I believe that an aftershave should serve to close your pores and leave your face with a masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>More importantly (to me at least)</li>
            <li>It delivers a cooling effect and does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an old man</li>
            <li>He has rather sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This could work well on sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li>like that the lotion is thin, light, and doesn&#x27;t feel oily after application as so many other brands of lotion do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave my face feeling better and much less dry.</li>
            <li>Apart from the scent, which I perceive as almost like baby powder, it performs as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried and definitely wins in the price</li>
            <li>Unlike most of the other shave balms and aftershaves that I have used, this product leaves no tingling sensation  (probably due to the lack of alcohol).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I&#x27;m not personally a face lotion user, I&#x27;d recommend this to men who use aftershave balms and are looking for something new to try.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, it&#x27;s small and compact enough to keep as a backup, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to use it as my primary post-shave balm.</li>
            <li>It squeezes like the new style ketchup bottles, the ones where it takes a very firm squeeze to get anything going and then comes out very fast.  </li>
            <li>He shaves about every other day and said he really likes the way this balm refreshes his face after the shave.  </li>
            <li>If you are a man and are tired of the slight sting a dry shave will give you, this comforts that nicely and quickly without the mess of shaving cream.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was using Proraso for a while because I enjoyed</li>
            <li> Gillette after shave gel is much better.</li>
            <li> and I love the brand.</li>
            <li> The Balm is very liquidly, the smell is not that great...</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing when applied to the face after shaving.</li>
            <li> After using this item my face felt more neutral than hydrated.</li>
            <li> lotion would be much better for your skin than this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband love the smell and the texture.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Does an OKAY job of soothing my skin</li>
            <li> I love Dove chocolates, Dove soaps and now Dove balm.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shave</li>
            <li> Did not burn, went on smoothly, nice clean smell (but not overpowering).  </li>
            <li> This stuff is alcohol free, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and has a nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> shave balm smells pretty good and it is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> When I found out that Dove Men + Care made an after shave balm and at a reasonable price, I checked it out and found it to be really good.</li>
            <li> Smell is nice, but not overly powerful</li>
            <li> is some super feminine &amp; very strong scented stuff.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care is good stuff and really helps with razor burn - very soothing, and the scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have taken many steps towards reducing the pain it causes with trimmers, fresh razors, better shaving creams, etc.  </li>
            <li> And the scent is very mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I easily get razor burn, and sometimes it feels like someone used a sander on my face.  </li>
            <li> Easy to carry , no spilling like aftershaves.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the feminine part of the scent or why they&#x27;d make it so strong either.</li>
            <li> Very fast absorbent liquid, which also has a nice, not-too-strong amount fragrance.  </li>
            <li> He liked it a lot, indicating that it soaks in very well and does make his skin feel more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Yes it hydrates and soothes fine</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth feels like its healing does not smell girly</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li> This Dove product had a light scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic aftershave-balm for the money.</li>
            <li> I have found, though, that a good aftershave is a must to maintain healthy and unreddened skin following a shave.  </li>
            <li> I find this type of post-shave product more pleasant to use than the harsh, strong smelling alcohol based ones tend to me so that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin stays moisturized and clean smelling for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use by squeezing the container and getting the right amount in your palm to apply to your face in a soothing and comforting manner.</li>
            <li> Also found this to be my favorite balm bc viscous and really improves my skin conditioning.</li>
            <li> Knowing that Dove&#x27;s products are usually of a good quality, I picked up a bottle of this stuff at the local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> The dove is more like a moisturizing lotion than a real shave balm or aftershave.  </li>
            <li> But perhaps that&#x27;s why it does such a good job of moisturizing the skin after a shave.</li>
            <li> Dove Post Shave Balm is a good remedy for those times when you realize you didn&#x27;t apply enough foam</li>
            <li> It smells fresh n clean.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin looking or feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Use to love using this product until I purchased a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed Dove&#x27;s line of new men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I can honestly say that I was completely surprised.</li>
            <li> If you have irritation after shaving and/or dry skin, this seems good to use</li>
            <li> It does not dry his face out and the product is in a nice sized bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li> it did a great job without the heavy burn of alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light fragrance is very unobjectionable (although he would prefer unscented, as he finishes with a cologne).  </li>
            <li> However, its performance wins out against any negatives.  </li>
            <li> but the bottle is designed to make you use far more than you need, which negates any cost savings you think you may be getting.  </li>
            <li> Just enough of a minty bite to feel nice.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men Care Post Shave Balm is a different kind of aftershave balm.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, has a nice barely noticeable smell to it and really softens your skin.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, no burn, suitable to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So I couldn&#x27;t recommend this to you for long-time use, especially if you have a sensitive skin, more and more..</li>
            <li> This was one of the first shave balms I purchased, mainly because I have used this brand before and was looking for something alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little more than the Nivea offering, but I like it better.</li>
            <li> Dove Men Care Hydrate Post Shave Balm absorbs quickly and is very soothing after a close electric shave.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in trying some new cheap aftershave</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The price can&#x27;t be beat and will last for many shaves to come.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; too.</li>
            <li> There is no burning and my skin feels really smooth and soft after use.</li>
            <li> This post-shave balm works exactly as advertised -- soothing my post-shave skin and softening it with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve used Dove post shave balm.</li>
            <li> This is more of a lotion than a traditional alcohol based aftershave.</li>
            <li> This is a comfortable, soothing after-shave balm that restores the skin and moisturizes while acting as a mild astringent.  </li>
            <li> Has a much stronger smell than I would like to have right under my nose.</li>
            <li> Large mistake.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I very much favor this after shave balm and recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> would re-order again will re-order again thanks.</li>
            <li> I buy the whole line for my husband.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I used to use after shave balm all of the time but stopped when the prices got to be too much for me to justify.</li>
            <li> This product works very well at soothing and preventing redness.  </li>
            <li> Soothes the face every so gently without feeling like you covered your face in moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have the burning/cooling sensation of aftershave, so if you&#x27;re into that, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> It really does everything it advertises.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am not a big fan of the fragrance, it is fairly light</li>
            <li> Light and not overpowering it works well on the facial skin.</li>
            <li> He really likes this lotion</li>
            <li> The shave balm is ok, and I was drawn to try it out because it&#x27;s a much lower cost/ounce than other balms.  </li>
            <li> it is not a bad product but it strays too far from the traditional aftershave to be really useful.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit light and maybe not very masculine smelling, but it does not linger very long and is easily masked by cologne.</li>
            <li> Quality went down the drain compared to before, time to find a better choice.</li>
            <li> The Hydrate is currently one of my favorite personal care products.  </li>
            <li> I also used it after a long day surfing on my sunburned nose / cheeks / forehead and appreciated the mild cooling</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that the scent is not too strong like the other products.</li>
            <li> This stuff has great ingredients, but also unfortunately contains an toxic ingridient (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate).</li>
            <li> the heavy cologne smell I&#x27;ve found in most products marketed to men.</li>
            <li> My least favorite part about many other shave balms is that they take forever to wash off but that&#x27;s not the case here.</li>
            <li> so I need more than the average person who only shaves just their face, and I still end up with too much.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new shave balm, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I go when I need a quick dry shave.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later after it has been absorbed, I follow up with the Hydrate Face Lotion, which is also a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> With the Dove post shave balm he now shaves comfortably since his skin is no longer rough and dry thanks to Dove.</li>
            <li> it works well for my 16 year old son</li>
            <li> Feels ok, but not thrilled with the smell</li>
            <li> Common Afta is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into my third bottle of this in five months of scraping my cheeks with a Hart straight razor.</li>
            <li> but I much prefer Nivea overall.</li>
            <li> Some with sensitive skin may like this</li>
            <li> but frankly I believe that an aftershave should serve to close your pores and leave your face with a masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> More importantly (to me at least)</li>
            <li> It delivers a cooling effect and does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an old man</li>
            <li> He has rather sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This could work well on sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li> like that the lotion is thin, light, and doesn&#x27;t feel oily after application as so many other brands of lotion do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave my face feeling better and much less dry.</li>
            <li> Apart from the scent, which I perceive as almost like baby powder, it performs as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried and definitely wins in the price</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the other shave balms and aftershaves that I have used, this product leaves no tingling sensation  (probably due to the lack of alcohol).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I&#x27;m not personally a face lotion user, I&#x27;d recommend this to men who use aftershave balms and are looking for something new to try.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, it&#x27;s small and compact enough to keep as a backup, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to use it as my primary post-shave balm.</li>
            <li> It squeezes like the new style ketchup bottles, the ones where it takes a very firm squeeze to get anything going and then comes out very fast.  </li>
            <li> He shaves about every other day and said he really likes the way this balm refreshes his face after the shave.  </li>
            <li> If you are a man and are tired of the slight sting a dry shave will give you, this comforts that nicely and quickly without the mess of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> good enough product, despite my biggest complaint of the thin consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my experience that this product does far more for much less money than the expensive &amp;#34;bigger name&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time as it takes only a dime size or so per application.</li>
            <li> I typically use an electric razor, and typically do not use lotion or moisturizer of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it lingered long, if anyone is concerned about smelling like Dove.</li>
            <li> Daily shaving can lead to rough, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Helps dry lips while giving my face a treat.</li>
            <li> hydration portion did leave my skin feeling slightly softer without the grease or slickness of a traditional lotion.</li>
            <li> As noted by a previous reviewer, this product&#x27;s consistency is on the thin side, and it does tend to leave a coating on your face rather than being fully absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have a tough Italian beard with tender soft skin so shaving has always been an ordeal for me.  </li>
            <li> The lotion goes on fast and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Squeeze and nothing comes out, squeeze harder and nothing comes out, squeeze even harder</li>
            <li> The expected.</li>
            <li> I expected something along the lines of the Gilette or Neutragena products but this is way off.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Some of that is to be expected of course, but it seemed to take a while to absorb.</li>
            <li> Prior to using the balm, I usually shied away from using after shave simply because of the sting of the alcohol and how it dried my skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike other after shaves, this product moisturizes the skin and lives up to its promise in stopping the irritation.</li>
            <li> No need to break the bank for some other over priced balm</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been a difficult task for me due to my extremely sensitive skin that just loves splitting open at the sight of a razor.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, the bottle that the product comes in makes it difficult to apply without squeezing out excess product so you end up applying more than needed.  </li>
            <li> I shared this with my son, who has dry skin to begin with and a recently defunct water softener to make matters worse.  </li>
            <li> Nothing particularly horrible about this product, but nothing exceptional either.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with the so-called &#x27;feminine&#x27; small of the product, as it is not very</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only other downside is the packaging, which can be slightly frustrating once the amount of product begins to dwindle.  </li>
            <li> I use this after shaving and I give my lips a little dab too.</li>
            <li> A little on the runny side and feels a little greasy on the face for a while.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t dried out</li>
            <li> No more scrathcing</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else has this issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of aftershaves in the past and I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I got sick of the stinging, and fumes to my eyes thanks to it&#x27;s alcohol content.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it got that 4.4 stars rating!</li>
            <li> While I hate shaving, I hate smelly and greasy aftershaves even more.  </li>
            <li> At least according to my wife!</li>
            <li> was tough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Even the scent is a very faint smell of Dove soap.  </li>
            <li> The tube design is just stupid - not convenient to use or to store.</li>
            <li> but I hate the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> stuff is TOTALLY DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> after about an hour my face smells like a damp cloth or something...quite horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> feels soothing to use  after  a shave</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the lotion but I hate the dispenser.  The lotion goes on fast and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a greasy feeling.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  It does the job to keep skin moisturized - it seems to last.  The dispenser is &amp;#34;a squirter&amp;#34;.  Squeeze and nothing comes out, squeeze harder and nothing comes out, squeeze even harder and you just squirted 3x lotion then you wanted!</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I can honestly say that I was completely surprised. The product was more lotion than liquid and did not burn at all. Prior to using the balm, I usually shied away from using after shave simply because of the sting of the alcohol and how it dried my skin. Now I will always use this balm. Unlike other after shaves, this product moisturizes the skin and lives up to its promise in stopping the irritation. The price can&#x27;t be beat and will last for many shaves to come.</li>
            <li> Great post shave balm.  Absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin looking or feeling greasy.  Start taking  care of your face and give this a try.</li>
            <li> I was using Proraso for a while because I enjoyed it&#x27;s fragrance. I got sick of the stinging, and fumes to my eyes thanks to it&#x27;s alcohol content. This stuff is alcohol free, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and has a nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> it works well for my 16 year old son</li>
            <li> I find that i need it but cannot always find. Works great after shaving for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;found myself scratching until I formed a scab on my face. No more scrathcing</li>
            <li> Everything is good as they advertise but I do not like it. Gillette after shave gel is much better.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth feels like its healing does not smell girly only wish the bottle came in a bigger size. Price was perfect would re-order again will re-order again thanks.</li>
            <li> Also found this to be my favorite balm bc viscous and really improves my skin conditioning.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Good Price. Good Service</li>
            <li> Feels ok, but not thrilled with the smell</li>
            <li> I very much favor this after shave balm and recommend it highly.  It is easy to use by squeezing the container and getting the right amount in your palm to apply to your face in a soothing and comforting manner.</li>
            <li> I like the fact I&#x27;m hydrating my skin. I use this after shaving and I give my lips a little dab too. Helps dry lips while giving my face a treat. And no, it doesn&#x27;t have a taste that I can tell.</li>
            <li> this is an inexpensive balm that does not carry an overpowering smell. Very good value for the price. No need to break the bank for some other over priced balm</li>
            <li> I buy the whole line for my husband. It smells amazing and he seems to like it. We crawl into bed at night and I can still smell it on him. We&#x27;re a Dove family and I love the brand.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably one of the best post-shave balms I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, has a nice barely noticeable smell to it and really softens your skin. It also lasts a long time as it takes only a dime size or so per application. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Too oily, doesn&#x27;t relieve irritation.  Common Afta is better.</li>
            <li> The Balm is very liquidly, the smell is not that great... Not sure how it got that 4.4 stars rating!</li>
            <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Use to love using this product until I purchased a new bottle. Quality went down the drain compared to before, time to find a better choice. :/</li>
            <li> Having been a fan of Nivea aftershave lotion for quite a while, I switched to Baxter of California After Shave Balm last year when I transitioned to shaving with a safety razor.  When my supply of that began to run low, I decided to take my chances with a cheaper product.  Knowing that Dove&#x27;s products are usually of a good quality, I picked up a bottle of this stuff at the local pharmacy.  Apart from the scent, which I perceive as almost like baby powder, it performs as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried and definitely wins in the price department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other downside is the packaging, which can be slightly frustrating once the amount of product begins to dwindle.  However, its performance wins out against any negatives.  If nothing else, it&#x27;s small and compact enough to keep as a backup, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to use it as my primary post-shave balm.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I use and recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> good product and value</li>
            <li> works well and smells good.</li>
            <li> Great shave balm. Reasonably priced</li>
            <li> A little on the runny side and feels a little greasy on the face for a while. The scent is pretty &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; too. If you have irritation after shaving and/or dry skin, this seems good to use but if you don&#x27;t, just stick with a nice aftershave scent you like.</li>
            <li> I used to use after shave balm all of the time but stopped when the prices got to be too much for me to justify. The problem with the alternatives is the alcohol and such was tough on my skin. When I found out that Dove Men + Care made an after shave balm and at a reasonable price, I checked it out and found it to be really good. There is no burning and my skin feels really smooth and soft after use. Another plus is that the scent is not too strong like the other products.</li>
            <li> Nice smell dose not burn I will buy again</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been a difficult task for me due to my extremely sensitive skin that just loves splitting open at the sight of a razor.  I have taken many steps towards reducing the pain it causes with trimmers, fresh razors, better shaving creams, etc.  I have found, though, that a good aftershave is a must to maintain healthy and unreddened skin following a shave.  This was one of the first shave balms I purchased, mainly because I have used this brand before and was looking for something alcohol free.  This product works very well at soothing and preventing redness.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. great to make your skin feel nice after shaving.</li>
            <li> The shave balm is ok, and I was drawn to try it out because it&#x27;s a much lower cost/ounce than other balms.  Yes it hydrates and soothes fine but the bottle is designed to make you use far more than you need, which negates any cost savings you think you may be getting.  It squeezes like the new style ketchup bottles, the ones where it takes a very firm squeeze to get anything going and then comes out very fast.  I shave my entire head so I need more than the average person who only shaves just their face, and I still end up with too much.</li>
            <li> This product breaks the mould from the traditional after shave which burns your chin and face to give you that feeling of satisfaction. With this product you wouldn&#x27;t experience any burning sensation however you will get the desired result, which is awesome!!!!!! It works real good and fast too.</li>
            <li> For those shaving with a straight-edge or safety razor, do your face a favor and order this immediately.  This is a comfortable, soothing after-shave balm that restores the skin and moisturizes while acting as a mild astringent.  I&#x27;m into my third bottle of this in five months of scraping my cheeks with a Hart straight razor.</li>
            <li> Has a much stronger smell than I would like to have right under my nose. It works ok but I much prefer Nivea overall.</li>
            <li> This works great but leaves a light coating for a while until it soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave my face feeling better and much less dry.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shave balm, smells great and smooths the skin to make it very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing when applied to the face after shaving.</li>
            <li> Smells good n soothes.those who say it smells feminine might never have used dove soap.  It smells fresh n clean.  It was soothing to the skin after shaving.  I have not tried nivia but I ordered one for a fair comparison.it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not too light. Just enough of a minty bite to feel nice. Soothes the face every so gently without feeling like you covered your face in moisturizer. If you are a man and are tired of the slight sting a dry shave will give you, this comforts that nicely and quickly without the mess of shaving cream. I keep this in the truck everywhere I go when I need a quick dry shave.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of issues with facial sensitivity and ingrown facial hair around the neck. After using this item my face felt more neutral than hydrated. It wasn&#x27;t dried out but it did not quite hydrate my skin the way I was hoping. I would say that it is much better than an alcohol based after shave which dries out your face but a good after shave lotion would be much better for your skin than this product.</li>
            <li> While I hate shaving, I hate smelly and greasy aftershaves even more.  This Dove product had a light scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  It simply smelled \\&quot;clean\\&quot; in my mind similar to that of a deodorant soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For calming the skin it did a great job without the heavy burn of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hydration portion did leave my skin feeling slightly softer without the grease or slickness of a traditional lotion.</li>
            <li> I shared this with my son, who has dry skin to begin with and a recently defunct water softener to make matters worse.  He liked it a lot, indicating that it soaks in very well and does make his skin feel more comfortable.  The light fragrance is very unobjectionable (although he would prefer unscented, as he finishes with a cologne).  The lotion has become a regular part of his morning grooming.</li>
            <li> The Dove post shave balm is a great product. For years I have always had irritated skin after shaving. But with this post shave balm, my skin felt great. And the scent is very mild and not overpowering. This is great when paired with the Dove Men shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic aftershave-balm for the money. My favorite is [[ASIN:B0007XBHIE Proraso Proraso Liquid Cream After-Shave 3.4oz]] , but it is more expensive. The Dove Men+Care is good stuff and really helps with razor burn - very soothing, and the scent is light and pleasant. I didn&#x27;t find that it lingered long, if anyone is concerned about smelling like Dove.</li>
            <li> Good aftershave balm.</li>
            <li> My husband has to shave daily as he works in the food industry. Daily shaving can lead to rough, dry skin. With the Dove post shave balm he now shaves comfortably since his skin is no longer rough and dry thanks to Dove. Very good product!</li>
            <li> Great product just wish they made it in unscented.</li>
            <li> Every morning user, great softening compound</li>
            <li> The Dove Men Care Post Shave Balm is a different kind of aftershave balm.  Unlike most of the other shave balms and aftershaves that I have used, this product leaves no tingling sensation  (probably due to the lack of alcohol).  Even the scent is a very faint smell of Dove soap.  Some with sensitive skin may like this but frankly I believe that an aftershave should serve to close your pores and leave your face with a masculine scent.  The dove is more like a moisturizing lotion than a real shave balm or aftershave.  To make matters worse, the bottle that the product comes in makes it difficult to apply without squeezing out excess product so you end up applying more than needed.  Overall it is not a bad product but it strays too far from the traditional aftershave to be really useful.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful balm that leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated, and grandpa is pleased with the way it goes on without feeling greasy. The scent is pleasant without being too strong like a lot of products made for men.</li>
            <li> It stings a little more than the Nivea offering, but I like it better. Smells nice, too. At least according to my wife!</li>
            <li> This post-shave balm works exactly as advertised -- soothing my post-shave skin and softening it with the moisturizer. More importantly (to me at least) it does all that *without* the heavy cologne smell I&#x27;ve found in most products marketed to men. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a tough Italian beard with tender soft skin so shaving has always been an ordeal for me.  I easily get razor burn, and sometimes it feels like someone used a sander on my face.  After I shave, I apply this product, and the burning and irritation are INSTANTLY gone.  A few minutes later after it has been absorbed, I follow up with the Hydrate Face Lotion, which is also a fantastic product.  It&#x27;s my experience that this product does far more for much less money than the expensive &amp;#34;bigger name&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> Smells real clean, but clogs your skin. I discontinued use after breakouts.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve used Dove post shave balm. I was using Nivea products earlier and I don&#x27;t regret my purchase. I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for about a month.  He shaves about every other day and said he really likes the way this balm refreshes his face after the shave.  The products has almost no scent so it will be good for those that do not want any additional smells.  It does not dry his face out and the product is in a nice sized bottle for the price.  This is a very good line of products from Dove.</li>
            <li> Nothing particularly horrible about this product, but nothing exceptional either. It did not seem an hydrating or calming as weleda products. I also did not find the aroma to be all that pleasant. The tube design is just stupid - not convenient to use or to store.</li>
            <li> My husband love the smell and the texture. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Aftershave + hydration lotion. don&#x27;t need to put some face lotion or creme. Easy to carry , no spilling like aftershaves.</li>
            <li> Feels nice after a shave. Doesn&#x27;t really have the burning/cooling sensation of aftershave, so if you&#x27;re into that, this isn&#x27;t for you. Or maybe both?</li>
            <li> My husband uses this balm after shaving his head and face. He swears by it as the best way to soothe his skin and prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> - Very good to moisturize&lt;br /&gt;- Smell is nice, but not overly powerful&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn at all</li>
            <li> This stuff has great ingredients, but also unfortunately contains an toxic ingridient (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate). So I couldn&#x27;t recommend this to you for long-time use, especially if you have a sensitive skin, more and more..</li>
            <li> I typically use an electric razor, and typically do not use lotion or moisturizer of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I got this as a sample and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the lotion is thin, light, and doesn&#x27;t feel oily after application as so many other brands of lotion do. I also used it after a long day surfing on my sunburned nose / cheeks / forehead and appreciated the mild cooling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#x27;m not personally a face lotion user, I&#x27;d recommend this to men who use aftershave balms and are looking for something new to try.</li>
            <li> The Hydrate is currently one of my favorite personal care products.  It really does everything it advertises.  Feels nice going on and soothes skin after shaving.  Nice scent and does a good job moisturizing.  I actually use this after shaving with either a razor or an electric rotary.  Feels great, soothes, moisturizes, smells nice.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Dove Men Care Hydrate Post Shave Balm absorbs quickly and is very soothing after a close electric shave.  It delivers a cooling effect and does not irritate sensitive skin.  The fragrance is a bit light and maybe not very masculine smelling, but it does not linger very long and is easily masked by cologne.</li>
            <li> As noted by a previous reviewer, this product&#x27;s consistency is on the thin side, and it does tend to leave a coating on your face rather than being fully absorbed. But perhaps that&#x27;s why it does such a good job of moisturizing the skin after a shave. I had no problem with the so-called &#x27;feminine&#x27; small of the product, as it is not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good enough product, despite my biggest complaint of the thin consistency.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying some new cheap aftershave so I decided to give this a try. Large mistake.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is TOTALLY DISGUSTING. Think French street walker.&lt;br /&gt;This is some super feminine &amp; very strong scented stuff. I&#x27;m not an old man yet so I don&#x27;t think this is a get off my lawn episode. This product is revolting. I don&#x27;t get the feminine part of the scent or why they&#x27;d make it so strong either. Maybe I received a rancid batch. I&#x27;d rather bathe in Drakkar or Brut all day before wearing this for 5 minutes. I expected something along the lines of the Gilette or Neutragena products but this is way off.&lt;br /&gt;Note - I have the Cilantro hater genes (not soap but similar) so that may play a role in my dislike of this.</li>
            <li> Does an OKAY job of soothing my skin but it smells like Play-Doh.</li>
            <li> This is more of a lotion than a traditional alcohol based aftershave. I find this type of post-shave product more pleasant to use than the harsh, strong smelling alcohol based ones tend to me so that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am not a big fan of the fragrance, it is fairly light so it did not stick around all day after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did not care for however was that it seemed to leave my face feeling a bit oily/greasy longer than I cared for. Some of that is to be expected of course, but it seemed to take a while to absorb.</li>
            <li> Wear well great smell, love it specially at night, Great after shower are a Bath!! This is something I would wear outside of the Evening!</li>
            <li> nice package, does a fine job, but not too fond of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great price and is a quality product. Light and not overpowering it works well on the facial skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas as a stocking stuffer. He really likes this lotion</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well but after about an hour my face smells like a damp cloth or something...quite horrible.  Not sure if anyone else has this issue.</li>
            <li> Really works great great after shave balm</li>
            <li> I love Dove! I love Dove chocolates, Dove soaps and now Dove balm. I have in the shower so after I come out and put the balm on, my face absorbs it instantly and my skin stays moisturized and clean smelling for the rest of the day. My wife also loves it on me! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I borrowed Dad to test drive this for me.  He has rather sensitive skin.  Did not burn, went on smoothly, nice clean smell (but not overpowering).  Very soothing, no burn, suitable to sensitive skin.  Will buy again.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Dove Post Shave Balm is a good remedy for those times when you realize you didn&#x27;t apply enough foam or there was not enough left in your razor lubrication strip.  Sometimes the skin will feel itchy after a shave and this adds necessary moisture to avoid that feeling.  Very fast absorbent liquid, which also has a nice, not-too-strong amount fragrance.  This could work well on sensitive skin as well.  For those days when your razor bites, give Dove Post Shave Balm a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of aftershaves in the past and I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s there&#x27;s been one that I&#x27;ve been too attached to. Certainly not enough to constantly spend money on it. But I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shave balm smells pretty good and it is easy to wash off. My least favorite part about many other shave balms is that they take forever to wash off but that&#x27;s not the case here. I&#x27;ve also liked the way my face feels for awhile after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new shave balm, give this one a try. It doesn&#x27;t smell as great as many others, but it&#x27;s neutral and easy to use. I&#x27;ve enjoyed Dove&#x27;s line of new men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product: not greasy. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Good stuff..Nice smell!</li>
