            <li>It is probably a good product but the smell is not nose friendly.</li>
            <li>Great soap, at a VERY reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The scalp looks better.  </li>
            <li>but i have ordered the neem powder and like it better more uses...</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more soon.</li>
            <li>we do love the stuff I had to buy it because my husband father sold is out of stock give it a try</li>
            <li>You can use any Neem oil product and have satisfying results.</li>
            <li>It works well to keep my skin free from lose skin in the Psoriasis areas .</li>
            <li>I have had my kids use it and they are pleased with the results, which is high praise from teens, they asked for more..</li>

            <li>This Soap Really Makes Your Skin Smooth .</li>
            <li>The soap is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Not really a fan, like the MARGO neem better, but it was not terrible soap.</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my face and scalp right before I shower.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product along with straight Neem oil for a while, very pleased, would definitely buy this item again, no hesitations.</li>
            <li>Purchased three, as I ordered these prior, and find them not to have a horrendous odor as many neem items.</li>
            <li>I started using this due to ring worm issues, hair loss and psoriasis on one of my dogs, and its been an amazing help.  </li>
            <li>So when I unwrapped the soap I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lymes aside, the soap does what soaps are supposed to do - get you clean and not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>This soap really works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Also, I live near a forest preserve where the insects run rampant!  </li>
            <li>It last for a long time and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you often have skin blemishes or irritations, you may like it for face and body areas as it only took one or two uses of it to heal very satisfactorily my needs.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, read the label (on the TheraNeem site) -- TheraNeem products have less strange chemicals in them than many other products.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I use organic neem oil in home blended oils and lotions to control my psoriasis.  I know the stuff works.  So when I unwrapped the soap I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh smell of it.  I use it to wash my face and scalp right before I shower.  The scalp because of some psoriasis problems.  The scalp looks better.  The soap is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. It last for a long time and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;It works well for dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> it was good but i have ordered the neem powder and like it better more uses...but this product is good</li>

            <li> Not really a fan, like the MARGO neem better, but it was not terrible soap.</li>
            <li> we do love the stuff I had to buy it because my husband father sold is out of stock give it a try I think you&#x27;ll be happy. if you have issues underneath your folds of skin this is a great thing to use for washing with it helps deter further issues</li>
            <li> It is probably a good product but the smell is not nose friendly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an outdoor worker and have to scrub every day to help guard against deer ticks. I have no idea if the NEEM helps discourages ticks or not but I&#x27;ll use anything within reason that might lower my odds of getting Lymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lymes aside, the soap does what soaps are supposed to do - get you clean and not dry out your skin.  Plus, read the label (on the TheraNeem site) -- TheraNeem products have less strange chemicals in them than many other products.  I also like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I understand the Neem Tree is now being grown in Florida as well as a &amp;#34;protected species&amp;#34; in India. If you often have skin blemishes or irritations, you may like it for face and body areas as it only took one or two uses of it to heal very satisfactorily my needs. Did amazingly well on razor cuts.  I need to reorder.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the advice of a mom whose children suffered from facial acne.  I have had my kids use it and they are pleased with the results, which is high praise from teens, they asked for more..</li>
            <li> Purchased three, as I ordered these prior, and find them not to have a horrendous odor as many neem items. Its great product, and did purchase three.  Last long.

            <li> This is pretty good stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT SOAP, use on face body</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I recommend it for anyone who has sensitive skin. I used it on my son who has eczema and it cleared it up in days. You can use any Neem oil product and have satisfying results.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and itchy skin. Also, I live near a forest preserve where the insects run rampant!  I use this soap everyday and it helps with my dry and itchy skin.  It also keeps those nasty insects away from my skin...I don&#x27;t itch.  This soap really works.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  I like the way I feel after using it in the shower.  Little pricey for soap, but will keep buying ( why 4 instead of 5 stars)</li>
            <li> I find this soap a bit drying for my skin. Smell is not great but I kept using it. I am not sure I will buy again but thanks for sending product on time.</li>
            <li> Impressive  delivery rate, arrived in 1-2 days!  So far I love this soap for my face which never seems to feel clean, regardless what I tried. It seems to remove excess oil and grime feeling, leaving my skin feel renewed. It is to soon to see if my complexion clears from black heads.</li>
            <li> This Soap Really Makes Your Skin Smooth .</li>
            <li> Excellent soap will recomend it to any one..</li>
