            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite!</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>My $7 Loreal Telescopic is way better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because I love the mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Before this brand, I&#x27;d scoff at paying more than $8 for mascara.</li>
            <li>I use another product that removes most of it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the brush and formula.</li>
            <li>Perfect, will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I have a pretty good length of eyelashes but my lashes are fine.</li>
            <li>I would not ever use anything else,  even though it isn&#x27;t the easiest top get off its well worth how amazing and full it makes my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>After getting a free trial size from Sephora, I was reformed.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic formula, stays on all day.</li>
            <li>My lashes are soft to the touch and it is very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Mascara!</li>
            <li>Seriously, I wish this company made a good eye makeup remover that would completely remove this mascara easily.</li>
            <li>I just love this mascara, it makes my lashes look very long and the brush helps put the mascara on evenly without clumping.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think its real.....</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look so much longer and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product.  </li>
            <li>When new it can run a little, but overall gives great shape and separation of lashes</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, I feel like I get so much more length and less clumping than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the mascara, it was a little wetter in consistency than what I like, but I just wiped off the brush a couple of times and it was fine.</li>
            <li>It has a nice black color and really helps define long eyelashes and will even give the appearance of being longer.</li>
            <li>My new go to mascara...</li>
            <li>but I can tell you with certainty that the item I received is authentic and is not old or dry.</li>
            <li>first time I bought from a different vendor.  </li>
            <li>The mascara left my lashes really chunky.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive eyes and blepharitis/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even seeing my natural lashes growing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing this mascara for about two years now and occasionally I will try to go for a drugstore brand because of cost, but I always come back to it because the quality really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>this time it is good, but must be an older tube because it is a little dried up in comparison to the previous same purchase</li>

            <li> This is the third tube I&#x27;ve used and as long as Benefit&#x27;s makes it, I&#x27;ll purchase it!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t flake...enough to make your lashes look long and thick but not fake</li>
            <li> The mascara had a strange odor the moment I opened it, and the consistency of the product is very different than the real thing; not as thick.  </li>
            <li> makes lashes extremely long.</li>
            <li> If your curious about yours, visit this site I found which was totally helpful:  </li>
            <li> but I can get the same effect with far less expensive mascaras.</li>
            <li> so I plopped down $28 for it.</li>
            <li> Also, I was a little nervous to purchase from this seller based on some reviews</li>
            <li> It makes my thin lashes look fuller and thicker, especially after two coats.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is hard to remove!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of one for buying expensive cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I used it like 5 times and was disappointed each time.  </li>

            <li> I hated it.</li>

            <li> This is an excellent mascara! It makes my thin lashes look fuller and thicker, especially after two coats. It stays on all day and never flakes. This is the third tube I&#x27;ve used and as long as Benefit&#x27;s makes it, I&#x27;ll purchase it!</li>
            <li> BewAre. Counterfeit merchandise.</li>
            <li> OK but I don&#x27;t think its real.....</li>
            <li> My new go to mascara... doesn&#x27;t flake...enough to make your lashes look long and thick but not fake</li>
            <li> first time I bought from a different vendor.  I gave 5 stars.  this time it is good, but must be an older tube because it is a little dried up in comparison to the previous same purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say, buy this mascara, usually wonderful, but don&#x27;t buy from this vendor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this mascara for about two years now and occasionally I will try to go for a drugstore brand because of cost, but I always come back to it because the quality really makes a difference. I definitely recommend this mascara! Also, I was a little nervous to purchase from this seller based on some reviews but I can tell you with certainty that the item I received is authentic and is not old or dry. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> makes lashes extremely long. flared bristles catch shorter inner lashes. would recommend</li>
            <li> I heard about this on E! News so I plopped down $28 for it. I hated it. If I could return it I would. My $7 Loreal Telescopic is way better than this.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has a nice black color and really helps define long eyelashes and will even give the appearance of being longer.</li>
            <li> When new it can run a little, but overall gives great shape and separation of lashes</li>
            <li> This is not the real Mascara! I buy this all the time and know how it works! but this one feels looks and smells  like someone used all of it and replaced it with paint.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty good length of eyelashes but my lashes are fine. So when I saw this in my Facebook saying that it lengthen and thickens eyelashes, I wanted to try it. I&#x27;m glad I did because I love the mascara. I definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used (53 yrs) compares to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of one for buying expensive cosmetics. Before this brand, I&#x27;d scoff at paying more than $8 for mascara. After getting a free trial size from Sephora, I was reformed. I love this mascara, I feel like I get so much more length and less clumping than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The mascara left my lashes really chunky. After applying it, my lashes were no longer separated. It was really frustrating, specially considering the price.</li>
            <li> This is great mascara!!! It makes my eyelashes look so much longer and doesn&#x27;t clump. My only complaint is that it is hard to remove! LOL Seriously, I wish this company made a good eye makeup remover that would completely remove this mascara easily. I use another product that removes most of it but I still have residue on my washrag after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I just love this mascara, it makes my lashes look very long and the brush helps put the mascara on evenly without clumping.  My lashes are soft to the touch and it is very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Would like to give zero stars.  This is not the real product, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and formula. When I first opened the mascara, it was a little wetter in consistency than what I like, but I just wiped off the brush a couple of times and it was fine. This is a fantastic formula, stays on all day. I have incredibly sensitive eyes and blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction, and yet I can still use this without aggravating my eyes. Perfect, will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.... I&#x27;ve tried the youngnique or whatever and the benefit product beats it a thousand times over. I&#x27;m even seeing my natural lashes growing. I will definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> Meh. It&#x27;s okay but I can get the same effect with far less expensive mascaras.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation.  I didn&#x27;t think it was all that, especially for $25.  I used it like 5 times and was disappointed each time.  I&#x27;m back with my Cover Girl.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product.  The mascara had a strange odor the moment I opened it, and the consistency of the product is very different than the real thing; not as thick.  I guess I learned my lesson buying this on amazon-- I will only buy at a make-up store or department store from now on.</li>
            <li> BEWARE- this product is totally COUNTERFEIT.  If you wear Benefit mascara you will notice the difference immediately.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  If your curious about yours, visit this site I found which was totally helpful:  www.stephaniebrink.me (how to tell if your benefit mascara is real or fake)</li>
            <li> I tried this about 5 years ago and have been hooked ever since.  I would not ever use anything else,  even though it isn&#x27;t the easiest top get off its well worth how amazing and full it makes my eyelashes.</li>
