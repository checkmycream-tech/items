            <li>Creates beautiful curls that last for days!!</li>
            <li>The curler is hot where it works to curl the hair nicely.</li>

            <li>I Reccomend this curler to those who want a fast, but nice looking style to their hair.</li>
            <li>After the 5 days, I thought it would be wise instead of sleeping wildly to use a hair bonnet.</li>
            <li>I was first pleased by how light this curling wand is.</li>
            <li>I love this Curler so much!</li>
            <li>I received it really quick with no problems, which is awesome because I was really anxious to test it out.</li>

            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It makes curling your hair fun rather than stressful.</li>
            <li>It makes curling your hair fun rather than stressful.</li>
            <li>I would just get a cheaper version of a clip-free curler to see if you like it first before splurging for this one.</li>
            <li>This curling iron heats up so fast !</li>
            <li>By far the only curler that has been able to curl my hair !</li>
            <li>I would reccomend if your hair is super super long, go with the 25 mm,</li>
            <li>than I expected it to be. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>The glove does not help much.</li>
            <li>Ordered this and am very well pleased...works well..</li>
            <li>Also, the top of the strand needs to be wrapped tightly around to keep the curl consistent.</li>
            <li>This one is a high quality wand</li>
            <li>It curls my hair so fast, and keeps it soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the iron arrived so professional looking.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li>I have long hair, about half way down my back and the 19mm was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It only has one temperature though, which is extremely hot, so if you have bleached hair like me, just hold the curl for 3 seconds instead of</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t mastered getting actual curls from the clipless iron, I do get extremely pretty waves with it.</li>
            <li>This item is not intended for rickity old hands like mine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far lighter than a traditional curling iron, which makes it easier to work with.</li>

It has a nice swivel cord to prevent tangles.

I found it easiest to hold the curling wand behind my head with the tip pointing down, then use the other (gloved) hand to wrap the 1-2 inch piece of hair around the barrel. Also, the top of the strand needs to be wrapped tightly around to keep the curl consistent. The glove comes included with this, along with 2 hair clips which was very nice.

Although the barrel is quite slim, it makes more spirals which creates that vintage glam look. I absolute love this curling iron, even for a great price!</li>
            <li> I just got this to try out the &#x27;wand&#x27; instead of the normal curling iron, and I am impressed! This one is a high quality wand, I love that is very light weight so it doesn&#x27;t tire my hand, and the cord swivels with you, so it doesn&#x27;t get all twisted! It comes with the glove which works great so you won&#x27;t burn your hand. I am sold on the wand,I only leave it a few seconds and my curl stays, looks very natural unlike my reg. curling iron which left creases. Highly recommend this wand, good price and high quality, and they deliver fast.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest curling iron I have ever had! It curls my hair so fast, and keeps it soft and bouncy. It is so easy to use after you get used to it, and I recommend it to all of my friends. What a GREAT DEAL. I can&#x27;t use anything else to curl my hair anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday after she used one at her friends and she absolutely loves it and her hair turns out perfect everytime!</li>
            <li> I never understood how to use those curlers with the clips and all, so I decided to try this. This curler is really easy to use and it leaves you with beautiful curls. It makes curling your hair fun rather than stressful. I love this curler! I received it really quick with no problems, which is awesome because I was really anxious to test it out. Definitely holding on to this curler!</li>
            <li> My hair will not hold a curl for long. after a day, they drop. Although I haven&#x27;t mastered getting actual curls from the clipless iron, I do get extremely pretty waves with it. I didn&#x27;t use a holder or anything. My hair stayed that way for 5 days. I don&#x27;t recommend that someone uses a bonnet with it though. After the 5 days, I thought it would be wise instead of sleeping wildly to use a hair bonnet. Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the curls (waves) look great. They give you clips to hold your hair and a glove with the iron. So don&#x27;t buy extra for no reason.</li>
            <li> This item is so great! I literally curl my little girls hair in 2 minutes every morning and it stays all day long! Great product and well worth the money!</li>
