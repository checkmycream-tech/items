            <li>Received my order very quick!!</li>

            <li>I was very pleased with the purchase.</li>

            <li>nicely packed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about this kind of device, however, from her opinion, price - value-makeshift is perfect.</li>
            <li>Works great, good quality, thanks!</li>
            <li>I am sure she will love it and it will meet her needs!  </li>
            <li>The light is blindingly bright and with no way to adjust it, I hope I don&#x27;t cause any of my \\&quot;mock\\</li>
            <li>This is nice, but I was expecting better quality.</li>
            <li>I liked it more instead of bulky devices that are not portable as this one.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to spending $500 or more on Welch Allyn&#x27;s full pro set.</li>
            <li>they sell excellent product 100% new and original!</li>
            <li>It is very light weight with the AA batteries too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent kit for medical students and physicians who are not ophthalmologists or otorhinolaringologists.</li>
            <li>The handle seems cheaply made with fair fit and finish.  </li>
            <li>I love this pocket set.</li>
            <li>However, it works well :)</li>
            <li>A rate this white 5 stars because the product is excellent, lobe the spare ear adaptors... and arrived without any problems...</li>
            <li>The body is on the smaller side, but I think it&#x27;ll be perfect for school.</li>
            <li>Love them both.  </li>
            <li>They are cheaper because they use batteries instead of charging with a plug-in, but I love them &amp; their carrying case.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had problems with it at all, except you have to change the batteries more often than you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t do better than this for the price.  </li>
            <li>My best kit as a medical student.</li>
            <li>So practical i love it.</li>
            <li>The product is original!</li>
            <li>So far this has been great to use when inspecting the eye and ear.  </li>
            <li>IDEAL especially if you dont plan on specializing in E.N.T.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and compact, fits right in the lab coat pocket, and the quality is strong.  </li>
            <li>Friendly user easy to carry and light!</li>
            <li>easy to store.</li>
            <li>Battery easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>correct reading and easy to read results.case is easy to keep tools together.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>the problem is that the light is very dim and you cant get a great light reflex off the optic disc like you</li>
            <li>Seems pretty good except that there is no dimmer on the ophthalmoscope, so unless you are quick on your eye exam you may burn your patients retina</li>
            <li>The otoscope works fine.  </li>
            <li>but I found that the light switch was easily turned on</li>
            <li>perfect for first year medical school</li>
            <li>Light and easy to take around.</li>
            <li>I got these for my health assessment clinical in NP school and wanted to find a nice quality for a reasonable price - this product fit that bill.  </li>
            <li>I tried the light on myself from about 1 foot</li>
            <li>Product itself looks cheap.</li>
            <li>Well turns out the light was not working in the otoscope.</li>
            <li>The otoscope arrived working well, and then the light died after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It provides a quick and easy view.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m able to find the optic disc, veins/arteries and the pearly grey + cone of light!!</li>
            <li>Overall, the kit had seemed good when I received it.</li>
            <li>A definite save for good quality Diagnostic set...</li>
            <li>this little  set is attractive and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but u can just buy rechargeable batteries for this if you want lol... and its also lighter weight than the other diagnostic sett, so unless you plan to specialize in ENT surgery...</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t leave you hanging, unless you don&#x27;t bring a extra pair of batteries, which fit nicely on the bottom of the included pocketbag.</li>
            <li>But this will do the job if you need just a quick look.</li>
            <li>The otoscope works fine, but I feel as though the opthalmoscope doesn&#x27;t really magnify...</li>
            <li>The one at my job is all stainless steel, has a nice weight in your hand and you twist the bottom to turn it on, similar to a flash light..</li>
            <li>The lens is just OK, and of course has a fixed focus.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with product so far.</li>
            <li>THAT is worth the cost</li>
            <li>Beware if you buy it here to save $100 you might end up spending more to get it fixed.</li>
            <li>His feedback was very positive.</li>
            <li>This set is decent enough to get the job done for school and as a good travel set.</li>
            <li>It is so light and easy to slip into a white coat pocket.</li>
            <li>perfect little thing for medical school rounds.</li>
            <li>Smart choice to make!</li>
            <li>Pretty good little set for the money</li>
            <li>Fast deliver!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for attention!</li>
            <li>Just received this so these are just first impressions.    </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Delivery on time and also product received as described exactly on the picture.  </li>
            <li>I am a first year pediatric resident.</li>
            <li>Dim light.</li>
            <li>I took these to Africa and used them in a clinic that was unbelievably hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Welch was nice enough to send me a new bulb, but they did not have to.</li>
            <li>The only bummer is that the light for the opthalmoscope is not adjustable and it can quickly irritate my patients eye.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, Welch Allyn backs up their products, and offers a full warranty for med students, while we are students.  </li>
            <li>fresh out the plastic brand new smell, not a scratch on the hardware...  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for our daughter who needed it by a certain date, and I gave plenty of time.  </li>
            <li>the model name/number certainly was never mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li>Very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice little portable kit.</li>
            <li>&quot; patients to become real patients as they trip over the furniture on the way out.</li>
            <li>and thanks for the pen..</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>B000RJXUDS Welch Allyn Otoscope/opthalomscope Diagnostic Set MOD 95001]]</li>
            <li>I do hope I keep a gentle touch, but I would suggest that if you could save up, buy the kit in the box.</li>
            <li>Too much money to spend on this quality.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Finish needs some refinement but for that price I shouldn&#x27;t ask for too much.</li>
            <li>I imagine that she may want to upgrade at some point; but she really enjoys the lighter weight, doing her rounds.</li>
            <li>They worked really well and didn&#x27;t use much battery power.  </li>
            <li>A very practical set.</li>
            <li>So useful, i can carry It in my case, not heavy at all and no need to charge</li>
            <li>so its ready to use.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more clear instructions for the different settings on the opthalmascope.  </li>
            <li>I requested a full refund and will never order medical supplies or anything from them every again.   </li>
            <li>this would be the better buy hands down</li>
            <li>I received brand new without defects!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try some older batteries to see if that helps, but Welch Allyn needs to correct this problem.</li>
            <li>Handy little portable set, light is quite as powerful as more expensive models but works well for occasional house calls.</li>
            <li>Definitely doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s worth $200.</li>
            <li>I consider the opthalmoscope unusable due to the brightness of the light.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, if you need a cheap otoscope/opthalmoscope, I&#x27;d reccomend this.</li>
            <li>I bought it brand new.</li>
            <li>Arrived well protected and it was a New Product</li>
            <li>Works as well as anything on a doctors office wall and very easy to stick in your little white coat.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who has just finished her first year of medical school.</li>
            <li>various light sizes , green and white light switch, all the magnifications</li>
            <li>Much less substantial build-quality than my primary one in the clinic.</li>
            <li>They are small enough to carry with her to clinical practicums but large enough, and bright enough, to be functional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working well so far.</li>
            <li>and you really need to be closer to do a proper examination.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it for any healthcare professional who needs portability and quality.</li>
            <li>professional equipment.</li>
            <li>However, when I finish with school, in a professional setting they just wouldn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>,  Otoscope comes with disposable and reusable tips of different sizes ( more than what I expected), they even send it with two double A batteries required to power the device...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always difficult to evaluate the fundus of the eye, but this is a good sort of inexpensive option for med students.</li>
            <li>I tried to avoid spending $500 on the good, expensive equipment</li>
            <li>Many professors recommend bulky expensive diagnostic sets but this compact less expensive kit has been perfect for practicing my clinical skills first year.  </li>
            <li>This one barely worked for a month before it fell apart, but at least it was cheap!</li>
            <li>I expected a little better quality from Welch Allyn.  </li>
            <li>The bulbs luckily are the same as for welch&#x27;s other otoscopes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the more expensive models much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>Otoscope is clear enough and ophthalmoscope works well also.</li>
            <li>I use it daily in my busy office and on ward rounds.</li>
            <li>This is all what I need to complete my examination, especially during calls when I have no time looking for the otoscope on the pediatric floor.</li>
            <li>The head quality seems low-end and simple but decent enough to use regularly.    </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, arrived in just a few days!  </li>
            <li>Portable, simple to use and cheap (on the USA at least, here in brazil is twice the price).</li>
            <li>This is smaller, easier to handle, cheaper, works just as well, and is the envy of my classmates who spent too much money.</li>
            <li>Beats paying  twice as much for the other diagnostic set ... which only difference is probably the rechargeable batteries ..</li>
            <li>Good product, bad seller.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got these for my health assessment clinical in NP school and wanted to find a nice quality for a reasonable price - this product fit that bill.  </li>
            <li> I tried the light on myself from about 1 foot</li>
            <li> Product itself looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Well turns out the light was not working in the otoscope.</li>
            <li> The otoscope arrived working well, and then the light died after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It provides a quick and easy view.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;m able to find the optic disc, veins/arteries and the pearly grey + cone of light!!</li>
            <li> Overall, the kit had seemed good when I received it.</li>
            <li> A definite save for good quality Diagnostic set...</li>
            <li> this little  set is attractive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> but u can just buy rechargeable batteries for this if you want lol... and its also lighter weight than the other diagnostic sett, so unless you plan to specialize in ENT surgery...</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t leave you hanging, unless you don&#x27;t bring a extra pair of batteries, which fit nicely on the bottom of the included pocketbag.</li>
            <li> But this will do the job if you need just a quick look.</li>
            <li> The otoscope works fine, but I feel as though the opthalmoscope doesn&#x27;t really magnify...</li>
            <li> The one at my job is all stainless steel, has a nice weight in your hand and you twist the bottom to turn it on, similar to a flash light..</li>
            <li> The lens is just OK, and of course has a fixed focus.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with product so far.</li>
            <li> THAT is worth the cost</li>
            <li> Beware if you buy it here to save $100 you might end up spending more to get it fixed.</li>
            <li> His feedback was very positive.</li>
            <li> This set is decent enough to get the job done for school and as a good travel set.</li>
            <li> It is so light and easy to slip into a white coat pocket.</li>
            <li> perfect little thing for medical school rounds.</li>
            <li> Smart choice to make!</li>
            <li> Pretty good little set for the money</li>
            <li> Fast deliver!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for attention!</li>
            <li> Just received this so these are just first impressions.    </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Delivery on time and also product received as described exactly on the picture.  </li>
            <li> I am a first year pediatric resident.</li>
            <li> Dim light.</li>
            <li> I took these to Africa and used them in a clinic that was unbelievably hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Welch was nice enough to send me a new bulb, but they did not have to.</li>
            <li> The only bummer is that the light for the opthalmoscope is not adjustable and it can quickly irritate my patients eye.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, Welch Allyn backs up their products, and offers a full warranty for med students, while we are students.  </li>
            <li> fresh out the plastic brand new smell, not a scratch on the hardware...  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for our daughter who needed it by a certain date, and I gave plenty of time.  </li>
            <li> the model name/number certainly was never mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> Very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice little portable kit.</li>
            <li> &quot; patients to become real patients as they trip over the furniture on the way out.</li>
            <li> and thanks for the pen..</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> B000RJXUDS Welch Allyn Otoscope/opthalomscope Diagnostic Set MOD 95001]]</li>
            <li> I do hope I keep a gentle touch, but I would suggest that if you could save up, buy the kit in the box.</li>
            <li> Too much money to spend on this quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Finish needs some refinement but for that price I shouldn&#x27;t ask for too much.</li>
            <li> I imagine that she may want to upgrade at some point; but she really enjoys the lighter weight, doing her rounds.</li>
            <li> They worked really well and didn&#x27;t use much battery power.  </li>
            <li> A very practical set.</li>
            <li> So useful, i can carry It in my case, not heavy at all and no need to charge</li>
            <li> so its ready to use.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more clear instructions for the different settings on the opthalmascope.  </li>
            <li> I requested a full refund and will never order medical supplies or anything from them every again.   </li>
            <li> this would be the better buy hands down</li>
            <li> I received brand new without defects!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try some older batteries to see if that helps, but Welch Allyn needs to correct this problem.</li>
            <li> Handy little portable set, light is quite as powerful as more expensive models but works well for occasional house calls.</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s worth $200.</li>
            <li> I consider the opthalmoscope unusable due to the brightness of the light.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, if you need a cheap otoscope/opthalmoscope, I&#x27;d reccomend this.</li>
            <li> I bought it brand new.</li>
            <li> Arrived well protected and it was a New Product</li>
            <li> Works as well as anything on a doctors office wall and very easy to stick in your little white coat.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has just finished her first year of medical school.</li>
            <li> various light sizes , green and white light switch, all the magnifications</li>
            <li> Much less substantial build-quality than my primary one in the clinic.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to carry with her to clinical practicums but large enough, and bright enough, to be functional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working well so far.</li>
            <li> and you really need to be closer to do a proper examination.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for any healthcare professional who needs portability and quality.</li>
            <li> professional equipment.</li>
            <li> However, when I finish with school, in a professional setting they just wouldn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> ,  Otoscope comes with disposable and reusable tips of different sizes ( more than what I expected), they even send it with two double A batteries required to power the device...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always difficult to evaluate the fundus of the eye, but this is a good sort of inexpensive option for med students.</li>
            <li> I tried to avoid spending $500 on the good, expensive equipment</li>
            <li> Many professors recommend bulky expensive diagnostic sets but this compact less expensive kit has been perfect for practicing my clinical skills first year.  </li>
            <li> This one barely worked for a month before it fell apart, but at least it was cheap!</li>
            <li> I expected a little better quality from Welch Allyn.  </li>
            <li> The bulbs luckily are the same as for welch&#x27;s other otoscopes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the more expensive models much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> Otoscope is clear enough and ophthalmoscope works well also.</li>
            <li> I use it daily in my busy office and on ward rounds.</li>
            <li> This is all what I need to complete my examination, especially during calls when I have no time looking for the otoscope on the pediatric floor.</li>
            <li> The head quality seems low-end and simple but decent enough to use regularly.    </li>
            <li> Quick delivery, arrived in just a few days!  </li>
            <li> Portable, simple to use and cheap (on the USA at least, here in brazil is twice the price).</li>
            <li> This is smaller, easier to handle, cheaper, works just as well, and is the envy of my classmates who spent too much money.</li>
            <li> Beats paying  twice as much for the other diagnostic set ... which only difference is probably the rechargeable batteries ..</li>
            <li> Good product, bad seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not super high quality, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> The lights only work half of the time and they are incredibly dim.</li>
            <li> Just have to be careful in case it drops as the opthalomscope is fragile.</li>
            <li> I am going to try other products from the same brand</li>
            <li> , I was past the warranty from Devine Medical and couldn&#x27;t get a refund.   </li>
            <li> They even asked about where I got it, I guess they r trying to stop other companies from selling products that r dysfunctional.</li>
            <li> I never got the return call, and she was extremely rude on the second phone call.  </li>
            <li> Was surprised by the poor quality, given the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> nifty little guy.....</li>
            <li> Also the on/off switch is a small plastic lever that feels like it is loose and will eventually break with basic frequent use :(</li>
            <li> The switch feels like it wouldn&#x27;t endure heavy usage.  </li>
            <li> If you are going into opthamology, obviously I&#x27;d recommend an expensive pan-optic, but for the typical med student I&#x27;d recommend these.  </li>
            <li> It seems as if it would break at the slightest touch, which would render the entire instrument useless.</li>
            <li> Works well and is small and portable.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Expensive kits may have some ease of use benefits, but I have had little to no difficulty adapting to this style/size kit.</li>
            <li> Not a good learning tool.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no light intensity adjustment capability</li>
            <li> Poor optics.</li>
            <li> This was a very unfortunate waste of money.</li>
            <li> In any case, it causes the pupil to constrict, making the exam difficult.</li>
            <li> so instead I bought this, but it&#x27;s essentially useless.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was  somewhat disappointed with the quality of the workmanship.</li>
            <li> This equipment is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Product! Fast deliver!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for attention!</li>
            <li> Product came according to specifications, in the predicted period. It&#x27;s been working well so far. It&#x27;s an excellent kit for medical students and physicians who are not ophthalmologists or otorhinolaringologists.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for our daughter who needed it by a certain date, and I gave plenty of time.  It was sent to an incorrect address.  After contacting the company twice by phone, the customer service representative assured me she would call me back after speaking with her supervisor.  I never got the return call, and she was extremely rude on the second phone call.  I would never use this company again!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a middle of the line diagnostic kit, but when it got here, it turned out to be the \\&quot;pocket jr\\&quot;. It should still work for my classes, but it&#x27;s not the quality I was expecting and the model name/number certainly was never mentioned in the description. The light is blindingly bright and with no way to adjust it, I hope I don&#x27;t cause any of my \\&quot;mock\\&quot; patients to become real patients as they trip over the furniture on the way out.</li>
            <li> Great I recommend you to buy it to importadora esviso they sell excellent product 100% new and original!</li>
            <li> Nice little portable kit. It&#x27;s always difficult to evaluate the fundus of the eye, but this is a good sort of inexpensive option for med students.</li>
            <li> I bought this last month for my son who&#x27;s a second year medical student. His feedback was very positive.</li>
            <li> This is nice, but I was expecting better quality. We have one similar at my job, so that&#x27;s what I was expecting. The one at my job is all stainless steel, has a nice weight in your hand and you twist the bottom to turn it on, similar to a flash light..this one I received has plastic handles and feels flimsy in your hand. Also the on/off switch is a small plastic lever that feels like it is loose and will eventually break with basic frequent use :(</li>
            <li> This was a great choice.  My bookstore only offered a larger, more expensive version.  This is smaller, easier to handle, cheaper, works just as well, and is the envy of my classmates who spent too much money.</li>
            <li> Just received this so these are just first impressions.    The otoscope works fine.  I expected a little better quality from Welch Allyn.  The lens is just OK, and of course has a fixed focus.  (Wear your glasses or contacts while using.)  The switch feels like it wouldn&#x27;t endure heavy usage.  The handle seems cheaply made with fair fit and finish.  The head quality seems low-end and simple but decent enough to use regularly.    I consider the opthalmoscope unusable due to the brightness of the light.  I tried the light on myself from about 1 foot and it is unacceptable - and you really need to be closer to do a proper examination.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try some older batteries to see if that helps, but Welch Allyn needs to correct this problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! and thanks for the pen..</li>
            <li> The item never arrived!  I was very dissapointed. I contacted the sender and got a reply but they did not follow up on my case. I requested a full refund and will never order medical supplies or anything from them every again.   Warning!</li>
            <li> Very good deal! Smart choice to make! Fast shipping! The best otoscope/opthtalmoscope ever! I&#x27;m very happy whith my choice! I recommend!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and just as described.</li>
            <li> I love this pocket set. Very high quality for the price. I would recommend it for any healthcare professional who needs portability and quality.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the purchase. The Sellers is correct. I received on time and in perfect condition. I recommend![[ASIN:B000RJXUDS Welch Allyn Otoscope/opthalomscope Diagnostic Set MOD 95001]]</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, arrived in just a few days!  Product itself looks cheap. Definitely doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s worth $200. However, it works well :) Otoscope is clear enough and ophthalmoscope works well also. You can see the red reflex and view the optic nerve.</li>
            <li> Received my order very quick!! Seller was great to work with. Pleased with product so far. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Overall, the kit had seemed good when I received it. However, 2 months later when I started using it in school and actually realized that it was broken (the opthalmoscope mirror was off, and the otoscope light bulb was cracked), I was past the warranty from Devine Medical and couldn&#x27;t get a refund.   Thankfully, Welch Allyn backs up their products, and offers a full warranty for med students, while we are students.  Good product, bad seller.</li>
            <li> So I thought that it was a great deal.  The otoscope works fine, but I feel as though the opthalmoscope doesn&#x27;t really magnify...</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was  somewhat disappointed with the quality of the workmanship. especially in the off/on switch. It seems as if it would break at the slightest touch, which would render the entire instrument useless. I do hope I keep a gentle touch, but I would suggest that if you could save up, buy the kit in the box. THAT is worth the cost</li>
            <li> Seems pretty good except that there is no dimmer on the ophthalmoscope, so unless you are quick on your eye exam you may burn your patients retina (well, probably not, but they will be grumpy). In any case, it causes the pupil to constrict, making the exam difficult. But you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This item works if you are just wanting to practice, however in the clinical setting it is not up to par. the problem is that the light is very dim and you cant get a great light reflex off the optic disc like you can with the more expensive welch allen. The Otoscope however, works perfectly well for what you need it to.</li>
            <li> Handy little portable set, light is quite as powerful as more expensive models but works well for occasional house calls.</li>
            <li> this little  set is attractive and easy to use. easy to store. works well. but it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> This equipment is terrible. I tried to avoid spending $500 on the good, expensive equipment so instead I bought this, but it&#x27;s essentially useless. The lights only work half of the time and they are incredibly dim. Definitely not sufficient for my medical training. This was a very unfortunate waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good value but I found that the light switch was easily turned on and I found it turned on within the case several times.</li>
            <li> nifty little guy.....perfect for first year medical school</li>
            <li> A rate this white 5 stars because the product is excellent, lobe the spare ear adaptors... and arrived without any problems...</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  If you need one of these, just buy a good one.  This one barely worked for a month before it fell apart, but at least it was cheap!</li>
            <li> Delivery on time and also product received as described exactly on the picture.  Excellent price.  Fully recommended.</li>
            <li> As I can says is &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34;  It does the job, BUT feels like something you won at the carnival. Too much money to spend on this quality.</li>
            <li> Portable, simple to use and cheap (on the USA at least, here in brazil is twice the price). Won&#x27;t leave you hanging, unless you don&#x27;t bring a extra pair of batteries, which fit nicely on the bottom of the included pocketbag.</li>
            <li> Good Quality, and fair price. Fast shipping. Packaged well for shipping</li>
            <li> Works well and is small and portable.  Battery easy to replace.  Case is sturdy.  Perfect for hospital rounds and students.  Affordable</li>
            <li> I bought this diagnostic set for PA school--it seems to work great! The body is on the smaller side, but I think it&#x27;ll be perfect for school.</li>
            <li> Love them both.  They are cheaper because they use batteries instead of charging with a plug-in, but I love them &amp; their carrying case.  If you are going into opthamology, obviously I&#x27;d recommend an expensive pan-optic, but for the typical med student I&#x27;d recommend these.  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I got these for my health assessment clinical in NP school and wanted to find a nice quality for a reasonable price - this product fit that bill.  It&#x27;s nice and compact, fits right in the lab coat pocket, and the quality is strong.  they&#x27;ve worked for me every time I&#x27;ve used them and that&#x27;s all i can ask for!</li>
            <li> I use it daily in my busy office and on ward rounds. Just have to be careful in case it drops as the opthalomscope is fragile.</li>
            <li> excellent product. Recommend purchase. Good finish and design. I am going to try other products from the same brand</li>
            <li> The ophtalmoscope looks like rusty. I bought it brand new. It looks different from the othoscope. But apperantly works Ok.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO GRACIAS AMAZON</li>
            <li> I am a first year pediatric resident. This is all what I need to complete my examination, especially during calls when I have no time looking for the otoscope on the pediatric floor. It is compatible to the hospital ear pieces.</li>
            <li> The scopes do not focus properly on any settings. I played with each setting &amp; could not see at all</li>
            <li> I bought this for a physical diagnosis course in medical school. It&#x27;s definitely not super high quality, but it does the trick. I haven&#x27;t had problems with it at all, except you have to change the batteries more often than you&#x27;d like. Other than that, if you need a cheap otoscope/opthalmoscope, I&#x27;d reccomend this. I even had our opthalmology professors say that he liked it.</li>
            <li> professional equipment. nicely packed. works well. no complaints. correct reading and easy to read results.case is easy to keep tools together.</li>
            <li> It is a gift for someone who is going to go to Medical school! I am sure she will love it and it will meet her needs!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Arrived well protected and it was a New Product</li>
            <li> I bought this as a requirement for my FNP program. This set is decent enough to get the job done for school and as a good travel set. However, when I finish with school, in a professional setting they just wouldn&#x27;t cut it. Good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Unless you wanna drop $700 on a pan-opthalmic you can&#x27;t do better than this for the price.  Works as well as anything on a doctors office wall and very easy to stick in your little white coat.  My friends who bought the bigger more expensive ones are jealous.</li>
            <li> Dim light. Poor optics. Had to send back. Not a good learning tool. Flimsy plastic, too. Was surprised by the poor quality, given the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Friendly user easy to carry and light!</li>
            <li> Very good optics and light source. Light and easy to take around. Finish needs some refinement but for that price I shouldn&#x27;t ask for too much.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money. My best kit as a medical student.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no light intensity adjustment capability</li>
            <li> Very good salesman! The product is original! No complains! Only compliments! I received brand new without defects! Strongly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice day!</li>
            <li> It does all she needs for everything she does, including her clinicals.  I imagine that she may want to upgrade at some point; but she really enjoys the lighter weight, doing her rounds.</li>
            <li> Works great, good quality, thanks!</li>
            <li> Great  tools  for my practice</li>
            <li> Pretty good little set for the money</li>
            <li> Excellent price and quality</li>
            <li> I took these to Africa and used them in a clinic that was unbelievably hot. They worked really well and didn&#x27;t use much battery power.  A very practical set.</li>
            <li> A gift for my soon to be doctor Niece. I don&#x27;t know much about this kind of device, however, from her opinion, price - value-makeshift is perfect.</li>
            <li> So practical i love it. So useful, i can carry It in my case, not heavy at all and no need to charge</li>
            <li> The diagnostic tool is excellent as it fits in my pocket. I liked it more instead of bulky devices that are not portable as this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for school so I can practice and hopefully know how to use this when I go into the hospital. Well turns out the light was not working in the otoscope. I called welch Allyn and they don&#x27;t make this or sell this or cover this product anymore, but the box comes with a warranty if it does not work, welch Allyn also covers students if anything happens to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welch was nice enough to send me a new bulb, but they did not have to. They even asked about where I got it, I guess they r trying to stop other companies from selling products that r dysfunctional. Beware if you buy it here to save $100 you might end up spending more to get it fixed. Also they don&#x27;t make parts anymore. The bulbs luckily are the same as for welch&#x27;s other otoscopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend looking into the student discount at welch.</li>
            <li> So far this has been great to use when inspecting the eye and ear.  I wish there were more clear instructions for the different settings on the opthalmascope.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m able to find the optic disc, veins/arteries and the pearly grey + cone of light!! The otoscope uses the standard office/hospital specula that are found everywhere!  It is very light weight with the AA batteries too.</li>
            <li> 100% reliable and recommended. Excellent !!!</li>
            <li> The otoscope arrived working well, and then the light died after 3 weeks.  I tried to replace the battery to no avail.  As a medical school student with standardized patient tests coming up, I needed this to work.  Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Great as a backup or for home use.  Much less substantial build-quality than my primary one in the clinic.</li>
            <li> The otoscope works great, I was really impressed. The opthalmascope is another story. I would say to find a place where you could just order the otoscope instead of the two paired together.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has just finished her first year of medical school. Some reviews indicated that the product was inferior to their expectations. My daughter was delighted with the scopes. They are small enough to carry with her to clinical practicums but large enough, and bright enough, to be functional. My physician friends all endorsed this manufacturer as producing superior equipment that lasts decades. I evaluated many options and this was the best value.</li>
            <li> Many professors recommend bulky expensive diagnostic sets but this compact less expensive kit has been perfect for practicing my clinical skills first year.  Expensive kits may have some ease of use benefits, but I have had little to no difficulty adapting to this style/size kit.</li>
            <li> Best one for the money! I am a medical student, this was all I needed! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend actually practicing with it.</li>
            <li> perfect little thing for medical school rounds. It is so light and easy to slip into a white coat pocket. This is a great alternative to spending $500 or more on Welch Allyn&#x27;s full pro set. As with all Welcy Allyn products, it works great.</li>
            <li> Thank you, a great investment</li>
            <li> It works great for what I need it for in my EENT class. The only bummer is that the light for the opthalmoscope is not adjustable and it can quickly irritate my patients eye.</li>
            <li> A definite save for good quality Diagnostic set... IDEAL especially if you dont plan on specializing in E.N.T. Has all the specs that a Welch Allyn Ophtal and Otoscope would have. 6 various light sizes , green and white light switch, all the magnifications,  Otoscope comes with disposable and reusable tips of different sizes ( more than what I expected), they even send it with two double A batteries required to power the device... so its ready to use. comes with a clip on pouch  that carries the tools , and the tools also have neat clip on parts... fresh out the plastic brand new smell, not a scratch on the hardware...  You jus cant beat it .. Beats paying  twice as much for the other diagnostic set ... which only difference is probably the rechargeable batteries .. but u can just buy rechargeable batteries for this if you want lol... and its also lighter weight than the other diagnostic sett, so unless you plan to specialize in ENT surgery... this would be the better buy hands down</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t compare.  It provides a quick and easy view.  The otoscope is perfect for use, although I find I can&#x27;t use this ophthalmoscope.  I find the more expensive models much easier to use.  But this will do the job if you need just a quick look.</li>
