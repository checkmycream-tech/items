            <li>This stuff is great..</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>If were marketed more toward people that shave just their face, it would be an Amazon best seller.</li>
            <li>This almost kills razor tug to nil and is great for shaving you head, or anything else that needs a good razoring.</li>
            <li>worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>but all in all provides a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s headblade product its always good</li>
            <li>I use the Headshed Lotion to negate the bumps and scales that I otherwise had to contend with, and as one can imagine after 3-4 days you got a fair bit of stub to shave off and</li>
            <li>all the good to say about it</li>
            <li>This product is good to use if you have a bald head and want to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find it on amazon since I am overseas now and it isnt available over here in the UK.  </li>
            <li>so it gets a fair amount of use.</li>
            <li>bottle lasts a good while...</li>
            <li>Good product to use along with the head blade.  </li>
            <li>This is a good in between from the soaps that you lather on and the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Good for shave the head</li>
            <li>Good shaving cream for head shaving.</li>
            <li>It is a good product; I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dominique</li>

            <li>Excellent product highly recommended to every body, this shave took the piece of the cake!!!</li>
            <li>Love this works great with the Head Blade</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure on why this works so great, but I dig it.</li>
            <li>great tingling feeling to perk you up during those early morning shaves and each lotion works great!</li>
            <li>More importantly, This is the best shaving cream I have used.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Headblade products to shave my head for about 2 years now, and I love all of their stuff!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>(please don&#x27;t kill any more badgers!).  </li>
            <li>The Mentholated Shave Cream is amazing,</li>
            <li>Unlike the crappy headblades, this headslick is popular with my husband.</li>
            <li>It really is nice.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best way to shave your head and face</li>
            <li>I do in fact own a lot of products from headblade</li>
            <li>This cream is really effective and makin it a lot easier to shave your head.</li>
            <li>It whips up a nice lather and lasts for the duration of the shave.  </li>
            <li>The HeadBlade cruises nicely over the scalp, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use much product to get the desired results, I just use an nickle size dab for my face and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>It works nicely, but is overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li>It smells great and feels tingly on skin, which is kind of cool.</li>
            <li>Also, this cream rinses out of a razor very easily --</li>
            <li>HeadBlade&#x27;s Headslick is a good, light menthol shave.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best you can use.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shave cream for use on bald heads.</li>
            <li>and this by far is the best shave cream.</li>
            <li>The menthol is effective and not to strong.</li>
            <li>I used to use gel, but I find that I like the results of this cream better.  </li>
            <li>This is ok</li>
            <li>This product is most decidedly liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and when I was deployed I made sure it was shipped to me by family.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>what kind of razor blades I use) is impeccably smooth.</li>
            <li>so smooth!</li>
            <li>i think this is better the shaving cream</li>
            <li>and it gives a nice smooth shave with an after cooling effect.</li>
            <li>more of a burn feeling like I didn&#x27;t have any type of shave cream on at all.</li>
            <li>I probably would have been better off doing so.</li>
            <li>it has gotten more 5 stars than 1 or 2.</li>
            <li>If I need more lather</li>
            <li>I love the way my face and head feel after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It performed better than my $125 Art of Shaving setup and I was hooked.</li>
            <li>Best shaving cream I ever used (face only)!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I use about a pea sized drop on the brush for both my head and face, making sure to lather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My brother love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Husbands favorite shave stuff.</li>
            <li>I think you would be better off just buying soap than using this product.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face,not my head and it works better than any shave cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t add a bunch of chemicals and perfumes, so you get a nice clean shave without any razor bumps or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>like i said nice clean shave with this</li>
            <li>it actually turns out to be an incredible bargain.</li>
            <li>There are better shaving creams available that are cheaper than this.</li>
            <li>Allows a protected, smooth, and safe shave.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is very efficient and gives me a good shave each time i use it</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy to apply and offers great protection for the skin.</li>
            <li>Other then that you can look forward to an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and cool close shave without the burn.</li>
            <li>Which I found to be an easy way to start shaving your head.</li>
            <li>The stuff makes your razor glide over your head easily.  </li>
            <li>Best product I have found so far, works very well for shaving head and face.</li>
            <li>The dispenser clogs way to easily, and the formula seems to have changed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products and this is the one that works great for the face and head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Is easy to rinse out</li>
            <li>Bald head and an easy shave.</li>
            <li>The product, itself, is fine.</li>
            <li>Once out of the bottle, the product is fine.</li>
            <li>It does fine for shaving</li>
            <li>When it is applied it creams up so well and allows the razor to glide smoothly and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>I also found that by doing this, the spread of the cream was easier across my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a nice even coating,</li>
            <li>This product will keep your skin AND your wallet happy for several months to come</li>
            <li>This makes for a smooth glide with a razor.  </li>
            <li>I have not cut my self and find it to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>rarely give more than four stars for a product review</li>
            <li>Cooling and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I respond &amp;#34;A fantastic line of headblade products of course&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I found a pump dispenser bottle with same size cap and thread, put it on the Headslick, and it works great.</li>
            <li>works well and leaves your head smooth</li>
            <li>Works well, gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It makes the surface smooth.  </li>
            <li>you smooth</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that will provide better results than some of the most expensive and exotic shave soap/creams on the market.</li>
            <li>I use it as my primary shaving product</li>
            <li>It was extremely smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>You dont need to be bald to enjoy this stuff...</li>
            <li>The menthol is a bit intense for my face, so I only use it on my head, but it&#x27;s perfect for that task.</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredibly good for shaving your head, and is by far the slickest cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Makes for a smooth shave and leaves your skin feeling fresh!</li>
            <li>The blade just glides smoothly and quickly and it leaves my face feeling smooth and refreshed with the cooling menthol.</li>
            <li>Being in a pinch, I grabbed this and fell in love after the first razor stroke.</li>
            <li>, this is going to keep me happy for a long time.</li>
            <li>Head Slick is the very best head shaving product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&amp;#34;s smooth and cool.</li>
            <li>Good for head shaving or any face / neck shaving in general.  </li>
            <li>Head slick is the best i can find.</li>
            <li>Originally it was for my husband shaving his head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various soaps and cremes but have found HeadSlick to be the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product kept my face tingly and fresh smooth and of course smells menthol as it is mentholated, is also an American product I have to order more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though designed for head shaving, this product is superior to many other shave creams intended for one&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li>My recent girlfriends have used it and loved it as well.</li>
            <li>I once got a full set of this brand skin / shaving stuff.  </li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t fully recommend it, because this stuff smells like dumping your head in bucket full of distilled coughdrops.</li>
            <li>so it has a bit of a cool sensation.  </li>
            <li>A regular can of shaving cream works just as good.</li>
            <li>Leave skin very silky and good smaell, like a soft menthol.</li>
            <li>Think rich, smooth, and  will get  your ready to shave and with a stroke or two, or</li>
            <li>My husband loves this stuff for it does a great job in comparison to other shave creams and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I experienced less irritation and bumps when using this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to give a full, rich lather that stays where it&#x27;s put.</li>
            <li>I use a headblade to shave my noggin in the summer and this certainly helps produce close comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li>It is a thin lather but more than adequate because of the excellent natural lubricants in the mix.  </li>
            <li>trick is to wet your head good before applying....</li>
            <li>He said it makes his scalp feel fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li>The HeadBlade itself is nice, although I prefer a traditional razor, but the Lotions can not be beat!</li>
            <li>his face have bought this product for many years and was glad to find it at amazon, lasts much longer than regular shaving cream and the bottle is recyclable</li>
            <li>bottle lasts me 2-3 months, I shave my head 2x a week and use about a dime&#x27;s worth every time I shave</li>
            <li>,I&#x27;ve tried so many shave gels,nothing comes close, I&#x27;m a 47 year old man who manscapes all of the time, I use this product from head to toe.</li>
            <li>its worth giving a shot if you shave your head</li>
            <li>arrived on time and ha been useful</li>
            <li>originally bought at a large chain store then they stopped carrying it, my husband loves this stuff he shaves his head and</li>
            <li>first I used it solely for my head, but quickly moved to shaving my face with it also.</li>
            <li>Good on other than just a bald head.</li>
            <li>Not as cooling as Noxzema Menthol Shave (available in Europe only in the light blue can), but very good overall.</li>
            <li>I was using it for years until I noticed that it had parabans in it, so I stopped using the product,much to my surprise I decided to pick up the new bottle with the new design on it that says PARABEN FREE, oh happy day, I&#x27;m back in business ,thank you so much Head Blade.</li>
            <li>....gives great shave as does all the SLICK products.  </li>
            <li>Omg,this stuff is great, very smooth slick, you only need a dab, so</li>
            <li>While I prefer to shave my beard with Jack Black products, HeadSlick is every bit as good.</li>
            <li>I switched to the old school art of wet shaving years ago - and have discovered products that make shaving a joy rather then a chore.</li>
            <li>as long as your using a Headblade razor, which is hands down the best way to shave your head.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly have much to compare it to, as it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used so far, but I can&#x27;t think of anything better.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found another bottle cap that fit, and threw the original away.</li>
            <li>That means that i can run the blade multiple times over a surface before needing more gel.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes this!</li>
            <li>just used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Better than regular shave cream for shaving the head.</li>
            <li>So I foolishly decided not to buy headslick when I bought my Headblade, so after the first 2 days of shaving without it I decided to buy some.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to buy a Headblade definitely get the headslick to go with it, trust me you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>This is not a regular shaving cream and therefore it is better for your head and for the shaving process because it doesn&#x27;t create clots in the razor.</li>
            <li>At first I passed this over thinking that it was just for shaving heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether it&#x27;s grandpa&#x27;s old shaving brush, a 5.00 cheapie, or a mega-buck brush made from the ear hairs of a virgin Unicorn, the results will be fantastic.</li>
            <li>I think you are better off just using regular shaving cream or gel.</li>
            <li>Just remember to use hot water.</li>
            <li>He actually shaves more than once a week now.</li>
            <li>Normal shaving cream like Barbados is not very slick and it provides more foam then needed.</li>
            <li>and I make a second pass with another razor for a super close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>i especially like the fact that it washes out of the razor very easily a bit pricey but so far worth every penny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely slick, rinses cleanly, and is nicely cooling.  </li>
            <li>and blade live is extraordinary as well.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin as well because no strong scents.</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes your skin tingle and leaves the scalp feeling very soft and slick after a shave.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get a better shave and not nearly as prone to cut myself.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head every day, and Slick is the most comfortable and functional product I have found.  </li>
            <li>But in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can smear it around for a long time and keep shaving the same area</li>
            <li>My foregoing HeadSlick for all my shaving needs is purely a matter of vanity.</li>
            <li>Slick is as good as some high end creams and shaving soaps that sell at 2-3 times</li>
            <li>My son really likes this stuff</li>
            <li>Even paying sales tax it was much cheaper at Publix.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this is in a bottle like this...</li>
            <li>but the results were very lacking, this just does it for me</li>
            <li>Its not much of a gain, about 20-30% I&#x27;d say, but it makes the price of the product more tolerable</li>
            <li>Initially I bought this product for my husband along with several others in the line - all of which are great, but a while back I ran out of shave cream.</li>
            <li>Very please with this product.</li>
            <li>To this day I use too much 1-2 times per bottle.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need that much....</li>
            <li>This works very well with the Head Blade that I really like for shaving.</li>
            <li>With foams and creams I always have way to much excess</li>
            <li>Just makes sure to wet your head or your hands before applying the shaving cream, unlike can cream</li>
            <li>, I get exactly as much as I want.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really have not come across a shaving cream that I like as much as this one.</li>
            <li>Not too much foam created.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful after reading all the reviews</li>
            <li>The menthol touch is very soothing and helps in the morning with a wake-up.</li>
            <li>I shave my head 3 times a week and use a pea sized spot on my hand to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li>Like an intense spearmint sensation where your razor burn used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does very well for shaving the head</li>
            <li>Much closer shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is my favorite product that Headblade offers</li>
            <li>better than other creams.</li>
            <li>so did the main px thanks for selling it online</li>
            <li>I had high hopes as the other products in this line are fantastic!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not light and airy and won&#x27;t spread great on dry skin.</li>
            <li>nice and slick and smells</li>
            <li>The menthol level is very low and not as cool as I thought it would be after the shave.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m REALLY particular about what I</li>
            <li>for bottle Is high, but I found a 3 pack for $22.00 here on Amazon</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough I&#x27;m going to try the other products as well.  </li>
            <li>a little squeeze gives you a lot of foam once you rub it in, much more than aerosol foam&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used HeadSlick only 2 or 3 times, but it&#x27;s been clean shaving so far.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up like normal gel and leaves a menthol feeling.</li>
            <li>Normal shaving gel or cream does not work on your dome.</li>
            <li>so it lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t have to add more to go over the same areas.  </li>
            <li>OK, went back to single edge disposibles no hair clogs</li>
            <li>This definitely reduces all pulling and drag while shaving your head, much better than any normal shave cream/foam.  </li>
            <li>we wanted to give it a try and try something new.</li>
            <li>The head blade is amazing and decided after a few months to try this instead of regular shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>On my first try with the HeadSlick, I just did my facial hair with a new blade and ended up with lots of nicks, bleeding.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and is better, in most all respects, than a lot of other brand shave creams/soaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HeadSlick is appropriately named as it truly provides a slick suface, allowing the razor to effortlessly do</li>
            <li>I was esceptical, but after experiment with this, kiss my face and caned shaving foam, head slick gave me the better shave and KMF</li>
            <li>I love Head Slick for all the reasons already listed.</li>
            <li>Just as expected and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>For only $2-$3, you can get a large can of moisturizing shave gel that works just as well.....</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic...a very small amount, on a wet head, provides a smooth, quick shave and really has stopped the razor nicks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to remove the cap and clear the coagulated product in the neck and cap.</li>
            <li>clearly I don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to take into the shower than a regular rust-prone can of shaving cream, squirt some out, and shave away.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the slick nature of this shave cream seems to prevent the razor from becoming clogged with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are price conscious, not to worry -</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels like if you put Gold Bond on too early after a shower.  </li>
            <li>The trick to using this product is to use an old school shaving</li>
            <li>I have yet to completely shave my head</li>
            <li>You can shave both ways with it; forward and back, and not get nicks or razor burn; though that may be just as much a function of your razor blade and technique.</li>
            <li>A bottle really does last for 100 shaves, they are not exaggerating!  </li>
            <li>It may be a little pricey, but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>No waste, no mess, no clog</li>
            <li>What I found as a result of using this shaving cream along with the lotion is that the condition of my scalp is clear and hydrated, I think the two products work together in tandem to promote a clear and unblemished scalp that avoids that entire &#x27;pimplehead&#x27; look that sensitive scalps like mine can be prone to drifting towards.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product considering</li>
            <li>You use very little and it helps the blade glide smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I NEVER cut my head when I use the headslick, only when I run out and use normal shaving gel</li>
            <li>I threw away the actual head blade and just use my normal razor with this.  </li>
            <li>This took a little getting used to, but it really does provide a much smoother and safer shade.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount in your hand, add a little water, and rub hands together for a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave my head at all, but I do use this frequently for a facial shave.  </li>
            <li>Thus the reason i purchased a larger bottle of the Slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend even for just normal daily face shaving!</li>
            <li>MY experience, with the two most recent purchases, is the product becomes so thick, IN THE BOTTLE, that THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT OUT IS TO REMOVE THE CAP AND SHAKE OR DIG IT OUT.</li>
            <li>scalp got shaved with the HeadSlick, facial hair got shaved with the Colgate, same handle and another new blade.</li>
            <li>Super slick.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my face and the same type of razor as usual, I was able to shave my face much closer than usual.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they&#x27;d make other scents and versions of the headslick...</li>
            <li>hard to clean off.</li>
            <li>I seem to have tried them all and found no other cream to be in the same league when it comes to head</li>
            <li>This product works great with the Headblade for shaving your head but is a little too thin for shaving face or other body parts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, the shave without it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or bad but with it I get a far superior shave.</li>
            <li>the lotion not only mitigates the previously mentioned issues, it also softens the stubble to where my shaving is much smoother and closer.  </li>
            <li>That being said a bottle typically lasts me a year because you only need a pea sized amount applied to damp skin/hair and worked into a lather and you&#x27;re ready to shave.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great..</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> If were marketed more toward people that shave just their face, it would be an Amazon best seller.</li>
            <li> This almost kills razor tug to nil and is great for shaving you head, or anything else that needs a good razoring.</li>
            <li> worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> but all in all provides a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s headblade product its always good</li>
            <li> I use the Headshed Lotion to negate the bumps and scales that I otherwise had to contend with, and as one can imagine after 3-4 days you got a fair bit of stub to shave off and</li>
            <li> all the good to say about it</li>
            <li> This product is good to use if you have a bald head and want to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to find it on amazon since I am overseas now and it isnt available over here in the UK.  </li>
            <li> so it gets a fair amount of use.</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a good while...</li>
            <li> Good product to use along with the head blade.  </li>
            <li> This is a good in between from the soaps that you lather on and the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Love this works great with the Head Blade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure on why this works so great, but I dig it.</li>
            <li> great tingling feeling to perk you up during those early morning shaves and each lotion works great!</li>
            <li> More importantly, This is the best shaving cream I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Headblade products to shave my head for about 2 years now, and I love all of their stuff!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> (please don&#x27;t kill any more badgers!).  </li>
            <li> The Mentholated Shave Cream is amazing,</li>
            <li> Unlike the crappy headblades, this headslick is popular with my husband.</li>
            <li> It really is nice.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best way to shave your head and face</li>
            <li> I do in fact own a lot of products from headblade</li>
            <li> This cream is really effective and makin it a lot easier to shave your head.</li>
            <li> It whips up a nice lather and lasts for the duration of the shave.  </li>
            <li> The HeadBlade cruises nicely over the scalp, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use much product to get the desired results, I just use an nickle size dab for my face and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> It works nicely, but is overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels tingly on skin, which is kind of cool.</li>
            <li> Also, this cream rinses out of a razor very easily --</li>
            <li> HeadBlade&#x27;s Headslick is a good, light menthol shave.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best you can use.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shave cream for use on bald heads.</li>
            <li> and this by far is the best shave cream.</li>
            <li> The menthol is effective and not to strong.</li>
            <li> I used to use gel, but I find that I like the results of this cream better.  </li>
            <li> This is ok</li>
            <li> This product is most decidedly liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when I was deployed I made sure it was shipped to me by family.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> what kind of razor blades I use) is impeccably smooth.</li>
            <li> so smooth!</li>
            <li> i think this is better the shaving cream</li>
            <li> and it gives a nice smooth shave with an after cooling effect.</li>
            <li> more of a burn feeling like I didn&#x27;t have any type of shave cream on at all.</li>
            <li> I probably would have been better off doing so.</li>
            <li> it has gotten more 5 stars than 1 or 2.</li>
            <li> If I need more lather</li>
            <li> I love the way my face and head feel after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> It performed better than my $125 Art of Shaving setup and I was hooked.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I ever used (face only)!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I use about a pea sized drop on the brush for both my head and face, making sure to lather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My brother love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Husbands favorite shave stuff.</li>
            <li> I think you would be better off just buying soap than using this product.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face,not my head and it works better than any shave cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t add a bunch of chemicals and perfumes, so you get a nice clean shave without any razor bumps or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> like i said nice clean shave with this</li>
            <li> it actually turns out to be an incredible bargain.</li>
            <li> There are better shaving creams available that are cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Allows a protected, smooth, and safe shave.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is very efficient and gives me a good shave each time i use it</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to apply and offers great protection for the skin.</li>
            <li> Other then that you can look forward to an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and cool close shave without the burn.</li>
            <li> Which I found to be an easy way to start shaving your head.</li>
            <li> The stuff makes your razor glide over your head easily.  </li>
            <li> Best product I have found so far, works very well for shaving head and face.</li>
            <li> The dispenser clogs way to easily, and the formula seems to have changed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products and this is the one that works great for the face and head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Is easy to rinse out</li>
            <li> Bald head and an easy shave.</li>
            <li> The product, itself, is fine.</li>
            <li> Once out of the bottle, the product is fine.</li>
            <li> It does fine for shaving</li>
            <li> When it is applied it creams up so well and allows the razor to glide smoothly and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> I also found that by doing this, the spread of the cream was easier across my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a nice even coating,</li>
            <li> This product will keep your skin AND your wallet happy for several months to come</li>
            <li> This makes for a smooth glide with a razor.  </li>
            <li> I have not cut my self and find it to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> rarely give more than four stars for a product review</li>
            <li> Cooling and comfortable shave.</li>

            <li> This is an excellent product that will provide better results than some of the most expensive and exotic shave soap/creams on the market.</li>
            <li> I use it as my primary shaving product</li>
            <li> It was extremely smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> You dont need to be bald to enjoy this stuff...</li>
            <li> The menthol is a bit intense for my face, so I only use it on my head, but it&#x27;s perfect for that task.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredibly good for shaving your head, and is by far the slickest cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Makes for a smooth shave and leaves your skin feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> The blade just glides smoothly and quickly and it leaves my face feeling smooth and refreshed with the cooling menthol.</li>
            <li> Being in a pinch, I grabbed this and fell in love after the first razor stroke.</li>
            <li> , this is going to keep me happy for a long time.</li>
            <li> Head Slick is the very best head shaving product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s smooth and cool.</li>
            <li> Good for head shaving or any face / neck shaving in general.  </li>
            <li> Head slick is the best i can find.</li>
            <li> Originally it was for my husband shaving his head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various soaps and cremes but have found HeadSlick to be the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product kept my face tingly and fresh smooth and of course smells menthol as it is mentholated, is also an American product I have to order more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though designed for head shaving, this product is superior to many other shave creams intended for one&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> My recent girlfriends have used it and loved it as well.</li>
            <li> I once got a full set of this brand skin / shaving stuff.  </li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t fully recommend it, because this stuff smells like dumping your head in bucket full of distilled coughdrops.</li>
            <li> so it has a bit of a cool sensation.  </li>
            <li> A regular can of shaving cream works just as good.</li>
            <li> Leave skin very silky and good smaell, like a soft menthol.</li>
            <li> Think rich, smooth, and  will get  your ready to shave and with a stroke or two, or</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff for it does a great job in comparison to other shave creams and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I experienced less irritation and bumps when using this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to give a full, rich lather that stays where it&#x27;s put.</li>
            <li> I use a headblade to shave my noggin in the summer and this certainly helps produce close comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li> It is a thin lather but more than adequate because of the excellent natural lubricants in the mix.  </li>
            <li> trick is to wet your head good before applying....</li>
            <li> He said it makes his scalp feel fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li> The HeadBlade itself is nice, although I prefer a traditional razor, but the Lotions can not be beat!</li>
            <li> his face have bought this product for many years and was glad to find it at amazon, lasts much longer than regular shaving cream and the bottle is recyclable</li>
            <li> bottle lasts me 2-3 months, I shave my head 2x a week and use about a dime&#x27;s worth every time I shave</li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;ve tried so many shave gels,nothing comes close, I&#x27;m a 47 year old man who manscapes all of the time, I use this product from head to toe.</li>
            <li> its worth giving a shot if you shave your head</li>
            <li> arrived on time and ha been useful</li>
            <li> originally bought at a large chain store then they stopped carrying it, my husband loves this stuff he shaves his head and</li>
            <li> first I used it solely for my head, but quickly moved to shaving my face with it also.</li>
            <li> Good on other than just a bald head.</li>
            <li> Not as cooling as Noxzema Menthol Shave (available in Europe only in the light blue can), but very good overall.</li>
            <li> I was using it for years until I noticed that it had parabans in it, so I stopped using the product,much to my surprise I decided to pick up the new bottle with the new design on it that says PARABEN FREE, oh happy day, I&#x27;m back in business ,thank you so much Head Blade.</li>
            <li> ....gives great shave as does all the SLICK products.  </li>
            <li> Omg,this stuff is great, very smooth slick, you only need a dab, so</li>
            <li> While I prefer to shave my beard with Jack Black products, HeadSlick is every bit as good.</li>
            <li> I switched to the old school art of wet shaving years ago - and have discovered products that make shaving a joy rather then a chore.</li>
            <li> as long as your using a Headblade razor, which is hands down the best way to shave your head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly have much to compare it to, as it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used so far, but I can&#x27;t think of anything better.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found another bottle cap that fit, and threw the original away.</li>
            <li> That means that i can run the blade multiple times over a surface before needing more gel.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes this!</li>
            <li> just used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Better than regular shave cream for shaving the head.</li>
            <li> So I foolishly decided not to buy headslick when I bought my Headblade, so after the first 2 days of shaving without it I decided to buy some.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy a Headblade definitely get the headslick to go with it, trust me you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> This is not a regular shaving cream and therefore it is better for your head and for the shaving process because it doesn&#x27;t create clots in the razor.</li>
            <li> At first I passed this over thinking that it was just for shaving heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether it&#x27;s grandpa&#x27;s old shaving brush, a 5.00 cheapie, or a mega-buck brush made from the ear hairs of a virgin Unicorn, the results will be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I think you are better off just using regular shaving cream or gel.</li>
            <li> Just remember to use hot water.</li>
            <li> He actually shaves more than once a week now.</li>
            <li> Normal shaving cream like Barbados is not very slick and it provides more foam then needed.</li>
            <li> and I make a second pass with another razor for a super close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> i especially like the fact that it washes out of the razor very easily a bit pricey but so far worth every penny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely slick, rinses cleanly, and is nicely cooling.  </li>
            <li> and blade live is extraordinary as well.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin as well because no strong scents.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes your skin tingle and leaves the scalp feeling very soft and slick after a shave.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get a better shave and not nearly as prone to cut myself.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head every day, and Slick is the most comfortable and functional product I have found.  </li>
            <li> But in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can smear it around for a long time and keep shaving the same area</li>
            <li> My foregoing HeadSlick for all my shaving needs is purely a matter of vanity.</li>
            <li> Slick is as good as some high end creams and shaving soaps that sell at 2-3 times</li>
            <li> My son really likes this stuff</li>
            <li> Even paying sales tax it was much cheaper at Publix.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this is in a bottle like this...</li>
            <li> but the results were very lacking, this just does it for me</li>
            <li> Its not much of a gain, about 20-30% I&#x27;d say, but it makes the price of the product more tolerable</li>
            <li> Initially I bought this product for my husband along with several others in the line - all of which are great, but a while back I ran out of shave cream.</li>
            <li> Very please with this product.</li>
            <li> To this day I use too much 1-2 times per bottle.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need that much....</li>
            <li> This works very well with the Head Blade that I really like for shaving.</li>
            <li> With foams and creams I always have way to much excess</li>
            <li> Just makes sure to wet your head or your hands before applying the shaving cream, unlike can cream</li>
            <li> , I get exactly as much as I want.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really have not come across a shaving cream that I like as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Not too much foam created.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful after reading all the reviews</li>
            <li> The menthol touch is very soothing and helps in the morning with a wake-up.</li>
            <li> I shave my head 3 times a week and use a pea sized spot on my hand to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> Like an intense spearmint sensation where your razor burn used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does very well for shaving the head</li>
            <li> Much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is my favorite product that Headblade offers</li>
            <li> better than other creams.</li>
            <li> so did the main px thanks for selling it online</li>
            <li> I had high hopes as the other products in this line are fantastic!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not light and airy and won&#x27;t spread great on dry skin.</li>
            <li> nice and slick and smells</li>
            <li> The menthol level is very low and not as cool as I thought it would be after the shave.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m REALLY particular about what I</li>
            <li> for bottle Is high, but I found a 3 pack for $22.00 here on Amazon</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I liked it enough I&#x27;m going to try the other products as well.  </li>
            <li> a little squeeze gives you a lot of foam once you rub it in, much more than aerosol foam&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used HeadSlick only 2 or 3 times, but it&#x27;s been clean shaving so far.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up like normal gel and leaves a menthol feeling.</li>
            <li> Normal shaving gel or cream does not work on your dome.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t have to add more to go over the same areas.  </li>
            <li> OK, went back to single edge disposibles no hair clogs</li>
            <li> This definitely reduces all pulling and drag while shaving your head, much better than any normal shave cream/foam.  </li>
            <li> we wanted to give it a try and try something new.</li>
            <li> The head blade is amazing and decided after a few months to try this instead of regular shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> On my first try with the HeadSlick, I just did my facial hair with a new blade and ended up with lots of nicks, bleeding.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and is better, in most all respects, than a lot of other brand shave creams/soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HeadSlick is appropriately named as it truly provides a slick suface, allowing the razor to effortlessly do</li>
            <li> I was esceptical, but after experiment with this, kiss my face and caned shaving foam, head slick gave me the better shave and KMF</li>
            <li> I love Head Slick for all the reasons already listed.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> For only $2-$3, you can get a large can of moisturizing shave gel that works just as well.....</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic...a very small amount, on a wet head, provides a smooth, quick shave and really has stopped the razor nicks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to remove the cap and clear the coagulated product in the neck and cap.</li>
            <li> clearly I don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to take into the shower than a regular rust-prone can of shaving cream, squirt some out, and shave away.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the slick nature of this shave cream seems to prevent the razor from becoming clogged with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are price conscious, not to worry -</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels like if you put Gold Bond on too early after a shower.  </li>
            <li> The trick to using this product is to use an old school shaving</li>
            <li> I have yet to completely shave my head</li>
            <li> You can shave both ways with it; forward and back, and not get nicks or razor burn; though that may be just as much a function of your razor blade and technique.</li>
            <li> A bottle really does last for 100 shaves, they are not exaggerating!  </li>
            <li> It may be a little pricey, but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> No waste, no mess, no clog</li>
            <li> What I found as a result of using this shaving cream along with the lotion is that the condition of my scalp is clear and hydrated, I think the two products work together in tandem to promote a clear and unblemished scalp that avoids that entire &#x27;pimplehead&#x27; look that sensitive scalps like mine can be prone to drifting towards.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product considering</li>
            <li> You use very little and it helps the blade glide smoothly.</li>
            <li> and I NEVER cut my head when I use the headslick, only when I run out and use normal shaving gel</li>
            <li> I threw away the actual head blade and just use my normal razor with this.  </li>
            <li> This took a little getting used to, but it really does provide a much smoother and safer shade.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount in your hand, add a little water, and rub hands together for a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave my head at all, but I do use this frequently for a facial shave.  </li>
            <li> Thus the reason i purchased a larger bottle of the Slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend even for just normal daily face shaving!</li>
            <li> MY experience, with the two most recent purchases, is the product becomes so thick, IN THE BOTTLE, that THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT OUT IS TO REMOVE THE CAP AND SHAKE OR DIG IT OUT.</li>
            <li> scalp got shaved with the HeadSlick, facial hair got shaved with the Colgate, same handle and another new blade.</li>
            <li> Super slick.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my face and the same type of razor as usual, I was able to shave my face much closer than usual.  </li>
            <li> I really wish they&#x27;d make other scents and versions of the headslick...</li>
            <li> hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> I seem to have tried them all and found no other cream to be in the same league when it comes to head</li>
            <li> This product works great with the Headblade for shaving your head but is a little too thin for shaving face or other body parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, the shave without it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or bad but with it I get a far superior shave.</li>
            <li> the lotion not only mitigates the previously mentioned issues, it also softens the stubble to where my shaving is much smoother and closer.  </li>
            <li> That being said a bottle typically lasts me a year because you only need a pea sized amount applied to damp skin/hair and worked into a lather and you&#x27;re ready to shave.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely thick, course beard and have struggled trying to find the right shave gel.</li>
            <li> Even with this product, shaving more frequently than that results in some unpleasant side effects that I prefer to avoid.  </li>
            <li> It is a little more slick than the normal shave gel or cream, which lets the blade glide easier, so you use less force and are less likely to cut yourself, and if you&#x27;ve shaved your head and cut yourself, you know you&#x27;ll be bleeding in the shower for forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredients are directly responsible, but every shave (no matter</li>
            <li> One bottle should last you for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I used regular shaving cream and that works but leaves your head dry.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is crazy though, I purchase this stuff for $4.95/bottle through the Army Air Force Exchange Service, so I&#x27;m sure there are places that are cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> I gave up on foams a long time ago.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this lasts a long time</li>
            <li> yes it goes a long way</li>
            <li> I also enjoy shaving with this cream because it does not induce acne or oiliness in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The secret to buying Headslick is to catch a sale here at Amazon or other retailers when you can buy the three pack for about $18 (roughly six bucks a bottle).</li>
            <li> I ran out once for a short while and was using a other head shaving cream recommended by a friend of mine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used gels, foams, regular shaving cream, and other types of creams and oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Headslick for several years now, and I cannot recommend any other product for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> The opening is one giant hole instead of 4 smaller holes; which does not plug the opening if the residue dried up.</li>
            <li> Good product, somthing different to use instead of the same boring shaver.</li>
            <li> The Headslick is a tad bit expensive but one bottle will last perhaps three times as long as a normal bottle of generic shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first - thought the Headblade product line was simply a gimick.</li>
            <li> The secret to the Headslick shaving gel is the large amount of propylene glycol that is used.</li>
            <li> I have used a Merkur DE razor handle, Derby Extra blades, and Colgate aloe shave cream for years, with little to no bleeding.</li>
            <li> It takes very little and it is very slippery or should I say slick.</li>
            <li> Its expensive but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> product reduces drag and razor burn and keeps that barrier between blade and skin</li>
            <li> It was not what we expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The shave is definitely closer than I previously achieved with a conventional razor and shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes just a TINY amount (you&#x27;re not lathering up your face with foam 2\\&quot; thick... just making your face/head slick for the blade to glide through it), so the extra expense will probably work out to about the same as what I was paying for the Aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wet my head a bit and the slick is totally refreshed</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so even though a bit pricey</li>
            <li> Get that extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and face every other day.</li>
            <li> but once you discover just how small an amount of this stuff is needed to shave your entire head</li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s comments, please.</li>
            <li> Ordered &amp; arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> I use the blades, shave cream, defoliant, and all the other products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and the consistency is so slick my razors last longer.</li>
            <li> Actively looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Wet your hands a little and then squeeze a bit on the hands</li>
            <li> but HeadSlick has them beat, hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> It has a very faint menthol smell, but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Gillette typically.  </li>
            <li> So, the previous WAS my Review/opinion some months ago.</li>
            <li> and it makes my morning routine easier, and with less razor rash.</li>
            <li> and I like the little amount needed for the average shave.</li>
            <li> , it is a bit pricey, what I&#x27;ve done is add a little water to the solution to extend its use a bit.  </li>
            <li> It might look a little pricey</li>
            <li> This makes scalp shaving (especially in the blind areas behind the head) easier and less likely to result in a cut, drag cut or razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a few years now</li>
            <li> After using this product for years, mentholated and regular, my husband said the formula is now thin and runny and is now a royal pain to shave with.</li>
            <li> Have used Headblade products for a few years, and will continue.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s too thin and doesn&#x27;t lubricate well enough for my thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I have pictures of my scalp and face (before I wiped off the dried blood and remaining cream) for comparison.</li>
            <li> This stuff lays down a slick protective coating on the skin upon application.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was bad, then I read the instructions.</li>
            <li> just a small amount</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to keep adding water into the product once it&#x27;s applied to keep the silicone slick.</li>
            <li> Slick (x2)</li>
            <li> I have shaved my head for about 40 years and have tried all sorts of creams and gels and Head Slick</li>
            <li> I usually apply it then after shaving with the HeadBlade</li>
            <li> Maybe because it&#x27;s specialized for slick heads.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve stole it a few times too!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s head slick &amp;#</li>
            <li> The slick level of protection that it provides will be noticeable the moment you apply it.</li>
            <li> This is one slick shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Very few nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I prefer using it with a regular razor over the head blade - simply because I hate the head blade.</li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to imagine you ever shaved with the stuff that comes out of a can....</li>
            <li> Dont use this same companies razor blades, they will make you bleed like crazy.</li>
            <li> I shave my head at least twice a week and my neck every two days</li>
            <li> It is very slick.</li>
            <li> I tried it 3 times while shaving my head and saw small bumps get progressively worse.</li>
            <li> Not sure what has changed, but as a long time headblader I&#x27;m disappointed with where this company is going.  </li>
            <li> I threw mine away after a few bloody tries.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving a pleasure rather than a painful drag</li>
            <li> Worst case would be you don&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> but i think ill stay with shave cream</li>
            <li> Remember nick on your head not only are unsightly but bleed terribly.</li>
            <li> too slimy made the blade rub wrong, over priced</li>
            <li> Sorry to hijack the 1960s Brylcream slogan, but don&#x27;t be daunted by the 10 bucks HEADBLADE HEADSLICK shave cream will set you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wife bought me this (along with the HEADBLADE razor) for xmas, and though the razor was utterly useless to me (see my review of it)</li>
            <li> I AM SORRY</li>
            <li> BAD.</li>
            <li> Try it, you wont be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>

            <li> GIves a great head shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 20+ years. and this is the best cream/lotion whatever you wanna call it ever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used everything from barbasol, to edge gel and even Koochi (slumber party stuff) and this is best ever. nice and slick and smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it out!</li>
            <li> Not a nick on senor Pelon!</li>
            <li> I wish I had started shaving my head 10 years sooner. HeadSlick Shave Cream, Mentholated, 8 oz. is perfect with the Headblade razors. Which I found to be an easy way to start shaving your head.</li>
            <li> worked surprisingly well. better than other creams.</li>
            <li> This product works great with the Headblade for shaving your head but is a little too thin for shaving face or other body parts.</li>
            <li> Ive ordered and used it since it came it. Great stuff. Get that extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent product highly recommended to every body, this shave took the piece of the cake!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific shave cream!  It makes any razor glide effortlessly on any surface you are shaving and helps to prevent&lt;br /&gt;nicks and scrapes.  Where has this wonderful product been all my life??  I pledge to never run out of it and will never&lt;br /&gt;use anything else again!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving cream.  I used to use gel, but I find that I like the results of this cream better.  I use it on my face too.</li>
            <li> My son really likes this stuff but I paid $9.99 for it on Amazon.com and found it in Publix for $5.99 same size bottle.  Even paying sales tax it was much cheaper at Publix.</li>
            <li> HeadBlade&#x27;s Headslick is a good, light menthol shave.  Just a small amount in your hand, add a little water, and rub hands together for a nice lather.  I don&#x27;t shave my head at all, but I do use this frequently for a facial shave.  It is a thin lather but more than adequate because of the excellent natural lubricants in the mix.  Also, this cream rinses out of a razor very easily -- an added plus.    Not as cooling as Noxzema Menthol Shave (available in Europe only in the light blue can), but very good overall.</li>
            <li> Does a great job lubricating my head for a shave.  I also use it on my face when shaving.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this is in a bottle like this... It is much easier to take into the shower than a regular rust-prone can of shaving cream, squirt some out, and shave away. However, I am not a fan of the &#x27;mentholated&#x27; aspect. I really wish they&#x27;d make other scents and versions of the headslick... but all in all provides a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I prefer using it with a regular razor over the head blade - simply because I hate the head blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s headblade product its always good</li>
            <li> Unlike the crappy headblades, this headslick is popular with my husband. I have to admit, I used it on my legs once or twice. It really is nice.</li>
            <li> This is ok but i think ill stay with shave cream</li>
            <li> Seriously wonderful. I&#x27;ve used soap, and Edge gel forever and now I use this on my face and my head. It&#x27;s perfect. The mentholated part of it takes a bit to get used to, I wish it wasn&#x27;t but after a while it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Some of head shavers can shave daily, others have to give the scalp a rest time, I&#x27;m one of those who has to let my scalp rest from the blade with around a 3-4 day cycle.  Even with this product, shaving more frequently than that results in some unpleasant side effects that I prefer to avoid.  I use the Headshed Lotion to negate the bumps and scales that I otherwise had to contend with, and as one can imagine after 3-4 days you got a fair bit of stub to shave off and the lotion not only mitigates the previously mentioned issues, it also softens the stubble to where my shaving is much smoother and closer.  What I found as a result of using this shaving cream along with the lotion is that the condition of my scalp is clear and hydrated, I think the two products work together in tandem to promote a clear and unblemished scalp that avoids that entire &#x27;pimplehead&#x27; look that sensitive scalps like mine can be prone to drifting towards.  I ran out once for a short while and was using a other head shaving cream recommended by a friend of mine but the results were very lacking, this just does it for me and I haven&#x27;t strayed since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the good to say about it, it is a bit pricey, what I&#x27;ve done is add a little water to the solution to extend its use a bit.  Its not much of a gain, about 20-30% I&#x27;d say, but it makes the price of the product more tolerable and I continue to repurchase it when I run out.  I also found that by doing this, the spread of the cream was easier across my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a nice even coating, a pool about the size of a dime is plenty.</li>
            <li> If you’re shaving your head the product is the best I’ve tried. Its expensive but worth the cost. Remember nick on your head not only are unsightly but bleed terribly.</li>
            <li> too slimy made the blade rub wrong, over priced</li>
            <li> This product is good to use if you have a bald head and want to keep it that way.  The stuff makes your razor glide over your head easily.  I used regular shaving cream and that works but leaves your head dry. This stuff leaves your head lotioned.</li>
            <li> I seem to have tried them all and found no other cream to be in the same league when it comes to head shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HeadSlick is appropriately named as it truly provides a slick suface, allowing the razor to effortlessly do it&#x27;s job. Additionally, the slick nature of this shave cream seems to prevent the razor from becoming clogged with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though designed for head shaving, this product is superior to many other shave creams intended for one&#x27;s beard. While I prefer to shave my beard with Jack Black products, HeadSlick is every bit as good. My foregoing HeadSlick for all my shaving needs is purely a matter of vanity. This is truly a great product.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;A note of caution: referring to HeadSlick as a shave \\&quot;cream\\&quot; is a bit misleading. This product is most decidedly liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are price conscious, not to worry - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the only multiglide shaving gel left on the market that i can find.  That means that i can run the blade multiple times over a surface before needing more gel.  Gillette used to have them, but they discontinued the product for whatever reason.  Since using this product, I never cut myself shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shaving cream every day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a few years now and when I was deployed I made sure it was shipped to me by family.  I was very happy to find it on amazon since I am overseas now and it isnt available over here in the UK.  Absolutely the best way to shave your head and face and... well anywhere else someone else might want to shave.  This definitely reduces all pulling and drag while shaving your head, much better than any normal shave cream/foam.  Try it, you wont be disappointed.  I love this stuff.  PS  Dont use this same companies razor blades, they will make you bleed like crazy.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found so far, works very well for shaving head and face.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Headblade products to shave my head for about 2 years now, and I love all of their stuff!  They don&#x27;t add a bunch of chemicals and perfumes, so you get a nice clean shave without any razor bumps or breakouts.  It may be a little pricey, but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Initially I bought this product for my husband along with several others in the line - all of which are great, but a while back I ran out of shave cream. Being in a pinch, I grabbed this and fell in love after the first razor stroke. I&#x27;m not sure which ingredients are directly responsible, but every shave (no matter what kind of razor blades I use) is impeccably smooth. I absolutely love this product! I NEVER want to use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> This item is great for shaving bald heads. I buy this every time I need to. Very please with this product.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for several years now.  Works awesome and he prefers not to use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream out there. I shave my head at least twice a week and my neck every two days so it gets a fair amount of use. That being said a bottle typically lasts me a year because you only need a pea sized amount applied to damp skin/hair and worked into a lather and you&#x27;re ready to shave. When I shave my head I shave in both directions to get the closest shave possible and headslick protects my skin from irritation. Great for sensitive skin as well because no strong scents. This product will keep your skin AND your wallet happy for several months to come</li>
            <li> Love this works great with the Head Blade</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 8 years. It is by far the best you can use. It only takes about 4 pea size drops for my head. To this day I use too much 1-2 times per bottle. I use it everywhere I shave. My recent girlfriends have used it and loved it as well.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving your head, even against the grain.....trick is to wet your head good before applying....and you don&#x27;t need that much....bottle lasts a good while...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.occasionally I&#x27;ve used it on my face and works well to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave my head with it, but it works great on my face! A little goes a long way. The blade just glides smoothly and quickly and it leaves my face feeling smooth and refreshed with the cooling menthol. I love it! I gave up on foams a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this! He said it makes his scalp feel fresh and tingly. It seems like it will last a while too.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff ... just a small amount and it goes a long way.  I use it for my face as well as my head.  My wife has even used it for her legs ... so smooth!</li>
            <li> just used this for the first time.  I like it.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over 16 years and always used shave gel.  Gillette typically.  This makes for a smooth glide with a razor.  I liked it enough I&#x27;m going to try the other products as well.  Check them out http://www.headblade.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen&#x3D;SFNT&amp;Store_Code&#x3D;&amp;AFFIL&#x3D;qmLF10</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a head shaver for a few years now and really like the Headblade and their products.  I switched to the old school art of wet shaving years ago - and have discovered products that make shaving a joy rather then a chore. Slick is as good as some high end creams and shaving soaps that sell at 2-3 times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product reduces drag and razor burn and keeps that barrier between blade and skin so well lubricated the blades just slide over effortlessly. You&#x27;ll want to keep adding water into the product once it&#x27;s applied to keep the silicone slick. Other then that you can look forward to an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 12 years now, and this is the best shaving cream that I&#x27;ve found for the purpose.  It&#x27;s extremely slick, rinses cleanly, and is nicely cooling.  The menthol is a bit intense for my face, so I only use it on my head, but it&#x27;s perfect for that task.</li>
            <li> I was esceptical, but after experiment with this, kiss my face and caned shaving foam, head slick gave me the better shave and KMF IS a 2nd close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$15 for bottle Is high, but I found a 3 pack for $22.00 here on Amazon, this is going to keep me happy for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product for shaving. Tingles on the man parts though. A bottle lasts me almost 6 months</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy some regular shave cream.</li>
            <li> I received the HeadBlade along with a combo pack of travel size Slick (x2) and both Matte and Glossy Lotion (Lube).  The HeadBlade itself is nice, although I prefer a traditional razor, but the Lotions can not be beat! The Mentholated Shave Cream is amazing, great tingling feeling to perk you up during those early morning shaves and each lotion works great! Thus the reason i purchased a larger bottle of the Slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend even for just normal daily face shaving!</li>
            <li> My preferred shaving product for my scalp. Normal shaving cream like Barbados is not very slick and it provides more foam then needed. This works very well with the Head Blade that I really like for shaving. since I use a brush to apply, I also use it on my beard. The menthol level is very low and not as cool as I thought it would be after the shave. Overall, I will continue to use this cream. Incan only find it here these days.</li>
            <li> Been using this product to shave me head and it works great. I have not cut my self and find it to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Meh, I prefer the shaving cream I got from Bath and Body Works over just about anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  This stuff isn&#x27;t THAT great...</li>
            <li> Head Slick is the very best head shaving product I have ever used.  I have shaved my head for about 40 years and have tried all sorts of creams and gels and Head Slick is the very best.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and face every other day. I&#x27;ve used gels, foams, regular shaving cream, and other types of creams and oils. I have found that this is the best product to get a close shave. I always feel refreshed from the menthol too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. With foams and creams I always have way to much excess and it slides off my head and face before I finish.&lt;br /&gt;A bottle of this lasts me months. I use maybe two a year?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely give more than four stars for a product review but this is one that deserves it, imo. Is it for everyone, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like their razors though. That would be a different review.</li>
            <li> This mentholated shave cream is the best shaving product I have ever used! Very smooth and cool close shave without the burn. Treat yourself to \\&quot;real\\&quot; shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The dispenser clogs way to easily, and the formula seems to have changed.  It&#x27;s now grainy and doesn&#x27;t lubricate as well.  Not sure what has changed, but as a long time headblader I&#x27;m disappointed with where this company is going.  Actively looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> i think this is better the shaving cream it self. you don&#x27;t need alot to use to shave. and it will last you</li>
            <li> After using this product for years, mentholated and regular, my husband said the formula is now thin and runny and is now a royal pain to shave with. Annoying.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Like the stimulating effect of the mentholated shave cream and I like the little amount needed for the average shave.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It might look a little pricey but once you discover just how small an amount of this stuff is needed to shave your entire head it actually turns out to be an incredible bargain. It is very slick. I usually apply it then after shaving with the HeadBlade I wet my head a bit and the slick is totally refreshed and I make a second pass with another razor for a super close and smooth shave. I highly recommend this. I have tried some of the shaving oils but HeadSlick has them beat, hands down.</li>
            <li> Have used Headblade products for a few years, and will continue. Was skeptical at first - thought the Headblade product line was simply a gimick. Doesn&#x27;t take much to give a full, rich lather that stays where it&#x27;s put. A little goes a long way, and is better, in most all respects, than a lot of other brand shave creams/soaps. Good on other than just a bald head. Their Sport Razor works great with this shave cream.   So, the previous WAS my Review/opinion some months ago. The product, itself, is fine. I have no issues there. My &#x27;zero&#x27; rating is because of the marginal/unsatisfactory packaging, and the coagulating of the product inside the container. MY experience, with the two most recent purchases, is the product becomes so thick, IN THE BOTTLE, that THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT OUT IS TO REMOVE THE CAP AND SHAKE OR DIG IT OUT. Once out of the bottle, the product is fine. The same goes with the aftershave Head Lube. Other&#x27;s comments, please.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I use about every 2-3 days and it gives a nice smooth shave with an after cooling effect.</li>
            <li> it is the only shave cream I use and the pharmacy stopped selling it so did the main px thanks for selling it online</li>
            <li> Great suff!  Keep it in the shower and use it to shave my head and face while in there.  Makes shaving a pleasure rather than a painful drag</li>
            <li> Amazing product kept my face tingly and fresh smooth and of course smells menthol as it is mentholated, is also an American product I have to order more</li>
            <li> Cooling and comfortable shave. Better than regular shave cream for shaving the head. Just use a drop about the size of a dime. It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t for me. It smells great and feels tingly on skin, which is kind of cool. But it&#x27;s too thin and doesn&#x27;t lubricate well enough for my thicker hair. I had discomfort and redness each time I shaved with it- more of a burn feeling like I didn&#x27;t have any type of shave cream on at all. I had high hopes as the other products in this line are fantastic! But this just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was bad, then I read the instructions. I&#x27;m not 100% sure on why this works so great, but I dig it. Maybe because it&#x27;s specialized for slick heads. Trust me it lives up to the name. I actually have people rub my head and say &amp;#34;How do you get it so smooth&amp;#34;. I respond &amp;#34;A fantastic line of headblade products of course&amp;#34;. I do in fact own a lot of products from headblade and I like them all. They have the market for baldness and this product is no different. Just makes sure to wet your head or your hands before applying the shaving cream, unlike can cream it&#x27;s not light and airy and won&#x27;t spread great on dry skin.</li>
            <li> when using this you have to use 1/2 of the bottle to work up enough suds to shave head . not a fan</li>
            <li> There are better shaving creams available that are cheaper than this. It didn&#x27;t protect my skin from nicks and cuts and actually caused me to have razor burn. Honestly it totally feels like I just lathered up with a bar of soap. I probably would have been better off doing so. I had such high hopes for this product considering it has gotten more 5 stars than 1 or 2. I&#x27;ll stick to my Burt&#x27;s Bees shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I love Head Slick for all the reasons already listed. What I don&#x27;t like is the bottle and cap. The product tends to glue the bottle cap shut. I&#x27;ve had to remove the cap and clear the coagulated product in the neck and cap. Finally, I found another bottle cap that fit, and threw the original away. 5 stars for the product, -1 for the cap.  ***** I found a pump dispenser bottle with same size cap and thread, put it on the Headslick, and it works great. No waste, no mess, no clog, I get exactly as much as I want. This is how it should be packaged.</li>
            <li> I tried it based on another review. It does work differently than shave gel. It doesn&#x27;t lather up like normal gel and leaves a menthol feeling. Worst case would be you don&#x27;t notice much difference. A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Good product to use along with the head blade.  works well and leaves your head smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products and this is the one that works great for the face and head.  Wet your hands a little and then squeeze a bit on the hands and it goes on great.  This is a good in between from the soaps that you lather on and the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34; type kits that include oil.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this and then a post shave moisturizer like Proraso Aftershave Lotion, it&#x27;s hard to imagine you ever shaved with the stuff that comes out of a can....</li>
            <li> HB Mentholated Shaving Cream combined with the HB Sport HB3 Shaving blades never disappoint. A Pro-Quality Shave At Your Home.</li>
            <li> Works well, gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This cream is really effective and makin it a lot easier to shave your head. It makes the surface smooth.  And you don&#x27;t need to put on any aftershave.</li>
            <li> So I foolishly decided not to buy headslick when I bought my Headblade, so after the first 2 days of shaving without it I decided to buy some. I&#x27;m glad I did, the shave without it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or bad but with it I get a far superior shave. If you&#x27;re going to buy a Headblade definitely get the headslick to go with it, trust me you&#x27;ll be glad you did. Not sure why exactly, but the headslick definite provides a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Headslick is the best shaving product I have ever discovered. You use very little and it helps the blade glide smoothly.</li>
            <li> Shortly after using the HeadBlade with HeadSlick, I began face shaving with a double edged shaver.  I&#x27;ve tried various soaps and cremes but have found HeadSlick to be the best so far.  Once applied to my face I give it a bunch of swirls with my synthetic brush (please don&#x27;t kill any more badgers!).  It whips up a nice lather and lasts for the duration of the shave.  If I need more lather I just squeeze it from the brush.  This is a terrific product.  I love the way my face and head feel after shaving.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used HeadSlick only 2 or 3 times, but it&#x27;s been clean shaving so far.  A little bit goes a long way.  The HeadBlade cruises nicely over the scalp, as advertised.  The shave is definitely closer than I previously achieved with a conventional razor and shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li> A lotion of any type would do just as well.</li>
            <li> originally bought at a large chain store then they stopped carrying it, my husband loves this stuff he shaves his head and his face have bought this product for many years and was glad to find it at amazon, lasts much longer than regular shaving cream and the bottle is recyclable</li>
            <li> Great product that works well.</li>
            <li> Sorry to hijack the 1960s Brylcream slogan, but don&#x27;t be daunted by the 10 bucks HEADBLADE HEADSLICK shave cream will set you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought me this (along with the HEADBLADE razor) for xmas, and though the razor was utterly useless to me (see my review of it), I thought the shave cream was about the best I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;m REALLY particular about what I use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about five years now, and settled on a combination of a Gilette Fusion razor, and Aveeno shave gel as the &#x27;best&#x27; shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m sticking with the Fusion razor, but will be switching for the foreseeable future to the HEADSLICK cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes just a TINY amount (you&#x27;re not lathering up your face with foam 2\\&quot; thick... just making your face/head slick for the blade to glide through it), so the extra expense will probably work out to about the same as what I was paying for the Aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Jonathan Sabin</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and I NEVER cut my head when I use the headslick, only when I run out and use normal shaving gel do I get cuts on my head. This took a little getting used to, but it really does provide a much smoother and safer shade. It is a little more slick than the normal shave gel or cream, which lets the blade glide easier, so you use less force and are less likely to cut yourself, and if you&#x27;ve shaved your head and cut yourself, you know you&#x27;ll be bleeding in the shower for forever, so get this, you won&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;d also say one 8 oz. bottle lasts me 2-3 months, I shave my head 2x a week and use about a dime&#x27;s worth every time I shave</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product from a great seller. Ordered &amp; arrived as expected! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Added this to my wishlist based on the reviews here and got 2 bottles as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets you smooth&lt;br /&gt;Is easy to rinse out&lt;br /&gt;Just a little squeeze gives you a lot of foam once you rub it in, much more than aerosol foam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Considerable bleeding. I have used a Merkur DE razor handle, Derby Extra blades, and Colgate aloe shave cream for years, with little to no bleeding. On my first try with the HeadSlick, I just did my facial hair with a new blade and ended up with lots of nicks, bleeding. Waited until it regrew to about the same length (today) and I decided to do a split test: scalp got shaved with the HeadSlick, facial hair got shaved with the Colgate, same handle and another new blade. Same result; my HeadSlicked scalp got lots of nicks and bleeding, my Colgate aloe&#x27;d face predictably only had a nick just outside the corner of my lip. I have pictures of my scalp and face (before I wiped off the dried blood and remaining cream) for comparison.</li>
            <li> Good product, somthing different to use instead of the same boring shaver.</li>
            <li> I use this shaving cream on my face on my face as well as my head.  I really have not come across a shaving cream that I like as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Not too much foam created. Leave skin very silky and good smaell, like a soft menthol. Good for shave the head</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shave cream for use on bald heads.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing shave cream we&#x27;ve purchased! Bought it for my husband but I&#x27;ve stole it a few times too!</li>
            <li> The secret to the Headslick shaving gel is the large amount of propylene glycol that is used. This not only lowers the force to cut for the razor on the scalp or the face, but also lowers the coefficient of friction for the gliding razor blade(s). This makes scalp shaving (especially in the blind areas behind the head) easier and less likely to result in a cut, drag cut or razor burn. Because of the PG used, this product also works well as a humectant and can be used as a lotion after shaving as well. I also enjoy shaving with this cream because it does not induce acne or oiliness in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The secret to buying Headslick is to catch a sale here at Amazon or other retailers when you can buy the three pack for about $18 (roughly six bucks a bottle). The Headslick is a tad bit expensive but one bottle will last perhaps three times as long as a normal bottle of generic shaving cream. Overall, this is my favorite product that Headblade offers and it makes my morning routine easier, and with less razor rash.</li>
            <li> Super slick.  some of the best shaving cream I have ever used.  A little bit goes a long way so even though a bit pricey this lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Bald head and an easy shave. This stuff is easy to apply and offers great protection for the skin. I would recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> Good shaving cream for head shaving. This is not a regular shaving cream and therefore it is better for your head and for the shaving process because it doesn&#x27;t create clots in the razor. I also like the fact that it is mentholated. I experienced less irritation and bumps when using this product.</li>
            <li> This is crappy shaving cream to go along with a crappy shaver. I AM SORRY I EVER BOUGHT THIS. BAD.</li>
            <li> wonderful....gives great shave as does all the SLICK products.  I use the blades, shave cream, defoliant, and all the other products.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  I gave it 3 stars because I know some products simply aren&#x27;t compatible with everyone.  I tried it 3 times while shaving my head and saw small bumps get progressively worse. I was very hopeful after reading all the reviews but it was just simply not for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the cats pajamas when it comes to shaving your head.  Ive been a HeadBlader for quite some time, cant do without this product</li>
            <li> Think rich, smooth, and  will get  your ready to shave and with a stroke or two, or three your out the door it&#x27;s head slick &amp;#34;for men who like to stand out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that will provide better results than some of the most expensive and exotic shave soap/creams on the market. The slick level of protection that it provides will be noticeable the moment you apply it. At first I passed this over thinking that it was just for shaving heads. While visiting my brother, I needed some shaving cream and he offered this up. It performed better than my $125 Art of Shaving setup and I was hooked. This stuff lays down a slick protective coating on the skin upon application. It&#x27;s like applying a pre-shave oil before applying a standard shaving cream. The razor then just effortlessly glides above the coating. The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use much product to get the desired results, I just use an nickle size dab for my face and that&#x27;s it. If were marketed more toward people that shave just their face, it would be an Amazon best seller. Buy it an try it.</li>
            <li> we wanted to give it a try and try something new. It was not what we expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I brought this item to put in a care package for a friend, who is deployed and like everyone else, is a head shaver.  He likes the product a lot.  I like the product because it&#x27;s not in an aerosol can, which means I can send it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I ever used (face only)! It&amp;#34;s smooth and cool. Very few nicks or cuts. I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> The menthol touch is very soothing and helps in the morning with a wake-up. More importantly, This is the best shaving cream I have used. It takes very little and it is very slippery or should I say slick.</li>
            <li> The head blade is amazing and decided after a few months to try this instead of regular shaving cream.  Hands down I feel like I get a better shave and not nearly as prone to cut myself.  Works great on my face as well.</li>
            <li> Omg,this stuff is great, very smooth slick, you only need a dab, so yes it goes a long way,I&#x27;ve tried so many shave gels,nothing comes close, I&#x27;m a 47 year old man who manscapes all of the time, I use this product from head to toe. I was using it for years until I noticed that it had parabans in it, so I stopped using the product,much to my surprise I decided to pick up the new bottle with the new design on it that says PARABEN FREE, oh happy day, I&#x27;m back in business ,thank you so much Head Blade. Keep up the great work!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t shave your head without this stuff.  Normal shaving gel or cream does not work on your dome. I shave my head 3 times a week and use a pea sized spot on my hand to do my whole head.  It lasts for about a year at that rate.</li>
            <li> too greasy. hard to clean off. Use shave cream instead.</li>
            <li> I once got a full set of this brand skin / shaving stuff.  I LOVE the shaving cream.  Its like a minty explosion on your face.  Like an intense spearmint sensation where your razor burn used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like if you put Gold Bond on too early after a shower.  But in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can smear it around for a long time and keep shaving the same area so it lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t have to add more to go over the same areas.  Good for head shaving or any face / neck shaving in general.  I threw away the actual head blade and just use my normal razor with this.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Best Shaving Product on the market.  8 Years and counting.  Use it anywhere, feels great!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I use it as my primary shaving product</li>
            <li> Works great!  I don&#x27;t exactly have much to compare it to, as it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used so far, but I can&#x27;t think of anything better.</li>
            <li> like i said nice clean shave with this it does very well for shaving the head i especially like the fact that it washes out of the razor very easily a bit pricey but so far worth every penny its worth giving a shot if you shave your head</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredibly good for shaving your head, and is by far the slickest cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. This almost kills razor tug to nil and is great for shaving you head, or anything else that needs a good razoring. However, I can&#x27;t fully recommend it, because this stuff smells like dumping your head in bucket full of distilled coughdrops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Headslick for several years now, and I cannot recommend any other product for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;At first I used it solely for my head, but quickly moved to shaving my face with it also. One bottle should last you for quite a long time. If my wife didn&#x27;t steal it to shave her legs, I could probably get well over 100 shaves out of a bottle. The trick to using this product is to use an old school shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;Whether it&#x27;s grandpa&#x27;s old shaving brush, a 5.00 cheapie, or a mega-buck brush made from the ear hairs of a virgin Unicorn, the results will be fantastic. I use about a pea sized drop on the brush for both my head and face, making sure to lather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Headblade, forget it. I threw mine away after a few bloody tries. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This is one slick shave cream.  I used it on my face and the same type of razor as usual, I was able to shave my face much closer than usual.  It was extremely smooth afterwards.  It&#x27;s mentholated so it has a bit of a cool sensation.  I have yet to completely shave my head so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works in that way.</li>
            <li> Works well; slicker than snot. Allows a protected, smooth, and safe shave. You can shave both ways with it; forward and back, and not get nicks or razor burn; though that may be just as much a function of your razor blade and technique. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> OK, went back to single edge disposibles no hair clogs</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream we ever found!  Smells great, makes your skin tingle and leaves the scalp feeling very soft and slick after a shave.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely thick, course beard and have struggled trying to find the right shave gel. Head slick is the best i can find. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and the consistency is so slick my razors last longer. It has a very faint menthol smell, but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Title for Review says it all! Use with all HeadBlade products and you&#x27;ll be very happy! My husband is \\&quot;BBC\\&quot;: \\&quot;Bald By Choice\\&quot; &amp; HeadBlade is the perfect product(s) for people like him. I actually use their Matte finish as a full-face moisturizer for my face &amp; neck..., no shiny face!</li>
            <li> Shave cream works great with the HeadBlade products. The opening is one giant hole instead of 4 smaller holes; which does not plug the opening if the residue dried up.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, works very good.</li>
            <li> My brother love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Yes I love IT because it give me a real nice close shave and real smooth.</li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless.  A regular can of shaving cream works just as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head now for about 4 years and this by far is the best shave cream. I use the Headblade razor with Gillette Sensor blades. The Amazon price is crazy though, I purchase this stuff for $4.95/bottle through the Army Air Force Exchange Service, so I&#x27;m sure there are places that are cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I shave my head every day, and Slick is the most comfortable and functional product I have found.  A bottle really does last for 100 shaves, they are not exaggerating!  I also find that I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of additional moisturizers when I&#x27;m using this.</li>
            <li> clearly I don&#x27;t use this. lol. but my boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Husbands favorite shave stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Headblade Sport Ultimate Head Shaver and started using regular shaving cream and decided to try Headslick shave cream. This is the perfect companion to the shaver. Much closer shave.</li>
            <li> I think you would be better off just buying soap than using this product. It does fine for shaving but then you have to keep scrubbing to get all the lather residue to be removed. I think you are better off just using regular shaving cream or gel.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream ever. Originally it was for my husband shaving his head but I stole it to shave my legs with!</li>
            <li> I use a headblade to shave my noggin in the summer and this certainly helps produce close comfortable shaves.  But the ECONOMY of this shave cream is incredible. I use a dot about 10mm on my fingertip that spreads over my entire scalp and face.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as my shave cram for facial shaving using just a cheap-o blue Gillette disposable. I&#x27;ve gone from shaving twice a day, (afternoon briefings), to just once in the morning. and blade live is extraordinary as well.  Just remember to use hot water.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shaving cream. He actually shaves more than once a week now.</li>
            <li> Hubby lover to use this stuff with his head blade.  He says it&#x27;s a keeper.  I shaved my legs with it one time and it works great for that too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic...a very small amount, on a wet head, provides a smooth, quick shave and really has stopped the razor nicks. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Bought this with my head blade. Best shaving cream for head.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> You dont need to be bald to enjoy this stuff...This stuff is great..I use it on my face,not my head and it works better than any shave cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff for it does a great job in comparison to other shave creams and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works nicely, but is overpriced for what it is. For only $2-$3, you can get a large can of moisturizing shave gel that works just as well.....as long as your using a Headblade razor, which is hands down the best way to shave your head.</li>
            <li> It is a good product; I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dominique</li>
            <li> arrived on time and ha been useful&lt;br /&gt;it is very efficient and gives me a good shave each time i use it</li>
            <li> Makes for a smooth shave and leaves your skin feeling fresh! The menthol is effective and not to strong. When it is applied it creams up so well and allows the razor to glide smoothly and rinses easily.</li>
