            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Heats up FAST and does a great job!</li>
            <li>Also nice that they threw in a heat protective glove.</li>
            <li>My wife liked this when it worked.  </li>
            <li>and she liked the curls that it did.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled with purchase - delivery took 2 weeks</li>
            <li>It arrived in a nice box and had a velvet bag for it.</li>
            <li>Replacement by Amazon was done promptly and courteously.</li>

            <li>I really liked this set.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s nice in that theres nothing protruding that would get caught in your hair, but it does worry me for safety reasons.</li>
            <li>Awesome and Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>The package came with no &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; so you are on your own for that</li>

            <li>Great brand, curls come out beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of curling barrels which are very easy to switch.</li>

            <li>This is a GREAT product and very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>I was concerned because the price was so good,but have no regrets its perfect.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to handle and heats up quickly,love everything about it.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, would not recommend.</li>
            <li>The straightener came quickly and works just as good my chi.  </li>
            <li>The included heat glove is a welcome plus to avoid mishaps while styling, as the wand reaches very high temperatures.</li>
            <li>glad they included a glove.  </li>
            <li>Ok lets start with the four interchangeable sizes.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>We all have different hair types and lengths so the 4 interchangeable wands is awesome!</li>
            <li>but after having such a great experience, i felt i had to share!</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>While I love this set</li>
            <li>She said better instructions for the temperature control and connecting are needed.</li>
            <li>With 10 years of experience working with many different tools,  this product was Perfect for me!</li>
            <li>Say it is it salon quality and works better then</li>
            <li>I continue to use this curling iron daily with great results!</li>
            <li>I love that the glove is included, it has saved my hand many a time.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Well, okay</li>

            <li>It appears OK for the most part.</li>
            <li>I love the curls it creates</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I ended up using the included heat glove to rest it on, since those tend to make my hair frizzy and static</li>
            <li>I love my Hsi curling iron set.</li>
            <li>I just wish the glove was a better quality.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the four barrels that are included in set.</li>
            <li>:Love, Love, Love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>but it waves better than the curling iron</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast and curls my hair really good and nice.</li>
            <li>Better than a chi.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with protective glove.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this curling iron.</li>
            <li>But more than that, the customer service was even better.</li>
            <li>It was a lot more than I needed.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, and she says it works much better than the curling wand that she&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s ok and giving 3 stars here because I couldn&#x27;t use the wands without burning something.</li>
            <li>Best choice I could have made for a present for her.</li>
            <li>You basically have to twist the side of the barrel to make sure the wand won&#x27;t fall off while you&#x27;re using it and its locked in place, however the twisty part won&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love the things that you can do with this tool.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works fantastic!</li>
            <li>Everything worked wonderfully with only an adapter.</li>
            <li>Feels very stable and solid, great product and an awesome price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair well.</li>
            <li>it curls nicely last all day and you can change the sizes which is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>After more use that may change.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Heats up instantly and gives great results !</li>
            <li>i am for sure buying another one ASAP.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve burned my self ...</li>
            <li>The second one works perfectly!</li>
            <li>It works better than the wand I bought from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>BUT MORE LIKE A CURLING IRON NOT WANDS.</li>
            <li>I love the curls from this iron, but as soon as it heats up to 450</li>
            <li>I really do love this set.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love this purchase.</li>
            <li>Save your money and get something that&#x27;s a better quality.</li>
            <li>Protective glove comes very handy as the iron can reach up to 430F, so it is much easier not to get burned when using it.</li>
            <li>I just received the wand this week but so far so good!  </li>
            <li>Beautifully packaged and it is truly a professional curling wand!</li>
            <li>This is a great set and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>long hair... perfect for both!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect beach wave curling iron for a long time.</li>
            <li>The HSI curling set is one of the best \\&quot;hair\\&quot; investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and using this tool takes me about 30 minutes to curl - but the best part, my hair stays curled all day+!  </li>
            <li>Luckily for me, their customer service is great and shipped me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>The best part was how long the curls lasted!</li>
            <li>The curls come out nice and quick too.</li>
            <li>Best curling purchase I&#x27;ve made in a very long time!</li>
            <li>She put the one inch on the fitting and it worked fine....</li>
            <li>For the amount you pay its a really good deal, but lets stop saying its as good as a quality brand flat iron.</li>
            <li>and I love how quickly this heats up and how shiny it makes my hair!</li>
            <li>so I use the large barrel all over (found some good youtube tutorials)</li>
            <li>So far my experience with the curling wand has been great.  </li>
            <li>This product was a great price and reccomended by a professional in the businesss.</li>
            <li>So decided to purchase this wand as it has so many attachments available.</li>
            <li>This is a great set for the novice or the professional.</li>
            <li>Loved the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>the iron is good when is not broken ((</li>
            <li>it works (although it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some others), and the curls look great right after I&#x27;m done, but they do fall out during the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome because the styling options are endless, from the signature</li>
            <li>Easy to change barrels.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, change barrel</li>
            <li>The interchanging tips are durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy to exchange the rods either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to change sizes.</li>
            <li>I just received the HSI professional curling iron, I was really satisfy with the item and the seller, the curling iron arrived in excellent conditions within the shipping time establish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a one size fits all and not the most comfortable or tailored fit.</li>
            <li>Using is was soo easy theirs</li>
            <li>Heats up within mins and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>The wands click in easily and are easy to switch out.</li>
            <li>The thing that stuck out to me the most was that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; when I curl it at a higher temperate (I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and was kind of worried at first, because she is a hair stylist and I was unsure about the quality of HSI, but after reading all the reviews I went ahead and got it for her</li>
            <li>beautiful and distinctly different curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was used to the clamp on my curling iron</li>
            <li>It gets hot fast and leaves the hair looking great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for about 3-4 weeks now and it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>This worked so well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend this one to anybody (even us girls with fine hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl).</li>
            <li>Shipping was really quick too!</li>
            <li>This wand makes great tight curls as well as nice waves.</li>
            <li>It holds her curls all day and creates smooth silky hair.</li>
            <li>This iron is also dual voltage, which is important, as I travel a lot.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product works great.</li>
            <li>It was great when it actually worked.</li>
            <li>The Argan Oil tames flyaways and leaves my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Used the product 4 times and already have an error light blinking.  </li>
            <li>Various sizes of curl wands are great.</li>
            <li>this curler is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I have found a product that actually curls my hair...</li>
            <li>While they may have convenient features, they don&#x27;t last and aren&#x27;t great for my hair.</li>
            <li>The attachments fit snug in the controller.</li>
            <li>which is obviously really important.  </li>
            <li>The seller Blue Novelties had great customer service.  </li>
            <li>I was about to purchase two separate curling iron sizes when I saw that sets like this one were available.</li>
            <li>This may or not be a good product, but the one I received was clearly used.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and I love the range of possible temperatures.</li>
            <li>After I emailed them, they apologized refunded my money, send me a free return label and made this process super easy to return.</li>
            <li>But with this one i just hold my hair on the wand for like 5 seconds and its a perfect tight curl!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The heat adjustment is easy to operate and the iron warms up quickly.</li>
            <li>It was curly all day and into the next.. which is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>, I love it, my hair looks soo pretty and curly:D</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>So glad they include the glove because you really need it!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Simply Rich</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this as a gift.</li>
            <li>Though it comes with a gloves,I suggest get an oven gloves or more heat resistant gloves as the barrel is hot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants nice curls!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and has a light to let me know when it has reached the temperature.  </li>
            <li>It not only arrived early, it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Since purchasing the iron, I&#x27;ve been able to clean out the bathroom by getting rid of many of my old irons.  </li>
            <li>It also felt like the handle was a bit flimsy specially when changing barrels.</li>
            <li>The price was great for me as many other products were higher in price for just 1 sized barrel.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to pick it up quickly and I am now able to curl my hair as quickly as I did with my old curling iron.</li>
            <li>Also the heat settings are all digital which is great because you know the exact temperature at all time.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a versatile top notch styling wand at a reasonable price point, I recommend the HSI Styling Wand.</li>
            <li>love that the heat distribution is very even .</li>
            <li>The glove is a plus especially if you don&#x27;t know how to use the wand to good</li>
            <li>Well made and heats up quickly; really like the four interchangable barrel sizes - provides for many style options.</li>
            <li>(remember to let your curls cool before running your fingers though you hair) with a bit a hair spray.</li>
            <li>I guess I got what its worth for its cheap price..</li>
            <li>But so far this item is working quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this would be the magic product that would keep my hair curled all day, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>and as a professional hair dresser that&#x27;s honestly kind of a plus</li>
            <li>Styling is fast and easy to get comfortable with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only glad amazing is such an amazing company.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought the flat iron from HSI and LOVED IT</li>
            <li>Leaves hair super shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Even with a cheap hairspray, they still looked amazing on the next day!</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and the product was well protected.</li>
            <li>Item is as described, was packaged well and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the product and it heats up really quick.</li>
            <li>They heat quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail quickly with all items and instructions in the box.</li>
            <li>I found this one that gives me the option to change the curl size with the quick switch of the wand.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>She has mastered it well and has sped up tremendously in her time to curl.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re more daring and better at curling your short hair without a clamp&#x27;s help, I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Curls my hair quickly...</li>
            <li>At first this product worked great, but within a few months of using it, it began to deteriorate and now is nowhere near as good as my CHI was.  </li>
            <li>so my hair tends to get damaged and the ends tend to feel rough but for some reason not with the HSI curler my hair felt incredibly soft all day and was even able to pass my fingers thru my hair (with LOTS of hair spray in it!!!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many flat irons, mostly versions costing under $30.</li>
            <li>The very first day i got this product and used it it worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and it can take forever to straighten but with this gorgeous iron, it takes no time at all.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved how it curled my hair until the only barrel (1&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I would like to try them out a bit more to see if they break after the first use, but I need to return the whole thing.</li>
            <li>The curling iron itself is really fast to heat up and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and it easy on my hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I curled my hair, the curls lasted 3 DAYS!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Love the HSI professional curling iron !</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!  </li>
            <li>but with this curling iron my hair will still have curl the next day, love it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Love this curling wand, the different size barrels are easily interchanged.</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly, and the various heat settings are nice.</li>
            <li>I bought as a gift for my daughter that has VERY thick hair and this works great on it !!!!</li>
            <li>The curling wand is ridiculously fantastic - my hair absolutely will NOT hold a curl with anything else, and this keeps a curl in my hair all day</li>
            <li>It creates amazing curls that last all day without any products added to your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has a light wave to it and is medium thickness, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to flatten out.</li>
            <li>The warm up time is short and the curling time is even shorter!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Good price and faster shipping than expected.</li>
            <li>The temperature is adjustable, and there is a nice digital display.</li>
            <li>It took me some practice to get used to it but worth the effort.</li>
            <li>This wand is worth every penny</li>
            <li>Was nice that it actually curled my hair.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is really worth the price.</li>
            <li>It curls so nicely and the curls hold with no hairspray used well into the next day until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>While I am still getting used to these wands with no clamps, I enjoyed the ease it offers in curling my hair.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really worth the price</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Recommended for any aged person who is able to curl their hair safely.</li>
            <li>Thus far I love this product.</li>
            <li>With the versatilty and price of this tool means you&#x27;ll get the worth of your money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional stylist and love this curling wand.</li>
            <li>I love the oil it comes with, it really helps your hair stay soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I thought that was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the cost in my opinion.</li>
            <li>So, its very easy to attach the different size barrels, its gets hot very quickly and it stays hot.</li>
            <li>I like that you can control the temperature so if your hair curls easily you don&#x27;t have to expose it to extremely high</li>
            <li>The other one I bought is great quality (my daughter likes it as much as her sister&#x27;s CHI)</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and seems to stay hot</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no longer working, it might just be me not getting the plate on right.</li>
            <li>So I went to look at the instructions and she was doing everything right.</li>
            <li>Gets nice and hot which is key for getting and maintaining curls.</li>
            <li>The glove that is included works ok to protect the heat, but my fingers still tend to get rather hot when near the iron despite the glove.</li>
            <li>The settings are very easy to figure out and the heat is controllable so you can always set the proper heat for any type of hair.</li>
            <li>The curling wand is very easy to use and creates a lasting curl.</li>
            <li>So far the quality seems great, and the multiple sizes really make it worth the money.</li>
            <li>It heats up so quickly and all the barrels allow for so many different styles.</li>
            <li>Maybe a different glove, it&#x27;s good, but feels rough and creates static in my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this purchase if you&#x27;re looking for pretty straight hair!!!</li>
            <li>and I l&#x27;m really liking how smooth both of these tools make my hair, whether its curly or straight.</li>
            <li>it has a magnet closure so not only does it look great as packaging, but can be used to actually store the products as well, so you can keep all the items in one place.</li>
            <li>It is vastly superior compared to my old, traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast...</li>
            <li>She has long Barbie blonde hair that looks absolutley beautiful with spiral curls now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair comes out great each time and curls last until my next shampoo!</li>
            <li>I looooooove My new HSI Curling Wand!!!</li>
            <li>Stop reading and go buy your new hair toy already!!!</li>
            <li>The 4 different barrels allow for many different styles and are very easy to change.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tool - it&#x27;s a must have for fast, easy styling that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>you so soft n straight, plus you can add a curl  fast easy to if you&#x27;d like!</li>
            <li>The different sized barrels come in very handy to create different looks.</li>
            <li>Also the iron heats very fast.</li>
            <li>I do find that my curls don&#x27;t stay as long as I would have expected when using these barrels in particular, but I really really love and adore the specialty ones, which curl my hair perfectly and stick around into the next day!</li>
            <li>this item is constantly going up and down, i think i got a very good deal, but if you want to save some money, you can get the  1&amp;#34;inch Tapered Curling Iron and the accessorie set for separate for around $70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate how the company takes care of it&#x27;s customers!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a curling iron with no clip</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>We love how the temperature is digital</li>
            <li>and you can watch as it gets higher and reaches your desired setting.  </li>
            <li>this is my first wand i ever used</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered a curling wand set.</li>
            <li>I love the option of having the different sizes.</li>
            <li>When I made the purchase it said 4 wands for the price I had purchase it for, that is the reason why I had purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to purchasing hair products.</li>
            <li>Love it overall and would/have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li>I would consider myself pretty savvy in regards to styling hair</li>
            <li>The price has gone up $20 since I bought the first one, and for what?</li>
            <li>This item is now her go to tool when styling her hair,  she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility of multiple barrel sizes.  </li>
            <li>I did research and tried a bunch of different curling irons and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Not too expensive very good expense!</li>
            <li>It also holds up pretty well to the humidity.</li>
            <li>Love the product, it comes with 4 different barrel sizes.</li>
            <li>Love the interchangeable barrels and overall quality for the money.  </li>
            <li>Broke the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this, but with the caveat that it&#x27;s not going to do much better than a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love all the different barrel sizes and the adjustable temperature.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it has up to 220V since I travel outside of the US quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I love the way the curl looks and the different styles I can obtain with it.</li>
            <li>Needless to say i am very VERY happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>The first thing that got my attention (besides the price) was the rave 1,000+ reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it can be used internationally!</li>
            <li>The tool gets really hot and stays consistently hot.</li>
            <li>My favorite are the middle ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, soft &amp; holds its style.</li>
            <li>I love the various sizes of the barrels!!!  </li>
            <li>They heat up really fast and the display is clear and easy to read.</li>
            <li>This was the first curling wand I&#x27;ve bought, and I decided on this one after being pleased with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and changing sizes is super simple and easy (haven&#x27;t had one problem).</li>
            <li>I was so excited when my HSI Professional Curling Iron Set came in.  </li>
            <li>Everyone looked amazing and it was much faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I have thick, pretty wavy, somewhat frizzy hair, and this worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and I love achieving different curls &amp; styles with all the sizes.</li>
            <li>Go look them up, not only the ones on their site but overall, NO not so good.</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well</li>
            <li>I read they reviews before purchase and decided on this product based on positive reviews and</li>
            <li>It gets hot really fast and my hair holds all day.</li>
            <li>The HSI Professional Flat Iron and Argan Oil are amazing products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of shopping with Amazon over the last few years, and this by far is the BEST purchase I ever made.</li>
            <li>I tried all of them and I have to say, as a first timer using wands, I really like these barrels.</li>
            <li>professional grade, very easy to use and all 4 barrels give the hair a different look.</li>
            <li>but I take that as a sign that it is in securely and not loose</li>
            <li>The barrels are easy to connect but feel tight and secure once you have them clicked into place.</li>
            <li>The wand heats very quickly, and I like the digital display for the heat control.</li>
            <li>it easy to switch the different barrels on and off as well.</li>
            <li>Does my hair super natural look</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and interchange the barrels to give you different styles.</li>
            <li>Blue Novelties shipped very quickly and everything was as described.  </li>
            <li>The different barrels are easy to install and it heats up very</li>
            <li>They emailed asking if everything was okay with the order a little while after I received it, and when I responded that one of the barrels didn&#x27;t fit, they sent me a whole new one immediately.</li>
            <li>I love my new flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it really helps from letting the heat get in.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect much from the glove-</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift, but my niece gives it a high 5!</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>It curls hair well and curls stay intact very well</li>
            <li>It started flashing a red error light</li>
            <li>I really like this wand.</li>
            <li>Do not twist, just pull the wand straight out of the handle.</li>
            <li>and she really like it.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, performs well.</li>
            <li>Would reccomend this product highly!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100% sold on the idea after reading all reviews, but you really can&#x27;t beat the price considering you receive four curling irons ...</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It curled it really well</li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to just exchange one barrel or the whole thing.</li>
            <li>so I just need to buy the whole thing again,</li>
            <li>I now have the option to have curly or straight hair, where before I did not.</li>
            <li>And then my hair is straight again</li>
            <li>This thing heats up fast and maintains the heat well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really recommend to buy to this seller.</li>
            <li>My hair was much softer after using the HSI iron, than when I used the CHI iron.</li>
            <li>My hair can hold real curls now for two days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the way it worked, hope it&#x27;s not broken.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>the price is way to much.</li>
            <li>And, I got them both for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but when i really wanted i&#x27;d have my boyfriend switch heads for me.</li>
            <li>but I really am liking it.</li>
            <li>Really like the versatility of this product.</li>
            <li>Well made, versatile, heats up fast.</li>
            <li>The seller was fast and product came just as described if not exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li>For those that had such troubles switching the barrels, if the bumps on the inside to lock it in place aren&#x27;t lined up exactly right it definitely causes more difficulty.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gets hot super fast and curls last for days</li>
            <li>The first one I received did not work properly but the seller quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li>The weight of the iron is just right, not heavy</li>
            <li>I got the order with only one tapered barrel, now I am wondering if I was cheated out of the original deal.</li>
            <li>I use the largest size and have yet to try the other sizes, but I expect I will be just as pleased with them.</li>
            <li>The other barrels seem to be working okay; for now.</li>
            <li>she threw away all her other curling irons :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it in every home for those who want what is new and has the capability to make you stand out!!</li>
            <li>First you have to make sure you push the wand firmly into the handle and it will lock into place.</li>
            <li>It heats up REALLY fast and curls my short hair quickly.</li>
            <li>We have tried and tried to curl her hair but this product was the only thing that worked on her super straight hair.</li>
            <li>It took me a few tries to get the hang of it (and the glove is a must for me), but I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the curls it produces.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at myself for not even needing the glove since I was a first timer.</li>
            <li>My old one had  a built on rest that kept the hot iron off my counter.  </li>
            <li>But there is not a little stand to prop the curling iron up on when hot and not using.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different wands and my hair will hold curls from different brands for about 5 min.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try different styles.</li>
            <li>great product it heats up fast and handles difficult hair well-</li>
            <li>I love the four different size barrels to achieve different curling looks.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and I like the digital temp reading.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Once again, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Nice and hot for my thick frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li>Great set overall, bonus the send extra little goodies and</li>
            <li>By far one of my favorite wands, even over more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and of course, straight.  </li>
            <li>The ease of switching barrels and the different sizes makes this fun to use.</li>
            <li>which was not hard for him-</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t wear down easily.</li>
            <li>I even bought the other attachments that came with a travel bag to fit all of these and the three of those from HSI.</li>
            <li>I had heard about the new curling wand idea from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>One word of advise: it takes some practice to use if you are new to using a wand.</li>
            <li>I recently got into using wands to curl my hair as it is the hot new trend</li>
            <li>It worked better than I expected!!!!</li>
            <li>I have long hair, and I&#x27;ve tried every single barrel and was pleased.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this I had to I am in love with this wand</li>
            <li>the wines get extremely hot and they hold the curls throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the HSI Professional curling iron set to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li>She likes the different sizes, hot temperatures and ease to use.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described and with the 4 wands it gives me flexibility for different types of curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m equally pleased with the wand - I recently used it to do several bridesmaids&#x27; hair at a wedding, and it worked well on all different kinds of hair.</li>
            <li>Before i purchased the HSI i actually used my friend wand first just to test it out .</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some others, but this might be better for your hair anyway.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot, so be careful and use the glove provided.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased a Flat Iron or used one.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to screw it back on tight.</li>
            <li>I cannot use this with a clear conscience because of fear it might fall off any moment.</li>
            <li>It completely transforms my hair and it looks natural and doesn&#x27;t have that -curled-dry-damaged hair look.  </li>
            <li>One day it completely stopped working, meaning that it wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all.</li>
            <li>When you want to change wands, wait until it is completely cooled.</li>
            <li>so thought that I would really appreciate the different barrel sizes.</li>
            <li>I had only about 10 or so curls in my hair and the rest was straight.</li>
            <li>I got the four piece HSI professional curling wand</li>
            <li>but my hair will hold the curl from the HSI professional curling wand</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter says &amp;</li>
            <li>I bought the HSI Professional Curling Iron Set for my daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It was fast and simple to use tho it does get some getting used to in the beginning since im used to the barrel with a clamp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this HSI for a few days now and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gone to bed with my hair styled, and woke up with the soft curls</li>
            <li>heats up fast and curls last all day!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting to try something new or simply want the beach wave hair style, whatever.</li>
            <li>It is a little on the pricey side but worth the money!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Blue Novelties and HSI Professional Curling Iron set.  </li>
            <li>This wand also heats up so quick it takes less than a minute to get up to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>I love how the iron curls however the barrels are difficult to remove and I had to return the first one for replacement because I could not remove the barrel that I put on and the release button would not release it.</li>
            <li>The main draw back if I&#x27;d have kept the set is that there is not a stand for the iron to rest on when warming.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but now this is my favorite styling tool.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for purchase to anyone that feels comfortable using a clip-less iron, just be aware that it is very different than the usual suspect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this flat iron if you&#x27;re seeking professional quality.  </li>
            <li>I have very hard to straighten hair and by using this HSI straightener, my hair is smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>If your hair is too long to curl the entire length at once, just do the top part and move the barrel down to do the other half after the top is curled.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, i chose this specific product - HSI Professional curling iron set, because of the high quality.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no regrets or complaints!</li>
            <li>I have a couple other ideas I saw that I might be interested in.  </li>
            <li>but I much prefer that to them being loose</li>
            <li>I received a brand new 1 inch CHI Flat-iron, as a gift, after I&#x27;d already ordered the HSI 1 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li>I knew I needed a new flat iron</li>
            <li>I mainly use the two smaller sizes as I prefer tighter curls (and they seem to last longer) but all four create</li>
            <li>the next morning, she still had a decent amount of curl left.  </li>
            <li>The barrels don&#x27;t go in very easily, the bigger barrel broken within weeks for this reason.</li>
            <li>The curling wand is definitely of professional quality, and the different barrel sizes meet all my hair curling needs.</li>
            <li>Apparently that must be everyone else that they respond to because she received no response to her questions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the smallest rod so far so</li>
            <li>Even on the second day, the curls are looking like natural wavy.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews that said the curls didn&#x27;t last, I bought the curling irons anyway because (as a professional cosmetologist)</li>
            <li>I had NO trouble with attaching the different sizes.</li>
            <li>We got this for our 10 year old daughter for xmas after seeing a product similar at the mall that they were selling for $250.00.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used only the 3/4&amp;#34; of the four.</li>
            <li>It is a quality curling iron complete with different sized barrels &amp; heat glove.</li>
            <li>This product gave her hair a professional curl that lasted through the entire day,</li>
            <li>I kind of wish there were two gloves supplies, because I am foreveer putting it on the wrong hand.</li>
            <li>Her only complaint is the glove seems really cheap.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; light, or the light that tells you that it is hot, is on the wrong side of the flat iron, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Switching the barrels seemed a little tricky at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;The item arrived promptly, packaged nicely and even though the heat glove was missing, no fault of Blue Novelties, it was included but unfortunately was misplaced in transit, I contacted Blue Novelties &amp; they were very prompt &amp; considerate &amp; quickly sent to me</li>
            <li>I finally decided that I needed a professional flat iron vs the drug store buy.</li>
            <li>a lot of her other sets that are main stream brands.</li>
            <li>I have very long, thick hair which is rather straight and difficult to curl, and I am rather challenged when it comes to hair styling skills, but with this iron I can create beautiful, long lasting curls without any problems.</li>
            <li>The curls are silky, soft, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>(my hair usually doesn&#x27;t keep curls for more than a few hours)</li>
            <li>The curling iron heats up quickly and evenly and so far she doesn&#x27;t have a single complaint about it.</li>

            <li> Probably a good iron</li>

            <li> Works best when you curl and add hair spray right after hair is off barrel.</li>
            <li> Awesome, right?</li>
            <li> The pink box was in perfect condition, which made me very happy!</li>

            <li> Replacement by Amazon was done promptly and courteously.</li>

            <li> I really liked this set.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s nice in that theres nothing protruding that would get caught in your hair, but it does worry me for safety reasons.</li>
            <li> Awesome and Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> The package came with no &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; so you are on your own for that</li>
            <li> but i love this, absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> My curls have a nice shine</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I love this curler!</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairstyling tool I have experienced in a long time.......</li>
            <li> Great brand, curls come out beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of curling barrels which are very easy to switch.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results and love the use of the glove to keep my hands from the heat on my hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick, the interchangable barrels are great, it allows me to style all hair types.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and has a good selection of sizes.  </li>
            <li> Very easy.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to use.  </li>

            <li> I get so many compliments, it makes me love my hair!</li>
            <li> for the price, best iron i&#x27;ve gotten, the curls stay on even longer than when i used my old ones</li>
            <li> I shopped around for a curling wand and this was by far the best quality and price.</li>
            <li> and then I got the 1 inch HSI professional curling Wand for my best friend.</li>
            <li> Products from HSI Professional are truly wonderful.</li>

            <li> This is a GREAT product and very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I was concerned because the price was so good,but have no regrets its perfect.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to handle and heats up quickly,love everything about it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The straightener came quickly and works just as good my chi.  </li>
            <li> The included heat glove is a welcome plus to avoid mishaps while styling, as the wand reaches very high temperatures.</li>
            <li> glad they included a glove.  </li>
            <li> Ok lets start with the four interchangeable sizes.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> We all have different hair types and lengths so the 4 interchangeable wands is awesome!</li>
            <li> but after having such a great experience, i felt i had to share!</li>
            <li> I Love everything about  </li>
            <li> Love the sample of argon oil too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is why I chose HSI, I love this curling iron set.</li>
            <li> Plus I love the pouch that comes with it for traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I really love this curling iron set</li>
            <li> and I really love this set.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am l very happy with this item!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> While I love this set</li>
            <li> She said better instructions for the temperature control and connecting are needed.</li>
            <li> With 10 years of experience working with many different tools,  this product was Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Say it is it salon quality and works better then</li>
            <li> I continue to use this curling iron daily with great results!</li>
            <li> I love that the glove is included, it has saved my hand many a time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Well, okay</li>
            <li> and I love it...  </li>
            <li> It appears OK for the most part.</li>
            <li> I love the curls it creates</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the included heat glove to rest it on, since those tend to make my hair frizzy and static</li>
            <li> I love my Hsi curling iron set.</li>
            <li> I just wish the glove was a better quality.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the four barrels that are included in set.</li>
            <li> :Love, Love, Love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> but it waves better than the curling iron</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and curls my hair really good and nice.</li>
            <li> Better than a chi.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with protective glove.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this curling iron.</li>
            <li> But more than that, the customer service was even better.</li>
            <li> It was a lot more than I needed.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, and she says it works much better than the curling wand that she&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s ok and giving 3 stars here because I couldn&#x27;t use the wands without burning something.</li>
            <li> Best choice I could have made for a present for her.</li>
            <li> You basically have to twist the side of the barrel to make sure the wand won&#x27;t fall off while you&#x27;re using it and its locked in place, however the twisty part won&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love the things that you can do with this tool.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> Everything worked wonderfully with only an adapter.</li>
            <li> Feels very stable and solid, great product and an awesome price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair well.</li>
            <li> it curls nicely last all day and you can change the sizes which is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> After more use that may change.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Heats up instantly and gives great results !</li>
            <li> i am for sure buying another one ASAP.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve burned my self ...</li>
            <li> The second one works perfectly!</li>
            <li> It works better than the wand I bought from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> BUT MORE LIKE A CURLING IRON NOT WANDS.</li>
            <li> I love the curls from this iron, but as soon as it heats up to 450</li>
            <li> I really do love this set.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love this purchase.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get something that&#x27;s a better quality.</li>
            <li> Protective glove comes very handy as the iron can reach up to 430F, so it is much easier not to get burned when using it.</li>
            <li> I just received the wand this week but so far so good!  </li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged and it is truly a professional curling wand!</li>
            <li> This is a great set and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> long hair... perfect for both!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect beach wave curling iron for a long time.</li>
            <li> The HSI curling set is one of the best \\&quot;hair\\&quot; investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and using this tool takes me about 30 minutes to curl - but the best part, my hair stays curled all day+!  </li>
            <li> Luckily for me, their customer service is great and shipped me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> The best part was how long the curls lasted!</li>
            <li> The curls come out nice and quick too.</li>
            <li> Best curling purchase I&#x27;ve made in a very long time!</li>
            <li> She put the one inch on the fitting and it worked fine....</li>
            <li> For the amount you pay its a really good deal, but lets stop saying its as good as a quality brand flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I love how quickly this heats up and how shiny it makes my hair!</li>
            <li> so I use the large barrel all over (found some good youtube tutorials)</li>
            <li> So far my experience with the curling wand has been great.  </li>
            <li> This product was a great price and reccomended by a professional in the businesss.</li>
            <li> So decided to purchase this wand as it has so many attachments available.</li>
            <li> This is a great set for the novice or the professional.</li>
            <li> Loved the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> the iron is good when is not broken ((</li>
            <li> it works (although it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some others), and the curls look great right after I&#x27;m done, but they do fall out during the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome because the styling options are endless, from the signature</li>
            <li> Easy to change barrels.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, change barrel</li>
            <li> The interchanging tips are durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to exchange the rods either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to change sizes.</li>
            <li> I just received the HSI professional curling iron, I was really satisfy with the item and the seller, the curling iron arrived in excellent conditions within the shipping time establish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a one size fits all and not the most comfortable or tailored fit.</li>
            <li> Using is was soo easy theirs</li>
            <li> Heats up within mins and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> The wands click in easily and are easy to switch out.</li>
            <li> The thing that stuck out to me the most was that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; when I curl it at a higher temperate (I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and was kind of worried at first, because she is a hair stylist and I was unsure about the quality of HSI, but after reading all the reviews I went ahead and got it for her</li>
            <li> beautiful and distinctly different curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was used to the clamp on my curling iron</li>
            <li> It gets hot fast and leaves the hair looking great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 3-4 weeks now and it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> This worked so well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this one to anybody (even us girls with fine hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl).</li>
            <li> Shipping was really quick too!</li>
            <li> This wand makes great tight curls as well as nice waves.</li>
            <li> It holds her curls all day and creates smooth silky hair.</li>
            <li> This iron is also dual voltage, which is important, as I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product works great.</li>
            <li> It was great when it actually worked.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil tames flyaways and leaves my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Used the product 4 times and already have an error light blinking.  </li>
            <li> Various sizes of curl wands are great.</li>
            <li> this curler is such a great product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I have found a product that actually curls my hair...</li>
            <li> While they may have convenient features, they don&#x27;t last and aren&#x27;t great for my hair.</li>
            <li> The attachments fit snug in the controller.</li>
            <li> which is obviously really important.  </li>
            <li> The seller Blue Novelties had great customer service.  </li>
            <li> I was about to purchase two separate curling iron sizes when I saw that sets like this one were available.</li>
            <li> This may or not be a good product, but the one I received was clearly used.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and I love the range of possible temperatures.</li>
            <li> After I emailed them, they apologized refunded my money, send me a free return label and made this process super easy to return.</li>
            <li> But with this one i just hold my hair on the wand for like 5 seconds and its a perfect tight curl!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The heat adjustment is easy to operate and the iron warms up quickly.</li>
            <li> It was curly all day and into the next.. which is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> , I love it, my hair looks soo pretty and curly:D</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> So glad they include the glove because you really need it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Simply Rich</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this as a gift.</li>
            <li> Though it comes with a gloves,I suggest get an oven gloves or more heat resistant gloves as the barrel is hot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants nice curls!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and has a light to let me know when it has reached the temperature.  </li>
            <li> It not only arrived early, it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing the iron, I&#x27;ve been able to clean out the bathroom by getting rid of many of my old irons.  </li>
            <li> It also felt like the handle was a bit flimsy specially when changing barrels.</li>
            <li> The price was great for me as many other products were higher in price for just 1 sized barrel.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to pick it up quickly and I am now able to curl my hair as quickly as I did with my old curling iron.</li>
            <li> Also the heat settings are all digital which is great because you know the exact temperature at all time.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a versatile top notch styling wand at a reasonable price point, I recommend the HSI Styling Wand.</li>
            <li> love that the heat distribution is very even .</li>
            <li> The glove is a plus especially if you don&#x27;t know how to use the wand to good</li>
            <li> Well made and heats up quickly; really like the four interchangable barrel sizes - provides for many style options.</li>
            <li> (remember to let your curls cool before running your fingers though you hair) with a bit a hair spray.</li>
            <li> I guess I got what its worth for its cheap price..</li>
            <li> But so far this item is working quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would be the magic product that would keep my hair curled all day, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> and as a professional hair dresser that&#x27;s honestly kind of a plus</li>
            <li> Styling is fast and easy to get comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only glad amazing is such an amazing company.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the flat iron from HSI and LOVED IT</li>
            <li> Leaves hair super shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Even with a cheap hairspray, they still looked amazing on the next day!</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and the product was well protected.</li>
            <li> Item is as described, was packaged well and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it heats up really quick.</li>
            <li> They heat quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quickly with all items and instructions in the box.</li>
            <li> I found this one that gives me the option to change the curl size with the quick switch of the wand.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> She has mastered it well and has sped up tremendously in her time to curl.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re more daring and better at curling your short hair without a clamp&#x27;s help, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Curls my hair quickly...</li>
            <li> At first this product worked great, but within a few months of using it, it began to deteriorate and now is nowhere near as good as my CHI was.  </li>
            <li> so my hair tends to get damaged and the ends tend to feel rough but for some reason not with the HSI curler my hair felt incredibly soft all day and was even able to pass my fingers thru my hair (with LOTS of hair spray in it!!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many flat irons, mostly versions costing under $30.</li>
            <li> The very first day i got this product and used it it worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and it can take forever to straighten but with this gorgeous iron, it takes no time at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved how it curled my hair until the only barrel (1&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I would like to try them out a bit more to see if they break after the first use, but I need to return the whole thing.</li>
            <li> The curling iron itself is really fast to heat up and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and it easy on my hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I curled my hair, the curls lasted 3 DAYS!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love the HSI professional curling iron !</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!  </li>
            <li> but with this curling iron my hair will still have curl the next day, love it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand, the different size barrels are easily interchanged.</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly, and the various heat settings are nice.</li>
            <li> I bought as a gift for my daughter that has VERY thick hair and this works great on it !!!!</li>
            <li> The curling wand is ridiculously fantastic - my hair absolutely will NOT hold a curl with anything else, and this keeps a curl in my hair all day</li>
            <li> It creates amazing curls that last all day without any products added to your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has a light wave to it and is medium thickness, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to flatten out.</li>
            <li> The warm up time is short and the curling time is even shorter!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Good price and faster shipping than expected.</li>
            <li> The temperature is adjustable, and there is a nice digital display.</li>
            <li> It took me some practice to get used to it but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This wand is worth every penny</li>
            <li> Was nice that it actually curled my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> It curls so nicely and the curls hold with no hairspray used well into the next day until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> While I am still getting used to these wands with no clamps, I enjoyed the ease it offers in curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really worth the price</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Recommended for any aged person who is able to curl their hair safely.</li>
            <li> Thus far I love this product.</li>
            <li> With the versatilty and price of this tool means you&#x27;ll get the worth of your money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist and love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> I love the oil it comes with, it really helps your hair stay soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought that was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the cost in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So, its very easy to attach the different size barrels, its gets hot very quickly and it stays hot.</li>
            <li> I like that you can control the temperature so if your hair curls easily you don&#x27;t have to expose it to extremely high</li>
            <li> The other one I bought is great quality (my daughter likes it as much as her sister&#x27;s CHI)</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and seems to stay hot</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no longer working, it might just be me not getting the plate on right.</li>
            <li> So I went to look at the instructions and she was doing everything right.</li>
            <li> Gets nice and hot which is key for getting and maintaining curls.</li>
            <li> The glove that is included works ok to protect the heat, but my fingers still tend to get rather hot when near the iron despite the glove.</li>
            <li> The settings are very easy to figure out and the heat is controllable so you can always set the proper heat for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> The curling wand is very easy to use and creates a lasting curl.</li>
            <li> So far the quality seems great, and the multiple sizes really make it worth the money.</li>
            <li> It heats up so quickly and all the barrels allow for so many different styles.</li>
            <li> Maybe a different glove, it&#x27;s good, but feels rough and creates static in my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this purchase if you&#x27;re looking for pretty straight hair!!!</li>
            <li> and I l&#x27;m really liking how smooth both of these tools make my hair, whether its curly or straight.</li>
            <li> it has a magnet closure so not only does it look great as packaging, but can be used to actually store the products as well, so you can keep all the items in one place.</li>
            <li> It is vastly superior compared to my old, traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast...</li>
            <li> She has long Barbie blonde hair that looks absolutley beautiful with spiral curls now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair comes out great each time and curls last until my next shampoo!</li>
            <li> I looooooove My new HSI Curling Wand!!!</li>
            <li> Stop reading and go buy your new hair toy already!!!</li>
            <li> The 4 different barrels allow for many different styles and are very easy to change.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool - it&#x27;s a must have for fast, easy styling that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> you so soft n straight, plus you can add a curl  fast easy to if you&#x27;d like!</li>
            <li> The different sized barrels come in very handy to create different looks.</li>
            <li> Also the iron heats very fast.</li>
            <li> I do find that my curls don&#x27;t stay as long as I would have expected when using these barrels in particular, but I really really love and adore the specialty ones, which curl my hair perfectly and stick around into the next day!</li>
            <li> this item is constantly going up and down, i think i got a very good deal, but if you want to save some money, you can get the  1&amp;#34;inch Tapered Curling Iron and the accessorie set for separate for around $70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate how the company takes care of it&#x27;s customers!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a curling iron with no clip</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> We love how the temperature is digital</li>
            <li> and you can watch as it gets higher and reaches your desired setting.  </li>
            <li> this is my first wand i ever used</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered a curling wand set.</li>
            <li> I love the option of having the different sizes.</li>
            <li> When I made the purchase it said 4 wands for the price I had purchase it for, that is the reason why I had purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to purchasing hair products.</li>
            <li> Love it overall and would/have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I would consider myself pretty savvy in regards to styling hair</li>
            <li> The price has gone up $20 since I bought the first one, and for what?</li>
            <li> This item is now her go to tool when styling her hair,  she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of multiple barrel sizes.  </li>
            <li> I did research and tried a bunch of different curling irons and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive very good expense!</li>
            <li> It also holds up pretty well to the humidity.</li>
            <li> Love the product, it comes with 4 different barrel sizes.</li>
            <li> Love the interchangeable barrels and overall quality for the money.  </li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this, but with the caveat that it&#x27;s not going to do much better than a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love all the different barrel sizes and the adjustable temperature.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it has up to 220V since I travel outside of the US quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I love the way the curl looks and the different styles I can obtain with it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say i am very VERY happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The first thing that got my attention (besides the price) was the rave 1,000+ reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it can be used internationally!</li>
            <li> The tool gets really hot and stays consistently hot.</li>
            <li> My favorite are the middle ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, soft &amp; holds its style.</li>
            <li> I love the various sizes of the barrels!!!  </li>
            <li> They heat up really fast and the display is clear and easy to read.</li>
            <li> This was the first curling wand I&#x27;ve bought, and I decided on this one after being pleased with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and changing sizes is super simple and easy (haven&#x27;t had one problem).</li>
            <li> I was so excited when my HSI Professional Curling Iron Set came in.  </li>
            <li> Everyone looked amazing and it was much faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick, pretty wavy, somewhat frizzy hair, and this worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and I love achieving different curls &amp; styles with all the sizes.</li>
            <li> Go look them up, not only the ones on their site but overall, NO not so good.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well</li>
            <li> I read they reviews before purchase and decided on this product based on positive reviews and</li>
            <li> It gets hot really fast and my hair holds all day.</li>
            <li> The HSI Professional Flat Iron and Argan Oil are amazing products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of shopping with Amazon over the last few years, and this by far is the BEST purchase I ever made.</li>
            <li> I tried all of them and I have to say, as a first timer using wands, I really like these barrels.</li>
            <li> professional grade, very easy to use and all 4 barrels give the hair a different look.</li>
            <li> but I take that as a sign that it is in securely and not loose</li>
            <li> The barrels are easy to connect but feel tight and secure once you have them clicked into place.</li>
            <li> The wand heats very quickly, and I like the digital display for the heat control.</li>
            <li> it easy to switch the different barrels on and off as well.</li>
            <li> Does my hair super natural look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and interchange the barrels to give you different styles.</li>
            <li> Blue Novelties shipped very quickly and everything was as described.  </li>
            <li> The different barrels are easy to install and it heats up very</li>
            <li> They emailed asking if everything was okay with the order a little while after I received it, and when I responded that one of the barrels didn&#x27;t fit, they sent me a whole new one immediately.</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it really helps from letting the heat get in.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much from the glove-</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift, but my niece gives it a high 5!</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> It curls hair well and curls stay intact very well</li>
            <li> It started flashing a red error light</li>
            <li> I really like this wand.</li>
            <li> Do not twist, just pull the wand straight out of the handle.</li>
            <li> and she really like it.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, performs well.</li>
            <li> Would reccomend this product highly!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% sold on the idea after reading all reviews, but you really can&#x27;t beat the price considering you receive four curling irons ...</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It curled it really well</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to just exchange one barrel or the whole thing.</li>
            <li> so I just need to buy the whole thing again,</li>
            <li> I now have the option to have curly or straight hair, where before I did not.</li>
            <li> And then my hair is straight again</li>
            <li> This thing heats up fast and maintains the heat well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really recommend to buy to this seller.</li>
            <li> My hair was much softer after using the HSI iron, than when I used the CHI iron.</li>
            <li> My hair can hold real curls now for two days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the way it worked, hope it&#x27;s not broken.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> the price is way to much.</li>
            <li> And, I got them both for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but when i really wanted i&#x27;d have my boyfriend switch heads for me.</li>
            <li> but I really am liking it.</li>
            <li> Really like the versatility of this product.</li>
            <li> Well made, versatile, heats up fast.</li>
            <li> The seller was fast and product came just as described if not exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> For those that had such troubles switching the barrels, if the bumps on the inside to lock it in place aren&#x27;t lined up exactly right it definitely causes more difficulty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gets hot super fast and curls last for days</li>
            <li> The first one I received did not work properly but the seller quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li> The weight of the iron is just right, not heavy</li>
            <li> I got the order with only one tapered barrel, now I am wondering if I was cheated out of the original deal.</li>
            <li> I use the largest size and have yet to try the other sizes, but I expect I will be just as pleased with them.</li>
            <li> The other barrels seem to be working okay; for now.</li>
            <li> she threw away all her other curling irons :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it in every home for those who want what is new and has the capability to make you stand out!!</li>
            <li> First you have to make sure you push the wand firmly into the handle and it will lock into place.</li>
            <li> It heats up REALLY fast and curls my short hair quickly.</li>
            <li> We have tried and tried to curl her hair but this product was the only thing that worked on her super straight hair.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get the hang of it (and the glove is a must for me), but I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the curls it produces.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at myself for not even needing the glove since I was a first timer.</li>
            <li> My old one had  a built on rest that kept the hot iron off my counter.  </li>
            <li> But there is not a little stand to prop the curling iron up on when hot and not using.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different wands and my hair will hold curls from different brands for about 5 min.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try different styles.</li>
            <li> great product it heats up fast and handles difficult hair well-</li>
            <li> I love the four different size barrels to achieve different curling looks.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and I like the digital temp reading.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Once again, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice and hot for my thick frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> Great set overall, bonus the send extra little goodies and</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite wands, even over more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and of course, straight.  </li>
            <li> The ease of switching barrels and the different sizes makes this fun to use.</li>
            <li> which was not hard for him-</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t wear down easily.</li>
            <li> I even bought the other attachments that came with a travel bag to fit all of these and the three of those from HSI.</li>
            <li> I had heard about the new curling wand idea from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> One word of advise: it takes some practice to use if you are new to using a wand.</li>
            <li> I recently got into using wands to curl my hair as it is the hot new trend</li>
            <li> It worked better than I expected!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and I&#x27;ve tried every single barrel and was pleased.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this I had to I am in love with this wand</li>
            <li> the wines get extremely hot and they hold the curls throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the HSI Professional curling iron set to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> She likes the different sizes, hot temperatures and ease to use.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described and with the 4 wands it gives me flexibility for different types of curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m equally pleased with the wand - I recently used it to do several bridesmaids&#x27; hair at a wedding, and it worked well on all different kinds of hair.</li>
            <li> Before i purchased the HSI i actually used my friend wand first just to test it out .</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some others, but this might be better for your hair anyway.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot, so be careful and use the glove provided.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased a Flat Iron or used one.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to screw it back on tight.</li>
            <li> I cannot use this with a clear conscience because of fear it might fall off any moment.</li>
            <li> It completely transforms my hair and it looks natural and doesn&#x27;t have that -curled-dry-damaged hair look.  </li>
            <li> One day it completely stopped working, meaning that it wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all.</li>
            <li> When you want to change wands, wait until it is completely cooled.</li>
            <li> so thought that I would really appreciate the different barrel sizes.</li>
            <li> I had only about 10 or so curls in my hair and the rest was straight.</li>
            <li> I got the four piece HSI professional curling wand</li>
            <li> but my hair will hold the curl from the HSI professional curling wand</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter says &amp;</li>
            <li> I bought the HSI Professional Curling Iron Set for my daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It was fast and simple to use tho it does get some getting used to in the beginning since im used to the barrel with a clamp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this HSI for a few days now and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gone to bed with my hair styled, and woke up with the soft curls</li>
            <li> heats up fast and curls last all day!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting to try something new or simply want the beach wave hair style, whatever.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the pricey side but worth the money!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Blue Novelties and HSI Professional Curling Iron set.  </li>
            <li> This wand also heats up so quick it takes less than a minute to get up to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li> I love how the iron curls however the barrels are difficult to remove and I had to return the first one for replacement because I could not remove the barrel that I put on and the release button would not release it.</li>
            <li> The main draw back if I&#x27;d have kept the set is that there is not a stand for the iron to rest on when warming.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but now this is my favorite styling tool.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for purchase to anyone that feels comfortable using a clip-less iron, just be aware that it is very different than the usual suspect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this flat iron if you&#x27;re seeking professional quality.  </li>
            <li> I have very hard to straighten hair and by using this HSI straightener, my hair is smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> If your hair is too long to curl the entire length at once, just do the top part and move the barrel down to do the other half after the top is curled.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, i chose this specific product - HSI Professional curling iron set, because of the high quality.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no regrets or complaints!</li>
            <li> I have a couple other ideas I saw that I might be interested in.  </li>
            <li> but I much prefer that to them being loose</li>
            <li> I received a brand new 1 inch CHI Flat-iron, as a gift, after I&#x27;d already ordered the HSI 1 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li> I knew I needed a new flat iron</li>
            <li> I mainly use the two smaller sizes as I prefer tighter curls (and they seem to last longer) but all four create</li>
            <li> the next morning, she still had a decent amount of curl left.  </li>
            <li> The barrels don&#x27;t go in very easily, the bigger barrel broken within weeks for this reason.</li>
            <li> The curling wand is definitely of professional quality, and the different barrel sizes meet all my hair curling needs.</li>
            <li> Apparently that must be everyone else that they respond to because she received no response to her questions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the smallest rod so far so</li>
            <li> Even on the second day, the curls are looking like natural wavy.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews that said the curls didn&#x27;t last, I bought the curling irons anyway because (as a professional cosmetologist)</li>
            <li> I had NO trouble with attaching the different sizes.</li>
            <li> We got this for our 10 year old daughter for xmas after seeing a product similar at the mall that they were selling for $250.00.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used only the 3/4&amp;#34; of the four.</li>
            <li> It is a quality curling iron complete with different sized barrels &amp; heat glove.</li>
            <li> This product gave her hair a professional curl that lasted through the entire day,</li>
            <li> I kind of wish there were two gloves supplies, because I am foreveer putting it on the wrong hand.</li>
            <li> Her only complaint is the glove seems really cheap.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; light, or the light that tells you that it is hot, is on the wrong side of the flat iron, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Switching the barrels seemed a little tricky at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;The item arrived promptly, packaged nicely and even though the heat glove was missing, no fault of Blue Novelties, it was included but unfortunately was misplaced in transit, I contacted Blue Novelties &amp; they were very prompt &amp; considerate &amp; quickly sent to me</li>
            <li> I finally decided that I needed a professional flat iron vs the drug store buy.</li>
            <li> a lot of her other sets that are main stream brands.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair which is rather straight and difficult to curl, and I am rather challenged when it comes to hair styling skills, but with this iron I can create beautiful, long lasting curls without any problems.</li>
            <li> The curls are silky, soft, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> (my hair usually doesn&#x27;t keep curls for more than a few hours)</li>
            <li> The curling iron heats up quickly and evenly and so far she doesn&#x27;t have a single complaint about it.</li>
            <li> When I use this iron my hair stays straight and tame all day even in humidity.</li>
            <li> Finally broke down and bought a new flat iron.</li>
            <li> Hsi heats up fast there 4 different sizes for small or big curls.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The different sized barrels give a range of different looks from soft waves to tight curls.</li>
            <li> you just bought 4 different professional curling wands for less than the price of one.</li>
            <li> I also have the HSI flat iron</li>
            <li> faster than my flat iron</li>
            <li> The flat iron straightens my hair with one run through.  </li>
            <li> Have only had a chance to use it a few times so far, but the curls it makes actually holds in my daughters hair all day!</li>
            <li> There is nothing in the description that this is for medium or long hair length only.  </li>
            <li> Or just creating volume to that flat lengthy hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and no matter how much hair spray nothing ever works!</li>
            <li> , the barrels are from very thin to a huge size, my wife likes this product very much, it holds the curls for very long time, and the price was $79.99!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but the glove was useless, It ripped easily.</li>
            <li> I dont think this will last long if we change the ends alot because the wire that is on the ends that connects comes loose.</li>
            <li> this flat iron and would reccommend this item to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t use the included barrels as frequently as I use the specialty ones that I purchased separately, but I&#x27;ve used all at least once and have no big qualms with any.</li>
            <li> Even though it gets up to 450 degrees, it takes a long time to make a curl and then the curl wouldn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> The curls can hold up all day long.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> She stated she has to be extra careful not to burn herself.</li>
            <li> Works well, but curls dont hold as long as with a remington wand</li>
            <li> For a week then it read err in red every time she tries to use it .</li>
            <li> Having 4 different size of barrels means you can style from short to long hair and can do from tight to loose curls.</li>
            <li> The other iron I bought, I ordered earlier</li>
            <li> Holds curl for a long time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very minor design flaw that wouldn&#x27;t deter me from ordering it again, but something to consider if you don&#x27;t have a heat-resistant countertop.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this for anyone who has a hard time curling their hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with small Argon oil, but still a great product.</li>
            <li> Their customer care seems good, just not a great product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The barrels are a little hard to change the first couple of times but it seems to get easier after that.  </li>
            <li> I always feel like I am going to break it and one came with a loose tip</li>
            <li> I like the HSI flat iron, it works just as well as my last one from Herstyler but half the price!</li>
            <li> I just got this item less than a week ago and curled my hair for work that same day.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, curls even my difficult hair with ease.</li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> They did last a long time, but was not able to finish curling the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not much.</li>
            <li> I received this shipment way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> This purchase was such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I sent the irons back a few days ago and am waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful putting each one on correctly it seems to come off easier.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact I can make them faster than expected.</li>
            <li> but considering I almost spent $30 on one lower-end curling wand</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, so I think it makes it harder to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a few chances to play around with it</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to pull the barrel away from the body from the first time and the wires were exposed for a few times because the barrel fell apart into two pieces when I tried to separate it from the body.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was that the temperature knob does not tell you anything except for the high heat and low heat.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why any of the long-haired gals on here had such issues, unless they were trying to hold the barrel pointed up like you might one with a clip.</li>
            <li> Other hair straighteners can&#x27;t touch this one.</li>
            <li> It came with 4 different sized barrels, a glove and a small bottle of argon oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> so I started looking stores and on other websites.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my money!</li>
            <li> However, due to the positioning of the power switch and my lack of experience using the tool, I did accidentally turn it off a couple of times while using it.</li>
            <li> it does have a place to hold onto unlike a lot of other curling wands.</li>
            <li> Beauriful loose or tight curls.</li>
            <li> I wish they had like a clip stand to put it down but other than that</li>
            <li> The only thing I can complain about it that they are really hard to change out.</li>
            <li> My one complaint, also what ruins the entire thing is the interchangeable wands won&#x27;t stay into place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m forced to wait Inbetween curls for it to heat back up again</li>
            <li> my finger sometimes hits the temperature control and turns it down</li>
            <li> but other times it curls on point!</li>
            <li> so be careful!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few months which is a bit disappointing to have to buy a new one I guess.    </li>
            <li> and so I had previously purchased a conair wand a cone shape.</li>
            <li> around 2 and a half years.</li>
            <li> I have long thick &amp; a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Kardashian curls to the tight bouncy summer curls that every girl has to try</li>
            <li> 1- I have small hands so the glove it comes with is really big on me which makes it hard to grip my hair</li>
            <li> The barrels are a little tricky to remove from the handle but that&#x27;s no problem for me.  </li>
            <li> was a little reluctant to purchase because of the price</li>
            <li> It just need a little bit of practice because it doesn&#x27;t have the clip which you can find with some type or brand.</li>
            <li> I did get little burns on my hand</li>
            <li> I was not let down!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, item does not come with clear instructions.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble curling your hair and your hair does not like holding curls</li>
            <li> I had this item for 3 months used it just a few times.</li>
            <li> having used it for a few days now I agree with their views.</li>
            <li> I just wasted $80 for the set.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> They put it on the heavier side that is usually facing down rather than on the lighter side that is facing up.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use or change barrels.  </li>
            <li> On/off button a little small.  </li>
            <li> and i have very thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it difficult to change out the different size wands as I have read in previous reviews either.</li>
            <li> When removing the attachments they can be a little hard to pull out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too difficult to get your hair wrapped around without burning your hand or arm if your locks are too short.</li>
            <li> I bought for her as a small gift</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried with product, no product leaving it on for longer, but the curls usually soften quite a bit by the time I get to work.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, and wavy hair that is difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> but my wife had a hard time locking the barrels</li>
            <li> not sure how the other rods will do or if it&#x27;l be difficult to change them out yet.</li>
            <li> but it being hard to switch plates.</li>
            <li> changing the barrels it is a bit hard</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have already mentioned it being hard to lock into place.</li>
            <li> at least once.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seriously sucks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone with thick or ethnic hair to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> and I mean it was well under a minute.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lock completely  :(</li>
            <li> However they worked with me and sent me a new base.</li>
            <li> You do have to push the wand into the base firmly before you can twist and lock it into place, but it&#x27;s no big deal once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> It can be a little difficult to change the barrel.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> To use it correctly you have to hold the barrel facing down and start wrapping your hair at the base of the barrel from the root down.</li>
            <li> so i guess i&#x27;m just really weak.  </li>
            <li> but mine was very hard to change barrels on.</li>
            <li> I would like a product that a company stands behind 100%.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> For an expensive wand I thought it would at least work for a year.</li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic change in my hair.</li>
            <li> The first curling iron that I received had a faulty base, but as soon as they were informed of this they shipped a replacement base at no cost to me.  </li>
            <li> the reason why i onyl gave it 3 stars is cuz it is sooooooo difficult to chnge the sizes...</li>
            <li> Sorry HSI</li>
            <li> The wands are difficult to change.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> the glove is useless..</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I may add a small amount of lubricant around the base of the attachments to aid with removal.  </li>
            <li> thats just crazy.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this set for the price!</li>
            <li> Ladies I recommend this 100% you will not be disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> when I used the irons and the curls dropped within an hour, I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!</li>
            <li> I have terrible frizzy hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am very pleased with the HSI Curling Wand I purchased through Amazon. The curling wand is definitely of professional quality, and the different barrel sizes meet all my hair curling needs. The wand heats very quickly, and I like the digital display for the heat control. The included heat glove is a welcome plus to avoid mishaps while styling, as the wand reaches very high temperatures. If you are looking for a versatile top notch styling wand at a reasonable price point, I recommend the HSI Styling Wand.</li>
            <li> The curling wand tapered barrel is absolutely amazing! I bought this for my girlfriend and it does wonders on her hair. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants nice curls! Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Great curling iron.  it gets really hot.  glad they included a glove.  I would give it a 5 star but it did not come with 4 barrels.  only the one attached.</li>
            <li> Heats up FAST and does a great job!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron/wand!  It gets the job done quickly and works perfectly.  I have thick, coarse, and wavy hair that is difficult to work with.  This product gets the job done!  It completely transforms my hair and it looks natural and doesn&#x27;t have that -curled-dry-damaged hair look.  The curls are silky, soft, and last a long time.  I would highly recommend!  Edit: AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! We had a problem with our curling iron and they handled it in the best way. Best customer service I have ever seen. Highly recommend! I really appreciate how the company takes care of it&#x27;s customers! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Ok lets start with the four interchangeable sizes. This is so great .Basically you just bought 4 different professional curling wands for less than the price of one. It&#x27;s awesome because the styling options are endless, from the signature Kardashian curls to the tight bouncy summer curls that every girl has to try at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the heat distribution is very even . Also the heat settings are all digital which is great because you know the exact temperature at all time. This wand also heats up so quick it takes less than a minute to get up to 400 degrees. Also nice that they threw in a heat protective glove. All and all I looooooove My new HSI Curling Wand!!! Are u still here? Stop reading and go buy your new hair toy already!!!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some others, but this might be better for your hair anyway.  Still great value.  Delivery was as promised.  :)</li>
            <li> great product. keeps my hair curled all day.Takes about 10 minutes to curl all my hair so it saves A LOT of time! professional grade, very easy to use and all 4 barrels give the hair a different look. It gets very hot, so be careful and use the glove provided.</li>
            <li> Great product. Loved the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this I had to I am in love with this wand it&#x27;s gets hot super fast and curls last for days it easy to switch the different barrels on and off as well. Ladies I recommend this 100% you will not be disappointed at all. The glove is a plus especially if you don&#x27;t know how to use the wand to good it really helps from letting the heat get in.</li>
            <li> This may or not be a good product, but the one I received was clearly used. It also felt like the handle was a bit flimsy specially when changing barrels.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and she loves it. It holds her curls all day and creates smooth silky hair. Update 3/9/15 - She told me the barrels did not heat up anymore, so I contacted them and immediately got a response for a replacement wand. Great customer service!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling wand. Don&#x27;t expect much from the glove- it&#x27;s not much.</li>
            <li> Great product and great communication!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift, but my niece gives it a high 5!</li>
            <li> Does everything my daughter wanted it to do. Christmas gift and it went over well.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and I love achieving different curls &amp; styles with all the sizes. Easy to change barrels.  I also have the HSI flat iron and I l&#x27;m really liking how smooth both of these tools make my hair, whether its curly or straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this for over a year, no problems at all. By far one of my favorite wands, even over more expensive brands. Leaves hair super shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. The curls stay for days.</li>
            <li> HSI curling iron is amazing! Great curler allows you to control temperature. I used it for the first time yesterday and loved it! So easy to use. I did the 1.5 barrel and got big beach waves. Works best when you curl and add hair spray right after hair is off barrel.</li>
            <li> Curling iron was sent back. Probably a good iron but my wife had a hard time locking the barrels and it did not have the clip,, to clip your hair on to the iron. The big problem was that is cost 20 dollars in shipping to send it back. That was a rip off.</li>
            <li> I was dying to do my hair and my two sisters&#x27; hair when it came in! We all have different hair types and lengths so the 4 interchangeable wands is awesome! Everyone looked amazing and it was much faster than I had expected. I could not believe the shine and softness that it gave each one of us! The best part was how long the curls lasted! Even with a cheap hairspray, they still looked amazing on the next day! This is great! I have absolutely no regrets or complaints! The results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron.  It heats up quickly and has a light to let me know when it has reached the temperature.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and of course, straight.  It looks like I just got out of the salon!  Easy purchase, quick shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Christmas gift and she loves it</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for the cost.  the wines get extremely hot and they hold the curls throughout the entire day. Best curling purchase I&#x27;ve made in a very long time!</li>
            <li> I ordered this curling wand as a christmas gift for my sister. I had heard about the new curling wand idea from my hairdresser. I researched reviews and read about wand options in the market. Ultimately, i chose this specific product - HSI Professional curling iron set, because of the high quality. I was not let down! The package arrived quickly and the product was well protected. The pink box was in perfect condition, which made me very happy! i was impressed with the box. it has a magnet closure so not only does it look great as packaging, but can be used to actually store the products as well, so you can keep all the items in one place. The wand came with a heat glove, 4 barrels and instructions. The barrels are easy to connect but feel tight and secure once you have them clicked into place. The warm up time is short and the curling time is even shorter! My sister &#x27;s hair was SO curly! she has a problem with her hair holding a curl, but not with this product! It was curly all day and into the next.. which is AMAZING!  She said it was the best curling iron she had ever had! ... This from a girl who is SO into her hair! I would recommend the HSI Professional curling iron set to anyone and everyone! Short hair... long hair... perfect for both! I am not one to write reviews.. but after having such a great experience, i felt i had to share! This is a GREAT product and very inexpensive! Like four curling irons in one!!!!!</li>
            <li> Well made and heats up quickly; really like the four interchangable barrel sizes - provides for many style options. Great value!</li>
            <li> Curling iron has different sizes for your days preference. Your hair stays curly even after sleeping on it. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I Love everything about  this set . The ease of switching barrels and the different sizes makes this fun to use.The glove protects my fingers and my curls or waves last all day. Dont know how I ever did my hair without this. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what to expect, but my wife liked it! Good price and faster shipping than expected. Recomended!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!! Item is as described, was packaged well and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Great packaging to keep all the components safe and organized. The weight of the iron is just right, not heavy but it feels well made. They heat up really fast and the display is clear and easy to read. The curls last all day. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a curling iron with no clip but I have to say that I do love it! It takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it (make sure you wear the included glove) you&#x27;ll have beautiful curls. The barrels are a little tricky to remove from the handle but that&#x27;s no problem for me.  Love the sample of argon oil too.</li>
            <li> Great product, Glad I purchased. A++++++++++++</li>
            <li> I received this shipment way sooner than expected. As soon as i got it i tried it out....the curls stayed in ALLLL DAY and looked so beautiful I got compliments all day. I totally RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> I dont think this will last long if we change the ends alot because the wire that is on the ends that connects comes loose.</li>
            <li> I couldnt even get the barrels to stay in the wand and the thing wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all. Can I return this? It seriously sucks. I was so excited.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! She says it&#x27;s the best hair styler she has ever had.</li>
            <li> Got this set as a birthday gift in January, 2014. I absolutely loved how it curled my hair until the only barrel (1&amp;#34;) I use broke. It was a little hard to pull the barrel away from the body from the first time and the wires were exposed for a few times because the barrel fell apart into two pieces when I tried to separate it from the body. One day it completely stopped working, meaning that it wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all. I&#x27;ve been using the tapered 1&amp;#34; barrel since then but I don&#x27;t like the curls I get with it. I miss my 1&amp;#34; barrel...</li>
            <li> Wonderful curling iron set. Very well made. Nice selection of curling barrels which are very easy to switch. Heats up instantaneously. Protective glove comes very handy as the iron can reach up to 430F, so it is much easier not to get burned when using it. The temperature is adjustable, and there is a nice digital display. I have very long, thick hair which is rather straight and difficult to curl, and I am rather challenged when it comes to hair styling skills, but with this iron I can create beautiful, long lasting curls without any problems. It is vastly superior compared to my old, traditional curling iron. This iron is also dual voltage, which is important, as I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> Finally broke down and bought a new flat iron.It works great and love the way my hair looks and shines.Very comfortable to handle and heats up quickly,love everything about it.Only wish i would of bought it sooner.I was concerned because the price was so good,but have no regrets its perfect.</li>
            <li> I had my eye set on the Bellami brand, but after some research decide on HSI, several reasons why but let me tell you a couple that sealed the deal with HSI.&lt;br /&gt;1) Price. omg Bellami is 300.00 unless you use their coupon code which gives you 160.00$ off, however do not be fooled, if you use their coupon code it is considered final sale. No returns, exchanges, or warranty replacement. Which means its yours no matter what. you get a dud your out 140.00. No, thank you. I would like a product that a company stands behind 100%.&lt;br /&gt;2) Customer Reviews about Customer Service. Go look them up, not only the ones on their site but overall, NO not so good. Not about the product but about the customer service they received.&lt;br /&gt;That is why I chose HSI, I love this curling iron set. It took me some practice to get used to it but worth the effort. So, its very easy to attach the different size barrels, its gets hot very quickly and it stays hot. It curls hair well and curls stay intact very well (remember to let your curls cool before running your fingers though you hair) with a bit a hair spray. Great set overall, bonus the send extra little goodies and the hair oil is to die for!</li>
            <li> The straightener came quickly and works just as good my chi.  I have no complaints!  Plus I love the pouch that comes with it for traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  At first this product worked great, but within a few months of using it, it began to deteriorate and now is nowhere near as good as my CHI was.  For the amount you pay its a really good deal, but lets stop saying its as good as a quality brand flat iron.</li>
            <li> I really love this curling iron set BUT the one thing I have is that sometimes when I curl my hair, I brush it out a bit and it looks funky lol but other times it curls on point! (: I wish they had like a clip stand to put it down but other than that, I love it, my hair looks soo pretty and curly:D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great product to purchase.  It has temperature setting which I can adjust its temperature that I need for my hair and it keeps my hair last all day.  Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> My two daughters and I really love this set.  It has a great variety of wands available, heats up quickly, and sets a really nice curl.  We love how the temperature is digital and you can watch as it gets higher and reaches your desired setting.  You do have to push the wand into the base firmly before you can twist and lock it into place, but it&#x27;s no big deal once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice curling iron...it feels sturdy and very solid...I am looking forward to utilizing it more often...8/10!</li>
            <li> My wife liked this when it worked.  Got it for Christmas and she liked the curls that it did.  The problem was that it would not stay on.  It would always turn itself off which I thought might be a safety feature.  There are no instructions on how to operate the thing.  She emailed them to ask about proper use because it says inside that they always answer their emails. Apparently that must be everyone else that they respond to because she received no response to her questions.  It started flashing a red error light so I decided to pack it up and send it back.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try another one but I&#x27;m hesitant at this point.</li>
            <li> I really like this wand. this is my first wand i ever used and i have very thick long hair. this wand holds my curls really good. the reason why i onyl gave it 3 stars is cuz it is sooooooo difficult to chnge the sizes... like my husband has to help me and i have to commit to the size until he is around again. maybe it was a defect on mine but overall i would buy it again..</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered a curling wand set. I couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled! It not only arrived early, it arrived in perfect condition. After reading one of the reviewer&#x27;s comments that she had to have her husband help her putting together the wand, I had mine along beside me. First you have to make sure you push the wand firmly into the handle and it will lock into place. I only wish that the instructions would tell you how to do it. When you want to change wands, wait until it is completely cooled. Do not twist, just pull the wand straight out of the handle. It heats up super fast...faster than my flat iron and I mean it was well under a minute. This wand is worth every penny and then some. You get four sizes!</li>
            <li> So far my experience with the curling wand has been great.  I like the look it gives when I want the deep waves.  I have a couple other ideas I saw that I might be interested in.  My experience with the vendor getting my curling wand to me within the time frame they agreed to, was on point.  Everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> Better than I could imagine!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It heats up so quickly and all the barrels allow for so many different styles. Very easy to use, I love this curler!</li>
            <li> I like the product and it heats up really quick. The curls come out nice and quick too. I still need to perfect the trick in doing the curls quicker lol... Shipping was really quick too!</li>
            <li> This curling wand and all its attachments are amazing. They heat up very quickly and with the glove you can change attachments on the fly. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when my HSI Professional Curling Iron Set came in.  It worked better than I expected!!!! The curls held up great in my hair.</li>
            <li> Once you figure out how to get it together it is a breeze and it works great.  I love the option of having the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand, the different size barrels are easily interchanged. It gets hot fast and leaves the hair looking great.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this curling iron to anyone! This purchase was such a waste of money. Even though it gets up to 450 degrees, it takes a long time to make a curl and then the curl wouldn&#x27;t hold up. I guess I got what its worth for its cheap price..</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only used the smallest rod so far so not sure how the other rods will do or if it&#x27;l be difficult to change them out yet. But so far this item is working quite nicely. It heats up REALLY fast and curls my short hair quickly. z&lt;br /&gt;Only things I don&#x27;t like are: 1- I have small hands so the glove it comes with is really big on me which makes it hard to grip my hair 2- the temperature changing buttons and power buttons are located in a spot that I constantly hit on accident while curling my hair and thus I sometimes turn off the machine on accident while curling my hair. Overall, I am l very happy with this item!</li>
            <li> Used maybe 5 times when all of a sudden it turned off in the middle of me using it and will not turn back on. I could understand if I dropped it or something, but it literally turned off while my hair was wrapped around it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I love how quickly this heats up and how shiny it makes my hair! The curls and waves last for days!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daugher for Christmas. She&#x27;s been using it ever since. She has long Barbie blonde hair that looks absolutley beautiful with spiral curls now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d absolutley reccommend to anyone that is looking to get a perfect spiral curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roxana from Rhode Island</li>
            <li> I bought the flat iron from HSI and LOVED IT so I decided to but the iron. I am soooo impressed with their products. Probably one of the best on the market and the price is AWESOME!  FYI.... I am a licensed Cosmetologist and I would not hesitate buying any products from HSI. You will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 3-4 weeks now and it seems to be working just fine. The heat settings are working correctly and I like the versatility with having 4 barrels. The only thing I can complain about it that they are really hard to change out. I always feel like I am going to break it and one came with a loose tip but I was able to screw it back on tight.</li>
            <li> When I made the purchase it said 4 wands for the price I had purchase it for, that is the reason why I had purchased it in the first place. I got the order with only one tapered barrel, now I am wondering if I was cheated out of the original deal.</li>
            <li> My sister ask me to purchase a curling iron set. I decided to purchase this for her and she really like it. She recommended this for her friends</li>
            <li> Love it. Heats up fast, performs well. Sometimes its a bit tricky to switch out, but always works in the end.</li>
            <li> I love this product. You can create different curls. The curls can hold up all day long. Even on the second day, the curls are looking like natural wavy.</li>
            <li> This product was a great price and reccomended by a professional in the businesss. Lots of options and looks and feels great. Would reccomend this product highly!</li>
            <li> Quality product! Hair looks gorgeous! I used to be a hairstylist and I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to purchasing hair products. This was definitely a good buy for me!</li>
            <li> This is a very good curling iron</li>
            <li> While I love this set I think it was misleading being labelled as a curling iron when it&#x27;s actually a wand. But I love it nonetheless and it seems to keep the curls longer in my hair! Easy to use, change barrel and it comes with hair oil &amp; glove.  However the power button just sunk in and now I keep getting an &amp;#34;error&amp;#34; label on the heating screen. I&#x27;ve only had it a few months which is a bit disappointing to have to buy a new one I guess.    However they worked with me and sent me a new base. Love it overall and would/have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product. The interchanging tips are durable and easy to use. They heat quickly and evenly. Great price.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! I personally like the biggest barrel and use it daily. It gets hot really fast and my hair holds all day.</li>
            <li> as advertised ... great product.  could not complain about any part of it.  would definitely recommend others to this product.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews that said the curls didn&#x27;t last, I bought the curling irons anyway because (as a professional cosmetologist) I know that some hair textures just don&#x27;t hold curl. My hair, however, holds curls for days so when I used the irons and the curls dropped within an hour, I was really disappointed.  It wasn&#x27;t easy to exchange the rods either. When I asked to return the irons I was contacted within a day and they accepted my request. I sent the irons back a few days ago and am waiting for my refund. Their customer care seems good, just not a great product unfortunately. Sorry HSI</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan! I wasn&#x27;t 100% sold on the idea after reading all reviews, but you really can&#x27;t beat the price considering you receive four curling irons ... For those that had such troubles switching the barrels, if the bumps on the inside to lock it in place aren&#x27;t lined up exactly right it definitely causes more difficulty. If you&#x27;re careful putting each one on correctly it seems to come off easier. I actually don&#x27;t use the included barrels as frequently as I use the specialty ones that I purchased separately, but I&#x27;ve used all at least once and have no big qualms with any. I do find that my curls don&#x27;t stay as long as I would have expected when using these barrels in particular, but I really really love and adore the specialty ones, which curl my hair perfectly and stick around into the next day! One thing to make note of is that the clip-less barrels, no matter the brand, are NOT for short hair! It&#x27;s just too difficult to get your hair wrapped around without burning your hand or arm if your locks are too short. Not sure why any of the long-haired gals on here had such issues, unless they were trying to hold the barrel pointed up like you might one with a clip. To use it correctly you have to hold the barrel facing down and start wrapping your hair at the base of the barrel from the root down. If your hair is too long to curl the entire length at once, just do the top part and move the barrel down to do the other half after the top is curled. I would definitely recommend this for purchase to anyone that feels comfortable using a clip-less iron, just be aware that it is very different than the usual suspect.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a teenager.  She likes the set.  She said better instructions for the temperature control and connecting are needed.</li>
            <li> i received the tool yesterday, and try it,it&#x27;s good for my need. i love it, and if it can more cheaper, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought as a gift for my daughter that has VERY thick hair and this works great on it !!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my sister for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. The different sized barrels come in very handy to create different looks. The box is great for storage. The curling iron heats up quickly and evenly and so far she doesn&#x27;t have a single complaint about it. It even comes with the heat glove and some hair oil to condition the ends.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for amazing price! Thrilled with purchase - delivery took 2 weeks but well worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li> With 10 years of experience working with many different tools,  this product was Perfect for me! I Love it!  I had NO trouble with attaching the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and was kind of worried at first, because she is a hair stylist and I was unsure about the quality of HSI, but after reading all the reviews I went ahead and got it for her and she loves it!! Say it is it salon quality and works better then a lot of her other sets that are main stream brands.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! I have thick, pretty wavy, somewhat frizzy hair, and this worked amazingly! It curled it really well, it made it not frizzy, and it held the curl (which my hair doesn&#x27;t like to do). I have long hair, and I&#x27;ve tried every single barrel and was pleased. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> great curling iron. didn&#x27;t have problems changing the barrels... for the price, best iron i&#x27;ve gotten, the curls stay on even longer than when i used my old ones</li>
            <li> Update: I continue to use this curling iron daily with great results! Once again, I would highly recommend. This is such a great product. It took me a few tries to get the hang of it (and the glove is a must for me), but I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the curls it produces. Plus, it was an added bonus that it comes with additional barrel sizes. I use the largest size and have yet to try the other sizes, but I expect I will be just as pleased with them. I love it!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my friend  that is in the Army in Korea. I also purchased the plug adapters to further enhance her needs. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron when I was growing my hair out so thought that I would really appreciate the different barrel sizes. In actuality, I still use the same barrel size every time. It is a good product and I love the range of possible temperatures. Curls my hair well. I love that the glove is included, it has saved my hand many a time. Good product, but not life changing.</li>
            <li> Tried several times to use this device. I bought it thinking it had a clamp.  It was unclear that you had to wrap your hair around the barrel. I would consider myself pretty savvy in regards to styling hair and I could not get the results I wanted with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It arrived in a nice box and had a velvet bag for it. The only thing is that it can sometimes be a pain when exchanging the iron for a different size. However, I will be buying this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I love how the iron curls however the barrels are difficult to remove and I had to return the first one for replacement because I could not remove the barrel that I put on and the release button would not release it. The button broke and fell inside. I have not tried to remove the barrel on the replacement. Replacement by Amazon was done promptly and courteously. I am happy with the service I received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> We got this for our 10 year old daughter for xmas after seeing a product similar at the mall that they were selling for $250.00.  It works great!  She can&#x27;t quite do it by herself yet but can grow into it.  The different barrels are easy to install and it heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have run into is when I am curling her hair my finger sometimes hits the temperature control and turns it down but when that happens it takes no time to heat back up.</li>
            <li> Gave this curling wand to my wife as a Christmas gift and she loved it! She really liked the fact that the barrels are interchangeable so she does not have to have 4 separate curling wands. I shopped around for a curling wand and this was by far the best quality and price.</li>
            <li> Was nice that it actually curled my hair. I have razor straight, thin hair that absolutely refuses to curl or stay curled for longer than about 20 minutes. The first time I curled my hair, the curls lasted 3 DAYS! I slept in them, brushed them, ran my fingers through my hair. AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller promptly replaced the defective barrel and I haven&#x27;t had any problems since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************&lt;br /&gt;However, I used the tapered barrel once for about 5 minutes before it quit working. I had only about 10 or so curls in my hair and the rest was straight. They did last a long time, but was not able to finish curling the rest of my hair. The display now says, \\&quot;Err\\&quot; and the barrel will not heat. The other barrels seem to be working okay; for now. I would like to try them out a bit more to see if they break after the first use, but I need to return the whole thing. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to just exchange one barrel or the whole thing. I only have the option to return. Well, okay so I just need to buy the whole thing again, right? NO! The price has gone up $20 since I bought the first one, and for what? So it can break again??? NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is really worth the price. I have very hard to straighten hair and by using this HSI straightener, my hair is smooth and straight. I love that there is an adjustable temperature control knob, which allows me to use maximum heat on my difficult hair. I now have the option to have curly or straight hair, where before I did not. Other hair straighteners can&#x27;t touch this one. I highly recommend this purchase if you&#x27;re looking for pretty straight hair!!!</li>
            <li> This product is one of my best ones.. Does my hair super natural look and I love it...  Im happy.</li>
            <li> I got the four piece HSI professional curling wand and then I got the 1 inch HSI professional curling Wand for my best friend. we both love this brand of wand !!!! I have tried many different wands and my hair will hold curls from different brands for about 5 min. And then my hair is straight again but my hair will hold the curl from the HSI professional curling wand untell I wash it out... If you have trouble curling your hair and your hair does not like holding curls this is the wand for you.... Me and my best friend love this curling wand ðŸ’—</li>
            <li> Purchased this curling iron for my teenage granddaughter for her birthday.  This item is now her go to tool when styling her hair,  she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> The other iron I bought, I ordered earlier and I kept it and my daughter loves it. Same brand. This one I had to send back because UPS had some delivery problems around Christmas and so I went to a store and bought it. It didn&#x27;t arrive until after I returned home (had it sent to where I was visiting). They were very good about the return, and I had no problems. Very easy. The other one I bought is great quality (my daughter likes it as much as her sister&#x27;s CHI)</li>
            <li> It appears OK for the most part. But there is not a little stand to prop the curling iron up on when hot and not using. I have never seen any curling iron without this feature. Strange.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece, she is 15, and she loves it. She likes the different sizes, hot temperatures and ease to use. She stated she has to be extra careful not to burn herself. Came in the mail quickly with all items and instructions in the box. Very Satisfied.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is really awesome. I love it!!!! It curls so nicely and the curls hold with no hairspray used well into the next day until you wash your hair. The different sized barrels give a range of different looks from soft waves to tight curls. Styling is fast and easy to get comfortable with. I wish I had this iron years ago.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy! Her only complaint is the glove seems really cheap. But she loves the irons!</li>
            <li> I really liked this set. It came with 4 different sized barrels, a glove and a small bottle of argon oil. This thing heats up fast and maintains the heat well. I was actually surprised at myself for not even needing the glove since I was a first timer. I love the curls it creates and I like the fact I can make them faster than expected. I am so glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! The first one I received did not work properly but the seller quickly replaced it. I was extremely impressed with their customer service. The replacement has been working great...exactly what I was looking for. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I just received the wand this week but so far so good!  I love the versatility of multiple barrel sizes.  Gets nice and hot which is key for getting and maintaining curls.</li>
            <li> Works well, but curls dont hold as long as with a remington wand</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  I bought for her as a small gift and she loves doing her hair with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome value and quality for the money. Highly recommend product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect beach wave curling iron for a long time. I found this one that gives me the option to change the curl size with the quick switch of the wand. The curling iron itself is really fast to heat up and easy to use. I like that the screen turns green when ready. The package shipped relatively quickly and arrived in perfect condition. The only con I can think of is that there is no stand of sorts to keep the barrel raised off of a surface. I guess it&#x27;s nice in that theres nothing protruding that would get caught in your hair, but it does worry me for safety reasons. I ended up using the included heat glove to rest it on, since those tend to make my hair frizzy and static-y anyways. It&#x27;s a very minor design flaw that wouldn&#x27;t deter me from ordering it again, but something to consider if you don&#x27;t have a heat-resistant countertop.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Would definitely buy there products... My fiance loved her curler set for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. product sent as advertised. My daughter loves it....she threw away all her other curling irons :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lock completely  :(</li>
            <li> I love my Hsi curling iron set. I have long thick &amp; a lot of hair. I have Hispanic hair. The curls last two days except the bigger one. I get lots of compliments. I like that you have options on sizes of your curls. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I recently got into using wands to curl my hair as it is the hot new trend and so I had previously purchased a conair wand a cone shape. It was a huge disappointment. So decided to purchase this wand as it has so many attachments available. Overall, the product works great. Heats up perfectly and I end up with beautiful bodacious waves. I get so many compliments, it makes me love my hair!</li>
            <li> Products from HSI Professional are truly wonderful. While I am still getting used to these wands with no clamps, I enjoyed the ease it offers in curling my hair. Also the iron heats very fast. The product is exactly as described and with the 4 wands it gives me flexibility for different types of curls.</li>
            <li> I like the HSI flat iron, it works just as well as my last one from Herstyler but half the price! I Also did not know it came with a glove, what a good idea!</li>
            <li> great gift for her, great price for me...</li>
            <li> Great product.. I just wish the glove was a better quality.</li>
            <li> I did research and tried a bunch of different curling irons and this is my favorite. It&#x27;s so easy to change sizes. I travel all the time and I never go anywhere without it. I even bought the other attachments that came with a travel bag to fit all of these and the three of those from HSI.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased a Flat Iron or used one.  I found it very easy to use.  The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was that the temperature knob does not tell you anything except for the high heat and low heat.  You have to guess where your actual setting might lie.  But it was very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. So glad they include the glove because you really need it! So far the quality seems great, and the multiple sizes really make it worth the money.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because i dont think is a perfect product, but is very good quality, the barrels are from very thin to a huge size, my wife likes this product very much, it holds the curls for very long time, and the price was $79.99!!!!!! this item is constantly going up and down, i think i got a very good deal, but if you want to save some money, you can get the  1&amp;#34;inch Tapered Curling Iron and the accessorie set for separate for around $70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only i dont like, it does not come with a clip or anything to hang up while is cooling.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, and works great. I was iffy about buy it but I love it. It even works on my nieceâ€™s hair. We have tried and tried to curl her hair but this product was the only thing that worked on her super straight hair.</li>
            <li> I just received the HSI professional curling iron, I was really satisfy with the item and the seller, the curling iron arrived in excellent conditions within the shipping time establish. I really recommend to buy to this seller. You will be as happy as I am with their products and with their service.</li>
            <li> I received a brand new 1 inch CHI Flat-iron, as a gift, after I&#x27;d already ordered the HSI 1 inch flat iron. My initial plan was to return the HSI iron when it arrived, but after reading all of the reviews and looking at tutorials on You Tube, I decided to try the HSI flat-iron before returning it to the sender. I flat-ironed my hair one day with the CHI iron and the following day with the HSI iron. There was a DEFINITE difference w/the texture of my hair. My hair was much softer after using the HSI iron, than when I used the CHI iron. I would definitely recommend it!  The HSI flat-iron is a definite keeper!</li>
            <li> the iron is good when is not broken ((</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied. I love the four barrels that are included in set. Beauriful loose or tight curls. Im lovin it.</li>
            <li> I personally loved this item it works really great. Holds curl for a long time! Not too expensive very good expense! I would deffenetly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> :Love, Love, Love this curling iron.  Arrived on time and works extremely well.  Disappointed with small Argon oil, but still a great product.</li>
            <li> This worked so well on my fine hair. It also holds up pretty well to the humidity. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> My hair never holds curls, and I had been reviewing curling wands for a while to try to find something that worked for me. I finally decided on this curling wand. And I&#x27;m so glad I did!  Works great. My hair can hold real curls now for two days. I highly suggest this for anyone who has a hard time curling their hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product, it comes with 4 different barrel sizes. It&#x27;s easy to use and interchange the barrels to give you different styles. It heats up quickly and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try different styles. Price was really good and it arrived on time and everything was packaged as seen on the web site.</li>
            <li> This is ok for good waves doesn&#x27;t give good curl definition. Wasn&#x27;t really worth the price but it waves better than the curling iron</li>
            <li> great product it heats up fast and handles difficult hair well- but the glove was useless, It ripped easily. The wands are difficult to change.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use or change barrels.  Gave it away.</li>
            <li> Love it! Awesome and Fast Delivery. Thank you Rochelle Marie with Living Simply Rich</li>
            <li> This curling iron does the job. Heats up really fast and curls my hair really good and nice. And the price is good too.</li>
            <li> I luv luv luv this flat iron and would reccommend this item to anyone!!! Better than a chi. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, and my friend has told me a dozen times over the past year how much she loves it!  Love the interchangeable barrels and overall quality for the money.  Does the job of a much more expensive wand.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used it.  Pushed the on button and it pushed thru.  Did not heat up once.  I waited to long to open the package just barely after the 30 day return and so I cant do nothing about it,  but this thing was destined to break soon.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!! It was great when it actually worked. I had this item for 3 months used it just a few times. I&#x27;ll admit, when I did use it my hair looked amazing and it it&#x27;s super easy to use. But last night in the middle of me doing my hair it just stopped working for no reason. I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything of that sort. It was so upsetting. I&#x27;m only glad amazing is such an amazing company. After I emailed them, they apologized refunded my money, send me a free return label and made this process super easy to return. Only problem is, this company isn&#x27;t Amazon so they can&#x27;t exchange this item. Which I wish they could, because when it worked, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would be the magic product that would keep my hair curled all day, but it&#x27;s not. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it works (although it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some others), and the curls look great right after I&#x27;m done, but they do fall out during the day. I&#x27;ve tried with product, no product leaving it on for longer, but the curls usually soften quite a bit by the time I get to work. I do like the interchangeable barrels, so that I can experiment with different looks. I&#x27;d recommend this, but with the caveat that it&#x27;s not going to do much better than a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, curls even my difficult hair with ease. Love that it comes with protective glove. I read they reviews before purchase and decided on this product based on positive reviews and having used it for a few days now I agree with their views. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this curling iron. So far I have used only the 3/4&amp;#34; of the four. I am very pleased with the results and love the use of the glove to keep my hands from the heat on my hair.</li>
            <li> The HSI curling set is one of the best \\&quot;hair\\&quot; investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time. It heats up quickly and seems to stay hot (I never have to take breaks so it can reheat). I mainly use the two smaller sizes as I prefer tighter curls (and they seem to last longer) but all four create beautiful and distinctly different curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was used to the clamp on my curling iron so once I finally got the hang of using a \\&quot;wand\\&quot; I found I could curl my hair in about 15-20 minutes. Switching the barrels seemed a little tricky at first but I much prefer that to them being loose and/or prone to falling out. I like that you can control the temperature so if your hair curls easily you don&#x27;t have to expose it to extremely high heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little reluctant to purchase because of the price but considering I almost spent $30 on one lower-end curling wand I felt it was an excellent price for what you get!</li>
            <li> The HSI Professional Flat Iron and Argan Oil are amazing products.  I purchased both of these items as recommended, and my hair looks like I just left a salon everytime.  The Argan Oil tames flyaways and leaves my hair silky smooth.  The flat iron straightens my hair with one run through.  I&#x27;ve received compliments on my hair everytime I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this flat iron if you&#x27;re seeking professional quality.  Blue Novelties shipped very quickly and everything was as described.  I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The curling wand is ridiculously fantastic - my hair absolutely will NOT hold a curl with anything else, and this keeps a curl in my hair all day (although of course it relaxes to a wave by the end of the day). But more than that, the customer service was even better. They emailed asking if everything was okay with the order a little while after I received it, and when I responded that one of the barrels didn&#x27;t fit, they sent me a whole new one immediately. Great product and great customer service. I recommend this one to anybody (even us girls with fine hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl).</li>
            <li> Great curling iron set.  I love the four different size barrels to achieve different curling looks.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s awesome&amp;#34;, for whom it was purchased.  She loves the diversity of curl with all 4 barrels. The price was great for me as many other products were higher in price for just 1 sized barrel.  She has mastered it well and has sped up tremendously in her time to curl. Recommended for any aged person who is able to curl their hair safely.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it, likes the different sizes and styles she can do.  Package arrived in a timely matter and had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> Have only had a chance to use it a few times so far, but the curls it makes actually holds in my daughters hair all day!</li>
            <li> I love all the different barrel sizes and the adjustable temperature.  I kind of wish there were two gloves supplies, because I am foreveer putting it on the wrong hand.</li>
            <li> This was the first curling wand I&#x27;ve bought, and I decided on this one after being pleased with the HSI flat iron. I&#x27;m equally pleased with the wand - I recently used it to do several bridesmaids&#x27; hair at a wedding, and it worked well on all different kinds of hair. It heats up really quickly, and the various heat settings are nice. I also love that it has up to 220V since I travel outside of the US quite a bit. It takes some getting used to, especially with the glove, but the results are what I was hoping for when looking for a wand. Plus the price is great!</li>
            <li> Used the product 4 times and already have an error light blinking.  Will have to check online for instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Loved the way it worked, hope it&#x27;s not broken.</li>
            <li> I sent this back.  It was a lot more than I needed.  The main draw back if I&#x27;d have kept the set is that there is not a stand for the iron to rest on when warming.  My old one had  a built on rest that kept the hot iron off my counter.  This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is 4 curling irons for the price of one!  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Thus far I love this product. Heats up quickly. Temperature control is great, allows you to adjust the temperature for your hair type. Various sizes of curl wands are great. Perhaps could have changed two things, 1. Add a tapered curl wand, and 2. Maybe a different glove, it&#x27;s good, but feels rough and creates static in my hair.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in the description that this is for medium or long hair length only.  If you have short hair find another curling iron.  I just wasted $80 for the set.</li>
            <li> Delivered within a week and I use it once a week and it holds my curls (my hair usually doesn&#x27;t keep curls for more than a few hours)</li>
            <li> great products by this company ! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  It made her hair look great.</li>
            <li> This clipless curling iron works wonders.  It creates amazing curls that last all day without any products added to your hair. Highly recommend it in every home for those who want what is new and has the capability to make you stand out!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves it, and she says it works much better than the curling wand that she&#x27;s had. Product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!  Since purchasing the iron, I&#x27;ve been able to clean out the bathroom by getting rid of many of my old irons.  It is perfect to be able to switch the barrel out depending on what style I&#x27;d like to have for the day.  The heat adjustment is easy to operate and the iron warms up quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> HSI product is great.  I have the straightener and it&#x27;s amazing.  I think it&#x27;s ok and giving 3 stars here because I couldn&#x27;t use the wands without burning something. My hair is shoulder length, so I think it makes it harder to use.  If you&#x27;re more daring and better at curling your short hair without a clamp&#x27;s help, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I love the way the curl looks and the different styles I can obtain with it. There is definitely a learning curve to the wand but I was able to pick it up quickly and I am now able to curl my hair as quickly as I did with my old curling iron. I don&#x27;t find it difficult to change out the different size wands as I have read in previous reviews either. You have to put effort into it but I take that as a sign that it is in securely and not loose so it won&#x27;t wear down easily.</li>
            <li> I bought the HSI Professional Curling Iron Set for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves the set.  She uses it every day.  Best choice I could have made for a present for her.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this as a gift. My one complaint, also what ruins the entire thing is the interchangeable wands won&#x27;t stay into place. You basically have to twist the side of the barrel to make sure the wand won&#x27;t fall off while you&#x27;re using it and its locked in place, however the twisty part won&#x27;t move. I cannot use this with a clear conscience because of fear it might fall off any moment.</li>
            <li> I just got this item less than a week ago and curled my hair for work that same day. It was fast and simple to use tho it does get some getting used to in the beginning since im used to the barrel with a clamp. It does come with a heat glove wich is great for me since im so accident prone &#x3D;) The curls came out AMAZING!!! my hair was curled and bouncy all day even tho i brushed them out (because i like the \\&quot;retro hollywood wave\\&quot;). I do use a lot of styling tools so my hair tends to get damaged and the ends tend to feel rough but for some reason not with the HSI curler my hair felt incredibly soft all day and was even able to pass my fingers thru my hair (with LOTS of hair spray in it!!!) Needless to say i am very VERY happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not a proffesional hairstylist, I found this tool as a must for your styling arsenal. Having 4 different size of barrels means you can style from short to long hair and can do from tight to loose curls. Or just creating volume to that flat lengthy hair. I purchased this for styling my daughthers (4 of them)and I love the things that you can do with this tool. The settings are very easy to figure out and the heat is controllable so you can always set the proper heat for any type of hair.It just need a little bit of practice because it doesn&#x27;t have the clip which you can find with some type or brand.Though it comes with a gloves,I suggest get an oven gloves or more heat resistant gloves as the barrel is hot. With the versatilty and price of this tool means you&#x27;ll get the worth of your money.</li>
            <li> Love it! Nice and hot for my thick frizzy hair!  My only complaint is that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; light, or the light that tells you that it is hot, is on the wrong side of the flat iron, in my opinion.  They put it on the heavier side that is usually facing down rather than on the lighter side that is facing up. Otherwise, it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of shopping with Amazon over the last few years, and this by far is the BEST purchase I ever made. I knew I needed a new flat iron so I started looking stores and on other websites. I was going to purchase a Chi from a beauty  website when I decided to check out the selection on Amazon. The first thing that got my attention (besides the price) was the rave 1,000+ reviews for this product. I decided then that my search ended and I was going to purchase the HSI from Blue Novelties. Thank you, thank you, thank you! My hair is long and it can take forever to straighten but with this gorgeous iron, it takes no time at all. Please, do not let the price fool  you, this is a superior quality product and you will not regret your purchase! Thank you so much Blue Novelties &amp; Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Have had this for about a month and I absolutely LOVE IT! I use it everyday. Heats up fast and changing sizes is super simple and easy (haven&#x27;t had one problem). great value for the price.</li>
            <li> This set is wonderful! The versatility is amazing! I love the fact that it can be used internationally! I bought this set before a trip to Australia. Everything worked wonderfully with only an adapter. No need for a converter! Totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist and love this curling wand. Heats up quick, the interchangable barrels are great, it allows me to style all hair types. Feels very stable and solid, great product and an awesome price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair well. Now, with this wand I&#x27;m able to do it quickly and the curls turn out great. The glove that is included works ok to protect the heat, but my fingers still tend to get rather hot when near the iron despite the glove.</li>
            <li> The curling wand is very easy to use and creates a lasting curl. Very happy with my decision to buy!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with it&#x27;s performance. The glove would simply melt when it was holding my hair while I was curling it. The curls would not stay in my hair even before and after hairspray was put in. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone with thick or ethnic hair to purchase this product. This was a total waste of my money!</li>
            <li> this curler is such a great product. it curls nicely last all day and you can change the sizes which is amazing!!! I dont know about the price now. When I purchesed it(June/2012) it was about $50 and now $200? thats just crazy. Great product but the price is way to much.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I have found a product that actually curls my hair... And it STAYS! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. It is a little on the pricey side but worth the money! My hair is thick and no matter how much hair spray nothing ever works! I am so glad I came across this, because you get 4 Barrels and it works amazing! I get compliments all the time and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! The curls stay in my hair for an entire day. Never happened before. I highly recommend this product. One word of advise: it takes some practice to use if you are new to using a wand. The package came with no &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; so you are on your own for that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many flat irons, mostly versions costing under $30. While they may have convenient features, they don&#x27;t last and aren&#x27;t great for my hair. I&#x27;ve only had this HSI for a few days now and so far I love it. It heats up fast and it easy on my hair. I love the oil it comes with, it really helps your hair stay soft and smooth. My hair has a light wave to it and is medium thickness, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to flatten out. When I use this iron my hair stays straight and tame all day even in humidity. The only think I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto-shut off. But other than that, I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great set for the novice or the professional. I wanted a wand set that had a well rounded mix of attachments. The HSI wand set along with the HSI 4 piece accessory kit provided me with just that. And, I got them both for a reasonable price. The tool gets really hot and stays consistently hot. However, due to the positioning of the power switch and my lack of experience using the tool, I did accidentally turn it off a couple of times while using it. The attachments fit snug in the controller. When locking the attachment in, the lock icon does not align with the arrow - don&#x27;t be alarmed, the attachment is still locked on. When removing the attachments they can be a little hard to pull out. After more use that may change. In the meantime, I may add a small amount of lubricant around the base of the attachments to aid with removal.  If I have a gripe with this set, I would have to say it&#x27;s the heat protective glove included in the set. It&#x27;s a one size fits all and not the most comfortable or tailored fit. Nor does it perform as well as I would like in protecting my skin from heat. I did not burn myself, but I could definitely feel the heat.</li>
            <li> I tried all of them and I have to say, as a first timer using wands, I really like these barrels. I decided to get this set because I couldn&#x27;t believe the price and I&#x27;m really glad I got it. My favorite are the middle ones. It heats up within minutes. And if the barrel is not locked in properly, the wand won&#x27;t heat up! I thought that was pretty cool. Also, if you leave it idle for a couple minutes, it automatically turns off, kinda. Awesome, right? It comes with a glove but I personally don&#x27;t use it because it creates frizziness. I did get little burns on my hand so be careful!! I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting to try something new or simply want the beach wave hair style, whatever.</li>
            <li> Love the HSI professional curling iron ! Heats up instantly and gives great results ! It is also very easy to use. I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I have recommended it to all my clients !</li>
            <li> This is freakin amazing!  I don&#x27;t like the look of a curl on me so I use the large barrel all over (found some good youtube tutorials) and then I brush it out for beautifully wavy locks.  I highly recommend!!!  I also like that at the end of the barrel it does have a place to hold onto unlike a lot of other curling wands.</li>
            <li> This is a must have! I was skeptical at first, but now this is my favorite styling tool. I have long hair and using this tool takes me about 30 minutes to curl - but the best part, my hair stays curled all day+!  I&#x27;ve even gone to bed with my hair styled, and woke up with the soft curls still there - took about 5-10 minutes to touch up and the curl held all day.  I highly recommend this tool - it&#x27;s a must have for fast, easy styling that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> i bought this a long-ish time ago. around 2 and a half years. i absolutely loved it. but mine was very hard to change barrels on. i had a medium sized barrel one that couldn&#x27;t change heads, so i just put the largest one on this and didn&#x27;t switch heads ever. but when i really wanted i&#x27;d have my boyfriend switch heads for me. which was not hard for him- so i guess i&#x27;m just really weak.  it&#x27;s no longer working, it might just be me not getting the plate on right. but i love this, absolutely loved it. over 2 years of use and no issue but it being hard to switch plates. and as a professional hair dresser that&#x27;s honestly kind of a plus because you know it&#x27;s not going to fall off or disconnect out ever. which is obviously really important.  i am for sure buying another one ASAP.</li>
            <li> The curls stayed in for three days! Before i purchased the HSI i actually used my friend wand first just to test it out . Using is was soo easy theirs no clamps just twist your hair in it for 5-10 seconds and the curls come out perfect. Hsi heats up fast there 4 different sizes for small or big curls.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: -when changing the barrels it is a bit hard&lt;br /&gt;- the glove is useless..&lt;br /&gt;- i don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve burned my self ...(but that&#x27;s just me lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the HSI is soo WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!  The 4 different barrels allow for many different styles and are very easy to change.  The range of temperature settings are great for all types of hair.  The seller Blue Novelties had great customer service.  The first curling iron that I received had a faulty base, but as soon as they were informed of this they shipped a replacement base at no cost to me.  The second one works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my curling wand! Unfortunately, item does not come with clear instructions. When putting the desired barrel in place, simply match it up inside and twist it into lock mode. Some reviewers have already mentioned it being hard to lock into place. Well it is, but it is manageable. The error message will pop up if you do not have it locked in place. Another thing, make sure when you want to switch the barrel out, do not twist it! I made that mistake and broke it. Luckily for me, their customer service is great and shipped me a replacement right away. Again, do not twist it, just simply pull it out. This wand makes great tight curls as well as nice waves. Get this item. It works better than the wand I bought from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this set for the price! Ive had this set almost 4 months and I love it! heats up fast and curls last all day! Very impressed with this curling want set! also the box it comes in is very cute! I kept it to keep all the pieces stored!</li>
            <li> The very first day i got this product and used it it worked wonders on my hair. I have been through a lot of curling irons and they never seem to keep my hair curly. But with this one i just hold my hair on the wand for like 5 seconds and its a perfect tight curl! I did my friends hair and she just bought one for herself. The curls stayed in her hair for like 3 days !!! Amazing wand !!! I LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> This is a great set and I highly recommend it.  It heats up very quickly and has a good selection of sizes.  The barrels are a little hard to change the first couple of times but it seems to get easier after that.  My hair is very straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well but with this curling iron my hair will still have curl the next day, love it!</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged and it is truly a professional curling wand! Hair comes out great each time and curls last until my next shampoo!</li>
            <li> ONCE THE CURLING IS INSERTED, IT KEEPS COMING OUT WHILE IN USE, IT NEVER LOCKS IN PLACE. I WOULD PREFER ALL THESE SIZES IN THE SET BUT MORE LIKE A CURLING IRON NOT WANDS.</li>
            <li> I love the curls from this iron, but as soon as it heats up to 450 and I begin using it, it starts to drop in temperature. I&#x27;m forced to wait Inbetween curls for it to heat back up again and I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that with a $100 curling iron</li>
            <li> Curls my hair quickly... Heats up within mins and easy to assemble. My curls have a nice shine and I only use hairspray to make them last.</li>
            <li> I got one of these each for my mom and my best friend for Christmas. My mom and I were in the bathroom tring to put the different sizes on. She put the one inch on the fitting and it worked fine.... For a week then it read err in red every time she tries to use it . So I went to look at the instructions and she was doing everything right. My best friend wand never worked correctly it just read err also. Needless to say a waste of time and money. For an expensive wand I thought it would at least work for a year.Next time I&#x27;ll just go with nume or conair.</li>
            <li> I have terrible frizzy hair.  I finally decided that I needed a professional flat iron vs the drug store buy. I have seen a dramatic change in my hair. It&#x27;s smooth, soft &amp; holds its style. I would recommend this flat iron. Thousand times over.</li>
            <li> I really do love this set. I was about to purchase two separate curling iron sizes when I saw that sets like this one were available. It&#x27;s well worth the cost in my opinion. I&#x27;ve only had a few chances to play around with it but I really am liking it. The thing that stuck out to me the most was that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; when I curl it at a higher temperate (I have very fine hair but a lot of it!) Additionally, I noticed that the curls stay AMAZINGLY well! I curled my hair with the largest iron size and when I brushed my hair out at the end of the night it still had the curl/wave to it even after brushing. I&#x27;m very impressed with this set. The wands click in easily and are easy to switch out. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairstyling tool I have experienced in a long time....... I love the various sizes of the barrels!!!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is in her mid-20&#x27;s as a birthday gift. She actually found it on Amazon &amp; asked for it. It is a quality curling iron complete with different sized barrels &amp; heat glove. This product gave her hair a professional curl that lasted through the entire day, the next morning, she still had a decent amount of curl left.  I am happy that she is so pleased with the curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived promptly, packaged nicely and even though the heat glove was missing, no fault of Blue Novelties, it was included but unfortunately was misplaced in transit, I contacted Blue Novelties &amp; they were very prompt &amp; considerate &amp; quickly sent to me a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product and the experience of dealing with this company. I highly recommend Blue Novelties and HSI Professional Curling Iron set.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Easy to use ! Leaves your hair  you so soft n straight, plus you can add a curl  fast easy to if you&#x27;d like!</li>
            <li> Really like the versatility of this product. It can be a little difficult to change the barrel.  Heats up quickly and I like the digital temp reading.  On/off button a little small.  Delivered in good time frame.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for our granddaughter. She was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Well made, versatile, heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recommendation from a friend who had it and I absolutely love it! The seller was fast and product came just as described if not exceeded expectations. Will be buying from them in the future as I still want the Hsi straightening iron. Don&#x27;t hesitate! You&#x27;ll love this purchase. Great brand, curls come out beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product! Love it!!</li>
            <li> The barrels don&#x27;t go in very easily, the bigger barrel broken within weeks for this reason. Very cheaply made, would not recommend. Save your money and get something that&#x27;s a better quality.</li>
