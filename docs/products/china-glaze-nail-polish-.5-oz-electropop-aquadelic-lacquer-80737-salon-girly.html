            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this polish.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast&amp;all, but the color isn&#x27;t as bright as on screen.</li>
            <li>Bright side?</li>
            <li>So this isn&#x27;t as bright as the picture.</li>
            <li>bright , I do nails at work</li>
            <li>The color is springy, but not too bright or neon.</li>
            <li>Not as bright at the picture as others have said.  </li>
            <li>The color by itself is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>and i was good to go.</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s a great polish and very smooth, it&#x27;s just not the color</li>
            <li>this polish goes on very smoothly and the color is really great.  </li>

            <li>Since I love blue/turquoise colors, I looked on Essie, however I noticed their colors are not as bright</li>

            <li>Paints on smooth &amp; looks great.</li>
            <li>what kind of nonsense is that?  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this color when I ordered it, it is great, I  love it.</li>
            <li>She picked out another color, and I added this one on my own.  </li>
            <li>Matches nicely with a coral accent color.</li>
            <li>She says that is goes on smoothly and is very nice.</li>
            <li>Luckily Im a nail polish addict and can be happy with any color.</li>
            <li>and I love the matte finish! :)</li>
            <li>I ordered the China Glaze Aquadelic which looked like a beautiful bright blue in the picture</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, color is beautiful, wore for my bday week, many likes.</li>
            <li>so it was okay,</li>
            <li>But it could be better.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite nail polish color for the summer.</li>
            <li>Love China Glaze</li>
            <li>10 more words required?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright and just a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this color.  </li>
            <li>finished with a top coat</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite nail polish ever.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>Cute name too :)</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>then I thought it would be not like the picture that is for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more products from this company</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS COLOR</li>
            <li>Love China Glaze polish.</li>
            <li>but it looks pretty good after two coats.</li>
            <li>This color is so much fun!!  </li>
            <li>The polish looks great when you top it with a top coat that has a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look, it just takes longer to go through multiple steps to achieve a shiny look.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love everything about this nail polish, the color is fabulous and it lasts for weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>(which is fantastic, BTW) Loving this color layered under China Glaze &amp;#34;Luxe and Lush&amp;#34; right now.</li>
            <li>Product arrived before the promised delivery date, so overall I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; vendor.</li>
            <li>when i got the nail polish i was excited because it came so quickly!</li>
            <li>Love this color so vibrant &amp; I also love that it has a kinda matte finish to it.</li>
            <li>So although they are excellent for other purposes like making artistic pictures on my nails, they are not for a quick one coat manicure.</li>
            <li>great colors and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>The color is the same as the picture too which is nice. :)</li>
            <li>(In my photo, I had to use a nail art brush to clean it up.)</li>
            <li>While I love the color, I have to top it with a glossy or \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; top coat.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment, just as described.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color and</li>
            <li>The seller saw my feedback and contacted me directly by phone, and she seemed genuinely concerned and was very understanding and extremely nice.</li>
            <li>When i got it, it looked more of a mint green in the bottle, but once you put it on, its a pretty bright aqua-ish/mint-ish.</li>
            <li>Overall, the color is nice</li>
            <li>Its not the same color as the picture, its nice but not as pretty.</li>
            <li>Looks great with a little sparkle topcoat!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this fun color!</li>
            <li>but it is actually less bright.</li>
            <li>Product was shipped and delivered super fast.</li>
            <li>China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish because its super shiny so you don&#x27;t need a top coat, and makes my nails hard.</li>
            <li>Its better if you put a white coat on first.</li>
            <li>this is probably the first bottle ive never given 5 stars for.</li>
            <li>Its so pretty.</li>
            <li>I thought this color was going to be exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>i love china glaze nail polish and will continue to use it on a regular basis....</li>
            <li>when i looked at the color my first thought is it looked a lot like the color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost an exact dupe for China Glaze&#x27;s For Audrey, so</li>
            <li>The color is pretty</li>
            <li>This color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the color is pretty.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I don&#x27;t really want to take the extra time to use a top coat.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>The color looks pretty much like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>Judging the bottle it does look dull, but its a really pretty bright aqua</li>
            <li>Finding a Tiffany blue color isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>but like all the china glaze polish it clumps when adding more than one layer, almost like it tries to pull up the first layer</li>
            <li>this color is so vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>I felt it might be too much on my hands for someone my age.</li>
            <li>it looks like a light blue in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Came fast and no damage.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves the Aquadelic nail polish by China Glaze.</li>
            <li>This product came on time and was exactly the color it looks like in the picture and the bottle was brand new &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this polish!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very pretty blue.</li>
            <li>I had some high hopes for this</li>
            <li>love this color and how long it last on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a sea foam green color.</li>
            <li>Its not as seafoam green as i thought it would be, but thats okay.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase OPI nail polish, but thought I would try this brand since I know that the nail salons around here use it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and quality is just like any of the other China Glaze nail polishes.</li>
            <li>shipping was prompt as usual but iwwas expecting more of an aqua neon.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty different aqua color.</li>
            <li>It came early!</li>
            <li>It does dry a little darker and then it fades into a nice bluebird egg color.</li>
            <li>Its a little more blue than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>I saw the other comments on this color saying that its dull and not as bright</li>
            <li>Glaze nail polish does dry to a matte finish that looks somewhat dull, but it lasts so long that it&#x27;s worth it just to finish with a shiny top coat.</li>
            <li>The color advertised is a bright turquoise and the color I received in the mail in a dull green.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never said this before, but this is a fast dry polish that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Love the color, appears to be watered down a little bit.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty thick and lasts a decent amount of time.</li>

            <li> Its not as seafoam green as i thought it would be, but thats okay.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase OPI nail polish, but thought I would try this brand since I know that the nail salons around here use it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and quality is just like any of the other China Glaze nail polishes.</li>
            <li> shipping was prompt as usual but iwwas expecting more of an aqua neon.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty different aqua color.</li>
            <li> It came early!</li>
            <li> It does dry a little darker and then it fades into a nice bluebird egg color.</li>
            <li> Its a little more blue than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I saw the other comments on this color saying that its dull and not as bright</li>
            <li> Glaze nail polish does dry to a matte finish that looks somewhat dull, but it lasts so long that it&#x27;s worth it just to finish with a shiny top coat.</li>
            <li> The color advertised is a bright turquoise and the color I received in the mail in a dull green.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never said this before, but this is a fast dry polish that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Love the color, appears to be watered down a little bit.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty thick and lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Honestly I had left bad feedback for this prouduct previously and wanted to return it because I judged the color from the bottle without really giving it a chance.</li>
            <li> When looking at the bottle, the color looks dull at first.  </li>
            <li> Actual color is not nearly as vibrant as the picture appears.</li>
            <li> I expected some color totally different</li>
            <li> flatter than i expected.</li>
            <li> Especially when I do my thumb, it looks uneven and unprofessional.</li>
            <li> but when I got it, it looked like a faded blue green color, nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> Arrived three days before I expected it.</li>
            <li> I was expected</li>
            <li> you have to do a few coats and the color will definitely pop</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty streaky and weird</li>
            <li> I guess that is what china glaze is though because I have a few other bottles in other colors from this brand</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t understand the \\&quot;matte\\&quot; problems other people are having because mine went on shiny and dried shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it, but it&#x27;s really not helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than  mint but lighter than turquoise.</li>
            <li> the color is a little darker than the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> When i try to fix something, it makes the polish uneven.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost green when I put it on...</li>
            <li> i got the mint green one as well</li>
            <li> So I will be saving these for a time when I want to do a full out manicure, It&#x27;s not that this is a bad choice or that the polish is not a good polish.</li>
            <li> The color is a little darker and dustier than the swatches I&#x27;ve seen online, but I think this might just be a color that&#x27;s hard to photograph.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not as green as it appears!</li>
            <li> then what I got and am not pleased at all...</li>
            <li> One thick coat is all i needed and it doesnt chip.</li>
            <li> Overall Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was HIGHLY disappointed with how dark this color was.</li>
            <li> I sent an order for this color and received &amp;#34;pink voltage&amp;#34;, and now, unfortunately, cannot return it.</li>
            <li> I realized I was wrong about the color.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. :(</li>
            <li> I was expecting a neon aqua color like in the picture :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> the shipping was fast&amp;all, but the color isn&#x27;t as bright as on screen. so it was okay, no chipping though! Bright side?</li>
            <li> So this isn&#x27;t as bright as the picture. I&#x27;ll use it anyway I guess. Its better if you put a white coat on first. But it could be better.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite nail polish color for the summer. It goes on pretty thick and lasts a decent amount of time. Everytime I wear it, I get TONS of compliments on the color!</li>
            <li> Great color for summer&lt;br /&gt;Very bright , I do nails at work I would definitely recommend this color to anyone that likes the shade of blue , just make sure you add a white polish base underneath to get that pop! :)</li>
            <li> too closely coloured to \\&quot;for audrey\\&quot;. shipping was prompt as usual but iwwas expecting more of an aqua neon. something way brighter and popping. something to catch the. flatter than i expected. this is probably the first bottle ive never given 5 stars for.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Its so pretty. The color is the same as the picture too which is nice. :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful summer color that make your nails pop, it&#x27;s not as green as it appears! Lots of compliments with this one! I would highly recommend this fun color!</li>
            <li> Actual color is not nearly as vibrant as the picture appears.</li>
            <li> This is a great color!</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty different aqua color. OPI is always great polish &amp; this color is another good one!</li>
            <li> I thought this color was going to be exactly like the picture but it is actually less bright. Didnt think I was going to like it but it looks pretty good after two coats.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, just as described.  Love China Glaze and this color is great!  Looks great with a little sparkle topcoat!</li>
            <li> Very pretty color and China Glaze is a good brand!! 10 more words required?  what kind of nonsense is that?  lol</li>
            <li> Product was shipped and delivered super fast. I received it Dec.31, well ahead of the estimated Jan 2-7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very pretty blue. Goes on smoothly and quality is just like any of the other China Glaze nail polishes. (which is fantastic, BTW) Loving this color layered under China Glaze &amp;#34;Luxe and Lush&amp;#34; right now.</li>
            <li> I expected some color totally different then what I got and am not pleased at all... Luckily Im a nail polish addict and can be happy with any color. I just wish it was what I was looking for. Overall Disappointed.</li>
            <li> i love china glaze nail polish and will continue to use it on a regular basis....great colors and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This color is so much fun!!  My Mom, sisters and nieces all want to buy it now.  It&#x27;s so bright and just a lot of fun.  I only put it on my toes.  I felt it might be too much on my hands for someone my age.</li>
            <li> Review on China Glaze For Audrey:&lt;br /&gt;I used to be big on China Glaze, until I went to Essie. Since I love blue/turquoise colors, I looked on Essie, however I noticed their colors are not as bright so I went to China Glaze. The color by itself is gorgeous. It&#x27;s a little darker than  mint but lighter than turquoise. I had some high hopes for this, however when I began applying, I had some problems with the formula. It&#x27;s pretty streaky and weird so you have to put a lot on.. I&#x27;ve never said this before, but this is a fast dry polish that I don&#x27;t like. When i try to fix something, it makes the polish uneven. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it, but it&#x27;s really not helpful. Besides that, my biggest problem was the brush. Maybe I&#x27;m used to the Essie, but the brush is much smaller. Especially when I do my thumb, it looks uneven and unprofessional. (In my photo, I had to use a nail art brush to clean it up.) Overall, the color is nice but since I had some problems with it, I will be going back to Essie.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this color.  China Glaze needs to make this one of their permanent summer colors.</li>
            <li> I was HIGHLY disappointed with how dark this color was. It looks a LOT like For Audrey by CG. I was expecting a summery aqua blue and this is not it. The formula is great though. It&#x27;s found a home in my collection but it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. :(</li>
            <li> love this color and how long it last on.</li>
            <li> I ordered the China Glaze Aquadelic which looked like a beautiful bright blue in the picture but when I got it, it looked like a faded blue green color, nothing like the picture. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great! It came early! (1 week) the color is a little darker than the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> when i got the nail polish i was excited because it came so quickly! when i looked at the color my first thought is it looked a lot like the color china glaze has called \\&quot;for audrey\\&quot; i was worried because i already have \\&quot;for audrey\\&quot;... but when i actually put it on my nail the color popped! just looking at the color from the outside of the bottle doesn&#x27;t give it justice. this color is so vibrant and pretty. i don&#x27;t understand the \\&quot;matte\\&quot; problems other people are having because mine went on shiny and dried shiny. finished with a top coat and i was good to go. if you like bright, cute colors then i would definitely add this to your collection!</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite nail polish ever. The color is great and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a neon aqua color like in the picture :( dissapointed</li>
            <li> I love this color it looks like a light blue in the bottle. I used it on my friend and she loves it. It&#x27;s more of a sea foam green color. It came in the mail pretty fast too. I ordered it on December 26th and recieved it on December 31. Was supposed to get here on January 2nd-January 7th. I will Definitely be buying another when I run out!</li>
            <li> I love this color! Its a little more blue than the picture shows. Its not as seafoam green as i thought it would be, but thats okay. Its a great color nonetheless!</li>
            <li> Great color, stays on for long-time wear.</li>
            <li> Like one of the reviews say it&#x27;s nothing like the picture, but I do like it a great spring color</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this color when I ordered it, it is great, I  love it. I have gotten tons of compliments on it</li>
            <li> I sent an order for this color and received &amp;#34;pink voltage&amp;#34;, and now, unfortunately, cannot return it. Not too happy about that.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, color is beautiful, wore for my bday week, many likes.</li>
            <li> Love this color so vibrant &amp; I also love that it has a kinda matte finish to it. Cute name too :)</li>
            <li> Finding a Tiffany blue color isn&#x27;t easy.  China glaze has done it!  I love this color it&#x27;s great for any season and occasion.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Arrived three days before I expected it. I ordered the color Aquadelice from the Electropop collection. The color is a little darker and dustier than the swatches I&#x27;ve seen online, but I think this might just be a color that&#x27;s hard to photograph. It&#x27;s almost an exact dupe for China Glaze&#x27;s For Audrey, so if you have that one already, you don&#x27;t NEED this one. The formula&#x27;s great; it&#x27;s almost a one-coat creme. I&#x27;m happy with this polish. It&#x27;ll fit great on my collection.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty but like all the china glaze polish it clumps when adding more than one layer, almost like it tries to pull up the first layer so you get flesh tone gaps.</li>
            <li> Thought this was going to be a lot brighter...it&#x27;s almost green when I put it on...although it&#x27;s a great polish and very smooth, it&#x27;s just not the color I was expected</li>
            <li> I like the color a lot but it is darker then I thought it would be not like the picture that is for sure.</li>
            <li> China Glaze ElectroPop Aquadelic nail polish I received in the mail is not the same color as advertised on Amazon or China Glaze website.  The color advertised is a bright turquoise and the color I received in the mail in a dull green.  Will be returning this polish since it&#x27;s not the color I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> I thought glaze meant shiny, so when I got this nail polish I was dismayed to find it a matte finish, not a shiny polish. While I love the color, I have to top it with a glossy or \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; top coat. Sometimes I don&#x27;t really want to take the extra time to use a top coat. So I will be saving these for a time when I want to do a full out manicure, It&#x27;s not that this is a bad choice or that the polish is not a good polish. I think it should say somewhere on the label or in the description that it is a matte finish. Don&#x27;t call it glaze, or even polish as those names to me connote a shiny product.  I guess that is what china glaze is though because I have a few other bottles in other colors from this brand and they&#x27;re all matte finish. So although they are excellent for other purposes like making artistic pictures on my nails, they are not for a quick one coat manicure. The polish looks great when you top it with a top coat that has a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look, it just takes longer to go through multiple steps to achieve a shiny look.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the color.  She picked out another color, and I added this one on my own.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This product came on time and was exactly the color it looks like in the picture and the bottle was brand new &amp;#60;3 I will be ordering more products from this company no questions asked...</li>
            <li> I normally purchase OPI nail polish, but thought I would try this brand since I know that the nail salons around here use it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this polish! The color is springy, but not too bright or neon. 2 coats lasted about a week before I needed to re-do it.</li>
            <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s like a creamy turquoise. China Glaze nail polish does dry to a matte finish that looks somewhat dull, but it lasts so long that it&#x27;s worth it just to finish with a shiny top coat. Product arrived before the promised delivery date, so overall I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; vendor.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS COLOR</li>
            <li> Honestly I had left bad feedback for this prouduct previously and wanted to return it because I judged the color from the bottle without really giving it a chance. But, after using the polish on my nails I realized I was wrong about the color. The polish looks completely different on, as do a lot of polishes. I saw the other comments on this color saying that its dull and not as bright but it might be because they didn&#x27;t try it on. Judging the bottle it does look dull, but its a really pretty bright aqua once you put it on I promise! The seller saw my feedback and contacted me directly by phone, and she seemed genuinely concerned and was very understanding and extremely nice. China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish because its super shiny so you don&#x27;t need a top coat, and makes my nails hard. One thick coat is all i needed and it doesnt chip.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love everything about this nail polish, the color is fabulous and it lasts for weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This color is awesome although not as bright as the picture depicts. It does dry a little darker and then it fades into a nice bluebird egg color. Matches nicely with a coral accent color.</li>
            <li> The color looks pretty much like it does in the picture. When i got it, it looked more of a mint green in the bottle, but once you put it on, its a pretty bright aqua-ish/mint-ish. perfect for summer</li>
            <li> Not as bright at the picture as others have said.  When looking at the bottle, the color looks dull at first.  But when I painted it on my nails it was a brighter color similar to the pic!  NOTE: you have to do a few coats and the color will definitely pop</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying this again! It&#x27;s an absolutely perfect color for summer and I love the matte finish! :)</li>
            <li> This color is so pretty. Paints on smooth &amp; looks great. Would recommend this color to anyone. Love China Glaze polish.</li>
            <li> Love the color, appears to be watered down a little bit. Otherwise the color is pretty. Came fast and no damage.</li>
            <li> Its not the same color as the picture, its nice but not as pretty. But i guess thatll happen on here,</li>
            <li> Must give this an awesome rating, product came within 2 days of orderig it &amp; the polish is a beautiful color, kind of like the Tiffany &amp;Co color . Will buy more !</li>
            <li> this polish goes on very smoothly and the color is really great.  i got the mint green one as well</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves the Aquadelic nail polish by China Glaze. She says that is goes on smoothly and is very nice.</li>
