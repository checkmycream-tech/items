    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>the quality is excellent</li>
            <li>so I give her to test it and said is very good</li>
            <li>But she always looks beautiful, so maybe I&#x27;m biased.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the needles scare you away from a great product.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend tried this out and it made her look great.</li>
            <li>Item was as described, works great</li>
            <li>so I know its good to use.</li>
            <li>A good friend of mine stopped by this morning.</li>
            <li>But if you have a good pain tolerance, then you might get the results that you want from this.</li>
            <li>This roller arrived in good condition and meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I always said to people that it wouldn&#x27;t be fair if I started getting wrinkles while I still had an oily face and acne</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Nice to see that it comes in a plastic pouch and that the pouch was still airtight</li>
            <li>It has a handy plastic storage case.  </li>
            <li>Never in my life has my skin looked more healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li>It is a great addition to my skin care regiment, I am already seeing improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li>and I am not too sure on using it if you are still getting stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Ok, ladies-</li>
            <li>but my face does look much more refreshed.</li>
            <li>however I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for some reason</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my problem areas on my face have been looking better since using this.</li>
            <li>I use Vitamin C Serum afterwards, which absorbs better because of the rolling first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps boost collagen production to heal them and allows for better absorption of your serums, oils, and creams.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend thinks I look better after using the derma roller.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice for acne scarring and found it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>the redness and spots went away very quickly for me.</li>
            <li>I have fine lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>Using it for under eye tightening  and lightly around face for prevention and rejuvenation of the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite beauty tool!  </li>
            <li>Its intriguing!</li>
            <li>she clean it and always look like it just get out of the box.</li>
            <li>But, any positive results would make it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>The right cord on my neck had flattened out!</li>
            <li>Just keep everything clean and sanitized and follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>Great little Derma roller.</li>
            <li>but if you are working out or gaining weight dermabrasion doesn&#x27;t work as well on fresh stretch marks.</li>
            <li>The product is very well packaged and comes with a nice clear plastic container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying using it and love the sensation of the object (not too sharp).</li>
            <li>I did remember, that I rolled horizontally on my right side.</li>
            <li>After having acne most of my life, I am always looking for something to help the scars it left me.</li>
            <li>And hey, so long as she thinks I look better, she&#x27;ll stay with me.</li>
            <li>It really makes it easy to clean and put in the case when I am done rolling, which only takes about 5 minutes to complete my face, not a lot of time for a lot of results.</li>
            <li>I will normally use this then afterwards use a toner or vitamin C serum right after.</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice little storage case.</li>
            <li>so excited about the soft line removal and new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Really affordable price too, would recommend.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the .05 mm one for some reason, even though the needles are longer.</li>
            <li>Was really hoping it would work.</li>
            <li>I chose this titanium roller over the stainless steel one due to the strength is better with titanium and the needles will stay sharper longer.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell the full effect as it has only been four days</li>
            <li>This derma roller with it&#x27;s titanium needles is  of much better quality than the 192 roller I had previously purchased.  </li>
            <li>Quick, simple to use, rejuvenates my skin.  </li>
            <li>But I mainly purchased this for stretch marks I got from a growth spurt and to prevent wrinkles before I get them.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older scars aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; anymore (well my nephew still thinks they are).</li>
            <li>Needles are uniform and high quality.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is a snap: first in hot sudsy water, alcohol bath, then air dry before putting it away in its convenient storage case.</li>
            <li>I really do see great improvement over the last month in the wrinkles especially with the less deep set ones.</li>
            <li>It does leave the skin feeling alive and vibrant but I cannot say anything else</li>
            <li>I am a very young looking 62.</li>
            <li>it hurts just a tiny bit if you press too hard,but it really does work!</li>
            <li>product is little and easy to use, like the holding case.</li>
            <li>derma roller has been helpful for rejuvenating my skin, exfoliation, and helping to smooth wrinkles and previous acne damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used plenty of topical skin treatments in the past that haven&#x27;t been as effective as this item.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;m not using it right or enough, maybe I just expect miracles, but I am not really seeing any significant results, but I will keep using it and keep trying, which is why I am rating it rather low</li>
            <li>I use this not as much as I probably should, but the little needles seem to make my skin thicker and more dry.</li>
            <li>I had clear skin up till my 20&#x27;s and then started dealing with adult acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it for for four days so far.</li>
            <li>and she wants to go to the next level.  </li>
            <li>had an old eye makeup remover pad container that I poured isopropyl alcohol into to dip this in for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin had tightened up almost immediately after use (in the evening) and then was soft again by morning.  </li>
            <li>There was a natural radiance about her.</li>
            <li>I was able to pierce the skin with one firm push, which I did several times.</li>
            <li>I also find this to be a little time consuming, but in the long run I will keep using it as my skin seems to be looking a lit bit better.</li>
            <li>With the exception of the softened and flat cord I really don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>It was likIe a miracle, except the left cord was exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I think it is too early to see results because I have only used it once.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared a first thinking anything with a lot of needles on it rolling over my skin would hurt ALOT.</li>
            <li>started using the new roller last night and as scary as it looks, it was fine.  </li>

            <li> The only women that did not see results were ones that didn&#x27;t use long enough needles and pressure.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if speak for if they really work on your skin or not.  </li>
            <li> Well, I got needles long enough, but, was timid with the pressure.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the science behind it if it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of purchasing another roller as the first one just didn&#x27;t stay sharp; however, I really wanted to find one that would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about a month and see absolutely no change in my face.</li>
            <li> It said you start seeing results in about 4-6 weeks because that&#x27;s how long it takes for your skin to heal so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short sharp needles didn&#x27;t hurt, just tingled my skin.  </li>
            <li> little weird, ok i guess</li>
            <li> The only thing that I can say about this derma roller is that it is painful to use and that was why I never used it more than once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be trying it out on a few scars on my legs next and will give the results later.</li>
            <li> Not only have my scars become less apparent, but I also had some dark pigmentation spots on my face since I used birth control pills, and even that has lightened quite a bit.</li>
            <li> When I used it it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, and you get little tiny bit of blood at the surface.  </li>
            <li> Shipment was damaged (crushed).  </li>
            <li> I’m 56 now, but only quit having acne a few years ago.</li>
            <li> &quot; She went on to tell me how pink my cheeks were and that I was glowing!</li>
            <li> Small enough to use on the face without any problems maneuvering it.</li>
            <li> For me, the process itself is very uncomfortable but the results are well worth it!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price to return.</li>
            <li> After we sat down for coffee, she said.</li>
            <li> I had little blood marks where the sharp needles must&#x27;ve slightly punctured my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe a slight tingle</li>
            <li> This little needle-like contraption hurts.</li>
            <li> Just little specks but</li>
            <li> I just received it and started using it a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am impatient.</li>
            <li> I started using a few days ago I am a semi-reformed tom boy...</li>
            <li> But, the forest thru the trees syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;After, that I am anxious to use the roller again.</li>
            <li> But, the forest thru the trees syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;After, that I am anxious to use the roller again.</li>
            <li> The roller comes in a sealed plastic sleeve, and a hard plastic case and was not damaged.  </li>
            <li> This is really hard to use, it hurts</li>
            <li> If you press to hard into the skin then it does hurt.</li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;Probably, should give it a couple of weeks at least to see any results.</li>
            <li> Its going to be painful if you do it properly</li>
            <li> My age shows the worst on the two cords going down the center of my neck.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I will be recommending it like crazy to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> It is not as painful depending on area being used.</li>

            <li> I use this not as much as I probably should, but the little needles seem to make my skin thicker and more dry. I do apply cream now that I seen that the Derma Roller needs to have some type of moisturizing equivalent. I also find this to be a little time consuming, but in the long run I will keep using it as my skin seems to be looking a lit bit better.</li>
            <li> Shipment was damaged (crushed).  Item box was damaged, but I opened it anyways.  The roller comes in a sealed plastic sleeve, and a hard plastic case and was not damaged.  It seems like the plastic case it comes with saved the roller.  Nice to see that it comes in a plastic pouch and that the pouch was still airtight so I know its good to use.</li>
            <li> I just received it and started using it a few days ago. It does leave the skin feeling alive and vibrant but I cannot say anything else yet.&lt;br /&gt;Probably, should give it a couple of weeks at least to see any results. Will try and remember to come back and update this review after a while.</li>

            <li> Quick, simple to use, rejuvenates my skin.  It&#x27;s my new favorite beauty tool!  I use in addition to my daily regimen.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about a month and see absolutely no change in my face. It hurts to use and there is no benefit that I can see.</li>
            <li> Have been using this when I can. Its going to be painful if you do it properly and I am not too sure on using it if you are still getting stretch marks. Definitely will work post pregnancy but if you are working out or gaining weight dermabrasion doesn&#x27;t work as well on fresh stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Since, this item takes time to work, I am writing a diary. This is for days 1,2,3, and 4. I am a very young looking 62. I have fine lines around my mouth and eyes. My age shows the worst on the two cords going down the center of my neck. The product is very well packaged and comes with a nice clear plastic container. I cleaned my face and neck, then used Cosmedica&#x27;s  Vit. C toner and their hyraluranic acid before using the roller. Ok, ladies- it hurts. But, any positive results would make it worthwhile. My face turned red and it felt like a sunburn. It passes in no time. On day two, I remembered a review saying. The only women that did not see results were ones that didn&#x27;t use long enough needles and pressure. Well, I got needles long enough, but, was timid with the pressure. On Day 2 I was diligent. It hurt like heck. The areas that I could not roll on- I was able to pierce the skin with one firm push, which I did several times. Even around my eyes, I would pull the skin towards my brow bone to apply the pressure. I finished with spraying the Vit C.to sooth my skin. I washed later that night and again used the products from Cosmedica and my regular creams.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 upon seeing myself in the mirror I was shocked. The right cord on my neck had flattened out! I was in awe! It was likIe a miracle, except the left cord was exactly the same. I did remember, that I rolled horizontally on my right side. But, my skin was tender, so, I decided to wait a day or two. It is now day 4. Tonight I roll. Will update!&lt;br /&gt;Day #5&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have the time to roll last night. However, I do have something to note. With the exception of the softened and flat cord I really don&#x27;t notice any difference. Yes, I am impatient. A good friend of mine stopped by this morning. I had not even washed my face yet. After we sat down for coffee, she said. \\&quot;What are you using? It looks so natural?\\&quot;  I said, \\&quot;What? Nothing. I haven&#x27;t even washed my face yet!\\&quot; She went on to tell me how pink my cheeks were and that I was glowing! I didn&#x27;t see it. But, the forest thru the trees syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;After, that I am anxious to use the roller again. Keep fingers crossed!ks were and that I was glowing! I didn&#x27;t see it. But, the forest thru the trees syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;After, that I am anxious to use the roller again. Keep fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> I had clear skin up till my 20&#x27;s and then started dealing with adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The derma roller has been helpful for rejuvenating my skin, exfoliation, and helping to smooth wrinkles and previous acne damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used plenty of topical skin treatments in the past that haven&#x27;t been as effective as this item.</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;m not using it right or enough, maybe I just expect miracles, but I am not really seeing any significant results, but I will keep using it and keep trying, which is why I am rating it rather low</li>
            <li> Used it for for four days so far. It is not as painful depending on area being used. Redness that comes out disappears in about an hour don&#x27;t know if it would be the same for others. Using it for under eye tightening  and lightly around face for prevention and rejuvenation of the skin. Can&#x27;t tell the full effect as it has only been four days but my face does look much more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Its intriguing! I&#x27;m enjoying using it and love the sensation of the object (not too sharp). Really affordable price too, would recommend.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable and i returned it.</li>
            <li> my daughter have been using them and her skin is showing improvement however I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for some reason I was it hurt so I give her to test it and said is very good and she wants to go to the next level.  the quality is excellent she clean it and always look like it just get out of the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so I&#x27;m not sure if speak for if they really work on your skin or not.  The only thing that I can say about this derma roller is that it is painful to use and that was why I never used it more than once.  But if you have a good pain tolerance, then you might get the results that you want from this.</li>
            <li> little weird, ok i guess</li>
            <li> This is really hard to use, it hurts but I think that&#x27;s what it suppost to do</li>
            <li> This roller arrived in good condition and meets my expectations.  It has a handy plastic storage case.  Needles are uniform and high quality.  I have used it twice for acne scarring and found it easy to use.  No visible results yet, but I am hopeful that I will see improvement in time.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared a first thinking anything with a lot of needles on it rolling over my skin would hurt ALOT. Didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Just a tingling sensation where you roll it.If you press to hard into the skin then it does hurt. I&#x27;ve noticed that my problem areas on my face have been looking better since using this.I&#x27;m going to be trying it out on a few scars on my legs next and will give the results later. I will normally use this then afterwards use a toner or vitamin C serum right after. The combination has been working for me. I&#x27;d recommend buying one and giving it a try. Don&#x27;t let the needles scare you away from a great product. Will be recommending this to family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> I chose this titanium roller over the stainless steel one due to the strength is better with titanium and the needles will stay sharper longer.  For me, the process itself is very uncomfortable but the results are well worth it!  Never in my life has my skin looked more healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the .05 mm one for some reason, even though the needles are longer. Hopefully it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
            <li> After having acne most of my life, I am always looking for something to help the scars it left me. I’m 56 now, but only quit having acne a few years ago. I always said to people that it wouldn&#x27;t be fair if I started getting wrinkles while I still had an oily face and acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed that in just a couple of days, my skin tone had already started to improve. Not only have my scars become less apparent, but I also had some dark pigmentation spots on my face since I used birth control pills, and even that has lightened quite a bit. I use Vitamin C Serum afterwards, which absorbs better because of the rolling first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an old eye makeup remover pad container that I poured isopropyl alcohol into to dip this in for cleaning. It really makes it easy to clean and put in the case when I am done rolling, which only takes about 5 minutes to complete my face, not a lot of time for a lot of results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results this product has on my skin. Im so excited about the soft line removal and new hair growth.</li>
            <li> This little needle-like contraption hurts. I had little blood marks where the sharp needles must&#x27;ve slightly punctured my skin. Not worth the price to return. Was really hoping it would work. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I think it is too early to see results because I have only used it once. But I mainly purchased this for stretch marks I got from a growth spurt and to prevent wrinkles before I get them.  When I used it it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, and you get little tiny bit of blood at the surface.  Just little specks but the redness and spots went away very quickly for me. I noticed my skin had tightened up almost immediately after use (in the evening) and then was soft again by morning.  It said you start seeing results in about 4-6 weeks because that&#x27;s how long it takes for your skin to heal so don&#x27;t expect immediate results. But I will continue to use this in hopes it works.  I like the idea of the science behind it if it&#x27;s true.  Just keep everything clean and sanitized and follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> I used this for post acne scars and it works.  I used it with copper serum and hyralauric acid.  My face looks smoother!  I will use every 1 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> I started using a few days ago I am a semi-reformed tom boy... So of course I have scars from my feet up. Now that I&#x27;m older scars aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; anymore (well my nephew still thinks they are). When I saw this product I said finally an at home product alternative for those pricey dermatologist procedures. This product helps with scars from injury and acne of which I have both. It helps boost collagen production to heal them and allows for better absorption of your serums, oils, and creams. It is a great addition to my skin care regiment, I am already seeing improvement within the first week. I will be recommending it like crazy to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have heard about this product a while back but have not had the chance to come across it. When I finally found it on amazon, I decided to give it a try. This product does not hurt, in fact, it help enhance the product I but on my face such as face serum. I also notice a decrease in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great little Derma roller. Small enough to use on the face without any problems maneuvering it. Comes with a nice little storage case.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for improved hair growth and to improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The product is little and easy to use, like the holding case.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend tried this out and it made her look great. There was a natural radiance about her. But she always looks beautiful, so maybe I&#x27;m biased. But then i figured, what the heck. let me give it a try. Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Maybe a slight tingle, that&#x27;s all. My girlfriend thinks I look better after using the derma roller. And hey, so long as she thinks I look better, she&#x27;ll stay with me.</li>
            <li> Item was as described, works great</li>
