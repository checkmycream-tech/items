    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was impressed with the cleaning system and it has an excellent battery life.  </li>
            <li>and I think Remington is the best of the bunch, so</li>
            <li>Impressive customer service</li>
            <li>and it still provides an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be one of the best shavers I have used.  </li>
            <li>Oh; by the way, neither of these shavers gives a very good shave.</li>
            <li>The lady from CS that I dealt with was great.</li>
            <li>A great electric razor.</li>
            <li>It cracks me up that people give this product 5 stars with reviews like \\&quot;works great until it breaks.\\</li>
            <li>and it still works great.  </li>
            <li>great as</li>
            <li>an MS-900 before Remington reads these reviews and doubles the price...which would still make it a great buy.  </li>
            <li>If the quality of the products was as good as the quality of customer service, there wouldn&#x27;t be any problems.</li>
            <li>the MS-900 is another good example of the quality of Remington.</li>
            <li>Remington has always been known for its good, close shaves.</li>
            <li>This razor was purchased as a Christmas gift and my husband loved it</li>
            <li>I loved it when I firlst got it.  </li>
            <li>It provided a good shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband was very pleased to receive the Remington MS-900.  </li>
            <li>While that was nice, it indicates their ful knowledge they have a defective product in the market.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I have never had a closer shave, but the shaver is not without its caveats.  </li>
            <li>When my company stopped allowing us to wear jeans on Fridays mid-last year I decided to stage my own protest by not shaving on Fridays.  </li>
            <li>If anyone from Braun is reading this, you folks have a lot of catching up to do.  </li>
            <li>I called the customer service, they sent me a new shaver within days (impressive).</li>
            <li>Very easy to hold and to use.</li>
            <li>At first they had great customer service</li>
            <li>It shaves better than just about any electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>He has used Remington products for many years and</li>
            <li>Many have had problems with the plastic \\&quot;feet\\&quot; that hold the shaving head in.</li>
            <li>This is the closest shave I have had after many shavers and brands.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not over-filling it.  </li>
            <li>When I get another one, I&#x27;ll make sure it has a toggle switch on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Problem is the top foil piece has tabs that keep breaking.  </li>
            <li>I should have kept it and used it with a cord; would have been better than these Remington products.    </li>
            <li>this is most satisfied I&#x27;ve ever been with ANY product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product as long as you dont use liquid.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I bought mine very cheap on sale as it is so flimsy</li>
            <li>(\\&quot;I loved the shave so much I bought the company!\\&quot;) sold Remington and Spectrum Brands bought it, the quality of the product has declined.</li>
            <li>Aside from the small defect, this is the best designed, quietest, most comfortable shave I have seen from them.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, no irritation whatsoever and the pop up trimmer can be used to pull up stubborn, curly hairs that want to grow into my face.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>After 2 months of operation the undersized plastic tabs that secure the head to the razor have borken.  </li>
            <li>was friendly but not knowledgeable.  </li>
            <li>You get a great shave - as long as the tabs hold out.     </li>
            <li>Though a price check reveals that the suggested retail price is higher, it sure does look, feel, and shave like an inferior product.    </li>
            <li>It takes many passes to get a reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s good enough for cordless phones, why not shavers?  </li>
            <li>and they said it has been discontitued (i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s becuase they can&#x27;t afford to keep them running for the whole 2 year warranty period)</li>
            <li>Will go back to a good blade razor and forget I ever heard of Remington.</li>
            <li>Really good shaver, have bought at least 6 or more, works well, better than others I have tried, would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Maybe I got lucky for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always interested in a good shave and only Remington</li>
            <li>I ended up returning the shaver but will definitely buy it again because when it was working, the shave was amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely powerful.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the plastic piece on the top of the shaver that other reviewers say breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to clean without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2009:</li>
            <li>You will most likely regret it.</li>
            <li>It must have been designed by a first year engineering student (who probably flunked).</li>
            <li>A rep with Remington said that they&#x27;re aware of this issue and would ship me a \\&quot;redesigned\\&quot; part.  </li>
            <li>After many years of reliable service, the battery on my Braun razor finally could not hold a charge.</li>
            <li>The first Friday (1/5) after I began using the MS-900</li>
            <li>Very easy to use in a very quiet shaver highly recommended for anybody.</li>
            <li>They still give great shaves - as long as the shaver lasts, which in this case isn&#x27;t long.</li>
            <li>In use, it takes a long shave requiring multiple passes to achieve good results.  </li>
            <li>Purely cosmetic</li>
            <li>It may be covered by the warranty but upon close inspection this is really a design issue.  </li>
            <li>After Remington replaced this piece for me 3 seperate times (it broke a 4th time), they are offering me a full refund if I send the unit back to them.  </li>
            <li>so the closer shave increases the irritation, but a little dab of Aqua Velva Ice Balm (which I think cools and soothes...and smells... better than the Nivea products) and</li>
            <li>It is as if folks need to reassure themselves that they made an excellent purchase --except that it was a bad product.</li>
            <li>They cannot survive normal handling.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a second shot.</li>
            <li>Remington sent me a new foil and plastic head with no questions asked.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t ask for proof of purchase date, just said that the new part would be sent out tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, this new part will not break.</li>
            <li>Spectrum Brands graciously replaced it with a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I called them again and they shipped me a new head to the shaver in no  time.  </li>
            <li>a new one is in the mail.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I thought the Syncro was a great improvement over my previous Braun, but the Activator was no better than the Syncro for me.  </li>
            <li>but after 3 months the same exact problem happened again.</li>
            <li>Remington will send you a new razor and pick up your old one.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job of cutting.    </li>
            <li>The plastic feet on the hair catcher break early and often.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want it fixed or replaced.</li>
            <li>First, I wish the foils and pop-up trimmer stretched closer to the ends of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>One little piece that&#x27;s sure to break is the tiny electronic board that holds an equally tiny on-off switch.  </li>
            <li>I am not completely certain, but I think this happened after I used the cleaner for the first time.</li>
            <li>I will use a blade until my new Braun arrives and I will not be going back to Remington.</li>
            <li>The new head broke this time after only 1 week.</li>
            <li>In fact, since I asked for a replacement for the $5 bottle of cleaner, they just sent an entire new unit.  </li>
            <li>This is apparently a known issue among both customer and Remington.  </li>
            <li>The first shaver lasted less than a month.</li>
            <li>&quot;, now it is just another run of the mill, hard to clean, electric razor.</li>
            <li>Other than the breakage issue, my hubby really likes how the razor shaves.</li>
            <li>Second, the cleaning system is far inferior to Braun because it doesn&#x27;t dry the shaver and it leaves \\&quot;beard</li>
            <li>and it is my main shaver that never lets me down.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it is my main shaver that never lets me down.  </li>
            <li> It now has a broken latch that secures the head; It only uses 2 very small catches to hold it in place, and even with gentle handling breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> Still, for a shaver that&#x27;s less than 3 years old, this shouldn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> The tabs break that secure the plastic head that holds the foil rendering the shaver useless.  </li>
            <li> After two months the plastic tabs that secure the head to the razor broke and this rendered the shaver useless.</li>
            <li> the MS-900, there are still a couple of minor improvements I would make.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to toss an otherwise good shaver just because the batteries no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I have resorted to one final pass with a dry blade to finish what I expected this shaver to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades and the foil last longer than those from any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> I had the same problem described in some of the other reviews where a piece snapped off of the razor head preventing it from locking in place.</li>
            <li> The Activator came out spotless and dry.  </li>
            <li> So I took the thing out, cut it from the wires, drilled two little holes in the back, put the wires through and attached a Radio Shack SPST momentary switch</li>
            <li> I went back to the first shaver with the new base.  </li>
            <li> When I change shavers, I usually get a different brand just for the sake of experimentation.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful with it</li>
            <li> and they sent a new razor and had UPS come pick the broken one up.  </li>
            <li> Appears to me a design flaw after reading all the other negative reviews from folks with the same problem.</li>
            <li> I took the thing apart wondering why it was so hard to turn on and off after only two &amp; a half years&#x27; use and found that the board cracked.  </li>
            <li> But, the serious design flaw everyone else has mentioned in their reviews is enough to kill any benefit.  </li>
            <li> But at least I don&#x27;t have to keep shipping it back to the manufacturer every few weeks.</li>

            <li> I bought this thinking it would be easy to keep clean. Well, within 3 months the base that holds the cleaning fluid cracked and leaked out. Impossible to find replacement parts for the \\&quot;Cleaning Base\\&quot;, now it is just another run of the mill, hard to clean, electric razor. Wish I had my money back. No more Remingtons for me.</li>
            <li> I bought the shaver at the beginning of April.  It did a great job of cutting.    Within a month the plastic tabs in the head assembly broke.  The customer service rep indicated that I was not doing anything wrong and sent me a replacement piece.    Two months later it broke again.  This time the rep had me send the unit in for repair.  I sent it via priority mail.  Remington now says the unit never arrived, and that I am out a shaver.</li>
            <li> This product is a very poor design.  The plastic feet on the hair catcher break early and often.  At first they had great customer service but lately they seem to be ignoring me.  If you like stuff that breaks this is for you.  They should have a \\&quot;0\\&quot; star rating this product doesnt even deserve a \\&quot;1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a dud.  The tabs break that secure the plastic head that holds the foil rendering the shaver useless.  Remington sent me a new foil and plastic head with no questions asked.  While that was nice, it indicates their ful knowledge they have a defective product in the market.  As close as a blade?  No way.  It takes many passes to get a reasonably close shave.  I have resorted to one final pass with a dry blade to finish what I expected this shaver to do.  The cleaning base leaks fluid so that&#x27;s useless as well.  Do not buy this shaver.  You will most likely regret it.</li>
            <li> It shaves better than just about any electric razor I have ever owned.  But, the serious design flaw everyone else has mentioned in their reviews is enough to kill any benefit.  After two weeks the base of the top section that holds the foil will start developing cracks in the four \\&quot;feet.\\&quot;  Between two and 6 weeks later they will break and then the razor will become useless.  Remington will send you a new razor and pick up your old one.  They will also tell you it has been redesigned to fix this problem (it hasn&#x27;t).  After the second one breaks they will make YOU pay shipping to them.  Avoid this model.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my husband for Christmas. Just had to call Remington to have a replacement part sent. If the quality of the products was as good as the quality of customer service, there wouldn&#x27;t be any problems. The lady from CS that I dealt with was great. She didn&#x27;t ask for proof of purchase date, just said that the new part would be sent out tomorrow. I like that. Hopefully, this new part will not break. Other than the breakage issue, my hubby really likes how the razor shaves.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased to receive the Remington MS-900.  He has used Remington products for many years and the MS-900 is another good example of the quality of Remington.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a Christmas gift about 6.5 months ago.  I can honestly say that I have never had a closer shave, but the shaver is not without its caveats.  To begin with, the original charging base never quit flashing, indicating that the shaver was not fully charged.  I called the company and the customer service representative was friendly but not knowledgeable.  She thought that the base was probably OK until I pointed out the correct operation of the base in the shaver&#x27;s handbook.  I was told that a base would be shipped to me and that I was to return the original base in the box in which I received the new base.  I was also told that I would be reimbursed for shipping though I was not.  Then, after a few months of blissful shaves, one side of the screen would not stay attached to the shaver, rendering the shaver useless.  I give up.  I will use a blade until my new Braun arrives and I will not be going back to Remington.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of operation the undersized plastic tabs that secure the head to the razor have borken.  This renders the shaver useless. It may be covered by the warranty but upon close inspection this is really a design issue.  The tabs are not durable.  I am sending the compelete package to the Spectrum Brands (Remingtons parent company) CEO for his use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 months now.  I was impressed with the cleaning system and it has an excellent battery life.  In use, it takes a long shave requiring multiple passes to achieve good results.  It now has a broken latch that secures the head; It only uses 2 very small catches to hold it in place, and even with gentle handling breaks easily.  Stay away from this unit.</li>
            <li> Remington has always been known for its good, close shaves. Unfortunately, ever since that crazy guy (\\&quot;I loved the shave so much I bought the company!\\&quot;) sold Remington and Spectrum Brands bought it, the quality of the product has declined. They still give great shaves - as long as the shaver lasts, which in this case isn&#x27;t long. The head assembly is held in place by very small, very thin, PLASTIC tabs. They cannot survive normal handling. It must have been designed by a first year engineering student (who probably flunked). The first shaver lasted less than a month. Spectrum Brands graciously replaced it with a new shaver. The second one lasted 5 weeks. The tabs break and the head assembly can&#x27;t be held in place. You get a great shave - as long as the tabs hold out.     I&#x27;ve given up on this one and switched to a Braun 360. The shave is almost (but not quite) as close as the Remington. But at least I don&#x27;t have to keep shipping it back to the manufacturer every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for only three months, and the same plastic piece keeps breaking.  It&#x27;s the \\&quot;hair catcher\\&quot;.  This is apparently a known issue among both customer and Remington.  A rep with Remington said that they&#x27;re aware of this issue and would ship me a \\&quot;redesigned\\&quot; part.  But they shipped me the same plastic piece.  I have only shaved with it and put it in it&#x27;s cradle since I&#x27;ve owned it.  I don&#x27;t abuse it.  It just keeps breaking from regular use.  After Remington replaced this piece for me 3 seperate times (it broke a 4th time), they are offering me a full refund if I send the unit back to them.  I&#x27;ll give them kudos for their customer service.  But save yourself the heartache.  The design for this shaver is inherently flawed.  Spend your money on a different shaver!</li>
            <li> Many have had problems with the plastic \\&quot;feet\\&quot; that hold the shaving head in. I have not.  Perhaps I have a redesign.  This is the closest shave I have had after many shavers and brands. I do not have or use the cleaning base.  A great electric razor.</li>
            <li> After many years of reliable service, the battery on my Braun razor finally could not hold a charge. I received the Remington MS 900 as a gift and it worked for about 2 weeks before the infamous \\&quot;broken head tabs\\&quot; problem. Stay away.    It cracks me up that people give this product 5 stars with reviews like \\&quot;works great until it breaks.\\&quot; The point of these reviews is to help others avoid your mistakes. It is as if folks need to reassure themselves that they made an excellent purchase --except that it was a bad product. Silly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the plastic piece on the top of the shaver that other reviewers say breaks easily.  Maybe I got lucky for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver since December of 2006 and it still works great.  When I change shavers, I usually get a different brand just for the sake of experimentation.  I&#x27;ve had Norelco, Braun and Remington and I think Remington is the best of the bunch, so I think I&#x27;ll stick with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades and the foil last longer than those from any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  I especially like the 1-hour charging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like to see from any razor is a replaceable battery pack.  If it&#x27;s good enough for cordless phones, why not shavers?  It should be mandatory.  I&#x27;d hate to toss an otherwise good shaver just because the batteries no longer hold a charge.  You could replace them with a solder iron and replacement tabbed batteries but why bother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this shaver 5 stars but the cleaning/charging system that comes with it leaks all over the place and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not over-filling it.  I couldn&#x27;t find any parts (maybe a gasket is missing?) for it on Remington&#x27;s web site, but I consider the system a bonus anyway.  It&#x27;s easy enough to clean without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2009: One little piece that&#x27;s sure to break is the tiny electronic board that holds an equally tiny on-off switch.  I took the thing apart wondering why it was so hard to turn on and off after only two &amp; a half years&#x27; use and found that the board cracked.  So I took the thing out, cut it from the wires, drilled two little holes in the back, put the wires through and attached a Radio Shack SPST momentary switch and it works. Still, for a shaver that&#x27;s less than 3 years old, this shouldn&#x27;t happen.  When I get another one, I&#x27;ll make sure it has a toggle switch on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A re-design is definitely in order.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about 6 months ago. After two months the plastic tabs that secure the head to the razor broke and this rendered the shaver useless. I called the customer service, they sent me a new shaver within days (impressive). I was very careful with it but after 3 months the same exact problem happened again. I called them again and they shipped me a new head to the shaver in no  time.  The new head broke this time after only 1 week. There is definitely a design defect...</li>
            <li> This razor was purchased as a Christmas gift and my husband loved it BUT in less than 3 months the head wouldn&#x27;t click into position on one side thus making this razor unusable.  I called the company and they sent a new razor and had UPS come pick the broken one up.  Impressive customer service I&#x27;d say!  There weren&#x27;t any questions asked as far a for a receipt or proof of purchase, it was simply \\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ll have UPS pick it up and a new one is in the mail.\\&quot;  We&#x27;ll just have to see if the replacement does the same.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver I have ever owned.  I loved it when I firlst got it.  It provided a good shave.  Problem is the top foil piece has tabs that keep breaking.  I have owned this shaver for 1.5 years and went through 4 of these.  They break when you use the cleaner.  Also the base cracked on the bottom so the cleaning fluid all leaks out.  I called them again as it has a 2 year warranty and they said it has been discontitued (i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s becuase they can&#x27;t afford to keep them running for the whole 2 year warranty period) and they said they would replace it with the f710 model.  Dont buy one, you will be sorry!</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington ms 900 about 3 or 4 months ago. The tabs that hold the foil head to the shaver broke and it is useless. Appears to me a design flaw after reading all the other negative reviews from folks with the same problem. Fortunately I bought mine very cheap on sale as it is so flimsy I don&#x27;t want it fixed or replaced. I just want it gone. Will go back to a good blade razor and forget I ever heard of Remington.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as long as you dont use liquid. Liquid or alcahol will melt the plastic that hold the blades in place.</li>
            <li> I received an MS-900 as a gift.  Shortly after, the base started leaking.  I called for a replacement, which was sent.  In fact, since I asked for a replacement for the $5 bottle of cleaner, they just sent an entire new unit.  Within a couple of months of that, the head would no longer stay on.  I went back to the first shaver with the new base.  Within a couple weeks, the head wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  Called Customer Service and they said they&#x27;d send me a different model.  Sent a F-720.  This one is not self-cleaning and only has two heads.  Though a price check reveals that the suggested retail price is higher, it sure does look, feel, and shave like an inferior product.    Next time I need one, I&#x27;m going back to Braun.  Had one of their recharables for over 10 years until the battery would no longer hold a charge.  I should have kept it and used it with a cord; would have been better than these Remington products.    Oh; by the way, neither of these shavers gives a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time. Very easy to use in a very quiet shaver highly recommended for anybody. Very easy to hold and to use.</li>
            <li> Forget shavers...this is most satisfied I&#x27;ve ever been with ANY product.  I had been using a Braun Activator and had considered switching to a rotary when I heard about the MS-900.  Like everyone else, I&#x27;m amazed they can sell it at this price.  I&#x27;ve never even seen this advertised and I watch a lot of football!!  It shaves closer than anything I&#x27;ve ever used...including a blade!!  Yes, it&#x27;s a Remington so the closer shave increases the irritation, but a little dab of Aqua Velva Ice Balm (which I think cools and soothes...and smells... better than the Nivea products) and the irritation is gone.  When my company stopped allowing us to wear jeans on Fridays mid-last year I decided to stage my own protest by not shaving on Fridays.  The first Friday (1/5) after I began using the MS-900 a guy in my area asked if I&#x27;d given up my protest.  Come Saturday morning it cuts through my tough beard in a fraction of the time it took with the Activator.  Seriously, I think you could shave a wire brush with it and have it come out feeling like silk...it&#x27;s extremely powerful.  My Activator is now in a drawer after being demoted to \\&quot;Kurt Warner\\&quot; status of high-priced backup.  I&#x27;ll keep my Braun toothbrush and coffee maker but I think I&#x27;ve bought their shavers for the last time.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As great as the MS-900, there are still a couple of minor improvements I would make.  First, I wish the foils and pop-up trimmer stretched closer to the ends of the shaver.  It makes getting sideburns and around the ears a little tough, but it&#x27;s doable.   Second, the cleaning system is far inferior to Braun because it doesn&#x27;t dry the shaver and it leaves \\&quot;beard dust\\&quot; residue patches on and in the shaver.  The Activator came out spotless and dry.  But again, this is no big deal because the MS-900 is washable and I only use the cleaning system once a week for lubrication.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Get an MS-900 before Remington reads these reviews and doubles the price...which would still make it a great buy.  If anyone from Braun is reading this, you folks have a lot of catching up to do.  I thought the Syncro was a great improvement over my previous Braun, but the Activator was no better than the Syncro for me.  And judging by what I&#x27;ve read about the 360, it&#x27;s just another high-priced gimmick. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I had the same problem described in some of the other reviews where a piece snapped off of the razor head preventing it from locking in place. I am not completely certain, but I think this happened after I used the cleaner for the first time. I ended up returning the shaver but will definitely buy it again because when it was working, the shave was amazing. I&#x27;m always interested in a good shave and only Remington delivers that for my face. Aside from the small defect, this is the best designed, quietest, most comfortable shave I have seen from them. Definitely worth a second shot.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for about 3 years and it is my main shaver that never lets me down.  I have not changed the blades in the 3 years I&#x27;ve owned it and it still provides an excellent shave.  The only thing that keeps it from looking like the day I bought it is the black color part of the shaver has started to peel and there is gray showing instead of black.  Purely cosmetic and it has not affected the performance of the shaver.  Easy to use, easy to clean, no irritation whatsoever and the pop up trimmer can be used to pull up stubborn, curly hairs that want to grow into my face.  I find it to be one of the best shavers I have used.  I have had no problems with the reliability of the plastic used.</li>
            <li> Really good shaver, have bought at least 6 or more, works well, better than others I have tried, would purchase again.</li>
