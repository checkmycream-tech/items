            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>They do not seem to clean and tighten my skin like the products purchased from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Always amazed with how clean my face is after using the foaming gel.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Amazon customer.</li>
            <li>Great product, just wish it cost less.</li>
            <li>Skin looks so much clearer, brighter and tighter!!</li>
            <li>I recently bought Foam gel and Toner which honestly felt like they were diluted.</li>
            <li>I no longer have acne issues and my skin is healthy and and clear....</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it does the job at cleaning your skin, leaving it smooth and soft with no strong perfume odor.</li>
            <li>There is nothing in the market place that is better and they last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; if used as directed!!</li>
            <li>Beng in my mid 50&#x27;s I need to take care of my skin now more then ever</li>
            <li>is my first Obagi purchase here</li>
            <li>This does not smell or look like the real stuff!</li>
            <li>At the right times of year, I don&#x27;t even need to moisturize after I use it, it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>The cleanser has such a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li>Really seems to have changed my skin.  </li>
            <li>Much fewer pimples.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would.  </li>
            <li>and obagi really does the trick</li>
            <li>Have to stick with it for a few months, but nothing works better.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase my Obagi product at Anu Skin, but since I have a gift card at Amazon</li>
            <li>After Dermalogica, Murad and many other lines, this is the cleanser I come back to.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>The facial cleanser is a clean liquid and what i received in the bottle was pink and smelled like hand soap.  </li>
            <li>These must be made from a different product ingredient other than what is used by the original Obagi product I purchased from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The pink color is much more pale.</li>

            <li> great service and product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi Products for 15-20 years. I go to Amazon every time I&#x27;m about to run out of al product.&lt;br /&gt;The Foaming Gel and Toner are staples! There is nothing in the market place that is better and they last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; if used as directed!!</li>
            <li> Really seems to have changed my skin.  Much fewer pimples.</li>
            <li> Refreshing foaming gel followed by tingling toner feel wonderful on the face! I use it twice a day!</li>

            <li> Awesome products that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> Power duo!  My skin never looked so good.</li>
            <li> Outstanding products! Obagi has changed my life. No more break outs or oily skin. I&#x27;ve used every product known to mankind and this one gets 10 stars. Had marked improvement in less than one week.</li>
            <li> Foaming gel is excellent.  Would not repurchase toner.  Like the Obagi products</li>
            <li> Loving the Obagi products.  Cleared my skin breakouts and dark spots.  Skin looks so much clearer, brighter and tighter!!</li>
            <li> If I could give this seller NO starts I absolutely would.  This item was not at all what it was supposed to be.  I have been using Obagi products for quite some time now and what i received was not an obagi product.  The facial cleanser is a clean liquid and what i received in the bottle was pink and smelled like hand soap.  The toner that i ordered with it was not as blue as it should be (almost as if it was diluted).  I would NEVER buy from this seller ever again.  They are selling fruadulent products that are absolutely NOT obagi.  buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite Obagi  :-)&lt;br /&gt;Many years using this products and I&#x27;m happy. I recommend to everyone to makes skin looks clean and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi since 2008 and have always bought it from my cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office. Since ordering others various items from Amazon I stumbled across Obagi. I purchased this not having second thoughts of the authenticity of the cleanser &amp; toner. But just after a few weeks of using it my face has began to breakout. I haven&#x27;t had breakouts since I started using obagi in 2008. I don&#x27;t know if it is a coincidence or the product. But I will be going back to my doctor to purchase obagi instead of ordering it from here again. If you have been purchasing obagi from a doctor who is an authorized seller, I&#x27;d suggest you continue to purchase it through them. Just because the product may be cheaper online, the integrity of the product is in jeopardy. Obagi is an excellent product with excellent results. Anything less just isn&#x27;t obagi.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Amazon customer. I do not have problems with most of the items. But I will never buy OBAGI skincare products on Amazon. I seriously doubt the authenticity of the products. I recently bought Foam gel and Toner which honestly felt like they were diluted. Foaming gel did not foam at all. Toner did not do what its supposed to do. I have used OBAGI products for many years now. I would recommend buying them from an authorized OBAGI dealer or doctor&#x27;s office. I would have liked to get a refund.  I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product all the time and she says the price for it here is not bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi for years. This set is identical to what I get at the spa, a bit less expensive and ordering from Amazon saves me the hassle of dealing with medspa staff. That sounds horrible, but it&#x27;s dreadful to go in for one thing and spend 30 minutes under sales pressure to buy the whole line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming gel is why I always come back to Obagi. After Dermalogica, Murad and many other lines, this is the cleanser I come back to. The cleanser has such a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. At the right times of year, I don&#x27;t even need to moisturize after I use it, it&#x27;s so gentle. (I tend to be dry in the winter and would be oilier in the summer were it not for my Obagi.)</li>
            <li> The best products in the world !!!&lt;br /&gt;I see great results quickly, without multiple steps. I won&#x27;t use any other products again.</li>
            <li> Love all my obagi products. Beng in my mid 50&#x27;s I need to take care of my skin now more then ever and obagi really does the trick</li>
            <li> Obgai products are great and  I have used them since 2009 and my skin is in great condition ... but it is very important to get a skin doctor to follow you and get you on a regiment of skin care using all the obagi products... It was the best money I have ever spend  ..  I am in my 60&#x27;s and  I have people accuse me of getting &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done... This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic duo for skincare...definately a must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years and will continue to do so.  I do not use moisturizer and I give credit to not needing it from these products.  I am totally committed to these products.  The Best!</li>
            <li> Obagi facial products are the Best!  I&#x27;ve been using Obagi for approximately 6 years.  I no longer have acne issues and my skin is healthy and and clear.... Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Smells great, does not burn.</li>
            <li> Works well...excellent quality</li>
            <li> Love this stuff ! Great cleaner and toner for sure ! The smell is great and it does the job at cleaning your skin, leaving it smooth and soft with no strong perfume odor. I will purchase again and made it my regular daily cleaner. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The perfect complement for skin care!!!!</li>
            <li> Obagi products are the best skin care products ever. Arrived on time and in great shape. Wonderful. Wonderful service. Would recommend to everyone.</li>

            <li> Great product, just wish it cost less. Better price than buying it from the dr office, tho!</li>
            <li> I got it as advertised.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase my Obagi product at Anu Skin, but since I have a gift card at Amazon I used it to buy Obagi foam gel and Obagi toner. I did not like it!!!&lt;br /&gt;The consistency, thickness is NOT the same as the one I have from Anu Skin, seems like it was diluted to me. The pink color is much more pale. The latherness, soapsuds is less. The Toner I can&#x27;t make reviews now, I tried once only,  can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Obagi purchase here and this will be my LAST!  (Seller from Hollys best beauty)</li>
            <li> Love Obagi and love the price here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Good product. Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi products and when I can find them on Amazon, it&#x27;s great. ! They are in the larger size and are less expensive than from my local store.</li>
            <li> These must be made from a different product ingredient other than what is used by the original Obagi product I purchased from my dermatologist. They do not seem to clean and tighten my skin like the products purchased from my dermatologist. This product was 50% cheaper than what I paid at Kaiser Permanente.</li>
            <li> Always amazed with how clean my face is after using the foaming gel.</li>
            <li> This does not smell or look like the real stuff! Do not waste your money!</li>
