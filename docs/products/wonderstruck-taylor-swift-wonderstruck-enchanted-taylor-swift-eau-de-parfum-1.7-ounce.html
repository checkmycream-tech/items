            <li>Coming from Amazon.com directly as the seller, I was expecting more than all but one of the charms to be broken off...</li>
            <li>It is definitely a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; person smell (not a heavy musk or floral scent).</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve paid the extra few bucks to get it from Ulta and gotten it pretty how it was suppposed to be.</li>

            <li> I have the 1.7 oz bottle and it has lasted me this long!</li>
            <li> This perfume has a bit of everything: floral, fruity, musk, but not to the point that any one over powers the other.  </li>
            <li> They blend and compliment each other.</li>
            <li> It is &amp;#34;enchanting&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll never want to put it down.</li>
            <li> If I try hard I can imagine the smell is the \\&quot;blonde woods\\&quot; listed in the description - but it&#x27;s a little bit of a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the one I bought by amazon was less stronger than the one I tried in Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, as soon as it hits my skin it turns slightly medicinal like cherry cough drops.  </li>
            <li> so disappointed with the scent I thought surely hundreds of review can&#x27;t be wrong..</li>
            <li> At least the Taylor Scent saved the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of perfume, but this one isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>

            <li> Smells like Teen Spirit??</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It is definitely a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; person smell (not a heavy musk or floral scent). It is a nice blend of sweet scents with other tones. Some reviews on here said it smelled like cherry but I don&#x27;t smell that at all. I bought this perfume because I had a patient come in smelling AWESOME and I had to ask her what she was wearing. I wear this daily, love the scent and the compliments.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a bit of everything: floral, fruity, musk, but not to the point that any one over powers the other.  They blend and compliment each other.</li>
            <li> This was a bday present for my daughter.  The scent is actually very pretty.  Just don&#x27;t put more than one squirt on!</li>
            <li> GREAT SCENT..COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME..</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume in Macy&#x27;s and that day I really liked it. But the one I bought by amazon was less stronger than the one I tried in Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice, a little sweet and perfect for young ladies.</li>
            <li> In the bottle this smells great.  It&#x27;s very fruity, spicy and warm.  I can smell the wild berries and peonies and there&#x27;s a good balance between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, as soon as it hits my skin it turns slightly medicinal like cherry cough drops.  If I try hard I can imagine the smell is the \\&quot;blonde woods\\&quot; listed in the description - but it&#x27;s a little bit of a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes it though and thinks it smells like apples, so I&#x27;ll hang on to it and give it another shot.  Everyone&#x27;s PH is different and this could be really great on someone else.</li>
            <li> Fragrance isn&#x27;t over powering. Don&#x27;t really need the charms hanging on the bottle.  They tend to get in the way.</li>
            <li> Bought for a teen-age girl who loves it. I&#x27;m not a big fan of perfume, but this one isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Taylor Swift&#x27;s Wonderstruck Enchanted Perfume is the best! My brother got it for me for Christmas last year and I have been using it ever since. From the first whiff I was hooked. It is &amp;#34;enchanting&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll never want to put it down. I like how I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and it&#x27;s still almost completely full. Not even a 1/3 is used yet. I have the 1.7 oz bottle and it has lasted me this long! It comes in a fantastically sweet and unique bottle that any girl would love to have. It&#x27;s beautiful and softly adds a smell of roses or something elegant that is completely unique. When you smell it, you can&#x27;t help but think of Taylor Swift. It is as if it is her signature.  I love how it&#x27;s not too strong like some of the perfume you can buy at the mall now. It&#x27;s soft and innocent -- great for all ages! This will make an excellent gift for your daughter or niece even if they aren&#x27;t Taylor Swift fanatics. This is something that can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it; she really likes the way it smells on her, and so do I. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love all things Taylor Swift. I got a bottle of her first perfume several years ago, and I wanted to check this one out. I love the bottle, it&#x27;s so pretty and has little charms. The scent is also great. I would buy this for any Taylor fan.</li>

            <li> Purchased for my daughter, as she loved the first scent by T. Swift. The bottles are beautiful and the scents aren&#x27;t to overpowering .</li>
            <li> Did not like at all I was so...so disappointed with the scent I thought surely hundreds of review can&#x27;t be wrong..well it is a dude! I do like her Taylor&#x27;s Fragrance as a matter of fact I love it.  If I had not ordered them together  I would not have not have ordered Taylor. At least the Taylor Scent saved the day. Gave the Wonderstruck away.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy wearing  this perfume .It has a really flattering scent, especially for all those Taylor Swift fans out there.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells very sweet and light. I think the scent would fit a young girl very well. I love the bottle, it&#x27;s super cute with the red iridescent color, cool cap and the charms on its neck.</li>

            <li> I love this scent!! I always get so many comments when I wear it. The scent stays on all day. If you like sweet perfume scent, I highly recommend Wonderstruck!!</li>
            <li> The shipper had this to me right in time for the holidays! The perfume smells great and was a great price!!</li>
            <li> Just what my granddaughter wanted.  That made it perfect.  The price worked for me and most stores I checked were out of stock.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a gift certificate from one of myy sons for Chistmas. I am a perfume freak and I review perfume on another site.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best perfume I have had, in the PRETTIEST bottle, for ages! I love it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product came and i love the smell. I&#x27;ve wanted this perfume for a while and I&#x27;ve smelt it before and loved it.
