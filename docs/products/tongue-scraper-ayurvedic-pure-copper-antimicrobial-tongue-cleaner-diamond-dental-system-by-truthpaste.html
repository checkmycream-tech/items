            <li>Paired with the &amp;#34;truth paste&amp;#34; there&#x27;s nothing on earth that could make my mouth feel better.</li>

            <li>I love the copper</li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and it&#x27;s just perfect for my daily routine!</li>
            <li>Love that copper is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>I am a dental hygienist and have tried many tongue scrapers.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It works great, and since the metal band is a bit thinner, the tongue scrapings rinse off more easily than the Whole Foods version.  </li>
            <li>THANK YOU for helping me achieve a SUPER HEALTHY mouth!</li>
            <li>my mouth feels so clean!</li>
            <li>Very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to maneuver, comfortable to hold and use and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna get this for people for Christmas - who doesn&#x27;t want better breath and a clean tongue ?</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean and healthy after each use.</li>
            <li>easy to use and effect</li>
            <li>3) easy to store.</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is pure copper makes it even better!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as advertised!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the light easy feel of the copper.</li>
            <li>It works as described,  is easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>This fantastic copper tongue scraper will not &amp;#34;fade with time&amp;#34;--</li>
            <li>What is amazing is how much cleaner my mouth feels, and I am noticing that the acuity in my taste is improved as well.</li>
            <li>Great item to have for your daily routine.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>She was so nice and really cared about my satisfaction with the product.</li>
            <li>Handles are of good design and length, and the heftiness of the scraper is clear.</li>
            <li>It is also more minimalist looking and supposedly, the copper aspect of it is a very positive addition.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In conjunction with the truth paste toothpaste,  I feel like I have found good, healthy oral care products I will use forca long time</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super easy to use,</li>
            <li>Love that copper, the ONLY way to go for healthy living!</li>
            <li>but this simple scraper is the best so far.</li>
            <li>After watching Daniel Vitalis&#x27;s video on natural dental care, I found this product and love it!</li>
            <li>Works so well and seems to clean better than my stainless steel scraper.</li>
            <li>My life &amp; mouth is immensely better thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Simple effective, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using tongue scrapers for years, I only feel fresh and clean after a good tongue scraping after tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>but I get a strange sensation in my tongue using it that isn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, clean, and healthy&#x3D;perfect</li>
            <li>Excellent design, for gentle but firm tongue scraping.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this regularly since I bought it and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>So all in all, it&#x27;s my favorite one so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel super clean too, really</li>
            <li>the price - well worth</li>
            <li>It came with extra tips on how to optimize your results and was inside a nicely sealed packet.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think the scraper is keeping my breath fresh longer if anything it shortens the time of being fresh.</li>
            <li>I have found that rinising it off and making sure its dry after use will prevent it from becoming stained or tarnished.  </li>
            <li>and this plus some whitening mouthwash just removes it right away.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, it really wakes me up in the morning and is the first part in a new morning routine that I have adopted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross to see what comes off of your tongue when using this scraper, yet, at the same time, you get this really clean feeling!</li>
            <li>this is a very high quality product!</li>
            <li>First, time using a copper tongue scraper.</li>
            <li>plus for this was there&#x27;s no weird metal aftertaste</li>
            <li>Top quality copper, the only metal that a scrapper shoudl bemade out of.</li>
            <li>My first tongue scraper</li>
            <li>My first tongue scraper</li>
            <li>I think its something that everyone has to get use to doing at first.  </li>
            <li>I use it first thing in the morning to reduce toxins in my body.</li>
            <li>So glad that I finally purchased one of these.</li>
            <li>Later I found a pack of 12 right here on Amazon for the same basic price that are just as good, thus a better deal</li>
            <li>It grips the tongue very well and really does a great job removing icky build up on the tongue.</li>
            <li>I almost used too much pressure the first time I used it since I got so used to the plastic</li>
            <li>you have more &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; using this than the single scrapers you get.  </li>
            <li>Cant live without it!!</li>
            <li>It apparently cleans up to an original shiny state with lemon juice and water.  </li>
            <li>Seems like much ado about nothing.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much fresher.</li>
            <li>The tongue scrapervus very well</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This scraper is so narrow, I have to make extra passes, and I suppose that&#x27;s okay, but my older, wider, scrapers work better.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brand new with this technique, so thanks for the tip!</li>
            <li>So much easier to clean and longer lasting than the plastic ones... not to mention a whole lot prettier sitting in the toothbrush cup.</li>
            <li>i feel toothbrushing and flossing alone is not enough to keep your mouth clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less harsh to your tongue than brushing it with a toothbrush &amp; is noticeably more effective.</li>
            <li>Unlike the comfortable steel version I had from Whole Foods, this has less of a grip, but that actually works just fine</li>
            <li>Also, when I mean more &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; I mean you can adjust it so you can scrap the middle of your tongue more effectively.</li>
            <li>There is no funky taste from the copper and it is high quality made.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am new to the tongue scraping thing, and I think I&#x27;ve been missing out on a really important hygiene step!  </li>
            <li>extremely well made, love that it is one solid piece with no nooks or crannies for gunk.</li>
            <li>This one runs circles around the old plastic things!  </li>
            <li>and they are the EXACT same product, for just $10.99!  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s easier to clean the scraper because it doesn&#x27;t have any rubber grips or other places for bacteria to hide.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone young or old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more rough on my tongue than I expected</li>
            <li>Any old tongue scraper will do</li>
            <li>Natural copper rules too.</li>
            <li>, It is long enough to easily to clean the back of my tongue.</li>
            <li>The single best purchase I&#x27;ve made to aid in controlling bad breath.</li>
            <li>and I prefer it because it&#x27;s easier to clean- the grip version builds up scum between the grip and metal which is hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>It hurt my tongue so much I had to go back to my previous tongue scraper.</li>

            <li> Am pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I love my TruthPaste tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I love the copper</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and it&#x27;s just perfect for my daily routine!</li>
            <li> Love that copper is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and have tried many tongue scrapers.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It works great, and since the metal band is a bit thinner, the tongue scrapings rinse off more easily than the Whole Foods version.  </li>
            <li> THANK YOU for helping me achieve a SUPER HEALTHY mouth!</li>
            <li> my mouth feels so clean!</li>
            <li> Very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to maneuver, comfortable to hold and use and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna get this for people for Christmas - who doesn&#x27;t want better breath and a clean tongue ?</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean and healthy after each use.</li>
            <li> easy to use and effect</li>
            <li> 3) easy to store.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is pure copper makes it even better!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light easy feel of the copper.</li>
            <li> It works as described,  is easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This fantastic copper tongue scraper will not &amp;#34;fade with time&amp;#34;--</li>
            <li> What is amazing is how much cleaner my mouth feels, and I am noticing that the acuity in my taste is improved as well.</li>
            <li> Great item to have for your daily routine.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> She was so nice and really cared about my satisfaction with the product.</li>
            <li> Handles are of good design and length, and the heftiness of the scraper is clear.</li>
            <li> It is also more minimalist looking and supposedly, the copper aspect of it is a very positive addition.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In conjunction with the truth paste toothpaste,  I feel like I have found good, healthy oral care products I will use forca long time</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super easy to use,</li>
            <li> Love that copper, the ONLY way to go for healthy living!</li>
            <li> but this simple scraper is the best so far.</li>
            <li> After watching Daniel Vitalis&#x27;s video on natural dental care, I found this product and love it!</li>
            <li> Works so well and seems to clean better than my stainless steel scraper.</li>
            <li> My life &amp; mouth is immensely better thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Simple effective, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tongue scrapers for years, I only feel fresh and clean after a good tongue scraping after tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> but I get a strange sensation in my tongue using it that isn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Fresh, clean, and healthy&#x3D;perfect</li>
            <li> Excellent design, for gentle but firm tongue scraping.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this regularly since I bought it and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> So all in all, it&#x27;s my favorite one so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel super clean too, really</li>
            <li> the price - well worth</li>
            <li> It came with extra tips on how to optimize your results and was inside a nicely sealed packet.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think the scraper is keeping my breath fresh longer if anything it shortens the time of being fresh.</li>
            <li> I have found that rinising it off and making sure its dry after use will prevent it from becoming stained or tarnished.  </li>
            <li> and this plus some whitening mouthwash just removes it right away.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, it really wakes me up in the morning and is the first part in a new morning routine that I have adopted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross to see what comes off of your tongue when using this scraper, yet, at the same time, you get this really clean feeling!</li>
            <li> this is a very high quality product!</li>
            <li> First, time using a copper tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> plus for this was there&#x27;s no weird metal aftertaste</li>
            <li> Top quality copper, the only metal that a scrapper shoudl bemade out of.</li>
            <li> My first tongue scraper</li>
            <li> My first tongue scraper</li>
            <li> I think its something that everyone has to get use to doing at first.  </li>
            <li> I use it first thing in the morning to reduce toxins in my body.</li>
            <li> So glad that I finally purchased one of these.</li>
            <li> Later I found a pack of 12 right here on Amazon for the same basic price that are just as good, thus a better deal</li>
            <li> It grips the tongue very well and really does a great job removing icky build up on the tongue.</li>
            <li> I almost used too much pressure the first time I used it since I got so used to the plastic</li>
            <li> you have more &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; using this than the single scrapers you get.  </li>
            <li> Cant live without it!!</li>
            <li> It apparently cleans up to an original shiny state with lemon juice and water.  </li>
            <li> Seems like much ado about nothing.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much fresher.</li>
            <li> The tongue scrapervus very well</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This scraper is so narrow, I have to make extra passes, and I suppose that&#x27;s okay, but my older, wider, scrapers work better.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brand new with this technique, so thanks for the tip!</li>
            <li> So much easier to clean and longer lasting than the plastic ones... not to mention a whole lot prettier sitting in the toothbrush cup.</li>
            <li> i feel toothbrushing and flossing alone is not enough to keep your mouth clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less harsh to your tongue than brushing it with a toothbrush &amp; is noticeably more effective.</li>
            <li> Unlike the comfortable steel version I had from Whole Foods, this has less of a grip, but that actually works just fine</li>
            <li> Also, when I mean more &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; I mean you can adjust it so you can scrap the middle of your tongue more effectively.</li>
            <li> There is no funky taste from the copper and it is high quality made.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am new to the tongue scraping thing, and I think I&#x27;ve been missing out on a really important hygiene step!  </li>
            <li> extremely well made, love that it is one solid piece with no nooks or crannies for gunk.</li>
            <li> This one runs circles around the old plastic things!  </li>
            <li> and they are the EXACT same product, for just $10.99!  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s easier to clean the scraper because it doesn&#x27;t have any rubber grips or other places for bacteria to hide.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone young or old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more rough on my tongue than I expected</li>
            <li> Any old tongue scraper will do</li>
            <li> Natural copper rules too.</li>
            <li> , It is long enough to easily to clean the back of my tongue.</li>
            <li> The single best purchase I&#x27;ve made to aid in controlling bad breath.</li>
            <li> and I prefer it because it&#x27;s easier to clean- the grip version builds up scum between the grip and metal which is hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> It hurt my tongue so much I had to go back to my previous tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> This thing will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one because I like the idea of ayurvedic, and I want something that will last a long time!</li>
            <li> have I waited so long to use this?!</li>
            <li> Having used tongue scrapers for decades, this item is not new to me.</li>
            <li> between this and oil pulling (with a little essential oil mixed in), I feel like I just came from the dentist (minus the chemicals)!</li>
            <li> Every person in the USA should consider using this as it&#x27;s far cheaper and less painful than the Dentist and very quick.</li>
            <li> I use it conjunction with an ionic tooth brush, oil pulling with essential oils and sea salt, a water-pic, raw cod liver oil to re-mineralize my teeth to maintain oral health.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well because of its shape and thickness (unlike the scrapers that come on toothbrush heads).</li>
            <li> Handles are not comfortable, when fingers are wet it sleets.</li>
            <li> I went with this tongue scraper since it appeared to be easier to use with less of a &amp;#34;gagging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am a heavy tea drinker and get &amp;#34;brown tongue syndrome&amp;#34; from that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how narrow the scraper is out of the box/bag.</li>
            <li> Thevhealth of my tongue appears improved after just a few daysvof use.  </li>
            <li> Got it a few days ago.</li>
            <li> the small amount of money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the material or the shape, but I prefer this one now.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m scraping too hard or what</li>
            <li> There is no handle, or other type object to make cleaning difficult</li>
            <li> Used it three times, and a day later I get sick, coincidence??</li>
            <li> Orabrush suffers serious wear.</li>
            <li> I swear after just a few days of using this thing I get sick!</li>
            <li> and they get dirty.</li>
            <li> the bad breathe</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This tongue scraper is the MOST thought out tongue cleaner I have seen! Ascetically, this is a BEAUTIFUL addition to my oral hygiene routine. I absolutely LOVE the chosen material, 100% COPPER! This is going to last me forever! I love this in addition to using TruthPaste by Diamond Dental System. THANK YOU for helping me achieve a SUPER HEALTHY mouth!</li>
            <li> Insightful instructions, well made and packaged.</li>
            <li> First, time using a copper tongue scraper. Best investment I&#x27;ve made this year.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s amazing how much better this copper tongue scraper works to remove build-up on the tongue vs. just brushing the tongue.  Very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> My life &amp; mouth is immensely better thanks to this product. Thank you!!! Paired with the &amp;#34;truth paste&amp;#34; there&#x27;s nothing on earth that could make my mouth feel better.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Use it every morning!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The price has gone up since I bought it but this simple scraper is the best so far. I Have tried Orabrush and had a Dr Tungs scraper. Orabrush suffers serious wear. Dr. Tungs is great too. I just prefer this one because it is more flexible. It is also more minimalist looking and supposedly, the copper aspect of it is a very positive addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus for this was there&#x27;s no weird metal aftertaste like I thought there would be. Also, when I mean more &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; I mean you can adjust it so you can scrap the middle of your tongue more effectively.</li>
            <li> So much easier to clean and longer lasting than the plastic ones... not to mention a whole lot prettier sitting in the toothbrush cup.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Arrived quickly and as advertised!</li>
            <li> It is excellent! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent design, for gentle but firm tongue scraping.  Love that copper, the ONLY way to go for healthy living!</li>
            <li> Frankly, I don&#x27;t get it.  Seems like much ado about nothing.  Any old tongue scraper will do</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Handles are not comfortable, when fingers are wet it sleets.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, why I haven&#x27;t used this before now is beyond me.  I&#x27;m gonna get this for people for Christmas - who doesn&#x27;t want better breath and a clean tongue ? My kids even like using it!</li>
            <li> This fantastic copper tongue scraper will not &amp;#34;fade with time&amp;#34;-- it works perfectly and reliably, and can be cleaned and stored easily.</li>
            <li> It hurt my tongue so much I had to go back to my previous tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> works easy and does a good job cleaning</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tongue scraper! It works extremely well because of its shape and thickness (unlike the scrapers that come on toothbrush heads). The fact that it is pure copper makes it even better! I was also very pleased to receive a follow-up email from the company with a tip for cleaning the scraper.</li>
            <li> This is the best tongue scraper I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s well worth the price. Cleans your tongue very nicely. Oh yeah can anyone tell me the best way to clean this tongue scraper and where the best place to store it in? Would a ziploc bag be a good storage place for the tongue scraper?</li>
            <li> This is ok, but it pales in comparison to the one I had and lost and can&#x27;t find anywhere. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to keep searching.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service.</li>
            <li> great stuff, works well, cleans your tongue like you would not believe</li>
            <li> Best quality tongue scraper out there. Top quality copper, the only metal that a scrapper shoudl bemade out of. I use it daily and it&#x27;s top notch.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re living without a tongue scraper, you&#x27;re not living life to the fullest.</li>
            <li> Cant live without it!! Amazing invention. Highly effective. Gets rid of the morning plaque build up. Every person in the USA should consider using this as it&#x27;s far cheaper and less painful than the Dentist and very quick. I use it conjunction with an ionic tooth brush, oil pulling with essential oils and sea salt, a water-pic, raw cod liver oil to re-mineralize my teeth to maintain oral health. It won&#x27;t make your dentist happy but your teeth will shine! and you&#x27;ll make Jimmy Carter Jealous!!</li>
            <li> extremely well made, love that it is one solid piece with no nooks or crannies for gunk.</li>
            <li> My first tongue scraper and I really like it. My mouth feels so much fresher. Recommend.</li>
            <li> The tongue scraper is amazing.  I like the copper as I know it is anti-microbial.  What is amazing is how much cleaner my mouth feels, and I am noticing that the acuity in my taste is improved as well.</li>
            <li> My first tongue scraper and I love it. Well made.</li>
            <li> Hey!  Great product!  I am new to the tongue scraping thing, and I think I&#x27;ve been missing out on a really important hygiene step!  This one runs circles around the old plastic things!  I&#x27;d give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love this thing there goes the bad breathe my mouth feels so clean!</li>
            <li> Simple design and practicality with this tongue scraper. The simple package has instructions for use. I&#x27;m pleased to add this to my morning wellness routine.</li>
            <li> I swear after just a few days of using this thing I get sick! Used it three times, and a day later I get sick, coincidence??</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more rough on my tongue than I expected but I think it just takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!  I am going to order one for my hubby too.  I am a heavy tea drinker and get &amp;#34;brown tongue syndrome&amp;#34; from that and this plus some whitening mouthwash just removes it right away.  Makes me feel super clean too, really kissable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/2/15: I wanted to get my fiance&#x27; one of these and then I noticed I could get 10 of them here on amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Asha-T-4-Copper-Tongue-Cleaners/dp/B002V75QMM/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0ZB3AVG5BX02SH9P0TJM) and they are the EXACT same product, for just $10.99!  So, just FYI, those are a better value.</li>
            <li> After watching Daniel Vitalis&#x27;s video on natural dental care, I found this product and love it! I can tell the difference in my breath and feeling of cleanliness already!</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing. It&#x27;s kind of gross to see what comes off of your tongue when using this scraper, yet, at the same time, you get this really clean feeling! Before I got the tongue scraper, I would always gag when brushing the back of my tongue with my toothbrush. Now gagging is not an issue when using the tongue scraper to get the back of by tongue. There is no funky taste from the copper and it is high quality made. I would highly recommend this product to anyone young or old.</li>
            <li> The single best purchase I&#x27;ve made to aid in controlling bad breath.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my tongue scraper.  I&#x27;m brand new with this technique, so thanks for the tip!</li>
            <li> Good experience with the device.  Perfect for the job.  Glad I have it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  My mouth feels so clean and healthy after each use.</li>
            <li> I love my copper tongue scraper! Easy to use and effective. easy to use and effect</li>
            <li> Great item to have for your daily routine.  I enjoy the light easy feel of the copper.</li>
            <li> Great scraper, better than plastic.  I use it every day and the width makes it easier to use.  Natural copper rules too.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I have recommended this to friends bc i feel toothbrushing and flossing alone is not enough to keep your mouth clean.</li>
            <li> Nice quality scraper.  Wish it was a bit wider, that the handles served as scraping surfaces also</li>
            <li> It is great. There are 3 features that make this the perfect scraper for me. 1)  the shape, It is long enough to easily to clean the back of my tongue. The &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; allow me evenly control of the pressure I apply to all sections of my tongue.  2) the copper. It is easy to clean. I wonder if those plastic scrapers are  clean or does bacteria have a great place to grow. Even when the plastic scrapers come off the assembly line there are imperfections. I was contacted by &amp;#34;truthPaste about my satisfaction through an e-mail and was informed that I can also use a combination of water and lemon juice, if necessary. 3) easy to store. I contacted &amp;#34;thuthPaste&amp;#34; about another product I purchased from them. A wonderful person called me back. She was so nice and really cared about my satisfaction with the product. My MD suggested it, and my dentist &amp;#34;OKed&amp;#34; it. he did not even know that scrapers were made in copper. You will love your purchase and want to tell all your friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have been using this regularly since I bought it and am very pleased with the results. Later I found a pack of 12 right here on Amazon for the same basic price that are just as good, thus a better deal</li>
            <li> Works good, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Best tongue scraper ever and so beautiful too!!</li>
            <li> wonderful product! works great! thank you for the personal touch and extra tip.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.  Am pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I went with this tongue scraper since it appeared to be easier to use with less of a &amp;#34;gagging&amp;#34; effect.  I think its something that everyone has to get use to doing at first.  This did the job - you have more &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; using this than the single scrapers you get.  Being copper, this will last a lifetime unless you lose it.  I have found that rinising it off and making sure its dry after use will prevent it from becoming stained or tarnished.  You cant beat the price - well worth the small amount of money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I love my TruthPaste tongue scraper. I use it first thing in the morning to reduce toxins in my body. A great addition to my morning routine of oil pulling! Love the sleek design - makes it great for traveling!</li>
            <li> Copper is known for its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties which sets this tongue scrapper above the rest.  Sturdy and easy to use, this is the best tongue scrapper I have ever come across!</li>
            <li> I am giving four stars bc my son loves his but I wasn&#x27;t as happy with mine.  Its ok but I get a strange sensation in my tongue using it that isn&#x27;t pleasant.  My son says its awesome though for him!</li>
            <li> Having used tongue scrapers for decades, this item is not new to me. I don&#x27;t like how narrow the scraper is out of the box/bag. I want to reach a wider path while pulling the scraper along my tongue. This scraper is so narrow, I have to make extra passes, and I suppose that&#x27;s okay, but my older, wider, scrapers work better.    Update - I bent the scraper to make it wider. The copper bends easily enough, but is sturdy enough to retain the shape, while in use. The quality of the scraper is good. Handles are of good design and length, and the heftiness of the scraper is clear. This thing will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Attractive and nice to think that it has antibacterial properties.  Unlike the comfortable steel version I had from Whole Foods, this has less of a grip, but that actually works just fine and I prefer it because it&#x27;s easier to clean- the grip version builds up scum between the grip and metal which is hard to clean.  It apparently cleans up to an original shiny state with lemon juice and water.  It works great, and since the metal band is a bit thinner, the tongue scrapings rinse off more easily than the Whole Foods version.  So all in all, it&#x27;s my favorite one so far!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Finally a tongue scraper that works.  I almost used too much pressure the first time I used it since I got so used to the plastic flimsy type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Even feels like you&#x27;ve cleaned your tongue versus just brushing it.</li>

In conjunction with the truth paste toothpaste,  I feel like I have found good, healthy oral care products I will use forca long time</li>
            <li> Great tongue scraper.. arrived fast and works well!</li>
            <li> Got it a few days ago. Keep you posted.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why have I waited so long to use this?!</li>
            <li> great addition to oral care!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tongue scrapers for years, I only feel fresh and clean after a good tongue scraping after tooth brushing. I&#x27;ve used various plastic ones, but some don&#x27;t seem to work well and they get dirty. I regularly cleaned my plastic tongue scrapers but after a while they just got gross and I had to dispose of them. I purchased this one because I like the idea of ayurvedic, and I want something that will last a long time! I love the copper, it&#x27;s super easy to use, both one and two-handed. It grips the tongue very well and really does a great job removing icky build up on the tongue. It also travels well, it&#x27;s also very easy to keep clean! There is no handle, or other type object to make cleaning difficult, it&#x27;s ideal and I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Cleans the tongue so well.  It works so well.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and it&#x27;s just perfect for my daily routine! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works so well and seems to clean better than my stainless steel scraper. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the material or the shape, but I prefer this one now. Also it&#x27;s easier to clean the scraper because it doesn&#x27;t have any rubber grips or other places for bacteria to hide.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, truly made of solid copper. This thing is likely to last forever.  It works as described,  is easy to use, and easy to clean. It came with extra tips on how to optimize your results and was inside a nicely sealed packet.  It&#x27;s less harsh to your tongue than brushing it with a toothbrush &amp; is noticeably more effective.</li>
            <li> Love this tongue scraper! Very easy to maneuver, comfortable to hold and use and clean. I plan to try the toothpaste from Truth Paste next.</li>
            <li> Working well!! Definitely notice a difference when it use it regularly....between this and oil pulling (with a little essential oil mixed in), I feel like I just came from the dentist (minus the chemicals)!</li>
            <li> Those tongue scrapers you find on toothbrushes have nothing on this one. Works amazing, couldn&#x27;t ask for better!</li>
            <li> Really great product.  Simple effective, easy to use and clean.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning! Love that copper is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> best tongue scraper I ever had</li>
            <li> This is a necessity item.  I recommend everyone should get one.</li>
            <li> So glad that I finally purchased one of these.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, it really wakes me up in the morning and is the first part in a new morning routine that I have adopted.</li>
            <li> I love the tongue scraper, and I also love how they send you emails with tips/facts about it after your purchase!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m scraping too hard or what but I don&#x27;t think the scraper is keeping my breath fresh longer if anything it shortens the time of being fresh. Help? Lol</li>
            <li> Happy with product.  Works as described.  Company service it great.</li>
            <li> this is a very high quality product! i like the narrower design as this allows me to reach further back in my mouth without gagging. i would definately recommend adding a tongue scraper to your dental hygiene regimen. i have noticed a big difference in my breath. my breath stays fresher longer</li>
