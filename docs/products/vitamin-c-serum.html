            <li>Very light weight and good smelling.</li>
            <li>Was very excited to learn that Radha was releasing a Vitamin C Serum!  </li>
            <li>I love Radha Products, this is amazing, this serum has faded my sun spots, I am really happy, I got it as sample, but I would get it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I am loving this face serum and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I really did like this one the best .</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the reviews that this went well with the Radha retinol moisturizer which i have been loving, and</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>My thoughts, results and review are honest and unbiased feedback.  </li>
            <li>The gel feels incredibly cooling and fresh as I dab it on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not required to post a favorable review and all opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>It has 20% Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, which are effective in brightening skin.  </li>
            <li>I could honestly tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use this with Radha Beauty&#x27;s retinol moisturizer and eye gel, since I found that I got the best results using the whole</li>
            <li>&amp; AFTER pictures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>for my wife she said she liked it</li>
            <li>However, all opinions stated are 100% honest and my exclusive opinion.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, high quality product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>As you may know, Vitamin C is wonderful for a vibrant, glowing complexion.</li>
            <li>: To work around this, I highly recommend everybody use a cotton ball or cotton pad to apply the product to, instead of your fingers as it greatly helps with product dispersion!  </li>
            <li>I also will say I am pleased with the manufacturer and they follow up to see if you are happy and are easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>I did get this for free, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
            <li>this seems to clean up my skin very nice .</li>
            <li>Eventhough, it didn&#x27;t work very well for me, It somehow worked great on my Mom, plus good costumer service.</li>
            <li>Start with 1 pump as it spreads very easily.  </li>
            <li>Runs between fingers &amp; doesn&#x27;t spread very easily.</li>
            <li>serum is non-greasy, non-sticky, &amp; perfect for sensitive or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with these products.  </li>
            <li>I feel this product could have a nice dropper and a bottle and would be more effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this products.</li>
            <li>This serum is light, potent and highly effective!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect serum to go with the retinol and this most definitely is my favorite so far!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.it is odorless and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>This serum is so light on my face and the feel of it is refreshing!</li>
            <li>Huge Pro: Vegan!</li>
            <li>and I only use the best of products.</li>
            <li>I am using anti aging products and I love this one.</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I really love this product....</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>The Serum is more of an oil than a lotion so keep that in mind when dispensing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after continued use these benefits will become more visible.</li>
            <li>My skin  looks lifted and the eyes look more lifted.</li>
            <li>thing I love about this serum is that it works.</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with the Radha Beauty Retinol Moisturizer, all you&#x27;ll feel is velvety-soft, healthy feeling skin.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Ive only used it once and the effect it had felt awesome</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the two together for about two weeks now,every night before bed, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with what I see when I wake up each morning..</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the Vitamin C Serum by Radha Beauty.</li>
            <li>This packaging was so much better than the glass bottle that remind you of medicine droppers.</li>
            <li>I will say I think that this serum is up there with the pricey department store brands but at a much more affordable price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this solution!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it and how it feels.  </li>

            <li>Really enjoyed it,could tell a difference,</li>
            <li>I love the results I have seen within one week.</li>
            <li>I love this Serum from Radha Beauty Products and use it day and night - under my SPF moisturizer &amp; makeup during the day, and under a night treatment or cream during the night time before I head to bed.</li>
            <li>I like it:)</li>
            <li>This is where it gets interesting.</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin look more even toned, it soaks in immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>it works and it is such a great price!</li>
            <li>and I sure that it helps with my puffy morning eyes</li>
            <li>On a side note, I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say I am a satisfied customer with these products.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it is Vegan AKA Cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li>and I do believe my face looks smoother and more healthy.</li>

            <li>and they are fantastic!</li>

            <li>[[VIDEOID:cec1506e721d2436cd8fb34cd71a74c4]]After trying many vitamin C serums</li>
            <li>I love the dispenser,</li>
            <li>I ADORE how smooth this makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li>I do wish, however, that it smelled more like oranges.</li>
            <li>For a more in-depth review, check out my blog post: http://www.gorgeousandstuff.com/2015/02/radha-beauty-review.html</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this for free in order to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>This vitamin C serum is top notch.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with every product I try from the Rahda Beauty company…</li>
            <li>puffy eyes immediately tighten on application, cools skin as it dries, and the longer I use it the better results I see.  </li>
            <li>It works great alone, and adding a moisturizer after the serum dries really boosts the moisturizing effect of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of different products over the years (I&#x27;m 42), but this one makes my face and neck look and feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>This product is simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my face.</li>
            <li>Put some on right away and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Radha Beauty Eye Gel has a light, crisp, cucumber scent that just might be my very favorite scent (I forgot how much I love the smell of cucumber)!  </li>
            <li>serum smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling dramatically refreshed after a long day or a too-short night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>Although I cannot yet speak of long term results, I can attest that after two weeks of using it my skin looks smooth and more flawless than before.  </li>
            <li>im super excited to see what results come from using radha anti aging skin care line !!</li>
            <li>Like all of the Radha beauty products I&#x27;ve tried prior this one is definitely worth the money, a top of the line product at a great price!</li>
            <li>You may see many reviewers got the product free to review it</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this serum is how light it is on your skin.</li>
            <li>- I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>thanks for good products.</li>
            <li>received a complimentary sample of this product to try in return for a written review of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum is easy to pump out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This serum goes on and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, sits nicely underneath my foundation and makes my skin feel fresh and restored.</li>
            <li>No smell, easy to use</li>
            <li>It is specially formulated to stimulate collagen production and renew aging skin to a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>I can not judge for the anti-aging or fine lines.</li>
            <li>I cannot clinically say this has changed my fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>I am hoping with time I will see fine line reduction and freckles getting lighter.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has started to even out and the serum is making all my fine lines melt away into a radiant glowing spring time skin.</li>
            <li>I can honestly report some positive changes to my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a light feeling formula that smooth&#x27;s easily over the skin.</li>
            <li>These types of serums can help get rid of free radicals and has been proven to stimulate collagen, which will reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>serum has an excellent texture: feels like aloe vera but leaves skin feeling smooth, and tight like a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent hydration, fewer fine lines, and fading acne scars to name just a few things I&#x27;ve noticed.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think this product is great, light weight and can be used under my make up with out any issues of looking oily.</li>
            <li>Huge difference.  </li>
            <li>and I see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I got this free for review</li>
            <li>You may even be brave enough to skip the make-up altogether after using these products for a while!</li>
            <li>I got to try this free for review purposes</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product.  </li>
            <li>Dear rhada feel free to re-stock.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,very nice and helpful c.s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s filled with water...</li>
            <li>When I put it on I love the smell and the fresh feel it gives me combining that with their retinol moisturizer</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling fantastic and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This serum is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Also, the customer service I received from the company is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy, I finally have a skin care regimen that I will keep!!</li>
            <li>Your doing such great work Radha...</li>
            <li>I did receive a free sample of this for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It’s lighter than feather and leaves your skin baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I put this on right on a fresh face before the Retinol mosturizer that Radha also sent me for free in return for this honest opinion.</li>
            <li>, only one week ago, I am expecting very good results, my skin is very soft and light and is organic which is very important to me,no allergy at all with this, and believe me I am allergic to everything.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found something that works so well that is also made without the use of parabens and other chemicals like so many others.</li>
            <li>I was most impressed by how much lighter my dark spots became.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak for longevity yet as that would take a while but plan to update review when significant changes are visible.  </li>
            <li>As you can see there is a significant reduction in the visibility of my acne scars after using Radha&#x27;s Beauty line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is water...</li>
            <li>The Serum is thin and spreads easily, smells lovely and mild, and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with Retinol Moisturizers for most of my adult life (I swear by them, in fact) and this one does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>His face is full of color, he has a brighter complexion, &amp; I see a new change in him almost every day, and he has NEVER had a breakout or skin irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in my skin right away!</li>
            <li>Plus for them being a natural and organic line they have amazing prices.</li>
            <li>The texture of the serum is light and fresh feeling....</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>It’s light and fresh and feels like a cool cucumber bath for your face.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and soaks right into my face.</li>
            <li>I like that this serum is very easy to apply and that it absorbs pretty fast and is non-sticky in texture.</li>
            <li>It noticeably reduced fine lines and wrinkles, even after the first use.</li>
            <li>This product was sent to me for free, however, the following views are my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products are filled with natural, organic ingredients that your skin will love.  </li>
            <li>The cooling gel is a great way to start my early early mornings.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave any sort of film on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum as a part of my beauty routine for about two weeks now and feel that I can adequately review my experience with it.  </li>
            <li>Awesome -- I see a big difference in my pores and wrinkles after only a month of use.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this batch will be much better than the last.</li>
            <li>so I appreciated that it helped make my skin seem just kind of brighter and glowier and look overall better.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and I feel that my skin stays much more moisturized when I use this under my regular moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li>This product has a quick absorbing quality and is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>great piece of packaging, this Retinol Moisturizer comes in a tall, sleek, silver bottle with a fancy little pump.  </li>
            <li>really loved their eye gel which I previously tried, so I was excited to try this product as well.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it is fragrance free too.</li>
            <li>so I really like that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>So far I love it,</li>
            <li>and I honestly have not noticed much of a difference in my skin besides it being soft.</li>
            <li>It truly is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part is that a little bit goes quite a long way, so you&#x27;re most certainly getting true-value-for-your-buck.</li>
            <li>but it soaks right into my skin and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I received the Radha Vitamin C Serum a couple of days ago and while I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see long term results I am looking forward to seeing what awesome changes it will bring to my skin as Vitamin C is a favorite and the most vital piece in my anti-aging beauty arsenal.  </li>
            <li>Right after I shower</li>
            <li>I will also leave positive packaging product reviews because I believe this company TRULY VALUES customer satisfaction!</li>
            <li>The quick absorption and nearly fragrance free scents leave skin feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Combining vegan hyaluronic acid, organic aloe, vitamin E and green tea, the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer is definitely my favorite, but I pretty much love all their products.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it when you can look in the mirror and tell it&#x27;s really working!</li>
            <li>Appart from the all natural ingredients and easy to use packaging</li>
            <li>However,  I have been using the product daily for just over a week along with my sunscreen and have already noticed huge improvements in my skin!</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is so important to keep your skin looking young.</li>
            <li>I am at the stage that my skin comes first</li>
            <li>Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li>Just one or two squirts will be more than enough to cover the face and neck area</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a plus when a product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t the first Vitamin C serum that I have tried out this year, but it is one my favorites.</li>
            <li>It is reccomended that you use the Serum first and then the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Most make their way to the back of the &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34;  drawer after a couple weeks, because I see no noticeable improvements.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I used it tonight and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My first step, after washing my face, is to apply the Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that if you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can get 100% of your money back, without even returning the bottle.</li>
            <li>I could see and feel a difference in my skin just after the first application.</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>From the first time using it</li>
            <li>, I can say that this one is among my top two for scent, performance, and overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my face looks fresh and ready to apply my moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li>I just love and can’t say enough about it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I simply need to shake up the bottle more to mix it?</li>
            <li>and so that most likely produced the watery consistency that I did not like.</li>
            <li>Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li>the burning from all their harsh chemicals was not doing any good.</li>
            <li>The smile lines which I absolutely detest have pretty much disappeared.</li>
            <li>Both products are very light which may be why it did not wow my skin.</li>
            <li>Although I love all of Radha Beauty products, this is the only one that I didn&#x27;t like so much.</li>
            <li>Since this is a serum rather than a cream, it is highly concentrated, and quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>and I have seen positive results.</li>
            <li>My skin looked better than it had in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I will most certainly be a long term customer!</li>
            <li>so im super sensitive</li>
            <li>My cheeks and chin are usually dry in the winter time, but since i&#x27;ve been using this, my face retains moisture better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t kind of smell like bug spray and is slightly sticky on your hands for about a min after using.</li>
            <li>it feels like this is a pure, functional product.</li>
            <li>There was an immediate feeling of WOW the very first time I used this.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday before your retinal moisturizer and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is much more even now and although I do not have wrinkles at the current time, I have full faith that this will be beneficial for my future.</li>
            <li>Serum was very thin,and I could not see a difference in about two -months of use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this a lot.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really can feel it feeding your skin.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to my skincare routine now thanks to you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear make up</li>
            <li>This is a very light,thin serum,so it goes straight into the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it seems to brighten my skin</li>
            <li>Very lightweight product.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The bottle was dented all over- thanks Amazon shipping.</li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s be real, what matters is the product.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes do 2 application, because my skin really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Just in case anyone is wondering I am an African American male - this stuff works great on my skin and has helped to even my complexion....</li>
            <li>Have not noticed much of s difference.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Absolutes very well.</li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to continuing to use these will crafted products and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>Really like that it tells me when it was made so there is no question if I&#x27;m getting something that has been sitting in a warehouse for a while.</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The Vit C serum is very soothing, to soon to see results.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>What is in the bottle very liquid for the serum.</li>
            <li>A few drops covers my whole face nicely, I rub it into my cheeks, chin area and forehead.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which is irritated by almost every cream or serum I try, but this is very gentle</li>
            <li>It has no sticky residue unlike many other Vitamin C serums, and within 3 seconds on my skin, it gets absorbed completely.  </li>
            <li>The gel is thick and spreads easily, but also absorbs very quickly and can be used underneath makeup.  </li>
            <li>The texture is a bit watery, but it spread easily and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>It is extremely hydrating &amp; leaves your skin looking supple &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed a significant reduction in lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes and my lip area.</li>
            <li>Because this serum absorbs so quickly, I can move on to my next steps much faster.</li>
            <li>I have begun to experience fine lines from living in the dry desert and find that this has helped reduce those lines.  </li>
            <li>This Cruelty Free serum comes in and kicks butt and takes names for dull, lifeless skin and fine lines/wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, then one day looked in the mirror and was surprised.  </li>
            <li>My skin color has become more uniform and less blotchy.</li>
            <li>I smooth this over my face nd neck, let it dry, and follow with their rosehip oil for a smoothe, glowy complexion.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin shine and look vibrant.</li>
            <li>I will provide more information on this product in the future, after I have used it for several weeks.</li>
            <li>It is a thick and creamy moisturizer that makes for a great final step in the three-step process.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if your skin likes very light moisturizers and things, but if you&#x27;re like me and you need heavy moisturizers then this is not for you.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>Color finnally in my skin, haha, but seriously its a circulation kind of thing.</li>
            <li>It is thinner in consistency than other serums I have tried, and I do feel like it absorbs very quickly into my skin (using it on face and neck).</li>
            <li>The pump is good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I received this product free from the company but am expected to do nothing in exchange.  </li>
            <li>and so far didn&#x27;t see much of a change.</li>
            <li>I have tried many beauty products to my face but this is the one that wow me in such a short period of time - a week...</li>
            <li>so I am confident it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Right away i used my Dead Sea Mineral soap to stop any more breakouts, &amp; went back to my old faithful, Radha Eye Gel serum, on my whole face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has almost no scent (maybe a slight citrus or green note if you insist), which is great if you are allergic to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>(it only takes a few seconds) itis important to apply a rich moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>hope this helps someone im always looking for new things to try for my hands</li>
            <li>This product have been a live saver for me.</li>
            <li>in it&#x27;s NEW packaging</li>
            <li>20% is strong and should cause a slight sting, redness, or dryness.  </li>
            <li>This product makes your skin firmer and very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I tend to loose interest quickly</li>
            <li>Its taken all of 2 or 3 weeks applying once a day at night and my skin is almost completely clear!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I felt it penetrate my skin very deeply with the first use.</li>
            <li>The 20% vitamin c definitely did its job fading dark marks and evening out my skin for a brighter, more radiant complexion.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C is known to promote collagen formation, and also to aid in repair of damaged skin, so I can say I definitely have witnessed the positive effect of using this serum as well as supplementing orally.</li>
            <li>but it does clear up acne overnight, sometimes two nights and</li>
            <li>helped clear up my skin</li>
            <li>Formula is clear liquid, almost like an essence rather than serum.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or adverse reactions(my skin is fairly sensitive)</li>
            <li>I have a yellow/ light medium or beige skin undertones, so when my makes scar or begin healing they darken and take a few months to fade.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this regime does not burn or cause any redness.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it a lot</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin,and it didn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>He uses it 2 times per day for 2 weeks &amp; he really does look younger!!  </li>
            <li>Then it soaks in completely.</li>
            <li>Be sure to dab around your eyes, so as not to stretch your delicate skin.  </li>
            <li>Another feature I like is that it is not heavily scented -</li>
            <li>You just need a tiny bit and it feels really moisturizing and luxurious.</li>
            <li>So far is has been helpful there as well.</li>
            <li>and wow.</li>
            <li>but this product has not caused any issues so far.  </li>
            <li>I have natural freckles that are now lightened from using this product.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum is for boosting collagen, and restores skins natural elasticity and helps repair the skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has 20% vitamin C to really tighten and refresh skin, and the vegan hyaluronic acid helps turn back time on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is 71% organic with natural ingredients such as Organic Aloe, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and thin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer and Intensive Youth Eye Gel by Radha Beauty, and the first thing I noticed was that a little goes a long way, which is a huge bonus not only for my ultra-sensitive skin but also for anyone on a budget.</li>
            <li>: In three weeks it didn&#x27;t help my dark circles or reduce the enlarged pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received Radha Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, Intensive Youth Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41,with light frown lines and dull texture.</li>
            <li>Generally I use a serum after exfoliating, and follow it up with a heavier moisturizer to lock in the nutrients and moisturize.</li>
            <li>but I would probably go with a different product just because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that this serum doesn&#x27;t leave behind an oily, greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It is light and other users should know to be careful when pumping as it is not thick so if not ready it may run a bit.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on really easily and a little goes a long way so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews so quickly after receiving a product, especially beauty products, but, this one is an exception.</li>
            <li>After only a week I started noticing something unexpected, my acne scars were starting to vanish, not all of them but enough to notice.</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference on my face--improving wrinkles, dark spots and firming my skin!</li>
            <li>When you remove the cap, you get a nice pump bottle, however, the product comes out as a very thin liquid and fast, which makes it very messy if you aren&#x27;t prepared.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Best Vit C Serum I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It is best used before adding a moisturizer, as the serum will help the skin absorb the moisturizer faster.</li>

            <li> I follow-up with my favorite SPF moisturizer and call it a day!</li>

            <li> Very light weight and good smelling.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to learn that Radha was releasing a Vitamin C Serum!  </li>
            <li> I love Radha Products, this is amazing, this serum has faded my sun spots, I am really happy, I got it as sample, but I would get it again for sure.</li>

            <li> I really did like this one the best .</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews that this went well with the Radha retinol moisturizer which i have been loving, and</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> My thoughts, results and review are honest and unbiased feedback.  </li>
            <li> The gel feels incredibly cooling and fresh as I dab it on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not required to post a favorable review and all opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> It has 20% Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, which are effective in brightening skin.  </li>
            <li> I could honestly tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use this with Radha Beauty&#x27;s retinol moisturizer and eye gel, since I found that I got the best results using the whole</li>
            <li> &amp; AFTER pictures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for honest and unbiased review.</li>

            <li> Wonderful, high quality product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> As you may know, Vitamin C is wonderful for a vibrant, glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> : To work around this, I highly recommend everybody use a cotton ball or cotton pad to apply the product to, instead of your fingers as it greatly helps with product dispersion!  </li>
            <li> I also will say I am pleased with the manufacturer and they follow up to see if you are happy and are easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> I did get this for free, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
            <li> this seems to clean up my skin very nice .</li>
            <li> Eventhough, it didn&#x27;t work very well for me, It somehow worked great on my Mom, plus good costumer service.</li>
            <li> Start with 1 pump as it spreads very easily.  </li>
            <li> Runs between fingers &amp; doesn&#x27;t spread very easily.</li>
            <li> serum is non-greasy, non-sticky, &amp; perfect for sensitive or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with these products.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product could have a nice dropper and a bottle and would be more effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this products.</li>
            <li> This serum is light, potent and highly effective!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect serum to go with the retinol and this most definitely is my favorite so far!  </li>

            <li> COMPLETELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I really love this product....</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The Serum is more of an oil than a lotion so keep that in mind when dispensing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after continued use these benefits will become more visible.</li>
            <li> My skin  looks lifted and the eyes look more lifted.</li>
            <li> thing I love about this serum is that it works.</li>
            <li> When used in conjunction with the Radha Beauty Retinol Moisturizer, all you&#x27;ll feel is velvety-soft, healthy feeling skin.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Ive only used it once and the effect it had felt awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the two together for about two weeks now,every night before bed, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with what I see when I wake up each morning..</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the Vitamin C Serum by Radha Beauty.</li>
            <li> This packaging was so much better than the glass bottle that remind you of medicine droppers.</li>
            <li> I will say I think that this serum is up there with the pricey department store brands but at a much more affordable price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this solution!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and how it feels.  </li>
            <li> I love how this feels when I put it on, not a greasy feeling at all like some others.  </li>
            <li> Love my Radha products.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free, yay!</li>
            <li> Wish they had more.</li>
            <li> love, from, clairebear.</li>
            <li> My mom and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoyed it,could tell a difference,</li>
            <li> I love the results I have seen within one week.</li>
            <li> I love this Serum from Radha Beauty Products and use it day and night - under my SPF moisturizer &amp; makeup during the day, and under a night treatment or cream during the night time before I head to bed.</li>
            <li> I like it:)</li>
            <li> This is where it gets interesting.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin look more even toned, it soaks in immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> it works and it is such a great price!</li>
            <li> and I sure that it helps with my puffy morning eyes</li>
            <li> On a side note, I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say I am a satisfied customer with these products.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it is Vegan AKA Cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> and I do believe my face looks smoother and more healthy.</li>
            <li> The serum goes on silky smooth and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the serum.  </li>
            <li> I will know more as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better since I began using their skin care products.</li>
            <li> and they are fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily and leaves skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cec1506e721d2436cd8fb34cd71a74c4]]After trying many vitamin C serums</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser,</li>
            <li> I ADORE how smooth this makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I do wish, however, that it smelled more like oranges.</li>
            <li> For a more in-depth review, check out my blog post: http://www.gorgeousandstuff.com/2015/02/radha-beauty-review.html</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this for free in order to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum is top notch.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with every product I try from the Rahda Beauty company…</li>
            <li> puffy eyes immediately tighten on application, cools skin as it dries, and the longer I use it the better results I see.  </li>
            <li> It works great alone, and adding a moisturizer after the serum dries really boosts the moisturizing effect of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different products over the years (I&#x27;m 42), but this one makes my face and neck look and feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my face.</li>
            <li> Put some on right away and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Radha Beauty Eye Gel has a light, crisp, cucumber scent that just might be my very favorite scent (I forgot how much I love the smell of cucumber)!  </li>
            <li> serum smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling dramatically refreshed after a long day or a too-short night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> Although I cannot yet speak of long term results, I can attest that after two weeks of using it my skin looks smooth and more flawless than before.  </li>
            <li> im super excited to see what results come from using radha anti aging skin care line !!</li>
            <li> Like all of the Radha beauty products I&#x27;ve tried prior this one is definitely worth the money, a top of the line product at a great price!</li>
            <li> You may see many reviewers got the product free to review it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this serum is how light it is on your skin.</li>
            <li> - I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> thanks for good products.</li>
            <li> received a complimentary sample of this product to try in return for a written review of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is easy to pump out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, sits nicely underneath my foundation and makes my skin feel fresh and restored.</li>
            <li> No smell, easy to use</li>
            <li> It is specially formulated to stimulate collagen production and renew aging skin to a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> I can not judge for the anti-aging or fine lines.</li>
            <li> I cannot clinically say this has changed my fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I am hoping with time I will see fine line reduction and freckles getting lighter.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has started to even out and the serum is making all my fine lines melt away into a radiant glowing spring time skin.</li>
            <li> I can honestly report some positive changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a light feeling formula that smooth&#x27;s easily over the skin.</li>
            <li> These types of serums can help get rid of free radicals and has been proven to stimulate collagen, which will reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> serum has an excellent texture: feels like aloe vera but leaves skin feeling smooth, and tight like a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent hydration, fewer fine lines, and fading acne scars to name just a few things I&#x27;ve noticed.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think this product is great, light weight and can be used under my make up with out any issues of looking oily.</li>
            <li> Huge difference.  </li>
            <li> and I see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I got this free for review</li>
            <li> You may even be brave enough to skip the make-up altogether after using these products for a while!</li>
            <li> I got to try this free for review purposes</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product.  </li>
            <li> Dear rhada feel free to re-stock.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,very nice and helpful c.s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s filled with water...</li>
            <li> When I put it on I love the smell and the fresh feel it gives me combining that with their retinol moisturizer</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling fantastic and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Also, the customer service I received from the company is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy, I finally have a skin care regimen that I will keep!!</li>
            <li> Your doing such great work Radha...</li>
            <li> I did receive a free sample of this for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It’s lighter than feather and leaves your skin baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I put this on right on a fresh face before the Retinol mosturizer that Radha also sent me for free in return for this honest opinion.</li>
            <li> , only one week ago, I am expecting very good results, my skin is very soft and light and is organic which is very important to me,no allergy at all with this, and believe me I am allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found something that works so well that is also made without the use of parabens and other chemicals like so many others.</li>
            <li> I was most impressed by how much lighter my dark spots became.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak for longevity yet as that would take a while but plan to update review when significant changes are visible.  </li>
            <li> As you can see there is a significant reduction in the visibility of my acne scars after using Radha&#x27;s Beauty line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is water...</li>
            <li> The Serum is thin and spreads easily, smells lovely and mild, and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with Retinol Moisturizers for most of my adult life (I swear by them, in fact) and this one does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> His face is full of color, he has a brighter complexion, &amp; I see a new change in him almost every day, and he has NEVER had a breakout or skin irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my skin right away!</li>
            <li> Plus for them being a natural and organic line they have amazing prices.</li>
            <li> The texture of the serum is light and fresh feeling....</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> It’s light and fresh and feels like a cool cucumber bath for your face.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and soaks right into my face.</li>
            <li> I like that this serum is very easy to apply and that it absorbs pretty fast and is non-sticky in texture.</li>
            <li> It noticeably reduced fine lines and wrinkles, even after the first use.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me for free, however, the following views are my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These products are filled with natural, organic ingredients that your skin will love.  </li>
            <li> The cooling gel is a great way to start my early early mornings.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not leave any sort of film on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum as a part of my beauty routine for about two weeks now and feel that I can adequately review my experience with it.  </li>
            <li> Awesome -- I see a big difference in my pores and wrinkles after only a month of use.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this batch will be much better than the last.</li>
            <li> so I appreciated that it helped make my skin seem just kind of brighter and glowier and look overall better.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and I feel that my skin stays much more moisturized when I use this under my regular moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li> This product has a quick absorbing quality and is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> great piece of packaging, this Retinol Moisturizer comes in a tall, sleek, silver bottle with a fancy little pump.  </li>
            <li> really loved their eye gel which I previously tried, so I was excited to try this product as well.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it is fragrance free too.</li>
            <li> so I really like that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> So far I love it,</li>
            <li> and I honestly have not noticed much of a difference in my skin besides it being soft.</li>
            <li> It truly is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best part is that a little bit goes quite a long way, so you&#x27;re most certainly getting true-value-for-your-buck.</li>
            <li> but it soaks right into my skin and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I received the Radha Vitamin C Serum a couple of days ago and while I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see long term results I am looking forward to seeing what awesome changes it will bring to my skin as Vitamin C is a favorite and the most vital piece in my anti-aging beauty arsenal.  </li>
            <li> Right after I shower</li>
            <li> I will also leave positive packaging product reviews because I believe this company TRULY VALUES customer satisfaction!</li>
            <li> The quick absorption and nearly fragrance free scents leave skin feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Combining vegan hyaluronic acid, organic aloe, vitamin E and green tea, the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer is definitely my favorite, but I pretty much love all their products.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it when you can look in the mirror and tell it&#x27;s really working!</li>
            <li> Appart from the all natural ingredients and easy to use packaging</li>
            <li> However,  I have been using the product daily for just over a week along with my sunscreen and have already noticed huge improvements in my skin!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is so important to keep your skin looking young.</li>
            <li> I am at the stage that my skin comes first</li>
            <li> Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li> Just one or two squirts will be more than enough to cover the face and neck area</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a plus when a product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the first Vitamin C serum that I have tried out this year, but it is one my favorites.</li>
            <li> It is reccomended that you use the Serum first and then the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Most make their way to the back of the &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34;  drawer after a couple weeks, because I see no noticeable improvements.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I used it tonight and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My first step, after washing my face, is to apply the Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that if you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can get 100% of your money back, without even returning the bottle.</li>
            <li> I could see and feel a difference in my skin just after the first application.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> From the first time using it</li>
            <li> , I can say that this one is among my top two for scent, performance, and overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my face looks fresh and ready to apply my moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li> I just love and can’t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I simply need to shake up the bottle more to mix it?</li>
            <li> and so that most likely produced the watery consistency that I did not like.</li>
            <li> Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li> the burning from all their harsh chemicals was not doing any good.</li>
            <li> The smile lines which I absolutely detest have pretty much disappeared.</li>
            <li> Both products are very light which may be why it did not wow my skin.</li>
            <li> Although I love all of Radha Beauty products, this is the only one that I didn&#x27;t like so much.</li>
            <li> Since this is a serum rather than a cream, it is highly concentrated, and quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> and I have seen positive results.</li>
            <li> My skin looked better than it had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will most certainly be a long term customer!</li>
            <li> so im super sensitive</li>
            <li> My cheeks and chin are usually dry in the winter time, but since i&#x27;ve been using this, my face retains moisture better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t kind of smell like bug spray and is slightly sticky on your hands for about a min after using.</li>
            <li> it feels like this is a pure, functional product.</li>
            <li> There was an immediate feeling of WOW the very first time I used this.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday before your retinal moisturizer and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is much more even now and although I do not have wrinkles at the current time, I have full faith that this will be beneficial for my future.</li>
            <li> Serum was very thin,and I could not see a difference in about two -months of use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this a lot.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really can feel it feeding your skin.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to my skincare routine now thanks to you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear make up</li>
            <li> This is a very light,thin serum,so it goes straight into the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it seems to brighten my skin</li>
            <li> Very lightweight product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The bottle was dented all over- thanks Amazon shipping.</li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s be real, what matters is the product.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes do 2 application, because my skin really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Just in case anyone is wondering I am an African American male - this stuff works great on my skin and has helped to even my complexion....</li>
            <li> Have not noticed much of s difference.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Absolutes very well.</li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to continuing to use these will crafted products and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really like that it tells me when it was made so there is no question if I&#x27;m getting something that has been sitting in a warehouse for a while.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Vit C serum is very soothing, to soon to see results.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> What is in the bottle very liquid for the serum.</li>
            <li> A few drops covers my whole face nicely, I rub it into my cheeks, chin area and forehead.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which is irritated by almost every cream or serum I try, but this is very gentle</li>
            <li> It has no sticky residue unlike many other Vitamin C serums, and within 3 seconds on my skin, it gets absorbed completely.  </li>
            <li> The gel is thick and spreads easily, but also absorbs very quickly and can be used underneath makeup.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a bit watery, but it spread easily and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hydrating &amp; leaves your skin looking supple &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a significant reduction in lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes and my lip area.</li>
            <li> Because this serum absorbs so quickly, I can move on to my next steps much faster.</li>
            <li> I have begun to experience fine lines from living in the dry desert and find that this has helped reduce those lines.  </li>
            <li> This Cruelty Free serum comes in and kicks butt and takes names for dull, lifeless skin and fine lines/wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, then one day looked in the mirror and was surprised.  </li>
            <li> My skin color has become more uniform and less blotchy.</li>
            <li> I smooth this over my face nd neck, let it dry, and follow with their rosehip oil for a smoothe, glowy complexion.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin shine and look vibrant.</li>
            <li> I will provide more information on this product in the future, after I have used it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a thick and creamy moisturizer that makes for a great final step in the three-step process.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will buy again.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if your skin likes very light moisturizers and things, but if you&#x27;re like me and you need heavy moisturizers then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> Color finnally in my skin, haha, but seriously its a circulation kind of thing.</li>
            <li> It is thinner in consistency than other serums I have tried, and I do feel like it absorbs very quickly into my skin (using it on face and neck).</li>
            <li> The pump is good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received this product free from the company but am expected to do nothing in exchange.  </li>
            <li> and so far didn&#x27;t see much of a change.</li>
            <li> I have tried many beauty products to my face but this is the one that wow me in such a short period of time - a week...</li>
            <li> so I am confident it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Right away i used my Dead Sea Mineral soap to stop any more breakouts, &amp; went back to my old faithful, Radha Eye Gel serum, on my whole face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has almost no scent (maybe a slight citrus or green note if you insist), which is great if you are allergic to perfumes.  </li>
            <li> (it only takes a few seconds) itis important to apply a rich moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> hope this helps someone im always looking for new things to try for my hands</li>
            <li> This product have been a live saver for me.</li>
            <li> in it&#x27;s NEW packaging</li>
            <li> 20% is strong and should cause a slight sting, redness, or dryness.  </li>
            <li> This product makes your skin firmer and very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I tend to loose interest quickly</li>
            <li> Its taken all of 2 or 3 weeks applying once a day at night and my skin is almost completely clear!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I felt it penetrate my skin very deeply with the first use.</li>
            <li> The 20% vitamin c definitely did its job fading dark marks and evening out my skin for a brighter, more radiant complexion.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C is known to promote collagen formation, and also to aid in repair of damaged skin, so I can say I definitely have witnessed the positive effect of using this serum as well as supplementing orally.</li>
            <li> but it does clear up acne overnight, sometimes two nights and</li>
            <li> helped clear up my skin</li>
            <li> Formula is clear liquid, almost like an essence rather than serum.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or adverse reactions(my skin is fairly sensitive)</li>
            <li> I have a yellow/ light medium or beige skin undertones, so when my makes scar or begin healing they darken and take a few months to fade.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this regime does not burn or cause any redness.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it a lot</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin,and it didn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> He uses it 2 times per day for 2 weeks &amp; he really does look younger!!  </li>
            <li> Then it soaks in completely.</li>
            <li> Be sure to dab around your eyes, so as not to stretch your delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> Another feature I like is that it is not heavily scented -</li>
            <li> You just need a tiny bit and it feels really moisturizing and luxurious.</li>
            <li> So far is has been helpful there as well.</li>
            <li> and wow.</li>
            <li> but this product has not caused any issues so far.  </li>
            <li> I have natural freckles that are now lightened from using this product.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum is for boosting collagen, and restores skins natural elasticity and helps repair the skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has 20% vitamin C to really tighten and refresh skin, and the vegan hyaluronic acid helps turn back time on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is 71% organic with natural ingredients such as Organic Aloe, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice and thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer and Intensive Youth Eye Gel by Radha Beauty, and the first thing I noticed was that a little goes a long way, which is a huge bonus not only for my ultra-sensitive skin but also for anyone on a budget.</li>
            <li> : In three weeks it didn&#x27;t help my dark circles or reduce the enlarged pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received Radha Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, Intensive Youth Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41,with light frown lines and dull texture.</li>
            <li> Generally I use a serum after exfoliating, and follow it up with a heavier moisturizer to lock in the nutrients and moisturize.</li>
            <li> but I would probably go with a different product just because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that this serum doesn&#x27;t leave behind an oily, greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It is light and other users should know to be careful when pumping as it is not thick so if not ready it may run a bit.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on really easily and a little goes a long way so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews so quickly after receiving a product, especially beauty products, but, this one is an exception.</li>
            <li> After only a week I started noticing something unexpected, my acne scars were starting to vanish, not all of them but enough to notice.</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference on my face--improving wrinkles, dark spots and firming my skin!</li>
            <li> When you remove the cap, you get a nice pump bottle, however, the product comes out as a very thin liquid and fast, which makes it very messy if you aren&#x27;t prepared.  </li>
            <li> The 0.5 fl oz bottle might not seem like much, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I appreciate how long this product will last me!  </li>
            <li> One significant and dramatic change I have noticed, is the fact that my complexion has truly evened out with continuous use of this product.</li>
            <li> Let dry prior to applying moisturizer - you can feel it work!!</li>
            <li> Let it dry before adding your next beauty product.  </li>
            <li> It definitely has left my skin looking brighter, and the few annoying &amp;#34;forehead lines&amp;#34; I have are greatly diminished in appearance.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long</li>
            <li> (be careful though, sometimes Vitamin C can break you out initially.  </li>
            <li> This serum is different from others I have tried due to its consistency.</li>
            <li> It took a minute to dry</li>
            <li> I am also using a touch of this on my dry legs.  </li>
            <li> It is very fancy and way less messy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now, to help with ocassional post menopause acne and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> and already I have noticed a brightness to my overall skin tone as well as an evenning and fading of some dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have improved skin texture and smaller, less noticeable pores.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C - both topically and as supplements as part of a skincare regimen for the past year and definitely feel that there has been an improvement in the smoothness and tautness of my skin.</li>
            <li> but I have very very dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is also very dry</li>
            <li> so when they say you can use any of their products on sensitive skin they mean it, I was using oil of olay for how long now and</li>
            <li> I had a cluster of little brown acne brown spots on my left cheek</li>
            <li> I like using a serum in addition to my moisturizer because I feel it gives me a little extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I put 1 small squirt in my cupped palm (very watery) and use that small amount to cover my face, neck etc.  </li>
            <li> The consistency was thinner than expected but does not diminish results.</li>
            <li> Just the nourishment my face needs on an icy January day.</li>
            <li> I have been using it only a few days</li>
            <li> and so I feel like it never dries up leaving this wet residue.</li>
            <li> Turns out that the Vitamin C Serum bottles were not very practical for the application of the serum</li>
            <li> Plain and simple...</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes felt tighter, a few days later it seems like the skin is almost smoothing out and the lines look a little less deep.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has virtually no scent at all and just like the eye gel, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and like their eye cream, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin never feels tight or dry, even though CA&#x27;s \\&quot;rainy season\\&quot; is a drought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; in texture, not a thick gel.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll be looking much younger in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Having used other vitamin c serums recommended  by a physician, I don&#x27;t think this product contains vitamin c.  </li>
            <li> Just received this product the other day.</li>
            <li> like other products tend to be that use fillers.)</li>
            <li> This is probably due to the Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> You will still need to use lotion or oil after a few mins b/c my skin felt dry.</li>
            <li> and I still needed to rub it in a little, because a little dab went a long way!</li>
            <li> I will use the rest of the bottle and see if my dark spots are lightened.</li>
            <li> I use about 2 months all my dark spots on face almost  gone .</li>
            <li> I use it in conjuction with the Eye Cream for Dark Circles, which also works vey well.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected- don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I bought this along with Radha Beauty&#x27;s other products and noticed smoother skin that day!</li>
            <li> My eyes are less saggy and my dark circles are diminishing.</li>
            <li> I have a slight allergy to citrus, so I was a bit nervous to try this serum out.</li>
            <li> being clearer and less oily.</li>
            <li> It feels tighter and seems less flabby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it under my eyes and it gave a slight cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> I use about half a pump for both eyes and still have some leftover on my fingers to dab across my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I suggest pumping about half a pump each for cheeks, forehead, nose and chin.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizers I’ve always used would leave that slightly oily and tacky feeling on the surface of my skin and when I would sweat just a little bit it felt like the sweat was trying seep through a wax mask…but</li>
            <li> MY DARK SPOTS ARE DIMINISHING AND FACE IS GLOWING AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it calmed down my acne a lot!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> and I am giving myself a few days to see how I react to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll comment again after I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and let you know how it works.</li>
            <li> After the Vitamin C Serum has FULLY soaked into the skin and dried</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over 1 month on a daily basis and I have never experienced burning, tingling, or too-much-aroma regarding this product -</li>
            <li> This serum is harsh, and irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing improvements in my skin after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no added fragrance, so the scent of this serum isn&#x27;t so heavy that it interferes with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********Disclaimer:  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what my skin didn&#x27;t like about this product, but I did have a little bit of a reaction with redness and also a little bit of drying of my hands.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two days, I like that it is very thin, I can feel a improvement so far.</li>
            <li> I have a cold and mixed it with a few other oils that I have.  </li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m not sure the order matters.</li>
            <li> and I have used some Serums in the past</li>
            <li> I also used this a few times on the rest of m face and neck!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and have noticed a difference in the small wrinkles I have around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually use both of them after I cleanse my face at night.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Radha Beauty Vitamin C Serum is a thin, runny serum that I was not certain</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> This serum is formulated with 2.5% Retinol Complex that provides both immediate and long-term release to promote radiant skin.  </li>
            <li> I always look for at least 20% and this serum does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I try to do it at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> serum in my view should be thick.</li>
            <li> Call me vain, but just because you are 46 doesn&#x27;t mean you have to look like it.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> AND the smell is subtle, almost non-existent, and does not have any scent of citrus.</li>
            <li> Because it was not in a box, I was a little skeptical about the integrity of the product.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> did not work as it specified, poor product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using a serum on my skin, but it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> and age 27 I&#x27;ve been struggle with some random breakouts.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I never leave home without putting some of this serum on my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend this product or this</li>
            <li> the one was a horrible cystic pimple that took forever to go down.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27; t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its not the worst Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a slight allergy to citrus, so I was a bit nervous to try this serum out. I&#x27;m not sure what my skin didn&#x27;t like about this product, but I did have a little bit of a reaction with redness and also a little bit of drying of my hands. Its not the worst Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used but I would probably go with a different product just because my skin is so sensitive. Overall I think this product is great, light weight and can be used under my make up with out any issues of looking oily.</li>
            <li> I like this Vitamin C serum but it&#x27;s out of stock so I can&#x27;t order again .. would order again in a heartbeat if they had it ..</li>
            <li> Serum was very thin,and I could not see a difference in about two -months of use.</li>
            <li> *This product was sent to me for free, however, the following views are my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is non-greasy, non-sticky, &amp; perfect for sensitive or acne-prone skin. It won&#x27;t break you out. It has a pleasant smell &amp; feel to it. It is extremely hydrating &amp; leaves your skin looking supple &amp; healthy. Vitamin C is so important to keep your skin looking young. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the results of Vitamin C Serum anti aging serum by Radha Beauty. I am at the stage that my skin comes first and I only use the best of products. I am using anti aging products and I love this one. I have been using it for 3 months already and I can feel that my skin is tighter.  I love that is organic and it has vitamin C &amp; E which are great to keep skin radiant and youthful looking. Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I have tried many beauty products to my face but this is the one that wow me in such a short period of time - a week...yes just in a week you see drastic results in your face. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND I WILL ORDER AGAIN! MY DARK SPOTS ARE DIMINISHING AND FACE IS GLOWING AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Not good.  Smells fishy and is greasy.  My skin did not like this.</li>
            <li> I really love this product....even after 1 use. It made my skin look so much better, smoother, and flawless!!</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin firmer and very soft. I apply it all over my face and then my moisturizer.  I have used it for about 2 weeks now and can already tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using a serum on my skin, but it seems to be helping. I have begun to experience fine lines from living in the dry desert and find that this has helped reduce those lines.  I was also worried about using a serum close to my eyes, but this has not been an issue. it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn or aggravate my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected- don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I am loving this face serum and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived damages even though the box was intact. Returned.</li>
            <li> I have reordered this serum.  I use it in conjunction with a retinol daily in the evening.  Give it time to work.  At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, then one day looked in the mirror and was surprised.  My skin looked better than it had in a long time.  I apply the c serum then the retinol although I&#x27;m not sure the order matters.</li>
            <li> I got this free for review and I have used some Serums in the past I really did like this one the best . I wanted to try this because I read it works on age spots so I wanted to try this on my hands . now I don&#x27;t have age spots but I have very very dry skin this seems to clean up my skin very nice . you must follow up with a moisturizer . hope this helps someone im always looking for new things to try for my hands and I think I found it</li>
            <li> I exchanged the retinol cream for the vitamin C serum and it is so good!  Used it maybe 4 times and I can already see my skin damage spots getting lighter!  The texture of the serum is light and fresh feeling.... Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Best Vit C Serum I&#x27;ve ever used! I can actually feel the difference in my skin! Like all of the Radha beauty products I&#x27;ve tried prior this one is definitely worth the money, a top of the line product at a great price! Thank you Radha Beauty Products! You&#x27;ve dove it again!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.it is odorless and absorbs easily. its vegan too.rejunavates your skin making it look radiant and smooth.would definitely recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love the feel it gives my skin after a apply!! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day. I use this with the Eye Cream and the Retinol Moisturizer. So lets talk about the container. Another wonderful easy to use push top. The Serum is more of an oil than a lotion so keep that in mind when dispensing. I find my face instantly turns red when I apply this. Color finnally in my skin, haha, but seriously its a circulation kind of thing. It doesnt feel sticky or have any sort of smell. I do notice my&lt;br /&gt;skin being clearer and less oily. It feels tighter and seems less flabby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The consistency was thinner than expected but does not diminish results. Let dry prior to applying moisturizer - you can feel it work!! I look 10 years younger with this and the eye gel!!! LOVING these products!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews so quickly after receiving a product, especially beauty products, but, this one is an exception. From about day 2 I noticed an increased smoothness in the texture of my skin. I use 1 or 2 pumps twice a day and after I do my face, neck and upper chest I put the rest on my hands. I&#x27;m sure after continued use these benefits will become more visible. I really like this a lot.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and good smelling. I have not been using it long but my skin tone has seemed to even out in the areas where I had some darker coloration. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  My skin looks radiant.  My skin  looks lifted and the eyes look more lifted.</li>
            <li> I have been using Radha Argon Oil, Vitamin C Serum and Eye Cream twice a day for a month or so and have not noticed any difference at all.  I will not be reordering these products.</li>
            <li> As you may know, Vitamin C is wonderful for a vibrant, glowing complexion. Add to it Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, Aloe Vera, and Witch Hazel, and you&#x27;ve got a serum that the skin literally craves. Since this is a serum rather than a cream, it is highly concentrated, and quickly absorbed into the skin. A little bit goes a LONG way. Seriously. Just one or two squirts will be more than enough to cover the face and neck area very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love about this serum is that it works. It&#x27;s always a plus when a product does exactly what it claims to do. It definitely has left my skin looking brighter, and the few annoying &amp;#34;forehead lines&amp;#34; I have are greatly diminished in appearance. I also love the fact that this serum doesn&#x27;t leave behind an oily, greasy residue. When used in conjunction with the Radha Beauty Retinol Moisturizer, all you&#x27;ll feel is velvety-soft, healthy feeling skin. You may even be brave enough to skip the make-up altogether after using these products for a while! The difference is something you not only feel, but you see it in the mirror, too.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Ive only used it once and the effect it had felt awesome I have a lupus malar rash on my face so im super sensitive so when they say you can use any of their products on sensitive skin they mean it, I was using oil of olay for how long now and the burning from all their harsh chemicals was not doing any good. im super excited to see what results come from using radha anti aging skin care line !!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks now.  I use it in combination with Radha&#x27;s Eye Gel and Retinol Moisturizing Cream.  So far I am very happy with these products.  My skin looks brighter. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or adverse reactions(my skin is fairly sensitive) I really appreciate that it is fragrance free too. I am looking forward to continue trying more products from the Radha Beauty line when they come out!</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews that this went well with the Radha retinol moisturizer which i have been loving, and oh my goodness, I can see why people love the two together!  I have been looking for the perfect serum to go with the retinol and this most definitely is my favorite so far!  I&#x27;ve been using the two together for about two weeks now,every night before bed, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with what I see when I wake up each morning.. Excellent hydration, fewer fine lines, and fading acne scars to name just a few things I&#x27;ve noticed.  I am so happy to have found something that works so well that is also made without the use of parabens and other chemicals like so many others.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum contains 20% Vitamin-C along with Hyaluronic Acid that is meant to be a de-ager for your skin. It is used to aid in fading sun spots, refine skin texture and reduces wrinkles. It is best used before adding a moisturizer, as the serum will help the skin absorb the moisturizer faster. It is organic and it is Cruelty Free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the first Vitamin C serum that I have tried out this year, but it is one my favorites. These types of serums can help get rid of free radicals and has been proven to stimulate collagen, which will reduce fine lines and wrinkles. The serum can also be used on scars and stretch marks. I always apply a moisturizer after applying the serum to my skin. Overall, I do like this Vitamin C Serum and I recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I got to try this free for review purposes and I actually LOVED IT! helped brighten my skin and improve my skins glow!</li>
            <li> Been using it regularly for two months.  Not a big improvement but it does clear up acne overnight, sometimes two nights and some of my darker age spots are not getting darker so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the Vitamin C Serum by Radha Beauty. I put it under my eyes and it gave a slight cooling sensation. It took a minute to dry and I still needed to rub it in a little, because a little dab went a long way! This packaging was so much better than the glass bottle that remind you of medicine droppers. It is very fancy and way less messy! I have been using it for one week and have seen great results! My eyes are less saggy and my dark circles are diminishing. My eyes are so hydrated! I felt like they looked younger overnight! I also used this a few times on the rest of m face and neck! It gives a nice refreshing feeling and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or sticky! I will say I think that this serum is up there with the pricey department store brands but at a much more affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is easy to pump out of the bottle. It goes on smoothly and soaks right into my face. I put this on twice a day, before my moisturizer. It makes my skin shine and look vibrant. A few drops covers my whole face nicely, I rub it into my cheeks, chin area and forehead. My cheeks and chin are usually dry in the winter time, but since i&#x27;ve been using this, my face retains moisture better. I really enjoy using this solution! It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Vitamin C serum provided for testing.</li>
            <li> I thought the review on this had to be over rated or paid reviews or something. Its no joke, or lie. This stuff works! have never had acne problems ever, but now two kids later and age 27 I&#x27;ve been struggle with some random breakouts. I have a yellow/ light medium or beige skin undertones, so when my makes scar or begin healing they darken and take a few months to fade. Its taken all of 2 or 3 weeks applying once a day at night and my skin is almost completely clear! I had a cluster of little brown acne brown spots on my left cheek all but one is all gone. the one was a horrible cystic pimple that took forever to go down. I will be repurchasing this!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to receive this product. I have only been using it for a couple of days but I already see a difference. A little goes a long way and absorbs quickly. Love the way it makes my skin feel! Thank you Radha!</li>
            <li> Another great Radha product - firming without drying the skin</li>
            <li> Wow! Love this product. I have been using it for about 1 1/2 weeks.  Results are already getting me compliments.  Tips for application:  A little goes a long way.  Let it dry before adding your next beauty product.  You really can feel it feeding your skin.  I use this in conjunction with Radha&#x27;s eye serum and their retinol moisturizer.  AMAZING RESULTS!  This product has a quick absorbing quality and is very powerful.  I have sensitive skin and this regime does not burn or cause any redness.  Highly recommend and will buy again.  I received this product free from the company but am expected to do nothing in exchange.  My thoughts, results and review are honest and unbiased feedback.  I took the time to write this to help those of you considering it to have reliable feedback to help you decide.</li>
            <li> Another awesome product!  Love it and how it feels.  Will always use this product.  Love it!  Thank you for such a great product.  I am so pleased with my Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> I love how this feels when I put it on, not a greasy feeling at all like some others.  Can&#x27;t speak for longevity yet as that would take a while but plan to update review when significant changes are visible.  So far I love it,</li>
            <li> Use this along with Radha eye gel and Moisturizer.  So far I like it a lot it&#x27;s nice and thin goes on very nice. Love my Radha products.</li>
            <li> So I have been using the products for about a1 1/2 weeks and I honestly have not noticed much of a difference in my skin besides it being soft. It is reccomended that you use the Serum first and then the moisturizer. Both products are very light which may be why it did not wow my skin. I can not judge for the anti-aging or fine lines. I can say that my pores remained fairly invisible when using this duo. I would recommend this product if your skin likes very light moisturizers and things, but if you&#x27;re like me and you need heavy moisturizers then this is not for you. Plus for them being a natural and organic line they have amazing prices. I hope they come out with face masks I would love to try those !</li>
            <li> This is the BEST vitamin C serum i have found! It has really made a difference on my face--improving wrinkles, dark spots and firming my skin!</li>
            <li> Thank you Radha for the vitamin C serum! I use it everyday before your retinal moisturizer and my skin has never looked better! I look forward to my skincare routine now thanks to you.</li>
            <li> wish they had it in stock. Cruelty free, yay! helped clear up my skin so yay on that. I don&#x27;t really wear make up so I appreciated that it helped make my skin seem just kind of brighter and glowier and look overall better. Wish they had more. I have oily skin, it didn&#x27;t cause breakouts or anything so yay for that, too. Dear rhada feel free to re-stock. love, from, clairebear.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this vitamin c serum definitely caught my attention.  It looks so luxurious!  And its product did not disappoint me.  The 20% vitamin c definitely did its job fading dark marks and evening out my skin for a brighter, more radiant complexion.  A lot of products like to say &amp;#34;oh, we&#x27;re a brightening serum&amp;#34; and the product does nothing for my skin.  I was happy to find that this one does something.  My mom and I love this stuff.  We can&#x27;t get enough vitamin c serums!</li>
            <li> Its only been a couple days since I received the serum and so far so good.  I have very sensitive skin and I am giving myself a few days to see how I react to it.  Will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,very nice and helpful c.s. This is a very light,thin serum,so it goes straight into the skin.I have sensitive skin,and it didn&#x27;t irritate. Really enjoyed it,could tell a difference,I&#x27;m 41,with light frown lines and dull texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s filled with water... There is no serum in this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this vitamin C serum for about a week. I like using a serum in addition to my moisturizer because I feel it gives me a little extra moisture. I have brown spots from my pregnancy about a year ago and even though it&#x27;s been a week I think they have already started lightening some. This serum goes on and absorbs very quickly. Seems to be doing the trick!</li>
            <li> I put this on right on a fresh face before the Retinol mosturizer that Radha also sent me for free in return for this honest opinion. I love whoever comes up with the packaging for these products the look is great. When I put it on I love the smell and the fresh feel it gives me combining that with their retinol moisturizer I got a smoother fresher brighter looking skin when is great trying to get rid of my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love the results I have seen within one week.</li>
            <li> I like it combined with LA Crème, I like the way my face feels, will keep you posted after I have used it for a month and let you know if I see the difference on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this vitamin c serum for almost two weeks and I have seen positive results. My skin color has become more uniform and less blotchy. I have improved skin texture and smaller, less noticeable pores. I have also noticed a significant reduction in lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes and my lip area. My skin has become noticeably &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; as one of my friends recently commented. I have been using the Radha Beauty Retinol Moisturizing Cream along with this Vitamin C Serum and I have been very pleased, and impressed by the results. I have tried several different products from a lot of different manufacturers over the years. Most make their way to the back of the &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34;  drawer after a couple weeks, because I see no noticeable improvements. I tend to loose interest quickly if I can&#x27;t see that something is working for me. I like the Radha Beauty product line because I started to see results almost immediately after I started using them. I also like the price, it&#x27;s worth it when you can look in the mirror and tell it&#x27;s really working! I received a sample of this product and decided to give it a try.  I am really glad I gave it a chance!! I will most certainly be a long term customer!</li>
            <li> I love this Serum from Radha Beauty Products and use it day and night - under my SPF moisturizer &amp; makeup during the day, and under a night treatment or cream during the night time before I head to bed. Vitamin C has been a great help in shielding the skin from harmful radicals, sun exposure, etc. Needless to say, I never leave home without putting some of this serum on my face. One significant and dramatic change I have noticed, is the fact that my complexion has truly evened out with continuous use of this product. It truly is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Very good work. ..I like it:)</li>
            <li> Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;  While I do like this item, I give it mixed reviews. Around my 10th day of use, I did, in fact, develop a localized breakout around my chin, &amp; sides of face when used it with another moisturizer. Right away i used my Dead Sea Mineral soap to stop any more breakouts, &amp; went back to my old faithful, Radha Eye Gel serum, on my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;  This is where it gets interesting. The bottle was lying around unused for a couple days in the bedroom, &amp; my husband got his hands on it. He RAVES on the change in his appearance!! He uses it 2 times per day for 2 weeks &amp; he really does look younger!!  His face is full of color, he has a brighter complexion, &amp; I see a new change in him almost every day, and he has NEVER had a breakout or skin irritation of any kind. He is running low now, &amp; asked me to order him another bottle asap.  I read about some factory-issues over the bottle caps. but neither my hubby or I didn&#x27;t have problems with that. THX RADHA!</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin look more even toned, it soaks in immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky feeling.  I don&#x27;t know why they discontinued it because I love it!</li>
            <li> This serum is different from others I have tried due to its consistency. It&#x27;s thin and &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; in texture, not a thick gel. I really like the way it seems to brighten my skin and I don&#x27;t need to use a lge amount to get results. I smooth this over my face nd neck, let it dry, and follow with their rosehip oil for a smoothe, glowy complexion. Nice product!!</li>
            <li> Very lightweight product. I used it tonight and my skin feels soft and smooth. I&#x27;ll comment again after I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and let you know how it works. I like that it is vegan and has a money-back guarantee. Hopefully I&#x27;ll be looking much younger in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now, to help with ocassional post menopause acne and dark spots.  I&#x27;m truly seeing a difference.  I put 1 small squirt in my cupped palm (very watery) and use that small amount to cover my face, neck etc.  Then followup with matching moisturizer.  Acne dramatically reduced and spots fading.  I will keep using!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Plain and simple... it works and it is such a great price!</li>
            <li> My only concern is the products packaging. Because it was not in a box, I was a little skeptical about the integrity of the product. However,  I have been using the product daily for just over a week along with my sunscreen and have already noticed huge improvements in my skin! People have mentioned that my skin is *glowing.* I also love that the product is Vegan!</li>
            <li> this is a great product!  i have a sunspot on my face that is fading.  it leaves my skin feeling fantastic and smooth.  highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used it for about a week and so far didn&#x27;t see much of a change. It doesn&#x27;t kind of smell like bug spray and is slightly sticky on your hands for about a min after using. Then it soaks in completely. The bottle was dented all over- thanks Amazon shipping. The pump is good and a little goes a long way. It has the viscosity of water and a yellow tint. I will use the rest of the bottle and see if my dark spots are lightened. You will still need to use lotion or oil after a few mins b/c my skin felt dry. I recommend rosehip from RAHDA. I also will say I am pleased with the manufacturer and they follow up to see if you are happy and are easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> These products are filled with natural, organic ingredients that your skin will love.  I tested these products as a three-step system. My first step, after washing my face, is to apply the Eye Gel.  The 0.5 fl oz bottle might not seem like much, but a little goes a long way so I am confident it will last a long time.  I use about half a pump for both eyes and still have some leftover on my fingers to dab across my forehead.  Be sure to dab around your eyes, so as not to stretch your delicate skin.  Radha Beauty Eye Gel has a light, crisp, cucumber scent that just might be my very favorite scent (I forgot how much I love the smell of cucumber)!  The gel is thick and spreads easily, but also absorbs very quickly and can be used underneath makeup.  The gel feels incredibly cooling and fresh as I dab it on my eyes.  Like I said, I also put this on my forehead but it can be used as an allover facial treatment for enhanced glow radiance.  I cannot clinically say this has changed my fine lines and wrinkles but it feels great on my face and I sure that it helps with my puffy morning eyes (I have puffy morning eyes).  The cooling gel is a great way to start my early early mornings.  After the eye gel I apply the Vitamin C Serum all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Radha Beauty Vitamin C Serum is a thin, runny serum that I was not certain I would like but it soaks right into my skin and does not feel greasy.  It is specially formulated to stimulate collagen production and renew aging skin to a more youthful appearance.  It has virtually no scent at all and just like the eye gel, a little goes a long way.  Start with 1 pump as it spreads very easily.  I like this serum and I think it has already begun to improve my skin tone.  I will provide more information on this product in the future, after I have used it for several weeks. On a side note, I love the packaging. The final step?  After the Vitamin C Serum has FULLY soaked into the skin and dried (it only takes a few seconds) itis important to apply a rich moisturizer.  Enter the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great piece of packaging, this Retinol Moisturizer comes in a tall, sleek, silver bottle with a fancy little pump.  But let&#x27;s be real, what matters is the product.  I have been in love with Retinol Moisturizers for most of my adult life (I swear by them, in fact) and this one does not disappoint.  This serum is formulated with 2.5% Retinol Complex that provides both immediate and long-term release to promote radiant skin.  The Retinol increases cell turnover rate to give you newer, brighter skin.  It is a thick and creamy moisturizer that makes for a great final step in the three-step process.  I love that it is 71% organic with natural ingredients such as Organic Aloe, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter.  So moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am a satisfied customer with these products.  The best part is that if you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can get 100% of your money back, without even returning the bottle. The customer service is incredible.</li>
            <li> Eventhough, it didn&#x27;t work very well for me, It somehow worked great on my Mom, plus good costumer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C serum by Radha Beauty for three weeks and I&#x27;m impressed with the results. I&#x27;ve been using Radha Beauty&#x27;s Intensive Youth Eye Gel in conjunction with their Retinol Moisturizer and Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate question is does it work? After only a week I started noticing something unexpected, my acne scars were starting to vanish, not all of them but enough to notice. I have had acne scar patches on both temples for several years. Nothing has worked at reducing them. I&#x27;ve been documenting the results so others could see for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the attached photo I&#x27;ve compared the before photo, week one, and week three side by side. As you can see there is a significant reduction in the visibility of my acne scars after using Radha&#x27;s Beauty line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness Ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing: *****&lt;br /&gt;Dark Circle Correction: Not observed&lt;br /&gt;Fine Line and Wrinkle Correction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Acne Scar Correction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness Reduction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Improved Texture and Tone: ****&lt;br /&gt;Pore Reduction: Not observed&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating: *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: No adverse reactions, didn’t cause acne breakouts, didn’t cause redness or any irritation, and exceeded my expectations at repairing damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: In three weeks it didn&#x27;t help my dark circles or reduce the enlarged pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received Radha Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, Intensive Youth Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer complimentary for testing purposes. I&#x27;m not required to post a favorable review and all opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum! I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer and Intensive Youth Eye Gel by Radha Beauty, and the first thing I noticed was that a little goes a long way, which is a huge bonus not only for my ultra-sensitive skin but also for anyone on a budget. An advocate for daily SPF, I&#x27;ve been using each one of these products with my already established moisturizing regimen and there are no signs of residual oil or irritation. The quick absorption and nearly fragrance free scents leave skin feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Combining vegan hyaluronic acid, organic aloe, vitamin E and green tea, the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer is definitely my favorite, but I pretty much love all their products. Wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Sponsored review:  Radha Beauty provided this item in exchange with my opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved their eye gel which I previously tried, so I was excited to try this product as well.  and I wasn&#x27; t disappointed.  This serum is fantastic.  It has almost no scent (maybe a slight citrus or green note if you insist), which is great if you are allergic to perfumes.  It has 20% Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, which are effective in brightening skin.  Formula is clear liquid, almost like an essence rather than serum.  It has no sticky residue unlike many other Vitamin C serums, and within 3 seconds on my skin, it gets absorbed completely.  I sometimes do 2 application, because my skin really like this stuff.  I have done 2 application twice a day.  (be careful though, sometimes Vitamin C can break you out initially.  If this happens, back out the use to just once a day, and see if it improves before increasing the usage).  I would recommend this product.  Also, the customer service I received from the company is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Simply Amazing! Finally, something that actually works for men as well as women!!! The smile lines which I absolutely detest have pretty much disappeared. Call me vain, but just because you are 46 doesn&#x27;t mean you have to look like it. Just in case anyone is wondering I am an African American male - this stuff works great on my skin and has helped to even my complexion....</li>
            <li> did not work as it specified, poor product</li>
            <li> Have not noticed much of s difference. Hard to use. Runs between fingers &amp; doesn&#x27;t spread very easily.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! I have been using it for a few days now and I can already tell the difference. I also love that it is Vegan AKA Cruelty free! I highly reccomend. It works best in conjunction with the moisturizer for best results!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: compensation for this review was in the form of the serum and accompanying products via Brandbacker &amp; Radha Beauty, but opinions are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin c serum was integrated into my beauty routine the day after receiving it (like 3 weeks ago) and I am still using it to this day. The texture is a bit watery, but it spread easily and dried quickly. AND the smell is subtle, almost non-existent, and does not have any scent of citrus. It did not irritate my skin, and my skin felt and looked bright and radiant after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy, I finally have a skin care regimen that I will keep!! 3 of Rahda Beauty Products are included in my routine! After cleansing and toning, I apply Rahda&#x27;s Eye Gel, Vitamin C Serum, then the Retinol Moisturizer.  I could see and feel a difference in my skin just after the first application. I&#x27;m on day 3 of using Rahda&#x27;s products and I&#x27;m more than happy with the results!!!</li>
            <li> Having used other vitamin c serums recommended  by a physician, I don&#x27;t think this product contains vitamin c.  20% is strong and should cause a slight sting, redness, or dryness.  This product does nothing.</li>
            <li> Great item! I love using vitamin c on my skin! I did get this for free, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
            <li> GREAT vitamin C serum.  I always look for at least 20% and this serum does the trick.  I was most impressed by how much lighter my dark spots became.  My skin tone is definitely beginning to even out.  I recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin, very refreshing</li>
            <li> Great product - I love it! It noticeably reduced fine lines and wrinkles, even after the first use. I have very sensitive skin which is irritated by almost every cream or serum I try, but this is very gentle and I&#x27;ve had no problems using it at all. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> Radha sends you emails updating the status of your order and also sends you a &amp;#34;How to use&amp;#34; your Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;ve been using this line of products for over two weeks and I do believe my face looks smoother and more healthy. You may see many reviewers got the product free to review it but I bought these products. I have to say this order is my second and I plan on sticking with this line. Happy customer here!</li>
            <li> Just received this product the other day. Just love it! The serum goes on silky smooth and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! Keep your awesome products coming!&lt;br /&gt;Carleen</li>
            <li> I received the Radha Vitamin C Serum a couple of days ago and while I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see long term results I am looking forward to seeing what awesome changes it will bring to my skin as Vitamin C is a favorite and the most vital piece in my anti-aging beauty arsenal.  Was very excited to learn that Radha was releasing a Vitamin C Serum!  I love the consistency of the serum.  It is light and other users should know to be careful when pumping as it is not thick so if not ready it may run a bit. I suggest pumping about half a pump each for cheeks, forehead, nose and chin.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave any sort of film on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to start seeing a decrease in wrinkles and spots over the next week or so. I will update the review with further use to detail.</li>
            <li> This is the best vitamin c serum . I use about 2 months all my dark spots on face almost  gone .</li>
            <li> I had just received the Vitamin C Serum for Face. I have used it for two days, I like that it is very thin, I can feel a improvement so far. I will know more as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  Radha has done it again with another home run.  I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and have noticed a difference in the small wrinkles I have around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and I really like it. It is thinner in consistency than other serums I have tried, and I do feel like it absorbs very quickly into my skin (using it on face and neck). Generally I use a serum after exfoliating, and follow it up with a heavier moisturizer to lock in the nutrients and moisturize. Because this serum absorbs so quickly, I can move on to my next steps much faster. Another feature I like is that it is not heavily scented - it feels like this is a pure, functional product. I have been using Vitamin C - both topically and as supplements as part of a skincare regimen for the past year and definitely feel that there has been an improvement in the smoothness and tautness of my skin. Vitamin C is known to promote collagen formation, and also to aid in repair of damaged skin, so I can say I definitely have witnessed the positive effect of using this serum as well as supplementing orally.</li>
            <li> This serum is light, potent and highly effective! Appart from the all natural ingredients and easy to use packaging I can honestly report some positive changes to my skin. It has been about 2 weeks since I started using and already I have noticed a brightness to my overall skin tone as well as an evenning and fading of some dark spots. I like that this serum is very easy to apply and that it absorbs pretty fast and is non-sticky in texture. I follow-up with my favorite SPF moisturizer and call it a day!</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin really soft and smooth. It goes on really easily and a little goes a long way so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> What a great product!! Your doing such great work Radha...I am a fan for life!! This serum is so light on my face and the feel of it is refreshing!</li>
            <li> Absolutes very well. Great price for the value</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the Vitamin C Serum, a perfect complement to the other excellent Radha Beauty products I have tried. The Serum is thin and spreads easily, smells lovely and mild, and feels wonderful. Just the nourishment my face needs on an icy January day. I am really looking forward to continuing to use these will crafted products and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum as a part of my beauty routine for about two weeks now and feel that I can adequately review my experience with it.  It goes on smoothly, sits nicely underneath my foundation and makes my skin feel fresh and restored. Although I cannot yet speak of long term results, I can attest that after two weeks of using it my skin looks smooth and more flawless than before.  I think my skin tone looks more even when I wash off my makeup, too!</li>
            <li> This is a light feeling formula that smooth&#x27;s easily over the skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and like their eye cream, a little goes a long way. My skin looks so much better since I began using their skin care products.</li>
            <li> For now , it works , i am using it with my Dermawand  kit , only one week ago, I am expecting very good results, my skin is very soft and light and is organic which is very important to me,no allergy at all with this, and believe me I am allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a Vitamin C Serum before. But looking around on Amazon I found this and with the good reviews I decided to give it a shot. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. From the first time using it I could honestly tell a difference. The skin around my eyes felt tighter, a few days later it seems like the skin is almost smoothing out and the lines look a little less deep. I would have no hesitations on ordering this again or recommending this to a friend, which I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I will also say I love the sticker on the packaging! Really like that it tells me when it was made so there is no question if I&#x27;m getting something that has been sitting in a warehouse for a while.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot. I could tell a difference in my skin right away! You just need a tiny bit and it feels really moisturizing and luxurious. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily or anything. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have all of their products  and they are fantastic! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> There was an immediate feeling of WOW the very first time I used this.  The serum smells great, spreads well and is in a really nice pump bottle.  I will defiantly tell my friends about this item.  I can see a difference in the over all health of my skin and my face is not nearly as red as it has been from age and sun exposure.  I am also using a touch of this on my dry legs.  So far is has been helpful there as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!! It&#x27;s not oily and leaves skin silky smooth! I have been using it only a few days and I can already notice healthier skin!! Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is water...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cec1506e721d2436cd8fb34cd71a74c4]]After trying many vitamin C serums, I can say that this one is among my top two for scent, performance, and overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling dramatically refreshed after a long day or a too-short night&#x27;s sleep.  After a week of twice daily use, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is firmer, smoother, and brighter.  My skin never feels tight or dry, even though CA&#x27;s \\&quot;rainy season\\&quot; is a drought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 1-2 pumps of this serum for each application; that&#x27;s enough for both my face and my neck.  I appreciate how long this product will last me!  I prefer to use this with Radha Beauty&#x27;s retinol moisturizer and eye gel, since I found that I got the best results using the whole set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the end of the video for my BEFORE &amp; AFTER pictures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The Vit C serum is very soothing, to soon to see results.  I love the dispenser, the serum not coming in contact with the air will definitely preserve the potency of the product.</li>
            <li> It feels nice.we shall see if it works over time.</li>
            <li> Awesome -- I see a big difference in my pores and wrinkles after only a month of use.  I try to do it at least once a day.  Huge difference.  I use it with the Retinol Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 4 days and wow. Softer skin and a breakout has healed in record time. I have also noticed a brighter look to my face if that makes sense. I use this with instanatural retinal cream and I do see changes in my skin. I am hoping with time I will see fine line reduction and freckles getting lighter. I have very sensitive skin but this product has not caused any issues so far.  My skin is also very dry and I feel that this product has helped with that as well.</li>
            <li> I tried the Vitamin C Serum and thought it made my skin visibly tighter, and brighter. I have natural freckles that are now lightened from using this product. I felt it penetrate my skin very deeply with the first use. Vitamin C Serum is for boosting collagen, and restores skins natural elasticity and helps repair the skin from sun damage. This product does just that! It restores your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that this product doesn&#x27;t have a very strong fragrance. It smells sort of like aloe, which is pleasant.  The product was not sticky. It absorbs quickly.  A little goes a long way. Huge Pro: Vegan! Made with Organic ingredients and it&#x27;s animal cruelty free!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: My only dislike is the packaging of this product. When you remove the cap, you get a nice pump bottle, however, the product comes out as a very thin liquid and fast, which makes it very messy if you aren&#x27;t prepared.  I feel this product could have a nice dropper and a bottle and would be more effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: To work around this, I highly recommend everybody use a cotton ball or cotton pad to apply the product to, instead of your fingers as it greatly helps with product dispersion!  I also recommend using this product after washing your face &amp; using a toner, &amp; prior to eye gel or moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I ADORE how smooth this makes my skin feel! I&#x27;ve been using it over 1 month on a daily basis and I have never experienced burning, tingling, or too-much-aroma regarding this product - and that is all VERY important to me! My face feels nourished and replenished each time I use this product. The best part is that a little bit goes quite a long way, so you&#x27;re most certainly getting true-value-for-your-buck. I will also leave positive packaging product reviews because I believe this company TRULY VALUES customer satisfaction! I&#x27;m a customer for life!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, high quality product at an amazing price. I bought this along with Radha Beauty&#x27;s other products and noticed smoother skin that day! Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I really loved this serum! I use it in the morning and at night! I did notice it brightened up my face a lot and gave me younger looking skin! I do wish, however, that it smelled more like oranges. But, that doesn&#x27;t even matter when you have a great product that works wonders. I also noticed that it calmed down my acne a lot! It shrunk them a lot, too. I did receive a free sample of this for testing purposes. For a more in-depth review, check out my blog post: http://www.gorgeousandstuff.com/2015/02/radha-beauty-review.html</li>
            <li> It states allow 45 days to see change in face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I really like it.  It absorbs very quickly and I feel that my skin stays much more moisturized when I use this under my regular moisturizer and makeup.  No greasy feel later in the day, though.  I use it both morning and night.</li>
            <li> I had to go back and edit all of my Radha Beauty reviews, because after a week of use I started having issues.  This serum is harsh, and irritates my skin.  I used in once a day and waited 15 minutes to put on the Retinol serum.  My skin started getting dryer in spots, almost like scales.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend this product or this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this for free in order to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum is top notch.  I like to use it at night and wake up in the morning and my face looks fresh and ready to apply my moisturizer and makeup.  It has helped my wrinkles and the skin tone as well.  I am very satisfied with this product and have recommended it to friends.  thanks for good products.</li>
            <li> Not a difference in wrinkles and have been using for 2 weeks faithfully morning and night. Will finish using to see if any changes until gone.</li>
            <li> This product have been a live saver for me. This goes on very smooth and works great with my skin. I use it in conjuction with the Eye Cream for Dark Circles, which also works vey well. Right after I shower I apply the eye cream, and then I apply this upon my entire face and neck. I have been using this product for almost a month now and I see a huge difference. My skin tone is much more even now and although I do not have wrinkles at the current time, I have full faith that this will be beneficial for my future. Vitamin C is GREAT for your skin. Now all I need is the Retinol moisturizer and I will be all set with the Radha Beauty line.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with every product I try from the Rahda Beauty company…but, I am really loving this C serum! It’s light and fresh and feels like a cool cucumber bath for your face. My skin tone has started to even out and the serum is making all my fine lines melt away into a radiant glowing spring time skin. I apply this serum to my entire face, neck, and upper chest/shoulder area. One of my favorite things about this serum is how light it is on your skin. After applying the serum and it has soaked in you can’t even feel it. It’s lighter than feather and leaves your skin baby butt smooth. The moisturizers I’ve always used would leave that slightly oily and tacky feeling on the surface of my skin and when I would sweat just a little bit it felt like the sweat was trying seep through a wax mask…but NOT with this serum! It hydrates and cools my skin like nothing I’ve tried before. I just love and can’t say enough about it. This is a must have for every lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this product to try in return for a written review of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> for my wife she said she liked it</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> No smell, easy to use and I&#x27;m seeing improvements in my skin after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This Cruelty Free serum comes in and kicks butt and takes names for dull, lifeless skin and fine lines/wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 20% vitamin C to really tighten and refresh skin, and the vegan hyaluronic acid helps turn back time on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks great now, puffy eyes immediately tighten on application, cools skin as it dries, and the longer I use it the better results I see.  This really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part is the money back guarantee is a lifetime guarantee so if you don&#x27;t like it at any time, no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has an excellent texture: feels like aloe vera but leaves skin feeling smooth, and tight like a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no sticky or oily residue after using this serum.  It works great alone, and adding a moisturizer after the serum dries really boosts the moisturizing effect of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no added fragrance, so the scent of this serum isn&#x27;t so heavy that it interferes with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********Disclaimer:  I received product in exchange for review.  However, all opinions stated are 100% honest and my exclusive opinion.***********</li>
            <li> Put some on right away and loved it.  The peppermint came just in time.  I have a cold and mixed it with a few other oils that I have.  I&#x27;m breathing easier now.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I had heard the benefits of using vitamin C for the face, as well as multiple reasons to use organic and vegan  -- well, this product delivers all those benefits. I am thrilled. I have tried tons of different products over the years (I&#x27;m 42), but this one makes my face and neck look and feel wonderful. (It&#x27;s a liquid, not a cream -- like other products tend to be that use fillers.)</li>
            <li> I love Radha Products, this is amazing, this serum has faded my sun spots, I am really happy, I got it as sample, but I would get it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Radha&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is pretty awesome! Using this with the Retinol Cream together make a perfect duo for my face. I usually use both of them after I cleanse my face at night. No doubt, this makes my face feel alot moisturized in the morning!!</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my face.</li>
            <li> Although I love all of Radha Beauty products, this is the only one that I didn&#x27;t like so much. In my opinion, the consistency feels too watery and so I feel like it never dries up leaving this wet residue. This is probably due to the Vitamin C. Perhaps I simply need to shake up the bottle more to mix it? Not sure. Overall though I like this product, but I would only use it as treatment to wear around the house..  EDIT**  Turns out that the Vitamin C Serum bottles were not very practical for the application of the serum and so that most likely produced the watery consistency that I did not like. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying this serum though in it&#x27;s NEW packaging and I&#x27;m sure this batch will be much better than the last. Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li> serum in my view should be thick. What is in the bottle very liquid for the serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks now. So far I am very happy with this products. My skin looks brighter. My skin is very sensitive so I really like that it is fragrance free.</li>
