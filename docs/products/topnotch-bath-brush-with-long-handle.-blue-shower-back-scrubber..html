            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Great price on this brush.  </li>
            <li>The ridges on the handle help you to maintain a grip, and the bristles are great for exfoliating and cleaning in hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I am happy to recommend it.</li>
            <li>Offered to me for evaluation and review, I find this shower brush one of the best of its kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice brush in my opinion, if you decide to try it, I think that youâ€™ll like it</li>
            <li>I think the manufacturer (TopNotch) did a great job to achieve a good balance.  </li>

            <li>Loving this brush!</li>

            <li>Good value.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I got this brush in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good to have hanging in the shower.</li>
            <li>I was happy to receive this shower brush for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>A good brush that seems well made.</li>
            <li>Good reach and well made.</li>
            <li>The had was good, but the handle was truly inferior.  </li>
            <li>It did come here on time and undamaged and it had a sturdy one piece handle and good medium bristles.  </li>
            <li>Length of handle is good, angled brush works</li>
            <li>This is a good brush with medium bristles.  </li>
            <li>Good points: plastic, so it wont get moldy.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a good length and it has a tie on the end to hang it up.</li>
            <li>Good customer service.</li>
            <li>good brush for a good price, love it!</li>
            <li>the price is good, the length of the handle is perfect, and the bristles are just the right texture and level of hardness or softness, depending on how you look at it.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did it still is great for the shower.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>So a versatile, quality product that seems very easy to keep in good shape, and adds that touch of luxury to your bathroom routine.  </li>
            <li>Love it and you!</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li>Feels great, but the handle snaps too easily under use.</li>
            <li>Great product, performs as described and looks fine.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, nice color, works well in shower or bath.</li>
            <li>While there is nothing spectacular about this brush</li>
            <li>This bath and shower brush is nice to have hanging in the shower.</li>
            <li>Nice brush.</li>
            <li>Nice quality brush.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not in our way even though it&#x27;s a nice size of 15\\</li>
            <li>Bristles give the skin a nice work-out without feeling scratchy.  </li>
            <li>I liked the handle&#x27;s grip which made it a bit easier to hold on to the brush if your hands are soapy.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice firmness of bristles.</li>
            <li>A wee bend in the handle end to hang the brush from the shower curtain rail would be handy.  </li>
            <li>The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a good brush to rely on for skin brushing and keepiing your skin healthy and glowing.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked it to be a touch softer but it should soften over time.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>squeaky clean with a great feeling that exfoliating gives.</li>
            <li>otherwise this company has great products and quick safe delivery plus you can&#x27;t beat the 1 YEAR GUARANTEE Courtesy of Top notch !&lt;</li>
            <li>The curve in the handle gives good leverage and reach, and the end of the handle has textured grooves to provide a secure grip, even with a soapy hand.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there was a way the handle could snap into the brush so the two could be detachable for greater</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and she seems pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am a repeat buyer- great brush, good curve to the handle, nice mid level stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li>But is okay and gives a good clean.</li>
            <li>Truly, there is nothing like a good brush to  get a good scrubbing on all sections of your body  in the shower, leaving  you  feeling, clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Very nice brush!&lt;br /&gt;Really like the length and pretty color of this bath brush.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I would like it even more if they offered a version with softer or milder bristles.  </li>
            <li>; on the handle would make this a more universally appealing product.</li>
            <li>well its an OK brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best shower brush I&#x27;ve personally owned.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many bath brushes we have bought over the years.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The brush works ok</li>
            <li>and I was glad because I didn&#x27;t want to scratch up my skin.</li>
            <li>We love this brush.</li>
            <li>this body brush does the job correctly and now his skin feels more softener , and we put this in bathroom hung it up on hook with cord</li>
            <li>my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A WONDERFUL BACK BRUSH.  </li>
            <li>But it turns out to be perfect, and I love the feel of the brush on my back!  </li>
            <li>the most part, it&#x27;s a quality brush.  </li>
            <li>Head appears ok.</li>
            <li>I find it perfect for my back while in the shower.</li>
            <li>My  elderly husband has used the brush many times in the shower and loves it.</li>
            <li>work OK</li>
            <li>Love this one.</li>
            <li>there are some grooves for gripping</li>
            <li>Now that is one of my favorite ways to use the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That works, but it would make for an even more luxurious feel if I didn&#x27;t have to change hands and directions so often while using the brush in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The hanging loop allows me to make sure the brush is left in the best position for air drying between shower</li>
            <li>in all I have to say I&#x27;m enjoying using this bath brush.  </li>
            <li>I would love it if the handle was about 1/3 longer and also wider.</li>
            <li>Bristles scratch more than they brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK otherwise</li>
            <li>Thus, the Top Notch Backscrubber is an excellent candidate for a gift, or for personal use.</li>
            <li>well, brush is nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice brush and very well made.</li>
            <li>Neither of us is that tall, and we both have pretty good flexibility.</li>
            <li>It has &amp;#34;grippers&amp;#34; on the bottom of the handle so that it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands and is a pretty good length.  </li>
            <li>that well, though they do a pretty good job trapping body hair,</li>
            <li>Great brush, good length and feels good on the back, not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>After doing my due diligence, I have found that many, many China products contain LEAD!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Overall, the construction of product is very good.</li>
            <li>; it is a very good back brush.</li>
            <li>This is a simple body brush at a very good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s roughness is perfect for feet, which are tough and love a good scrub.</li>
            <li>Nice long handle with great grip.</li>
            <li>The perfect length for any bath brush, but since it&#x27;s all plastic, the bristles are way too rough for skin.</li>
            <li>you rough up the handle with some sand paper and dip the end in Rubber Dip tool coating I suspect this could be the perfect fix for someone who already owns this brush.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a good product, at a reasonable price, that delivers what it says it will.</li>
            <li>This bath brush has a sturdy grooved handle, nice oval head, stiffer bristles and is just the right length to reach all of the spots.  </li>
            <li>Despite what other reviews may say, I found this brush perfect for me.</li>
            <li>great product great price, cleans the way you want but not too hard.</li>
            <li>Nice and hard bristles, perfect length, and lite weight.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I am able to clean my feet satisfactorily and it doesn&#x27;t tickle.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>I expected a nice brush but for me it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Looks good, feels good, works as expected.</li>
            <li>First off,  I liked the color of the brush.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this brush was how nice it felt in my hand when I held it.  </li>
            <li>Its fine, well made &amp; all that.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>A fine back-brush.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>After all the scratches healed, it was fine.  </li>
            <li>For me it is just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you are in the market for a sturdy backscrubber, the Top Notch Backscrubber is a worthy candidate that I can recommend.</li>
            <li>Great back brush</li>
            <li>Great simple brush.</li>
            <li>: I received a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li>Do not hate it but the brushing quality is lacking..</li>
            <li>This brush fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li>I received this product free for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My brand X brush has good density but the bristles are too soft for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the good job it did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After taking my morning showers with my new body brush, I found that it did exactly as advertised (very good quality brush) and is worth what it will cost you.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I bought it to scrub my back but find that it&#x27;s a very effective for arms legs, hands and feet as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, new, good price &amp; warranty.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy handle and nice full head of bristles.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this brush</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>A good product for general brushes/scrubbing though.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this back brush</li>
            <li>I like the stiffness they clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had any problem with rinsing the soap out of the bristles; the brush rinses clean every time.  </li>
            <li>I like that feeling though, after using this thing in the shower I feel like I am extremely clean when I come out.</li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>Exactly as it was described, and it does a great job on the back!  </li>
            <li>Good basic brush.  </li>
            <li>The handle grip on it allowed me to have full control.</li>
            <li>Good back scrubber.</li>
            <li>This brush is very sturdy and the bristles will wear out after many years of service before THIS one cracks.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and nice, but it has that cheap brittle plastic handle that broke the first time it was dropped in the shower.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a very good replacement for my old worn out one.</li>
            <li>synthetic bristles are kind to the skin but sufficiently firm to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Not as long as I thought, but the brush is dense and good quality.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tear the flesh or anything that extreme, but it will most certainly leave skin bright</li>
            <li>Ahhh, my back has never felt better!</li>
            <li>exactly as promised!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect for our use, exactly what we were looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Build is fine, but the bristles of the brush are much stiffer than I expected by a fair margin.</li>
            <li>As good as I expected it.</li>
            <li>Might be useful to scrub the shower walls.</li>
            <li>I really liked this shower brush, it has just enough firmness.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a thoroughly useful tool.</li>
            <li>Way too short to be effective.</li>
            <li>brush it the right size and the bristles are the right stiffness for me.  </li>
            <li>Bristles were just right.  </li>
            <li>Seller did contact me right away about a refund, though.</li>
            <li>and u feel clean also its very slippery</li>
            <li>but I bought the second one because I liked the first one.</li>
            <li>Using a well-made brush like this one is a very easy way to turn a shower into a tonic massage, especially if you have the fortitude to do the alternating hot-cold water thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but overall, seems good early on.  </li>
            <li>Great length / reaches middle of back.......</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality brush--great for anyone with limited range of motion.</li>
            <li>the first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Getting several more as gifts to family.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what you think you are getting when you buy it.</li>
            <li>When pulling the first one out of the holder I kept it in the handle broke.</li>
            <li>Since receiving this (as a review sample) I have been using it daily and love the feel.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this brush, I said to my wife, This I can deal with.  </li>
            <li>You would be better off scrubbing the shower tiles than your back.</li>
            <li>This is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>THE SHIPPING CHARGE WAS TOO MUCH FOR ONE ITEM!</li>
            <li>The bristles are good and firm.</li>
            <li>It features a nice long handle, easy to use on my back in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Good stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the brush does develop a good lather and also rinses clean, helping to inhibit funky odors that could lead to the growth of mold or other unwanted issues in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great brush, not too soft and not too firm</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of bristle to do the job whether you pour Jo Malone Bath Soap or another good brand of cleanser about a quarter size on the brush and then go to town scrubbing hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>Not too stiff not to soft, feels great in the shower</li>
            <li>However, if you use a lighter touch it is a long way better than not having</li>
            <li>You will love this long nylon bristle brush.</li>
            <li>It is a treat to use this in the shower and then afterward a brisk towel dry and slather more body cream to hydrate you skin.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and not long in handle as stated!</li>
            <li>my husband&#x27;s last brush became too grody, we started looking for a new one, and I was glad to find this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not expect this to be a super gentle soft brush</li>
            <li>the bristles are very stiff too, so you&#x27;ll get a really good scrub.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush very highly.</li>
            <li>but I just would have liked the handle to be a little longer</li>
            <li>Bristles are a little soft so lather up good........</li>
            <li>Very convenient for washing your back or legs when you can&#x27;t bend or turn or kneel comfortably or the places on you</li>
            <li>Firm - Great Brush Back Scrubber!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter, though.  </li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t very dense</li>
            <li>like this brush and find it very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;who is basically shut in and has very tender skin.  </li>
            <li>It is interesting to see how they go in and out of fashion, making them easier or harder to find.</li>
            <li>However, they feel much stiffer when you are scrubbing with the brush because of the density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We were sent one to review, and after using, find it to work very well.</li>
            <li>The embedded &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; that they made on the plastic sure does help when this brush is wet</li>
            <li>My husband ordered this brush and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Much needed and well received.  </li>
            <li>Held up very well.</li>
            <li>Very timely delivery and the item is also packaged very well; I&#x27;ll doubtless order from them again.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy well made brush.</li>
            <li>Twisting and bending don&#x27;t happen much anymore.  </li>
            <li>I dont use it much.</li>
            <li>Some users may like this because it will really get the dirt off your skin - it all depends on what you are looking for in a bath brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much I bought my Husband and my son a Brush .</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY PRETTY.THOU.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The color is a lovely clear blue.</li>
            <li>brush just has a much cleaner look, they had good colors to choose from and the bristles are not too soft and not too stiff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, following in the footsteps of brushmakers before them, Top Notch has developed a Shower Brush that not only cleans but also exfoliates, claiming to leave your skin renewed and clean.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and purchased based on those and was quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Lumbar spinal damage and subsequent fusion restrict my movement significantly  </li>
            <li>well made, better than other brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love the color and that it is made of plastic and not wood which can mold and smell after getting wet and drying out!</li>
            <li>Rinses easily and hangs from rope to drip dry between uses.</li>
            <li>Much better than a bath strap, and much more durable than natural loofah; my last one disintegrated after a few encounters with a cellulite scrub.  </li>
            <li>Bristles very stiff and good for cleaning feet, but not for sensitive parts of body.</li>
            <li>I found the  bristles were not too soft nor too hard, and felt good on my body.</li>
            <li>At present, though, I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this is a decent product and does what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>Handle was too short to reach many areas on my back.  </li>
            <li>At the same time, they are firm enough to give that mild tingle which feels so good.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely medium stiffness and more for scrubbing your legs, back and feet.</li>
            <li>Probably for someone who is small and has little or medium sized hands the handle is a good fit.</li>
            <li>The hard plastic handle is curved and also has ridges, ensuring a good grip (even when hands are wet and soapy), and the curve enables you to have a more solid scrubbing action.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>the price; I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Although the feeling of bristle firmness against one&#x27;s skin is highly subjection, I would rate this at about 4/10.</li>
            <li>Would recommend, highly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I still think it was priced on the high side</li>
            <li>Seriously, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Great back brush..works wonderfully wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>It is a beautiful blue and has a cord for proper hang up after you are finished so it may dry properly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have given 5 stars if it just had a little more reach.</li>
            <li>It has a nice curve to help reach the hard spots.</li>
            <li>My back thanks you very much.</li>
            <li>if anything, I&#x27;d like them a bit firmer, but, it&#x27;s fine as it is; I can understand folks who use this as a dry skin brush, though I prefer natural bristles for that purpose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s of a design that makes the use of the brush very simple and reaches all of the right places.  </li>
            <li>This is the right brush for me, However, it is short.</li>
            <li>I love the textured ridges on the handle that give grip when your hands are soapy, and the gently curved handle seems to work well down the back, particularly, and to reach your feet if you have difficulty</li>
            <li>Nice brush, bristles are not too hard or too soft.  </li>
            <li>You can get a good scrub, but if your skin is very sensitive it might be a little too rough.  </li>
            <li>If youre not super flexible (look at their pics) you wont be able to get your back very well.</li>
            <li>:/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the mistake in color, the brush does pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have a problem with is that the handle is very slippery and hard to hold onto; if they could just improve the texture of the grip to something a bit more aggressive that might fix the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job exfoliating the skin, especially on those hard to reach places, like the shoulders and back.  </li>
            <li>The handle is long enough to reach his entire back, soaps up well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much shower brushes during my lifetime and most of them are stiff bristles which is like sandpaper if you don&#x27;t use them daily.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a few minutes skin brushing and find the bristles to be a perfect texture for that purpose -- not too stiff, not too soft.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t I find a back brush long enough and strong enough, with a secure grip and proper bristles?</li>
            <li>The handle has a very definite patterning effect on it and that helps me hold on to the brush quite easily after it has gotten wet and soapy</li>
            <li>I chose the blue one (aquamarine actually) because of my bathroom colours, but it is also available in a pretty pink version.  </li>
            <li>My old body brush, much used, has finally lost its zip and must be retired, but, though I&#x27;m sorry to see it go, I&#x27;m delighted to replace it with this new body brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the bristles on this brush...not too hard and not too soft either...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for legs, feet and such but not perfect for all those spots on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive</li>
            <li>I thought they would be soft.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll keep using my old one.</li>
            <li>It did  at first to appear  rather long for someone of my size, but as I used it I found it worked quite well.</li>
            <li>I like that the bristles are not too soft and not too</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month and so far, it has gotten the job done.</li>
            <li>, he likes it so far</li>
            <li>I still have to really stretch to get to the upper blades on my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised by this brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush is well made and not heavy but sturdy.</li>
            <li>I developed bursitis in my shoulder</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as they want you to believe.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are medium firmness, not too soft.</li>
            <li>Good shower brush, but the bristles are a little stiff.</li>
            <li>Angle of the brush is odd, only works at the exact right angle.</li>
            <li>You definitely cannot snap this in half easily.</li>
            <li>Also, a great back scratcher when used dry -- unnecessary if used frequently in bath or shower to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Useful and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Got this for older lady who has only one arm to use.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Just know that these aren&#x27;t soft bristles, these are the kinds of bristles that are going to scrub you clean, even if that means it&#x27;s going to hurt a little!</li>
            <li>It is more substantial than the last two I used which only lasted a few weeks.</li>
            <li>As a consequence, the brush is a bit rough on the skin at first.</li>
            <li>It was advertised as having a long handle it does not very uncomfortable to use</li>
            <li>I would like for it to take soap a little better as I have problems with skin infections and need to wash carefully each night.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, select a different brush, maybe one with natural bristles.</li>
            <li>i like it because the bristles were soft enough but not tao soft</li>
            <li>Far to short for this old man.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice, but the handle isn&#x27;t long enough and it&#x27;s hard to grip.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and have ended up with many of the soft, froufrou things masquerading as back brushes in your search to find a stiff bristled back brush; then look no further.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for the price, although the bristles are less firm than more expensive versions I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size/length and has a slight bend in the handle for ease of use.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of stiff and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Brush is the right balance of stiff and soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right - not too soft and not too stiff.</li>
            <li>The bristles are WAY too hard to be used comfortably.</li>
            <li>you just want a general purpose bath brush</li>
            <li>The feel of brush is not the same as natural one but serve the purpose.</li>
            <li>soft bristles and just what I need to reach my back.</li>
            <li>And the bristles are relatively soft, allowing for cleaning without ripping up your back.</li>
            <li>It also works well for legs, if you don&#x27;t want to bend that far, or if physical disability limits it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too short, the bristles are too soft, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>handle is very slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li>like this brush because the bristles are soft enough so they don&#x27;t scratch my skin.  </li>
            <li>Okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li>Bristles just right to get results w/o being too stiff or wimpy.</li>
            <li>The first was a wooden one from another company that cracked at the brush head after less than a weeks use.</li>
            <li>I think the bristle could be a tad bit harder and the grips should be extended slightly but other than that I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I like the stiff-ish bristles of this brush, but the handle is not long.</li>
            <li>Not a long handle.</li>
            <li>It is NOT a Long Handle Brush.</li>
            <li>Quality Bath Brush with Long Handle, Shower or Bath Brush long handled, Dry Skin Brushing Body Brush, Exfoliating, Cellulite Massager, Back Acne, Medium Soft Bristles - Gentle Yet</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are super hard.  </li>
            <li>Pretty,  but bristles are too stiff.</li>
            <li>This brush washes well and remains fresh looking, and has a little cord loop for hanging to dry.  </li>
            <li>Also not long enough.</li>
            <li>Handle not long enough to reach between shoulders.</li>
            <li>Not too rough not too soft!</li>
            <li>The handle is not long enough not too confortable to brush your back</li>

            <li> Good to have hanging in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive this shower brush for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> A good brush that seems well made.</li>
            <li> Good reach and well made.</li>
            <li> The had was good, but the handle was truly inferior.  </li>
            <li> It did come here on time and undamaged and it had a sturdy one piece handle and good medium bristles.  </li>
            <li> Length of handle is good, angled brush works</li>
            <li> This is a good brush with medium bristles.  </li>
            <li> Good points: plastic, so it wont get moldy.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a good length and it has a tie on the end to hang it up.</li>
            <li> Good customer service.</li>
            <li> good brush for a good price, love it!</li>
            <li> the price is good, the length of the handle is perfect, and the bristles are just the right texture and level of hardness or softness, depending on how you look at it.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did it still is great for the shower.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> So a versatile, quality product that seems very easy to keep in good shape, and adds that touch of luxury to your bathroom routine.  </li>
            <li> Love it and you!</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li> Feels great, but the handle snaps too easily under use.</li>
            <li> Great product, performs as described and looks fine.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, nice color, works well in shower or bath.</li>
            <li> While there is nothing spectacular about this brush</li>
            <li> This bath and shower brush is nice to have hanging in the shower.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not in our way even though it&#x27;s a nice size of 15\\</li>
            <li> Bristles give the skin a nice work-out without feeling scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I liked the handle&#x27;s grip which made it a bit easier to hold on to the brush if your hands are soapy.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice firmness of bristles.</li>
            <li> A wee bend in the handle end to hang the brush from the shower curtain rail would be handy.  </li>
            <li> The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a good brush to rely on for skin brushing and keepiing your skin healthy and glowing.  </li>
            <li> Would have liked it to be a touch softer but it should soften over time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> squeaky clean with a great feeling that exfoliating gives.</li>
            <li> otherwise this company has great products and quick safe delivery plus you can&#x27;t beat the 1 YEAR GUARANTEE Courtesy of Top notch !&lt;</li>
            <li> The curve in the handle gives good leverage and reach, and the end of the handle has textured grooves to provide a secure grip, even with a soapy hand.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if there was a way the handle could snap into the brush so the two could be detachable for greater</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she seems pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer- great brush, good curve to the handle, nice mid level stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li> But is okay and gives a good clean.</li>
            <li> Truly, there is nothing like a good brush to  get a good scrubbing on all sections of your body  in the shower, leaving  you  feeling, clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Very nice brush!&lt;br /&gt;Really like the length and pretty color of this bath brush.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I would like it even more if they offered a version with softer or milder bristles.  </li>
            <li> ; on the handle would make this a more universally appealing product.</li>
            <li> well its an OK brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best shower brush I&#x27;ve personally owned.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many bath brushes we have bought over the years.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The brush works ok</li>
            <li> and I was glad because I didn&#x27;t want to scratch up my skin.</li>
            <li> We love this brush.</li>
            <li> this body brush does the job correctly and now his skin feels more softener , and we put this in bathroom hung it up on hook with cord</li>
            <li> my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL BACK BRUSH.  </li>
            <li> But it turns out to be perfect, and I love the feel of the brush on my back!  </li>
            <li> the most part, it&#x27;s a quality brush.  </li>
            <li> Head appears ok.</li>
            <li> I find it perfect for my back while in the shower.</li>
            <li> My  elderly husband has used the brush many times in the shower and loves it.</li>
            <li> work OK</li>
            <li> Love this one.</li>
            <li> there are some grooves for gripping</li>
            <li> Now that is one of my favorite ways to use the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That works, but it would make for an even more luxurious feel if I didn&#x27;t have to change hands and directions so often while using the brush in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The hanging loop allows me to make sure the brush is left in the best position for air drying between shower</li>
            <li> in all I have to say I&#x27;m enjoying using this bath brush.  </li>
            <li> I would love it if the handle was about 1/3 longer and also wider.</li>
            <li> Bristles scratch more than they brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK otherwise</li>
            <li> Thus, the Top Notch Backscrubber is an excellent candidate for a gift, or for personal use.</li>
            <li> well, brush is nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush and very well made.</li>
            <li> Neither of us is that tall, and we both have pretty good flexibility.</li>
            <li> It has &amp;#34;grippers&amp;#34; on the bottom of the handle so that it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands and is a pretty good length.  </li>
            <li> that well, though they do a pretty good job trapping body hair,</li>
            <li> Great brush, good length and feels good on the back, not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> After doing my due diligence, I have found that many, many China products contain LEAD!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Overall, the construction of product is very good.</li>
            <li> ; it is a very good back brush.</li>
            <li> This is a simple body brush at a very good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s roughness is perfect for feet, which are tough and love a good scrub.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle with great grip.</li>
            <li> The perfect length for any bath brush, but since it&#x27;s all plastic, the bristles are way too rough for skin.</li>
            <li> you rough up the handle with some sand paper and dip the end in Rubber Dip tool coating I suspect this could be the perfect fix for someone who already owns this brush.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a good product, at a reasonable price, that delivers what it says it will.</li>
            <li> This bath brush has a sturdy grooved handle, nice oval head, stiffer bristles and is just the right length to reach all of the spots.  </li>
            <li> Despite what other reviews may say, I found this brush perfect for me.</li>
            <li> great product great price, cleans the way you want but not too hard.</li>
            <li> Nice and hard bristles, perfect length, and lite weight.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I am able to clean my feet satisfactorily and it doesn&#x27;t tickle.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I expected a nice brush but for me it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Looks good, feels good, works as expected.</li>
            <li> First off,  I liked the color of the brush.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this brush was how nice it felt in my hand when I held it.  </li>
            <li> Its fine, well made &amp; all that.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> A fine back-brush.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> After all the scratches healed, it was fine.  </li>
            <li> For me it is just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you are in the market for a sturdy backscrubber, the Top Notch Backscrubber is a worthy candidate that I can recommend.</li>
            <li> Great back brush</li>
            <li> Great simple brush.</li>
            <li> : I received a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li> Do not hate it but the brushing quality is lacking..</li>
            <li> This brush fit the bill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> I received this product free for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My brand X brush has good density but the bristles are too soft for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the good job it did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After taking my morning showers with my new body brush, I found that it did exactly as advertised (very good quality brush) and is worth what it will cost you.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I bought it to scrub my back but find that it&#x27;s a very effective for arms legs, hands and feet as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, new, good price &amp; warranty.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy handle and nice full head of bristles.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this brush</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> A good product for general brushes/scrubbing though.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this back brush</li>
            <li> I like the stiffness they clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any problem with rinsing the soap out of the bristles; the brush rinses clean every time.  </li>
            <li> I like that feeling though, after using this thing in the shower I feel like I am extremely clean when I come out.</li>
            <li> just right!</li>
            <li> Exactly as it was described, and it does a great job on the back!  </li>
            <li> Good basic brush.  </li>
            <li> The handle grip on it allowed me to have full control.</li>
            <li> Good back scrubber.</li>
            <li> This brush is very sturdy and the bristles will wear out after many years of service before THIS one cracks.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and nice, but it has that cheap brittle plastic handle that broke the first time it was dropped in the shower.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a very good replacement for my old worn out one.</li>
            <li> synthetic bristles are kind to the skin but sufficiently firm to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Not as long as I thought, but the brush is dense and good quality.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tear the flesh or anything that extreme, but it will most certainly leave skin bright</li>
            <li> Ahhh, my back has never felt better!</li>
            <li> exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect for our use, exactly what we were looking for!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Build is fine, but the bristles of the brush are much stiffer than I expected by a fair margin.</li>
            <li> As good as I expected it.</li>
            <li> Might be useful to scrub the shower walls.</li>
            <li> I really liked this shower brush, it has just enough firmness.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a thoroughly useful tool.</li>
            <li> Way too short to be effective.</li>
            <li> brush it the right size and the bristles are the right stiffness for me.  </li>
            <li> Bristles were just right.  </li>
            <li> Seller did contact me right away about a refund, though.</li>
            <li> and u feel clean also its very slippery</li>
            <li> but I bought the second one because I liked the first one.</li>
            <li> Using a well-made brush like this one is a very easy way to turn a shower into a tonic massage, especially if you have the fortitude to do the alternating hot-cold water thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but overall, seems good early on.  </li>
            <li> Great length / reaches middle of back.......</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality brush--great for anyone with limited range of motion.</li>
            <li> the first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Getting several more as gifts to family.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what you think you are getting when you buy it.</li>
            <li> When pulling the first one out of the holder I kept it in the handle broke.</li>
            <li> Since receiving this (as a review sample) I have been using it daily and love the feel.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush, I said to my wife, This I can deal with.  </li>
            <li> You would be better off scrubbing the shower tiles than your back.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPING CHARGE WAS TOO MUCH FOR ONE ITEM!</li>
            <li> The bristles are good and firm.</li>
            <li> It features a nice long handle, easy to use on my back in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Good stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the brush does develop a good lather and also rinses clean, helping to inhibit funky odors that could lead to the growth of mold or other unwanted issues in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great brush, not too soft and not too firm</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of bristle to do the job whether you pour Jo Malone Bath Soap or another good brand of cleanser about a quarter size on the brush and then go to town scrubbing hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> Not too stiff not to soft, feels great in the shower</li>
            <li> However, if you use a lighter touch it is a long way better than not having</li>
            <li> You will love this long nylon bristle brush.</li>
            <li> It is a treat to use this in the shower and then afterward a brisk towel dry and slather more body cream to hydrate you skin.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and not long in handle as stated!</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s last brush became too grody, we started looking for a new one, and I was glad to find this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not expect this to be a super gentle soft brush</li>
            <li> the bristles are very stiff too, so you&#x27;ll get a really good scrub.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush very highly.</li>
            <li> but I just would have liked the handle to be a little longer</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little soft so lather up good........</li>
            <li> Very convenient for washing your back or legs when you can&#x27;t bend or turn or kneel comfortably or the places on you</li>
            <li> Firm - Great Brush Back Scrubber!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really matter, though.  </li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t very dense</li>
            <li> like this brush and find it very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;who is basically shut in and has very tender skin.  </li>
            <li> It is interesting to see how they go in and out of fashion, making them easier or harder to find.</li>
            <li> However, they feel much stiffer when you are scrubbing with the brush because of the density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We were sent one to review, and after using, find it to work very well.</li>
            <li> The embedded &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; that they made on the plastic sure does help when this brush is wet</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this brush and really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Much needed and well received.  </li>
            <li> Held up very well.</li>
            <li> Very timely delivery and the item is also packaged very well; I&#x27;ll doubtless order from them again.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy well made brush.</li>
            <li> Twisting and bending don&#x27;t happen much anymore.  </li>
            <li> I dont use it much.</li>
            <li> Some users may like this because it will really get the dirt off your skin - it all depends on what you are looking for in a bath brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much I bought my Husband and my son a Brush .</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY PRETTY.THOU.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The color is a lovely clear blue.</li>
            <li> brush just has a much cleaner look, they had good colors to choose from and the bristles are not too soft and not too stiff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, following in the footsteps of brushmakers before them, Top Notch has developed a Shower Brush that not only cleans but also exfoliates, claiming to leave your skin renewed and clean.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and purchased based on those and was quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Lumbar spinal damage and subsequent fusion restrict my movement significantly  </li>
            <li> well made, better than other brushes.</li>
            <li> and I love the color and that it is made of plastic and not wood which can mold and smell after getting wet and drying out!</li>
            <li> Rinses easily and hangs from rope to drip dry between uses.</li>
            <li> Much better than a bath strap, and much more durable than natural loofah; my last one disintegrated after a few encounters with a cellulite scrub.  </li>
            <li> Bristles very stiff and good for cleaning feet, but not for sensitive parts of body.</li>
            <li> I found the  bristles were not too soft nor too hard, and felt good on my body.</li>
            <li> At present, though, I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, this is a decent product and does what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> Handle was too short to reach many areas on my back.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, they are firm enough to give that mild tingle which feels so good.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely medium stiffness and more for scrubbing your legs, back and feet.</li>
            <li> Probably for someone who is small and has little or medium sized hands the handle is a good fit.</li>
            <li> The hard plastic handle is curved and also has ridges, ensuring a good grip (even when hands are wet and soapy), and the curve enables you to have a more solid scrubbing action.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> the price; I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Although the feeling of bristle firmness against one&#x27;s skin is highly subjection, I would rate this at about 4/10.</li>
            <li> Would recommend, highly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I still think it was priced on the high side</li>
            <li> Seriously, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great back brush..works wonderfully wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It is a beautiful blue and has a cord for proper hang up after you are finished so it may dry properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given 5 stars if it just had a little more reach.</li>
            <li> It has a nice curve to help reach the hard spots.</li>
            <li> My back thanks you very much.</li>
            <li> if anything, I&#x27;d like them a bit firmer, but, it&#x27;s fine as it is; I can understand folks who use this as a dry skin brush, though I prefer natural bristles for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of a design that makes the use of the brush very simple and reaches all of the right places.  </li>
            <li> This is the right brush for me, However, it is short.</li>
            <li> I love the textured ridges on the handle that give grip when your hands are soapy, and the gently curved handle seems to work well down the back, particularly, and to reach your feet if you have difficulty</li>
            <li> Nice brush, bristles are not too hard or too soft.  </li>
            <li> You can get a good scrub, but if your skin is very sensitive it might be a little too rough.  </li>
            <li> If youre not super flexible (look at their pics) you wont be able to get your back very well.</li>
            <li> :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the mistake in color, the brush does pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have a problem with is that the handle is very slippery and hard to hold onto; if they could just improve the texture of the grip to something a bit more aggressive that might fix the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a great job exfoliating the skin, especially on those hard to reach places, like the shoulders and back.  </li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to reach his entire back, soaps up well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much shower brushes during my lifetime and most of them are stiff bristles which is like sandpaper if you don&#x27;t use them daily.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a few minutes skin brushing and find the bristles to be a perfect texture for that purpose -- not too stiff, not too soft.  </li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t I find a back brush long enough and strong enough, with a secure grip and proper bristles?</li>
            <li> The handle has a very definite patterning effect on it and that helps me hold on to the brush quite easily after it has gotten wet and soapy</li>
            <li> I chose the blue one (aquamarine actually) because of my bathroom colours, but it is also available in a pretty pink version.  </li>
            <li> My old body brush, much used, has finally lost its zip and must be retired, but, though I&#x27;m sorry to see it go, I&#x27;m delighted to replace it with this new body brush.  </li>
            <li> I love the bristles on this brush...not too hard and not too soft either...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for legs, feet and such but not perfect for all those spots on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive</li>
            <li> I thought they would be soft.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll keep using my old one.</li>
            <li> It did  at first to appear  rather long for someone of my size, but as I used it I found it worked quite well.</li>
            <li> I like that the bristles are not too soft and not too</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and so far, it has gotten the job done.</li>
            <li> , he likes it so far</li>
            <li> I still have to really stretch to get to the upper blades on my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised by this brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush is well made and not heavy but sturdy.</li>
            <li> I developed bursitis in my shoulder</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as they want you to believe.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are medium firmness, not too soft.</li>
            <li> Good shower brush, but the bristles are a little stiff.</li>
            <li> Angle of the brush is odd, only works at the exact right angle.</li>
            <li> You definitely cannot snap this in half easily.</li>
            <li> Also, a great back scratcher when used dry -- unnecessary if used frequently in bath or shower to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Useful and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Got this for older lady who has only one arm to use.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Just know that these aren&#x27;t soft bristles, these are the kinds of bristles that are going to scrub you clean, even if that means it&#x27;s going to hurt a little!</li>
            <li> It is more substantial than the last two I used which only lasted a few weeks.</li>
            <li> As a consequence, the brush is a bit rough on the skin at first.</li>
            <li> It was advertised as having a long handle it does not very uncomfortable to use</li>
            <li> I would like for it to take soap a little better as I have problems with skin infections and need to wash carefully each night.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, select a different brush, maybe one with natural bristles.</li>
            <li> i like it because the bristles were soft enough but not tao soft</li>
            <li> Far to short for this old man.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice, but the handle isn&#x27;t long enough and it&#x27;s hard to grip.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have ended up with many of the soft, froufrou things masquerading as back brushes in your search to find a stiff bristled back brush; then look no further.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for the price, although the bristles are less firm than more expensive versions I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is just the right size/length and has a slight bend in the handle for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of stiff and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Brush is the right balance of stiff and soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right - not too soft and not too stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles are WAY too hard to be used comfortably.</li>
            <li> you just want a general purpose bath brush</li>
            <li> The feel of brush is not the same as natural one but serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> soft bristles and just what I need to reach my back.</li>
            <li> And the bristles are relatively soft, allowing for cleaning without ripping up your back.</li>
            <li> It also works well for legs, if you don&#x27;t want to bend that far, or if physical disability limits it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too short, the bristles are too soft, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> handle is very slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li> like this brush because the bristles are soft enough so they don&#x27;t scratch my skin.  </li>
            <li> Okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li> Bristles just right to get results w/o being too stiff or wimpy.</li>
            <li> The first was a wooden one from another company that cracked at the brush head after less than a weeks use.</li>
            <li> I think the bristle could be a tad bit harder and the grips should be extended slightly but other than that I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I like the stiff-ish bristles of this brush, but the handle is not long.</li>
            <li> Not a long handle.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a Long Handle Brush.</li>

            <li> The bristles on this brush are super hard.  </li>
            <li> Pretty,  but bristles are too stiff.</li>
            <li> This brush washes well and remains fresh looking, and has a little cord loop for hanging to dry.  </li>
            <li> Also not long enough.</li>
            <li> Handle not long enough to reach between shoulders.</li>
            <li> Not too rough not too soft!</li>
            <li> The handle is not long enough not too confortable to brush your back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm and stiff enough to give your back a good scrubbing, but not in any way overly hard on my back.</li>
            <li> While the innuendo is obvious, I also retorted that single people apparently donâ€™t know what a back scrubber is.</li>
            <li> Other more expensive brushes I have tried have bristles that are so soft that they don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> so you get the brush flat on your back.</li>
            <li> The arm reaches down my back just far enough for me</li>
            <li> Long enough handle to reach any spot on your back.</li>
            <li> entire brush and handle are just under 15 inches long, and that handle part is only around 9 inches.</li>
            <li> (the handle only is about 10\\&quot;), which is long enough for me.</li>
            <li> problem is that the handle is just wee short of being long enough.  </li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to reach everywhere on my back.</li>
            <li> The eponymous product is also quite useful for scrubbing other areas, especially if you have arthritis and and/or a medical condition that make it difficult to reach certain areas of your body to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and this brush handle isn&#x27;t long enough</li>
            <li> I specifically researched, Long Handle, back brushs for my husband.  </li>
            <li> entire brush is just under 14\\&quot; long</li>
            <li> QUALITY BLUE BATH AND SHOWER BRUSH WITH LONG HANDLE.</li>
            <li> It does not have a long handle, it is way too short.</li>
            <li> but it should last him a long time.</li>
            <li> This brush felt soft out of the box (on my hand), but when used on my back/body/arms (maybe I have sensitive skin), it feels very stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very stiff and it feels like I&#x27;m brushing my back with rough sandpaper, even after running hot water over the bristles.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the plastic because it doesn&#x27;t get dirty and moldy like the wooden ones.  </li>
            <li> have to work a bit harder to reach middle of the back.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not that long, but it is plenty long enough for me and my wife.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the string to hang it up with - it is too small to fit around the shower faucet and</li>
            <li> However, thinking that it was new and the bristles were stiff, I figured it would be a week or two with every day use before the bristles softened.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews complaining about the handle being too short but assumed, as I am only 5&#x27; tall, that it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Being an average height male, I would have preferred the handle length to be a tad longer so that one can reach down the entire length of their back without having to use the brush from a different angle (such as from the side of one&#x27;s body).  </li>
            <li> Bristles are a little soft, but still does the job</li>
            <li> Bristles are quite hard and don&#x27;t hold suds very well..</li>
            <li> Much too hard for him to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just long enough to reach all of my back and the curve helps make it comfortable, instead of awkward.</li>
            <li> It did seem a bit awkward to use, but i might need to get more practice using it.  </li>
            <li> the head of the brush isn&#x27;t wide enough to hang over a towel bar, it just fall s through.  </li>
            <li> This is shorter than expected but I did not read the description well enough, so shame on me.  </li>
            <li> (There&#x27;s really no spot on my back</li>
            <li> They should change the description from \\&quot;long handle\\&quot; to \\&quot;13.75</li>
            <li> long brush\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It said long handle, I was expecting a longer handle.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are not soft and mushy</li>
            <li> My blue bath and shower brush arrived as a PINK shower brush instead.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Shower, Body and Exfoliating Brush.</li>
            <li> A bit firm even for someone without sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I debated about choosing this particular bath brush because a previous reviewer said it was too stiff or too short.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not too stiff nor soft.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he likes that the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft or too stiff.</li>
            <li> for the longevity of the brush I have not had it long enough to determine one way or the other.</li>
            <li> Works well but is developing rusty-looking spots where the bristles are glued in...which is strange because I rinse it well and hang it to dry after each use.</li>
            <li> This brush, and others like it, can provide aid and comfort by helping you reach everywhere on your back and other parts of your body if you have problems bending.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes loofa or net or other scrubbers take over the market for awhile.</li>
            <li> The brush is as any other brush with standard handle.</li>
            <li> Of course, for other people this assumes that one&#x27;s shoulder joints are flexible enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it that much, and they seem to soften up a little bit after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> I really like the tightly packed stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> I had never thought about using a brush like this as a dry brush for exfoliating until I read the description on the product page.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s build the same as other pink brush</li>
            <li> Hygienic, Long Life, Pink, 1 YEAR GUARA...]</li>
            <li> Both wet and dry applications are working well for me and the only slight bother is the length of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the bristles are very stiff and without water and a good lathering of soap, can be painful.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a little chink of plastic was knocked out but no big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rated 4 star only because the handle could be a little longer.</li>
            <li> Handle a little to short.</li>
            <li> Not to soft, not to hard.</li>
            <li> so  thoroughly especially his hard to reach back area</li>
            <li> this thing is rough.</li>
            <li> Handle slippery when wet and soapy, which you can&#x27;t avoid.</li>
            <li> Bristles will soften when wet, so it&#x27;s versatile.  </li>
            <li> This is WAY, WAY rougher than I expected.</li>
            <li> The handle has ridges on it to make is easier to hold when wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have something on the softer side than on the harder side.</li>
            <li> this brush is just like the pink my husband is using this</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ll want the pink like me which I used then go here &gt;</li>
            <li> Pity</li>
            <li> My son uses it as a toy, so not a total waste...</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected cared to EarthLink brand</li>
            <li> Guess I should not have got it wet.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t too heavy, but if you dropped it on your foot it would definitely hurt a bit.</li>
            <li> I searched around on Amazon and found 2 brushes that looked promising because the negative things that people had to say about them were that the bristles were too stiff.  </li>
            <li> to the person who says that this is stiff enough to wash a rhino, I would have to disagree.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be stiff enough to wash one of my horses</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about eleven inches long, which is long enough for me to reach almost to the small of my back over my shoulder, and I can get the rest by going behind my back.</li>
            <li> bristles are just stiff enough.</li>
            <li> The handle length is roughly 10&amp;#34; as stated in other reviews, with the rest of the length being the brush head.</li>
            <li> I had a wooden handled back brush &amp; wood is never good in the water.  </li>
            <li> Bristles nice, but in less than 2 weeks, they became completely mildewed and disgusting hanging in the shower even though the brush was thoroughly rinsed after every use.  </li>
            <li> BUT, its not designed well - its bent to be ergonomic, but it should be bent in the other direction</li>
            <li> Too small to use on back, which is the advertised purpose of this brush.</li>
            <li> our other favorites, it is plastic which stays nicer longer.</li>
            <li> For my back though I wish it was about 6&amp;#34;-8&amp;#34; longer and the head is angled wrong for a back brush, it should be angled along the same curve as the handle.</li>
            <li> Very few people can reach every spot on their back.  </li>
            <li> the brush is so very very rough on the edges and feels like it cuts into your skin</li>
            <li> Stiff enough to provide cleaning power, but not so it is so harsh</li>
            <li> Short handle, hard, lo quality bristles.  </li>
            <li> The bristles didn&#x27;t feel too stiff or rough when I ran my fingers through them</li>
            <li> Would have preferred slightly longer handle or adjustable handle.</li>
            <li> think there are many of us with dirty backs for the reason that our hands can&#x27;t reach completely behind us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint with it is that the bristles are just a bit to stiff and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> -The brush handle could be a little bit longer</li>
            <li> bristles could be a little softer on the skin(But</li>
            <li> It took a little bit of time to get here, but I&#x27;d order it again.  </li>
            <li> I just wish the handle was a little longer.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little longer</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the handle was a little longer.</li>
            <li> Is too short and the bristles are very HARD.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll remove a layer of dead  skin if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> it reaches well behind my back and the brushes do not hurt</li>
            <li> I was looking for one where brush was firm but not so firm as to cause problems.</li>
            <li> Some people might  find it a bit to firm, but it suits me to a tee.</li>
            <li> but when I used the brush in the bathroom and the bristles were a little too stiff for my liking (but not stiff-stiff which would have resulted in a lower star rating).  </li>
            <li> Bristles are a little stiff for my skin comfort.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are to stiff for me.</li>
            <li> Stiff., but not to stiff bristles, seems</li>
            <li> , I found that the bristles are just a bit stiff, yet in my opinion, I found this to be a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way too stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too stiff.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are stiff and don&#x27;t hold soap</li>
            <li> bristles way too stiff  3.</li>
            <li> Bristles are way too stiff.</li>
            <li> I suppose after a few uses they will get broken in and soften but until then they are a little rough for my liking.  </li>
            <li> Your brush handles very well and allows me to reach areas that would be otherwise impossible to access.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a weighlifter, so my range of motion is limited when it comes to reaching behind my head/back.</li>
            <li> Little too hard for me</li>
            <li> Bristles a little too hard.  </li>
            <li> The handle was very weak and broke in the middle of the handle at the interface.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s sees all the dead skins that was hard to get rid of with a wash cloth</li>
            <li> brush did have a small defect however.</li>
            <li> Brissels are somewhat stiff but just what I needed for stimulation of hard to get to places.</li>
            <li> Disappointed overall, very hard brush, too hard for normal skin</li>
            <li> the brush was too tough and hurts a little bit</li>
            <li> I wish it was just a few dollars less expensive</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are too hard....</li>
            <li> It also gets in some of the hard to reach areas too.</li>
            <li> and the bristles are too hard for me.  </li>
            <li> Slippery in the shower and hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li> This could be my bad, but the handle is just a little too short.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing and too short for my 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; frame.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as always was helpful in arranging their no hastle return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the wooden handled camel&#x27;s hair - impossible to hold when soapy.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and are looking for one to reach those impossible spots on your back...</li>
            <li> I was once told that single people have dirty backs.</li>
            <li> Badly scratches my skin leaving red welts.</li>
            <li> but its a tough brush</li>
            <li> the handle is tough to grip if your hands are soapy...</li>
            <li> to improve this bath brush, I would soften the stiffness from the start, so it doesn&#x27;t have to get broken in before the bristles start to soften.  </li>
            <li> Alas it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IMHO- Completely false advertising.</li>
            <li> And the bristles are so firm as to be just this side of painful.</li>
            <li> and so it is difficult to keep a lather in them.  </li>
            <li> but what I&#x27;m trying to say is that they look like someone sat on the brush and spread the bristles kinda weird</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the handle</li>
            <li> I just pulled it the wrong way and the handle snapped.</li>
            <li> If it fails or falls apart prematurely I will update this review accordingly.</li>
            <li> ; bend is done wrong, if you hold it up the tip of the handle is level with the tip of the brush.  </li>
            <li> This one disappointed me with it uncomfortable bristles and hard to hold on handle.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The handle is flimsy and very difficult to grip when soap is on your hand.</li>
            <li> Lathering is impossible.</li>
            <li> In all, a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is painful.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really annoying, I could have purchased one from the grocery store for $5 that had a longer handle.</li>
            <li> When I did use it I dropped it and it shattered at the base of the brush.</li>
            <li> It started discoloring at the base roots of the brush.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the handle snapped in two within a month of using it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are super hard.  I have used it for some time and they have not eased up a bit.  This brush would be great if you have to wash a rhino but for skin or even a car this thing is rough.</li>
            <li> -The brush handle could be a little bit longer&lt;br /&gt;-The bristles could be a little softer on the skin(But I have sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Overall great product</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price, although the bristles are less firm than more expensive versions I have purchased in the past.  Doesn&#x27;t really matter, though.  It still does the same job.  It took a little bit of time to get here, but I&#x27;d order it again.  I&#x27;d just order multiples next time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would improve is a longer handle.  Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have ended up with many of the soft, froufrou things masquerading as back brushes in your search to find a stiff bristled back brush; then look no further.  I searched around on Amazon and found 2 brushes that looked promising because the negative things that people had to say about them were that the bristles were too stiff.  I ordered both of them and this is my preference because of the larger head on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the person who says that this is stiff enough to wash a rhino, I would have to disagree.  It wouldn&#x27;t be stiff enough to wash one of my horses so doubt that it would do a satisfactory job on a rhino.</li>
            <li> Love this. I think the bristle could be a tad bit harder and the grips should be extended slightly but other than that I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are to stiff for me. It&#x27;ll remove a layer of dead  skin if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  It works great in the shower to get all the places he can&#x27;t reach.  He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, nice color, works well in shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Husband loved this brush. Will buy another one for me</li>
            <li> Nice brush, bristles are not too hard or too soft.  After back surgery I have a problem bending to wash my feet while in the shower.  This brush has solved the problem.  My only complaint is the string to hang it up with - it is too small to fit around the shower faucet and the head of the brush isn&#x27;t wide enough to hang over a towel bar, it just fall s through.  Regardless, I am able to clean my feet satisfactorily and it doesn&#x27;t tickle.</li>
            <li> Its fine, well made &amp; all that. BUT, its not designed well - its bent to be ergonomic, but it should be bent in the other direction so you get the brush flat on your back. If youre not super flexible (look at their pics) you wont be able to get your back very well.</li>
            <li> Brush is perfect. Not to soft, not to hard. Nice long handle with great grip. Curve fits my back to I can reach all the rounder spots. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Too short. The handle is flimsy and very difficult to grip when soap is on your hand. And the bristles are so firm as to be just this side of painful. Why can&#x27;t I find a back brush long enough and strong enough, with a secure grip and proper bristles? I&#x27;ve tried the wooden handled camel&#x27;s hair - impossible to hold when soapy. *sigh*</li>
            <li> Bristles nice, but in less than 2 weeks, they became completely mildewed and disgusting hanging in the shower even though the brush was thoroughly rinsed after every use.  Also not long enough.</li>
            <li> Handle way to short no grip</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best bath brush I&#x27;ve had.  The bristles aren&#x27;t very dense and so it is difficult to keep a lather in them.  I think these were priced at least three times what they are worth.</li>
            <li> Bristles are quite hard and don&#x27;t hold suds very well.. Handle could be longer..</li>
            <li> Ahhh, my back has never felt better!</li>
            <li> Very few people can reach every spot on their back.  And if you are suffering from a generalized itching, it can be maddening.  This brush, and others like it, can provide aid and comfort by helping you reach everywhere on your back and other parts of your body if you have problems bending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this brush and find it very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint with it is that the bristles are just a bit to stiff and scratchy.  I would like it even more if they offered a version with softer or milder bristles.  Stiff enough to provide cleaning power, but not so it is so harsh the first thing in the morning.  However, if you use a lighter touch it is a long way better than not having it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MI</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my back when I used it.</li>
            <li> Angle of the brush is odd, only works at the exact right angle.</li>
            <li> Works fine. I just wish the handle was a little longer.</li>
            <li> The feel of brush is not the same as natural one but serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff not to soft, feels great in the shower</li>
            <li> Handle needs to be longer.</li>
            <li> I like the stiff-ish bristles of this brush, but the handle is not long.</li>
            <li> An excellent product that functions perfectly.</li>
            <li> So needed &amp; works well.</li>
            <li> Stiff., but not to stiff bristles, seems well put together., hope it will last a couple of years. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> soft bristles and just what I need to reach my back.</li>
            <li> great brush, not too soft and not too firm</li>
            <li> Bristles too rigid or, perhaps, I&#x27;m a wimp.</li>
            <li> bristles are stiffer than the wood brushes i&#x27;ve bought through the years (which tended to get moldy and removable handles fall off as wood swells and contracts).  But the handle is a bit short. have to work a bit harder to reach middle of the back.  but overall, seems good early on.  will see if it holds up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! As good as I expected it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It cleans his back well and I no longer have to go scrub his back because this does it for me. The handle is long enough to reach his entire back, soaps up well and easy to clean. Very sturdy handle and nice full head of bristles.</li>
            <li> great product great price, cleans the way you want but not too hard.</li>
            <li> Handle slippery when wet and soapy, which you can&#x27;t avoid. Too small to use on back, which is the advertised purpose of this brush. Bristles very stiff and good for cleaning feet, but not for sensitive parts of body.</li>
            <li> Sent it back. It was an inch shorter than advertised.</li>
            <li> Good basic brush.  Good value.  Appears to be anti-microbial.  Bristles are on the stiffer side, which is perfect.  Bristles will soften when wet, so it&#x27;s versatile.  As you can see from the pic, it&#x27;s all plastic.</li>
            <li> I really like the tightly packed stiff bristles. My brand X brush has good density but the bristles are too soft for my liking.  I bought it to scrub my back but find that it&#x27;s a very effective for arms legs, hands and feet as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve heard complaints that the handle is too short. Though this is not the case for me, I would not recommend this for people with shoulder mobility issues. Another 2&amp;#34; on the handle would make this a more universally appealing product.</li>
            <li> Great product, performs as described and looks fine. Getting several more as gifts to family. Also, a great back scratcher when used dry -- unnecessary if used frequently in bath or shower to exfoliate. Bristles just right to get results w/o being too stiff or wimpy. Superb!</li>
            <li> Despite what other reviews may say, I found this brush perfect for me. Just the right amount of stiff and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> It was advertised as having a long handle it does not very uncomfortable to use</li>
            <li> Great for washing my feet!</li>
            <li> Handle too short.  Another 6&amp;#34; is needed.</li>
            <li> it reaches well behind my back and the brushes do not hurt</li>
            <li> Whats not to like. Long enough handle to reach any spot on your back.</li>
            <li> great product. will buy from them again</li>
            <li> Not a long handle. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t reach all of my back with it. Had to purchase another one and give this one to my wife.</li>
            <li> exactly as promised! Love it and you!</li>
            <li> Great brush, good length and feels good on the back, not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> Was going to give it 3 stars ...well its an OK brush my problem is that I&#x27;ve only had it for a month and the bristles are all over the place now they are not falling off but what I&#x27;m trying to say is that they look like someone sat on the brush and spread the bristles kinda weird I no..I like the stiffness they clean and u feel clean also its very slippery but its a tough brush I&#x27;ve dropped it like 3 times inside the tub  and the plastic keeps surving no cracks</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice, but the handle isn&#x27;t long enough and it&#x27;s hard to grip.</li>
            <li> This one disappointed me with it uncomfortable bristles and hard to hold on handle.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are too hard....I thought they would be soft.  I ordered for my husband&lt;br /&gt;who is basically shut in and has very tender skin.  Much too hard for him to use.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> While there is nothing spectacular about this brush it is exactly what you think you are getting when you buy it. It does the job well. It is the second of these brushes I have purchased and both of them have been on the money when it comes to scrubbing in the shower. When pulling the first one out of the holder I kept it in the handle broke. Nothing wrong with the handle I just pulled it the wrong way and the handle snapped. I wish it was just a few dollars less expensive but I bought the second one because I liked the first one. I am glad that I did it still is great for the shower.</li>
            <li> Great back brush I just wish it was a little longer</li>
            <li> the brush was too tough and hurts a little bit</li>
            <li> Useful and long lasting. Very convenient for washing your back or legs when you can&#x27;t bend or turn or kneel comfortably or the places on you body that your hand  won&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty much perfect. The bristles are just right - not too soft and not too stiff. The curve in the handle gives good leverage and reach, and the end of the handle has textured grooves to provide a secure grip, even with a soapy hand. It&#x27;s the best shower brush I&#x27;ve personally owned.</li>
            <li> Brissels are somewhat stiff but just what I needed for stimulation of hard to get to places.</li>
            <li> This brush would be great if it was 3&amp;#34; longer.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and this brush handle isn&#x27;t long enough so it&#x27;s going in the trash and I&#x27;ll keep using my old one.</li>
            <li> I specifically researched, Long Handle, back brushs for my husband.  Ordered this one which came today.  The handle appears to be shorter than a regular handle brush.  I knew it wasn&#x27;t want I ordered when i saw the size of the box.  This needs to be reclassified as a regular size back brush. It is NOT a Long Handle Brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I got this brush in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush it the right size and the bristles are the right stiffness for me.  The curved handle makes the brush manageable.  I like the fact that it comes with a string so I can hang it up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price; I highly recommend this.  When it wears out, I&#x27;ll get another one.</li>
            <li> Feels great, but the handle snaps too easily under use. I&#x27;ve purchased two from bed bath beyond, and both snapped in the same place.</li>
            <li> This is shorter than expected but I did not read the description well enough, so shame on me.  Construction and bristle texture are perfect.  I&#x27;d have given 5 stars if it just had a little more reach.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this brush. The bristles are very stiff and it feels like I&#x27;m brushing my back with rough sandpaper, even after running hot water over the bristles.</li>
            <li> My back thanks you very much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many bath brushes we have bought over the years. It is interesting to see how they go in and out of fashion, making them easier or harder to find. Sometimes loofa or net or other scrubbers take over the market for awhile. But the brushes always win in the end, just because they are so practical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my husband&#x27;s last brush became too grody, we started looking for a new one, and I was glad to find this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like our other favorites, it is plastic which stays nicer longer. It has a loop to hang it. It has a nice curve to help reach the hard spots. And the bristles are relatively soft, allowing for cleaning without ripping up your back. It also works well for legs, if you don&#x27;t want to bend that far, or if physical disability limits it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for our use, exactly what we were looking for! Glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is WAY, WAY rougher than I expected. If you&#x27;re a zookeeper and need a brush for a baby elephant, buy this. If you plan to use it on a human, get something else.</li>
            <li> Since receiving this (as a review sample) I have been using it daily and love the feel. It&#x27;s about eleven inches long, which is long enough for me to reach almost to the small of my back over my shoulder, and I can get the rest by going behind my back. For reference I am 5&#x27; 8\\&quot; and even with only ninety percent rotation I can still use this effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are densely spaced and moderately still if you run your fingers through them. However, they feel much stiffer when you are scrubbing with the brush because of the density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with [[ASIN:B001MIZMP2 Nivea For Men Active3 Body Wash]] and between the wash and this brush I come out of the shower squeaky clean with a great feeling that exfoliating gives. I also use this on the soles of my feet, which works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the longevity of the brush I have not had it long enough to determine one way or the other. If it fails or falls apart prematurely I will update this review accordingly. At present, though, I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> This bath and shower brush is nice to have hanging in the shower. We were sent one to review, and after using, find it to work very well. The bristles are medium, and I like them quite a bit. My wife wishes they were just a tad softer. I just feel cleaner when I have the stiffer bristles scrubbing my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire brush and handle are just under 15 inches long, and that handle part is only around 9 inches. So it&#x27;s not that long, but it is plenty long enough for me and my wife. Neither of us is that tall, and we both have pretty good flexibility. (There&#x27;s really no spot on my back I can&#x27;t reach with my hand, the brush just makes it easier.) The handle has ridges on it to make is easier to hold when wet. There is a hole in the end of the handle and short piece of cord attached so you can hang this on any type of hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not a lot you can say about a shower brush. Bottom line, this is a decent product and does what it is suppose to. Good to have hanging in the shower.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this brush for a couple of days, this is my opinion/review after using this brush thus far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking my morning showers with my new body brush, I found that it did exactly as advertised (very good quality brush) and is worth what it will cost you.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found that the bristles are just a bit stiff, yet in my opinion, I found this to be a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice brush in my opinion, if you decide to try it, I think that youâ€™ll like it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this brush for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> But, I guess that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be.  But, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Not too rough not too soft!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the handle was a little longer. The brush works ok but I just would have liked the handle to be a little longer</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive this shower brush for an honest review.  I was excited to try this brush and I was not disappointed. First off,  I liked the color of the brush. It is a beautiful blue and has a cord for proper hang up after you are finished so it may dry properly.  It did  at first to appear  rather long for someone of my size, but as I used it I found it worked quite well. The handle grip on it allowed me to have full control. I found the  bristles were not too soft nor too hard, and felt good on my body. Truly, there is nothing like a good brush to  get a good scrubbing on all sections of your body  in the shower, leaving  you  feeling, clean and fresh.  This brush definitely did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it as an exfoliating brush on my feet. This is not something I do often, but I wanted to give it a try.  I was surprised at the good job it did. All in all this is a good product, at a reasonable price, that delivers what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Great simple brush. Although the feeling of bristle firmness against one&#x27;s skin is highly subjection, I would rate this at about 4/10. It&#x27;s about medium softness to me and I was glad because I didn&#x27;t want to scratch up my skin. I&#x27;d rather have something on the softer side than on the harder side. I think the manufacturer (TopNotch) did a great job to achieve a good balance.  The handle length is roughly 10&amp;#34; as stated in other reviews, with the rest of the length being the brush head. Being an average height male, I would have preferred the handle length to be a tad longer so that one can reach down the entire length of their back without having to use the brush from a different angle (such as from the side of one&#x27;s body).  The embedded &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; that they made on the plastic sure does help when this brush is wet and/or you have soapy hands.  Overall, the construction of product is very good. You definitely cannot snap this in half easily. It&#x27;s meant to take a beating and last for a while. My only gripe (hence the 4 star rating is), I wish the bristles were a tad softer and it could hold the foam of soap or could hold liquid soap (similar to a loofah). A good product for general brushes/scrubbing though.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Little too hard for me but will work with it. wish the handle was longer. im 5&#x27;10&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bristles were just right.  Would have preferred slightly longer handle or adjustable handle.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Handle could be longer</li>
            <li> Exactly as it was described, and it does a great job on the back!  It&#x27;s of a design that makes the use of the brush very simple and reaches all of the right places.  The bristles are good and firm.</li>
            <li> This could be my bad, but the handle is just a little too short.  Like everything else about it though.</li>
            <li> The handle is not long enough not too confortable to brush your back</li>
            <li> The handle was very weak and broke in the middle of the handle at the interface.</li>
            <li> I could not reach the area between my shoulders.  This gets it.</li>
            <li> A good brush that seems well made. I like that the bristles are not too soft and not too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire brush is just under 14\\&quot; long (the handle only is about 10\\&quot;), which is long enough for me. They should change the description from \\&quot;long handle\\&quot; to \\&quot;13.75 long brush\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The translucent blue plastic is attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brush did have a small defect however. It looks like a little chink of plastic was knocked out but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 4.5 stars so I&#x27;m rounding up to 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li> This is what I would expect at a $ store.  Disappointing and too short for my 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; frame.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as always was helpful in arranging their no hastle return.</li>
            <li> We have been using back brushes with wood handles but noticed &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; forming on them.  My husband ordered this brush and really likes it.  It has &amp;#34;grippers&amp;#34; on the bottom of the handle so that it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands and is a pretty good length.  My only criticism is that the bristles are softer than I like but I would probably order this again.</li>
            <li> Do not hate it but the brushing quality is lacking..</li>
            <li> Good back scrubber. I would like for it to take soap a little better as I have problems with skin infections and need to wash carefully each night. I have been using it for a month and so far, it has gotten the job done. It is more substantial than the last two I used which only lasted a few weeks. I expect this to last for years.</li>
            <li> Way too stiff. Badly scratches my skin leaving red welts.Could not use it. Might be useful to scrub the shower walls.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush.  Got this for older lady who has only one arm to use.  Much needed and well received.  Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Good reach and well made.</li>
            <li> We love this brush. It is just long enough to reach all of my back and the curve helps make it comfortable, instead of awkward. This brush is made well and seems to be one built to last. Would recommend, highly.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moUZW6NI94VTC7]]My this brush is just like the pink my husband is using this it&#x27;s build the same as other pink brush and I gave video of before his use age , he likes it so far and he said it&#x27;s scrubs him so  thoroughly especially his hard to reach back area and he&#x27;s sees all the dead skins that was hard to get rid of with a wash cloth this body brush does the job correctly and now his skin feels more softener , and we put this in bathroom hung it up on hook with cord and it&#x27;s not in our way even though it&#x27;s a nice size of 15\\&quot; and he&#x27;s loves the non slip ridges on handle  .

            <li> Very nice brush!&lt;br /&gt;Really like the length and pretty color of this bath brush. The bristles are soft-enough -- if anything, I&#x27;d like them a bit firmer, but, it&#x27;s fine as it is; I can understand folks who use this as a dry skin brush, though I prefer natural bristles for that purpose.</li>
            <li> this brush is great! I read the other reviews and purchased based on those and was quite pleased. the price is good, the length of the handle is perfect, and the bristles are just the right texture and level of hardness or softness, depending on how you look at it. my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush and very well made. The problem is the handle is too short.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little soft, but still does the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and looks great. For my back though I wish it was about 6&amp;#34;-8&amp;#34; longer and the head is angled wrong for a back brush, it should be angled along the same curve as the handle. It&#x27;s great for legs, feet and such but not perfect for all those spots on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want a general purpose bath brush it&#x27;s perfect. If you are like me and are looking for one to reach those impossible spots on your back... Then keep looking because this is not going to do it.</li>
            <li> Great length / reaches middle of back.......Bristles are a little soft so lather up good........Should have bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> the brush is so very very rough on the edges and feels like it cuts into your skin I can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> Perfect for me. Nice and hard bristles, perfect length, and lite weight.</li>
            <li> Short handle, hard, lo quality bristles.  In all, a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> The handle. Is too short and the bristles are very HARD.  If you have sensitive skin, select a different brush, maybe one with natural bristles.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this for a family member and she loves it. It is just the right size/length and has a slight bend in the handle for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Great bath brush! Great transaction!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she seems pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great back brush..works wonderfully wet or dry.  The length is also quite generous. Am very pleased with the product.Shower brush</li>
            <li> I really liked this shower brush, it has just enough firmness. I was very disappointed that the handle snapped in two within a month of using it.</li>
            <li> It said long handle, I was expecting a longer handle.  I have shoulder problems and need a brush with a longer handle.  The brush is as any other brush with standard handle.</li>
            <li> great product. Helps me reach even my toes without bending. I will never do without this!!</li>
            <li> Great shower brush.  Pity you can&#x27;t find them at a neighborhood store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The bristle of the brush bends inwards after a week. But is okay and gives a good clean.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer- great brush, good curve to the handle, nice mid level stiffness of the bristles. Held up very well.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL BACK BRUSH.  It has just the right amount of bristle to do the job whether you pour Jo Malone Bath Soap or another good brand of cleanser about a quarter size on the brush and then go to town scrubbing hard to reach areas.  It is a treat to use this in the shower and then afterward a brisk towel dry and slather more body cream to hydrate you skin.  YOU will feel and smell like a queen!</li>
            <li> I debated about choosing this particular bath brush because a previous reviewer said it was too stiff or too short.  But it turns out to be perfect, and I love the feel of the brush on my back!  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and the length of the handle and the size of the brush works well for me. Bristles give the skin a nice work-out without feeling scratchy.  Very happy with this purchase, and it would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I think one of the big problems with us &amp;#34;guys&amp;#34; is our lack of ability to reach our backs in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are many of us with dirty backs for the reason that our hands can&#x27;t reach completely behind us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought it would be a great idea to purchase this shower brush.  The mention of a &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34; was the ultimate reason why I picked this one above others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, it&#x27;s a quality brush.  The bristles are not too stiff nor soft.  They retain body wash soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the handle is just wee short of being long enough.  I still have to really stretch to get to the upper blades on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my dad, he loves it!</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised by this brush.  I expected a nice brush but for me it&#x27;s great. I was looking for one where brush was firm but not so firm as to cause problems. This brush fit the bill. It&#x27;s firm and stiff enough to give your back a good scrubbing, but not in any way overly hard on my back. Some people might  find it a bit to firm, but it suits me to a tee. It also gets in some of the hard to reach areas too. I liked the handle&#x27;s grip which made it a bit easier to hold on to the brush if your hands are soapy. Overall, it was a very good replacement for my old worn out one. A good buy!</li>
            <li> A fine back-brush. When you have arthritis it is a must have.</li>
            <li> Handle not long enough to reach between shoulders.</li>
            <li> I had purchased two similar brushes from CVS and let me say what a piece of CR__P.  The had was good, but the handle was truly inferior.  The both brook in the same place.  The first time I used this brush, I said to my wife, This I can deal with.  It is durable, the head is great and by the way this was made in the USA.  After doing my due diligence, I have found that many, many China products contain LEAD!!!!!  Bottom line is, this brush delivers what was said it can do.</li>
            <li> Disappointed overall, very hard brush, too hard for normal skin</li>
            <li> Perfect!! for someone who needs a softer back brush</li>
            <li> The perfect length for any bath brush, but since it&#x27;s all plastic, the bristles are way too rough for skin. It&#x27;s roughness is perfect for feet, which are tough and love a good scrub. Now if I could just find a manufacturer who makes a one-piece brush this length with boar bristleâ€¦</li>
            <li> Nice product. Item is as described - sturdy plastic handle is contoured to help aid reaching while scrubbing your back. Bristles are not soft and mushy so it gets the job done well. Very timely delivery and the item is also packaged very well; I&#x27;ll doubtless order from them again.</li>
            <li> This is the right brush for me, However, it is short. Needs an additional 3 inches in length.</li>
            <li> Inadequate in all ways. It&#x27;s too short, the bristles are too soft, just not what I wanted. My son uses it as a toy, so not a total waste...</li>
            <li> My blue bath and shower brush arrived as a PINK shower brush instead. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the mistake in color, the brush does pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have a problem with is that the handle is very slippery and hard to hold onto; if they could just improve the texture of the grip to something a bit more aggressive that might fix the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you rough up the handle with some sand paper and dip the end in Rubber Dip tool coating I suspect this could be the perfect fix for someone who already owns this brush.</li>
            <li> handle is very slippery when wet.  bristles are just stiff enough.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too stiff.  It irritates my skin.  I have stopped using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too short. I&#x27;m a weighlifter, so my range of motion is limited when it comes to reaching behind my head/back. This scrubber is a bit short to reach all over my back. Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Works well.  The handle is long enough to reach everywhere on my back. Of course, for other people this assumes that one&#x27;s shoulder joints are flexible enough.</li>
            <li> It broke after three days.</li>
            <li> Handle was too short to reach many areas on my back.  Head appears ok.</li>
            <li> Bristles are stiff and don&#x27;t hold soap that well, though they do a pretty good job trapping body hair,</li>
            <li> The brush itself is durable. However, thinking that it was new and the bristles were stiff, I figured it would be a week or two with every day use before the bristles softened. The bristles never softened. This brush is painful. You would be better off scrubbing the shower tiles than your back.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy well made brush. I find it perfect for my back while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Nice firmness of bristles. Other more expensive brushes I have tried have bristles that are so soft that they don&#x27;t do anything. This works well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality brush--great for anyone with limited range of motion.</li>
            <li> Really annoying, I could have purchased one from the grocery store for $5 that had a longer handle. It&#x27;s about 2\\&quot; longer than a sheet of paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO- Completely false advertising. QUALITY BLUE BATH AND SHOWER BRUSH WITH LONG HANDLE. *1 YEAR GUARANTEE* Long Handled Shower, Body and Exfoliating Brush. Hygienic, Durable Plastic. Blue.</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> My  elderly husband has used the brush many times in the shower and loves it. The brush is well made and not heavy but sturdy. The color is a lovely clear blue. There is a string attached to the handle and you can hang it up.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this back brush</li>
            <li> It did come here on time and undamaged and it had a sturdy one piece handle and good medium bristles.  It did seem a bit awkward to use, but i might need to get more practice using it.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and i do recommend it.  Kimmie</li>
            <li> It does not have a long handle, it is way too short.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much shower brushes during my lifetime and most of them are stiff bristles which is like sandpaper if you don&#x27;t use them daily.  I like this one because its softer like a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not as long as I thought, but the brush is dense and good quality.</li>
            <li> work OK it reaches my back just fine i like it because the bristles were soft enough but not tao soft</li>
            <li> Lumbar spinal damage and subsequent fusion restrict my movement significantly  This blessing is compounded by arthritis.  Twisting and bending don&#x27;t happen much anymore.  Your brush handles very well and allows me to reach areas that would be otherwise impossible to access.  A wee bend in the handle end to hang the brush from the shower curtain rail would be handy.  Otherwise, a thoroughly useful tool.</li>
            <li> Makes every shower a pleasure.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, new, good price &amp; warranty. A quality unit !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too short or a handle to reach my upper back well and the bristles are too hard for me.  I dont use it much. When I did use it I dropped it and it shattered at the base of the brush.</li>
            <li> Good stiff bristles.  My husband loves it!!!</li>
            <li> well made, better than other brushes. just needs a longer handle as I am tall.</li>
            <li> I had a wooden handled back brush &amp; wood is never good in the water.  Love this one.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as pictured. Seems to be made well. Bought it for my husband and he likes that the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft or too stiff. I still think it was priced on the high side but it should last him a long time.</li>
            <li> Zero complaints about the seller, and expressions of approval for the product&lt;br /&gt;itself; it is a very good back brush.</li>
            <li> Looks good, feels good, works as expected. Brush is the right balance of stiff and soft. Length of handle is good, angled brush works well, ridges on grip help when handling a slippery soapy surface. Rinses easily and hangs from rope to drip dry between uses. I developed bursitis in my shoulder so I needed help to reach my back. Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t order this sooner.</li>
            <li> the handle is tough to grip if your hands are soapy... there are some grooves for gripping but they&#x27;re not substantial enough to help.  the bristles are very stiff too, so you&#x27;ll get a really good scrub.  if you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as they want you to believe.  After all the scratches healed, it was fine.  Seems to be well made and works.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this brush because the bristles are soft enough so they don&#x27;t scratch my skin.  At the same time, they are firm enough to give that mild tingle which feels so good.  I had never thought about using a brush like this as a dry brush for exfoliating until I read the description on the product page.  Now that is one of my favorite ways to use the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have any reservations about the brush it would have to concern the length of the brush.  The entire brush measures 14&amp;#34; in length with nine of those inches being the handle by itself.  That works, but it would make for an even more luxurious feel if I didn&#x27;t have to change hands and directions so often while using the brush in the shower.  I&#x27;ve not had any problem with rinsing the soap out of the bristles; the brush rinses clean every time.  The handle has a very definite patterning effect on it and that helps me hold on to the brush quite easily after it has gotten wet and soapy and there is a hanging loop on the end which feels like a nylon material.  The hanging loop allows me to make sure the brush is left in the best position for air drying between shower uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I have to say I&#x27;m enjoying using this bath brush.  Both wet and dry applications are working well for me and the only slight bother is the length of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this brush in exchange for a review.  The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3B7I4IPBTNXTY]]If you are looking for a bath brush with stiffer bristles than look no further.  This bath brush has a sturdy grooved handle, nice oval head, stiffer bristles and is just the right length to reach all of the spots.  The first thing I noticed about this brush was how nice it felt in my hand when I held it.  The bristles didn&#x27;t feel too stiff or rough when I ran my fingers through them but when I used the brush in the bathroom and the bristles were a little too stiff for my liking (but not stiff-stiff which would have resulted in a lower star rating).  I suppose after a few uses they will get broken in and soften but until then they are a little rough for my liking.  Some users may like this because it will really get the dirt off your skin - it all depends on what you are looking for in a bath brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to improve this bath brush, I would soften the stiffness from the start, so it doesn&#x27;t have to get broken in before the bristles start to soften.  I would also like to use the brush as a standalone brush, for scrubbing my arms and torso.  It would be nice if there was a way the handle could snap into the brush so the two could be detachable for greater versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> Using this back brush is like washing your back with sand paper.</li>
            <li> Well made and durable.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected cared to EarthLink brand</li>
            <li> This is my second bath brush. The first was a wooden one from another company that cracked at the brush head after less than a weeks use. Guess I should not have got it wet. LOL. This brush is very sturdy and the bristles will wear out after many years of service before THIS one cracks. Aesthetically, I like the look of wood, but when I am using it, I can&#x27;t see it anyway LOL. Seriously, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Pretty,  but bristles are too stiff.</li>
            <li> This is a simple body brush at a very good price. They recommend it for scrubbing your face which I disagree with. It is definitely medium stiffness and more for scrubbing your legs, back and feet. Do not expect this to be a super gentle soft brush and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I like it for what I need and would buy another one.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush with medium bristles.  It works well in the shower.  I would love it if the handle was about 1/3 longer and also wider. Probably for someone who is small and has little or medium sized hands the handle is a good fit.</li>
            <li> Way too short to be effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The bristles are WAY too hard to be used comfortably. Feels like it takes off a layer of skin every time I use it. Lathering is impossible. I do not suggest purchasing.</li>
            <li> Good points: plastic, so it wont get moldy.  Inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Bad points: 1. too short  2. bristles way too stiff  3. the &#x27;ergonomic&amp;#34; bend is done wrong, if you hold it up the tip of the handle is level with the tip of the brush.  It should have been angled so that the tip of the brush would be lower than the handle, thereby helping to reach your back.  Still, even if bent correctly, its too short by 4 inches.</li>
            <li> Works well but is developing rusty-looking spots where the bristles are glued in...which is strange because I rinse it well and hang it to dry after each use.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not great.  Bristles are a little stiff for my skin comfort.</li>
            <li> Slippery in the shower and hard to hold on to. Bristles scratch more than they brush.</li>
            <li> This brush felt soft out of the box (on my hand), but when used on my back/body/arms (maybe I have sensitive skin), it feels very stiff.</li>
            <li> I love the bristles on this brush...not too hard and not too soft either...just right! The arm reaches down my back just far enough for me and I love the color and that it is made of plastic and not wood which can mold and smell after getting wet and drying out! I would recommend this brush very highly.</li>
            <li> Great brush, good price.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my wife after I found that it relieved constant back itch.</li>
            <li> Great price on this brush.  The handle is a good length and it has a tie on the end to hang it up. The bristles are medium firmness, not too soft. You can get a good scrub, but if your skin is very sensitive it might be a little too rough.  For me it is just fine.</li>
            <li> I Like the Brush so much I bought my Husband and my son a Brush .</li>
            <li> Far to short for this old man. Bristles are way too stiff.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment. The brush is soft and nice, but it has that cheap brittle plastic handle that broke the first time it was dropped in the shower. It&#x27;s a goner. Seller did contact me right away about a refund, though. Good customer service.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews complaining about the handle being too short but assumed, as I am only 5&#x27; tall, that it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for me. Alas it is. It&#x27;s OK otherwise but next time I will look for a longer handle.</li>
            <li> I was once told that single people have dirty backs. While the innuendo is obvious, I also retorted that single people apparently donâ€™t know what a back scrubber is. The eponymous product is also quite useful for scrubbing other areas, especially if you have arthritis and and/or a medical condition that make it difficult to reach certain areas of your body to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, following in the footsteps of brushmakers before them, Top Notch has developed a Shower Brush that not only cleans but also exfoliates, claiming to leave your skin renewed and clean. So, how does it perform? A breakdown of the features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ The hard plastic handle is curved and also has ridges, ensuring a good grip (even when hands are wet and soapy), and the curve enables you to have a more solid scrubbing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ The bristles are plastic or nylon and feel somewhat like a semi-firm toothbrush. As a consequence, the brush is a bit rough on the skin at first. It doesn&#x27;t tear the flesh or anything that extreme, but it will most certainly leave skin bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ The brush isn&#x27;t too heavy, but if you dropped it on your foot it would definitely hurt a bit. That being said, the brush is durable and wont crack if dropped into the tub or onto the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Finally, the brush does develop a good lather and also rinses clean, helping to inhibit funky odors that could lead to the growth of mold or other unwanted issues in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are in the market for a sturdy backscrubber, the Top Notch Backscrubber is a worthy candidate that I can recommend. The ridges on the handle help you to maintain a grip, and the bristles are great for exfoliating and cleaning in hard-to-reach places. Thus, the Top Notch Backscrubber is an excellent candidate for a gift, or for personal use. Definitely recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

            <li> good brush for a good price, love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I rated 4 star only because the handle could be a little longer. That really is not a big issue. I&#x27;ve had wooden bath brushes and they always seem to crack and get stained and moldy.&lt;br /&gt;This brush just has a much cleaner look, they had good colors to choose from and the bristles are not too soft and not too stiff. It hangs in the shower by a rope and dries off.&lt;br /&gt;Good product and a great price!</li>
            <li> 2nd brush, holds up well, handle fits had well, brush is nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Bristles a little too hard.  Handle a little to short.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He has been wanting one of these for a while.  It does a great job exfoliating the skin, especially on those hard to reach places, like the shoulders and back.  Also, I love the plastic because it doesn&#x27;t get dirty and moldy like the wooden ones.  However, the bristles are very stiff and without water and a good lathering of soap, can be painful.  Also, when I received this in the mail, it had a chip at the edge of the brush head, and some of the bristles fell out.  If I bought another bath brush, I would try to find one with softer bristles.</li>
            <li> My old body brush, much used, has finally lost its zip and must be retired, but, though I&#x27;m sorry to see it go, I&#x27;m delighted to replace it with this new body brush.  I have spent a few minutes skin brushing and find the bristles to be a perfect texture for that purpose -- not too stiff, not too soft.  It features a nice long handle, easy to use on my back in the shower.  All in all, this is a good brush to rely on for skin brushing and keepiing your skin healthy and glowing.  I am happy to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Build is fine, but the bristles of the brush are much stiffer than I expected by a fair margin. Hoping they&#x27;ll ease up with some use.</li>
            <li> A bit firm even for someone without sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Cheap and not long in handle as stated!</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> THE HANDLE ON THIS BRUSH IS TOO SHORT,, BUT I&#x27;M KEEPING IT TO SCRUB,FROM THE NECK DOW,N.  I CAN NOT REACH MY BACK WITH IT.  IT IS VERY PRETTY.THOU. THE SHIPPING CHARGE WAS TOO MUCH FOR ONE ITEM!</li>
            <li> Loving this brush! Would have liked it to be a touch softer but it should soften over time.</li>
            <li> You will love this long nylon bristle brush. It should last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for maybe 6-7 months and used it only a handful of times. It started discoloring at the base roots of the brush. Besides that the ergonomics just aren&#x27;t designed for someone 6&#x27;3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good shower brush, but the bristles are a little stiff. I don&#x27;t mind it that much, and they seem to soften up a little bit after using it a few times. Just know that these aren&#x27;t soft bristles, these are the kinds of bristles that are going to scrub you clean, even if that means it&#x27;s going to hurt a little! I like that feeling though, after using this thing in the shower I feel like I am extremely clean when I come out.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Offered to me for evaluation and review, I find this shower brush one of the best of its kind. I chose the blue one (aquamarine actually) because of my bathroom colours, but it is also available in a pretty pink version.  I don&#x27;t have the best circulation and have been advised to do all I can to improve it.  Using a well-made brush like this one is a very easy way to turn a shower into a tonic massage, especially if you have the fortitude to do the alternating hot-cold water thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The synthetic bristles are kind to the skin but sufficiently firm to be effective.  Much better than a bath strap, and much more durable than natural loofah; my last one disintegrated after a few encounters with a cellulite scrub.  This brush washes well and remains fresh looking, and has a little cord loop for hanging to dry.  I love the textured ridges on the handle that give grip when your hands are soapy, and the gently curved handle seems to work well down the back, particularly, and to reach your feet if you have difficulty bending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to commit to the expense of a separate brush, this one will also work for dry-brushing before a bath or shower.  So a versatile, quality product that seems very easy to keep in good shape, and adds that touch of luxury to your bathroom routine.  It&#x27;s only after you have used a poorly-made brush that you appreciate something like this.</li>
            <li> This is the  second brush that I have purchased. I am very satisfied with the quality. Easy to use.</li>
