            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> A little pricy, it probably works, but I can&#x27;t tolerate the turpentine smell.</li>
            <li> This was missing from my order, along with any paper work..</li>
            <li> Only need a little mixed with a base.</li>
            <li> It is small so just keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li> I keep this small bottle in my jeans pocket in case of any emergency!</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed because I did not get Frankincense as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li> Sounds expensive</li>
            <li> Expensive, YES!</li>
            <li> outrageous price.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love the Frankincense and use YL oils every day.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured. I recieved a lower grade young living product called  &amp;#34;frerana frankincense&amp;#34; Somalia. I am not happy with this product and was warned by a young living consultant not to buy Young Living oils from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for a great price!</li>
            <li> The Young Living Frankincense Oil is superb. I&#x27;ve used other brands, but the Young Living brand is the best for me and it&#x27;s Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> Needed this in a hurry.  I gave my personal bottle to a friend and wanted to replace mine ASAP.  This is one I would not do without.</li>

            <li> wonderful oil. I  diffuse it  but also  use it  for my  skin.</li>

            <li> Exactly as expected. However, I wish they would distinguish between Sacred Frankincense and the &#x27;regular&#x27; variety in the description of the item. This is the &#x27;regular&#x27; one.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good brand.</li>

            <li> This was missing from my order, along with any paper work.. Packaged very poorly, open at both ends so I imagine It fell out!</li>

            <li> does many special things...love it.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet. How can you not love oils:)</li>
            <li> LOVE YL OILS and Frankincense is one of the &amp;#34;must have at all times&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s great for so many uses.  I am now a YL distributor.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived in good condition,  no evidence of tampering like other people have complained of.</li>
            <li> this is so good for any bug bites.  I carry it with me and use it on friends and they can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  It is good for cuts as well.  It is small so just keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li> nice scent.  comes out easilry but not too much at a time.  Delivered on time.  We&#x27;ll see if it works for what I want which is as a natural topical anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li> I use this in my aromatherapy. I love Young Living oils.</li>
            <li> Clears my head and I smell it and feel good! :)</li>
            <li> Bottle came with disintegrated label and oily.....not packaged well at all</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the product arrived in a timely manor. I usually order directly through Young Living so I am acquainted with their oils. This one is genuine and the price was good.</li>
            <li> It has many good uses but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This review only applies to the Young Living frankincense sold by Young Living Independent Distributor!! I am a Young Living independent distributor and my husband and I use Young Living frankincense internally for health issues. Since it is out of stock with the company right now, I hesitantly turned to the Internet because we need it. I spoke with Tim several times through email and he, being a YL distributor as well calmed my fears and doubts about its authenticity and not bring tampered with.  With a return guarantee if I didn&#x27;t feel like it was authentic, I ordered 3 bottles. I know my YL frankincense and this is authentic. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> The oil was not a Young Living authentic product. Lesson learned... if it&#x27;s too cheap to be true, it probably is...</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, good price. Would buy from again!</li>
            <li> great smell to me but feel it is was overpriced but than what is not these days,  So I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Love these oils! They help me w/o having to run to doctor for every little thing and also use them on my animals to help them feel better! I have horses and dogs...</li>
            <li> I love frankincense for my skin, and young living is great except it is very expensive.  I also took this internally and did not notice any difference.  The quality is great, the price is not.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it for all sorts of things. It has really helped clear up my breakouts and im so excited about the anti aging benefits. this is the secret to perfect skin.</li>
            <li> Young Living is the only Essential Oil Products I have found worth using.  One or two drops on a regular basis for better health</li>
            <li> Expensive, YES! Potent...YES! I love this oil! I use it for my thyroid and areas of concern. The smell is pretty nice as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Cleared my elbows--- doctors could never seem to have the answer.  Started using very diligently for&lt;br /&gt;approximately three weeks. It has cleared up took two bottles.  Sounds expensive but I have spent for several years never&lt;br /&gt;any results.  My niece told me about the product.  Works great!!!!  Do not purchase the cheaper oils made out of USA&lt;br /&gt;not the same!!!  This is a great product for insect bites etc.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS AND LOVE YL. we use this for my husbands back injury and we wouldnt use any other brand.......thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Super nice oil and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> The lid was cracked like the picture. But, it leaked out. I wasn&#x27;t ready for that.</li>
            <li> Frankincense oil is amazing. I use it mixed with coconut oil as a face cream to reduce wrinkles &amp; I&#x27;m using it on my husband&#x27;s face to treat precancerous spots. If you want to save 24% on Young Living products, please contact me! www.oilygurus.com/Mandy-Kutz/</li>

            <li> Was a little disappointed because I did not get Frankincense as it was advertised.  It was a blend of frankincense and another oil.</li>
            <li> Magical oilâ€¦can be used in many home remedy for lots of sickness</li>
            <li> great oil and was a good price.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Husband ordered because it was cheaper than DoTERRA.  I prefer by a mile, DoTERRA</li>
            <li> Great product have already used several time and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Young Living oils.  I use frankincense on a daily basis applying it to my face and adding a few drops to my first glass of water in the morning.  My order was delivered when promised and the sellers included several free samples of other oils! Sweet deal!!</li>
            <li> Good, the basil cell cancer on my nose shrunk after one bottle!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! However you can get it cheaper by signing up as a distributor for Young Living. On their site as a wholesaler you can get a 15ml bottle for just a little more than this 5 ml bottle! Contact me at nicole8632@gmail.com for more information!</li>
            <li> A little pricy, it probably works, but I can&#x27;t tolerate the turpentine smell.</li>
            <li> Love it... use it for everything...</li>
            <li> These prices reflect these people breaking up kits and ripping people off.  Get products through website.</li>
