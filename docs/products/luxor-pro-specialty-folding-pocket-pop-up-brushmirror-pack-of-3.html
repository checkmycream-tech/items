    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great for taming the helmet hair issue</li>
            <li>, It works great and has not broke yet..</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great to have a mirror in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife is not bald (lol) and used hers for hair management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, expeditious delivery!</li>
            <li>and the mirror is very handy.  </li>
            <li>These arrive promptly and quality seems very good, however they smell very strongly of moth balls.  </li>
            <li>the others are good.</li>
            <li>Good deal on these, to use in gift packs.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter and she was very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>The item turns out to be unbelievably handy to have around.  </li>
            <li>Great item - A must have if you need a quick hair fix and don&#x27;t always carry a handbag.</li>
            <li>This product had a very strong chemical odor that was not removed by washing the product in the dishwasher.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s just a brush, but it&#x27;s nice to have a mirror and brush together.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember where I first got one of these, but they are very handy to keep around.  </li>
            <li>These are kind of cheap quality, but for the money, you can&#x27;t expect much more.  </li>
            <li>BTW - There were 5-6, not 3 as in the item description:-)</li>
            <li>I bought while the 6 pack was being sold, but I do believe it&#x27;s still worthwhile just to get 3 of them.  </li>
            <li>Just keep in mind that a $1 brush is not going to be top of the line.</li>
            <li>One more brush to go.  </li>
            <li>Vendor sent them quickly, used them in the bridesmaid&#x27;s gift bags, and girls were thrilled to get them.</li>
            <li>or whatever it is holding the bristles has an unbelievably strong offensive odor.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>Quality is CHEAP</li>
            <li>I was able to finally find good folding hair brushes (with mirror)</li>
            <li>These little pop up brush with mirror are great for the purse, take up little space and work great, everyone should have one!  </li>
            <li>A six pack of them seems reasonable, and I can give one or more to friends or family members.     </li>
            <li>The bristles do not stay in line when opening/closing and during use, and it has a strong chemical smell that does not seem to improve much over time.</li>
            <li>I want to give these away in Christmas boxes for poor children, and thought the price was excellent.  </li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>I rarely use the one I keep in my purse or gym bag because I use quite a bit of hairspray on my hair and don&#x27;t brush it again during the day.  </li>
            <li>one broke right away.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little stiffer than the better ones, but I&#x27;m OK with that, too.  </li>
            <li>These are brittle and began losing teeth immediately on first use.</li>
            <li>But from the first use I could tell the quality was just not there.</li>
            <li>It fades with use but at first you don&#x27;t even want to touch them because you wonder if they&#x27;re toxic.  </li>
            <li>Fell apart at first use.</li>
            <li>Functionally, it works great, folds up small enough to fit in a pocket.</li>
            <li>Seriously, if you can&#x27;t stand having messy-feeling hair, these are a great product.  </li>
            <li>I love these brushes they easily fit in clothing pockets or small bags and are pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>You really need to start out just pushing on one side and let the other side roll out on its own.  </li>
            <li>love this type of brush to carry in my pocket for my long beard..  </li>
            <li>This collapsible brush is a great idea, but it is very shoddily made.</li>
            <li>It is also very durable.  </li>
            <li>That makes it much easier and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cheap and inexpensive, the mirror breaks off easily, but it is a small compact hair brush for my travel kit</li>
            <li>I keep one in my desk drawer downstairs, one in my purse, one in a drawer on the main level of our home and one in my car.  </li>
            <li>I ended up super gluing it back on.</li>
            <li>Pay a little bit more and get a decently made product.</li>
            <li>Useful only if you have no alternative.</li>
            <li>but the item&#x27;s tolerances would not permit normal operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they look good on the photos, but they are of a cheap rubber and the brush will crack down the middle after a few days of use and the bristles will fall out.</li>
            <li>frame tends to break, and the mirror half comes off sometimes, but even with the damage, it&#x27;s a great little brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Loose hairs are easy to clean out and the product folds to a nicely thin profile.  </li>
            <li>I had previously purchased 6 brushes without the mirrored handle and ended up throwing them away because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>and I love having small folding brushes that I can scatter out (car, desk, workbag, etc).  </li>
            <li>The first one broke the third day I used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, next time I&#x27;d probably buy a more expensive brand from a reputable travel goods company.  </li>
            <li>The tip broke of the first time I tried to open and use the brush.  </li>
            <li>They are so small you can fit them anywhere, even in a cute little party clutch</li>
            <li>This brush has not caught any of my hairs so far.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of light use, the rows of comb-like parts fell out of place, leaving just a couple of rows to do the job of brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is with these brushes, but for some reason they have a strong \\&quot;gasoline\\&quot; type smell to them.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought (different brand) lasted me for years with no smell or problems and was a bit larger.  </li>
            <li>I expected a cheap cloudy mirror due to the price point, but the mirror is very clear, though</li>
            <li>Odd, right?  </li>
            <li>The only hairs I have lost to this brush are the hairs that naturally fall out every time we brush our hair.</li>
            <li>I really could do without the pink brushes that I was sent.</li>
            <li>Not a real problem as I am only aware of the odor when I use the product and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think a brush this small and light could actually move my hair around, but this one does, and because it folds up completely, it doesn&#x27;t get tangled in other things (like my crocheted handbags).</li>
            <li>Considering that I&#x27;d been able to use my previous hairbrush for so many years, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that a seemingly identical product would break after only a dozen or so uses.</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes because I needed a small brush that would fit in my purse or travel luggage without tangling with other items.</li>

            <li> I glued it back together, and we&#x27;ll see how long that holds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a minor nuisance</li>
            <li> bald and bought the combs to help with my long beard.</li>
            <li> combs failed due to the parts becoming disengaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> locally, so these went away the moment I had the other in hand.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re purchasing these based on value, not high quality.  </li>
            <li> I had purchase a small non-folding hair brush from a local third world drug store</li>
            <li> I got mine from the little personal hygiene pack on a business class flight home from China.    </li>
            <li> I even use one for my everyday brush (I have short hair).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re careful about chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i threw it away and even the other two I didn&#x27;t use yet.</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s lasted without the breakage problems other reviewers have had.  </li>
            <li> I think I got suckered in due to the fact that the product was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Previous brush, purchased from Sally&#x27;s, lasted over 3 years.  </li>
            <li> This little brush has bristles that fold in on itself then folds in half to minimize the space required.  </li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the black material under the bristles all 3 brushes cracked.</li>
            <li> The one I replaced was at least 8 years old, that&#x27;s 8 years of extreme heat and cold, being smashed into small places and other trying circumstances.  </li>
            <li> I carry a small purse.</li>
            <li> The small, curved piece at the end which keeps the rubber bristles in place has popped off a couple times.</li>
            <li> No matter where I go, I have a brush there for those icky tangled moments.  </li>
            <li> , the old travel brush I had before would catch my hair and pull out from the root painfully every now and then.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use the bristles have already begun to snap off, and the rubber base has completely split (see uploaded image).</li>
            <li> I detected no initial bad smell as another reviewer wrote.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad that was necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used the mirror from time to time for working on industrial equipment, when I had to see behind an obstacle.</li>
            <li> The brushes were broken before five minutes were up.</li>
            <li> As of today, April 8, 2014, two of the brushes have broken.  </li>
            <li> I then decided to try this version - with the mirrored handle and while the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as my previous purchase, it still has a lingering \\&quot;gasoline\\&quot; type smell to it.</li>
            <li> None of them have failed on me yet.  </li>
            <li> The brush is also difficult to fold/unfold because the rubber base material is very stiff.</li>
            <li> Too bad, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Len</li>
            <li> I now know it&#x27;s inexpensive because it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> These are horribly made and I returned them immediately.</li>
            <li> horrible don&#x27;t​</li>

            <li> Twice I have tried to order this product, and twice my order was canceled with no explanation.  I&#x27;m trying again, but this is my last effort.  I want to give these away in Christmas boxes for poor children, and thought the price was excellent.  Hope I actually get them this time!</li>
            <li> These little pop up brush with mirror are great for the purse, take up little space and work great, everyone should have one!  Vendor sent them quickly, used them in the bridesmaid&#x27;s gift bags, and girls were thrilled to get them.</li>
            <li> This product had a very strong chemical odor that was not removed by washing the product in the dishwasher.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for about three years now, and I&#x27;ve used it nearly daily. I got mine from the little personal hygiene pack on a business class flight home from China.    I travel a lot, and mine just broke while in Kuwait. It&#x27;s still usable, but I need to replace it. A six pack of them seems reasonable, and I can give one or more to friends or family members.     Sure, it&#x27;s just a brush, but it&#x27;s nice to have a mirror and brush together. I&#x27;ve even used the mirror from time to time for working on industrial equipment, when I had to see behind an obstacle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair and I love having small folding brushes that I can scatter out (car, desk, workbag, etc).  These are kind of cheap quality, but for the money, you can&#x27;t expect much more.  They did have a chemical smell, so I just let them air out for a while and it&#x27;s not a problem.  They&#x27;re a little stiffer than the better ones, but I&#x27;m OK with that, too.  They come in a variety of colors, so you don&#x27;t get to select one... if that&#x27;s a problem for you... it wasn&#x27;t for me.      You&#x27;re purchasing these based on value, not high quality.  BTW - There were 5-6, not 3 as in the item description:-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve carried one of these in my motorcycle tank bag for years until it finally gave up the ghost.  This little brush has bristles that fold in on itself then folds in half to minimize the space required.  Great for taming the helmet hair issue women get.  It is also very durable.  The one I replaced was at least 8 years old, that&#x27;s 8 years of extreme heat and cold, being smashed into small places and other trying circumstances.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> the rubber? or whatever it is holding the bristles has an unbelievably strong offensive odor.  Doesn&#x27;t wash away. don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> This brush is convenient, durable, and pocketable. It works just fine. I keep one in my car at all times. I&#x27;ve dropped it without breaking the mirror. I detected no initial bad smell as another reviewer wrote.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for such a device, this one works.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they easily fit in clothing pockets or small bags and are pretty sturdy.  Great item - A must have if you need a quick hair fix and don&#x27;t always carry a handbag.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she was very pleased with them.  It was just what she was looking for to keep in her purse.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the black material under the bristles all 3 brushes cracked. These brushes literally fall apart. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This collapsible brush is a great idea, but it is very shoddily made. I gave them to three of my granddaughters. The brushes were broken before five minutes were up.</li>
            <li> This has recently been changed from a pack of 6 for 9.99 to a pack of 3 for 9.99!  I bought while the 6 pack was being sold, but I do believe it&#x27;s still worthwhile just to get 3 of them.  I keep one in my desk drawer downstairs, one in my purse, one in a drawer on the main level of our home and one in my car.  No matter where I go, I have a brush there for those icky tangled moments.  Seriously, if you can&#x27;t stand having messy-feeling hair, these are a great product.  They are so small you can fit them anywhere, even in a cute little party clutch and the mirror is very handy.  I expected a cheap cloudy mirror due to the price point, but the mirror is very clear, though small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loose hairs are easy to clean out and the product folds to a nicely thin profile.  Figuring out the quickest way to get the bristles to pop out was a bit of an annoyance to me.  You really need to start out just pushing on one side and let the other side roll out on its own.  That makes it much easier and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the old travel brush I had before would catch my hair and pull out from the root painfully every now and then.  This brush has not caught any of my hairs so far.  The only hairs I have lost to this brush are the hairs that naturally fall out every time we brush our hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is with these brushes, but for some reason they have a strong \\&quot;gasoline\\&quot; type smell to them. I had previously purchased 6 brushes without the mirrored handle and ended up throwing them away because of the strong smell. I then decided to try this version - with the mirrored handle and while the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as my previous purchase, it still has a lingering \\&quot;gasoline\\&quot; type smell to it. Functionally, it works great, folds up small enough to fit in a pocket.</li>
            <li> they look good on the photos, but they are of a cheap rubber and the brush will crack down the middle after a few days of use and the bristles will fall out. i threw it away and even the other two I didn&#x27;t use yet.</li>
            <li> one broke right away. the others are good. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush, it&#x27;s a mirror, its....................fantastic.  Was what I was expecting.  Good deal on these, to use in gift packs.</li>
            <li> These are brittle and began losing teeth immediately on first use. I was able to finally find good folding hair brushes (with mirror) locally, so these went away the moment I had the other in hand. Useful only if you have no alternative.</li>
            <li> The moment I took these out of the package and tried to open one of the brushes, it fell apart into 3 pieces. These are horribly made and I returned them immediately. Pay a little bit more and get a decently made product.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes because I needed a small brush that would fit in my purse or travel luggage without tangling with other items. I carry a small purse. These do the trick. I have had them for 5 months now and have only had 1 issue. The small, curved piece at the end which keeps the rubber bristles in place has popped off a couple times. I ended up super gluing it back on. I don&#x27;t use the brush every day so it&#x27;s a minor nuisance and I have not had any issues with the rubber splitting. Just keep in mind that a $1 brush is not going to be top of the line.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think a brush this small and light could actually move my hair around, but this one does, and because it folds up completely, it doesn&#x27;t get tangled in other things (like my crocheted handbags).</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace one I had purchased at a brick and mortar beauty supply.  The item turns out to be unbelievably handy to have around.  I keep one in my desk, my car and a travel kit.  These arrive promptly and quality seems very good, however they smell very strongly of moth balls.  Odd, right?  Not a real problem as I am only aware of the odor when I use the product and it does not seem to transfer to my hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a folding hairbrush to replace a trusty one that I had for over a decade. Since this looked identical, I went for it. But from the first use I could tell the quality was just not there. The bristles do not stay in line when opening/closing and during use, and it has a strong chemical smell that does not seem to improve much over time. It often causes my hair to smell as well. The brush is also difficult to fold/unfold because the rubber base material is very stiff. After a few weeks of use the bristles have already begun to snap off, and the rubber base has completely split (see uploaded image). Considering that I&#x27;d been able to use my previous hairbrush for so many years, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that a seemingly identical product would break after only a dozen or so uses.</li>
            <li> They give you a pack of three because you&#x27;ll need them!! The first one broke the third day I used it. The second one broke three weeks later. The third one I kept strictly for travel and it lasted four days in to my trip. I had purchase a small non-folding hair brush from a local third world drug store, It works great and has not broke yet.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> cheap and inexpensive, the mirror breaks off easily, but it is a small compact hair brush for my travel kit</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember where I first got one of these, but they are very handy to keep around.  I have one in my travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frame tends to break, and the mirror half comes off sometimes, but even with the damage, it&#x27;s a great little brush.</li>
            <li> I carry one of these everywhere.  I even use one for my everyday brush (I have short hair).  I carry spares to the gym and have given them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But oh, the stink!  It fades with use but at first you don&#x27;t even want to touch them because you wonder if they&#x27;re toxic.  Don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re careful about chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/3/13:  I&#x27;m still using one from this purchase for my daily brush. I don&#x27;t fold and unfold the one I use daily so maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s lasted without the breakage problems other reviewers have had.  I rarely use the one I keep in my purse or gym bag because I use quite a bit of hairspray on my hair and don&#x27;t brush it again during the day.  None of them have failed on me yet.  And it&#x27;s great to have a mirror in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, next time I&#x27;d probably buy a more expensive brand from a reputable travel goods company.  The first one I bought (different brand) lasted me for years with no smell or problems and was a bit larger.  Another one that I bought afterwards and before these rubbed color off all over the inside of my purse.  That was not this item, but just saying, I&#x27;d upgrade next time.</li>
            <li> It mentions it would be possible to get this in another color.  IT DOES NOT SAY color is sellers choice.&lt;br /&gt;I love this type of brush to carry in my pocket for my long beard..  I really could do without the pink brushes that I was sent.</li>
            <li> I received these on February 28, 2014.  As of today, April 8, 2014, two of the brushes have broken.  I bought these for my husband and neither brush has lasted a month.  One more brush to go.  The brush seam ripped in the same place on both brushes.  Previous brush, purchased from Sally&#x27;s, lasted over 3 years.  Very disappointed.  Of course, the return period has passed by 9 days.</li>
            <li> I got three brushes with my order,after opening each 3 or 4 times iit just came apart. Also smelled like kerosene.</li>
            <li> The tip broke of the first time I tried to open and use the brush.  I glued it back together, and we&#x27;ll see how long that holds.  Too bad that was necessary.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, expeditious delivery!</li>
            <li> Fell apart at first use. This replaced a similar folding brush with mirror that had lasted me over ten years. Quality is CHEAP</li>
            <li> horrible don&#x27;t​ buy it!</li>
            <li> This item consists of several comb-like parts bound together to form a brush. Each \\&quot;comb\\&quot; contains bristles that arrange your hair. After a few weeks of light use, the rows of comb-like parts fell out of place, leaving just a couple of rows to do the job of brushing. I tried gluing the parts back together but the item&#x27;s tolerances would not permit normal operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bald and bought the combs to help with my long beard. My wife is not bald (lol) and used hers for hair management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both combs failed due to the parts becoming disengaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item ought to be dropped from Amazon&#x27;s offerings, imo. I think I got suckered in due to the fact that the product was inexpensive. I now know it&#x27;s inexpensive because it&#x27;s worthless. Too bad, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Len</li>
