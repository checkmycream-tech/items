            <li> They ship right away!  Perfect - brand new love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both bags for a while now (probably around 6 months) and I&#x27;m still very pleased. The quality of the bags are still look just as new as the day that I&#x27;ve received them in the mail (I applause the people who made it because I have thrown the bags around a lot). The material on the outside is rather soft and fragile-feeling but it still manages to hold everything very well on the inside. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars was because I was hoping that the bags would be able to stand up on its own but depending on how many things are in it, they mainly weren&#x27;t able to for me.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are two different sized cosmetic bags, because you can choose the size that is more convenient for every occasion. The smaller one is great for using everyday and keeping all the essentials together in your bag. The bigger one can be used on trips, if you are a person that packs only what is needed.</li>
            <li> For the price, I can&#x27;t complain but the accompanying perfume sample does not spray.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Its great.  The colors are vibrant and they&#x27;re exactly what I wanted.  I actually use the larger bag for my checkbook and coupons and the smaller one as a change purse.</li>
            <li> Cute cosmetic bags, arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Very nice bags for the price! And larger than expected! They are perfect for keeping my purse organized. I&#x27;m even thinking of buying a second set.</li>
            <li> Love the inside is super easy to clean the big bag is bigger then I expected still a great size!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice little makeup bag, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Lovely and functional. They make great clutch purses, too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set it was even bigger than I thought love the colours  great purchase I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Excellent, really great cosmetic bags for a very good price</li>
            <li> Just as pictured, cute and colorful.  Lightweight, sort of textured canvasy-plastic material that you would expect.  Both zip up smoothly.  Great deal, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my &amp;#34;Tween&amp;#34; niece, put some special make-up inside $$$$, she loved it!</li>

            <li> To my pleasant surprise, the bags were larger than I thought they would be! The vibrant colors and floral patterns are beautiful and the zippers seem durable. The material of the bag is a bit rougher than expected but that&#x27;s not big deal. As long as it lasts me a long time, I&#x27;m a happy camper! I also love how this product comes with 2 bags. I can&#x27;t wait to use these when I go to Japan and Taiwan in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the cosmetic bags. The fabric and design are very nice and they were an exceptional deal!! The smaller one fits in my purse - perfect!</li>

            <li> Love it. Canvas material, dimensions are accurate from description. Came after a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with  this set of 2 cosmetic bags, nice sizes, nice color, good space inside in both bags. I&#x27;m saving them, for my next trip out of the Country to carry with me my cosmetics, can&#x27;t go with out them!&lt;br /&gt;Good buy, good brand, good size, pretty color, and I like it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Very well made and large enough sizes.  Glad i bought them.</li>
            <li> Adorable set of Cosmetic bags.  Perfect size and zips nicely.</li>
            <li> They are totally worth it. Great amount of interior space and nice quality. Interior is nicely lined and zipper works. Looking forward to using it in the near future.</li>
            <li> Update July 2017: still using these bags!  Wash them in cold water, gentle cycle, air dry and they stay nice and clean, and are still in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2015: Adorable little cosmetic bags!  Very feminine.  Feels delicate, but also good quality.  I can use the small one for everyday and the larger one for traveling.  The bottom of the bags are flat so it can sit up.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Used the smaller bag to hold my basic makeup(eyeliner, eyelash curler, mascara, foundation, powder, eyebrow pencil, etc.) and the bigger bag as a pencil pouch for school. Can be interchangeable if my makeup collection expands. Very durable quality as well.</li>
            <li> Great affordable gift for office staff. Great colors and quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for small toiletries for young girls.  My girls loved them!</li>
            <li> i like the lining they have inside, don&#x27;t have to worry about my eye pencils poking through or smearing through. The bigger bag I use to carry 2 diapers and a small pouch of baby wipes, perfect when I want to change my baby but don&#x27;t want to carry the whole diaper bag. Really good size, great for the price!</li>
            <li> Pretty bags, can&#x27;t beat two for the price of one. Good size, even the smaller one. However the material is very thin so I don&#x27;t expect them to last for very long. They look nice but feel cheap.</li>
            <li> The bags were bigger than I thought-- they hold a lot.  Very pretty, crafted well and at a great price.  I have had no problems with the zippers. I use the smaller one in my purse for on the go essentials and the larger one as a cosmetic bag when travelling.</li>
            <li> It is perfect. Just what I expected. I posted earlier and hit one star in error. It is a 5 star item!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at the quality of these cosmetic bags.  They are well made, the zippers work nicely and they are lined so nothing spills into my purse.  Just perfect.</li>
            <li> They came in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Very bright and pretty.  Well made.</li>
            <li> Good size and quality for the price.Size as mentioned.Looks like can be hand washed.</li>
            <li> didnt look good in real</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!! Great deal!!!</li>
            <li> Love these beautiful bags! Gave them to my daughter as a gift and the first time she went to zip the larger one closed, the zipper fell apart. Very disappointing because they are beautiful bags...</li>
