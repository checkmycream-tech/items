            <li>I&#x27;ve never been good with hair</li>
            <li>I bought it because it seemed like a good idea but dissapointed now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are perfect to hold my hair up during the hot months of summer.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how much I love them!</li>
            <li>I used the foam kind  before and thought these might be easier because they clipped together.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to put on</li>
            <li>Super cheap too!!!</li>
            <li>I use this product to tuck hair under instead of making a full oval bun, and it&#x27;s really more attractive that way.  </li>
            <li>Love these..  </li>
            <li>I bought some of these many years ago, and have been looking for them again.  </li>
            <li>Thought it was a wonderful till suddenly SNAP ...</li>
            <li>These are ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t be getting anymore.</li>
            <li>Every time I wear them I have coworkers and customers asking how I get such perfect buns.</li>
            <li>wish they have more specified sizes.</li>
            <li>These had been my favorite things for holing her hair.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I like it much more than the sponge bun.</li>
            <li>Love love love with this product.</li>
            <li>i realy like this items better thn the sponge.</li>
            <li>I would recommend everyone :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe these aren&#x27;t more readily available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hairagami and other bunmaker products, but this works best for me.  </li>
            <li>these must help you to form bun easy, but they are plastic and not flexible.</li>
            <li>They do not hold my fine hair.</li>
            <li>These are very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>this is a very nice product easy to use and it looks reallly nice, but they should make it a little bit longer for people with a lot hair like me..</li>
            <li>So my bun isn&#x27;t perfect (because of the uneven ends) but it keeps my hair out of the way at work and doesn&#x27;t slip around.</li>
            <li>Bun doesnt come up perfect round shape.</li>
            <li>if you buy this product make sure you get the right size - I need the 8.5 inch size for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I own sponge bun makers, but always have to use a bobby pin to complete.</li>
            <li>These are fairly brittle plastic and will break eventually, so get several.  </li>
            <li>They also give my hair a great curl when I take it down.</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair though so that might be the REAL problem.</li>
            <li>i recomended very much and it does not cost alot</li>
            <li>it broke in two during first use.</li>
            <li>Would be better for short hair.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, don&#x27;t pull my hair (like some more expensive bun makers have) and they are seriously so so simple (takes me maybe 5 minutes to get the perfect bun).</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t good for thin or fine hair</li>
            <li>They are so easy to figure out, it doesn&#x27;t matter that the instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li>But if you need to keep your hair back all day, this will make a neat bun very quickly and it stays put.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t break your hair like pony tail holders and gives you a nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; tight bun like look..</li>
            <li>So easy to use and holds hair in a bun for as long as you like.</li>
            <li>The hooks help keep it tighter so it grips better than any other sponge.</li>
            <li>Not only did these arrive super fast (three weeks sooner than the arrival date</li>
            <li>Overall, well worth it, particularly if you dance or do lab work, or do anything else which requires you to get your mane up and keep it up..</li>
            <li>Got these pretty fast but only TWO in package!!</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska</li>
            <li>Make a good messy bun , but i haven&#x27;t mastered getting a tight bun with it yet.  </li>
            <li>this product is hard to use it falls out easily even if you didnt do anything.</li>
            <li>I found a video on You Tube, of course, also in Chinese, but it was a clear demonstration.</li>
            <li>It took a few weeks for this product to arrive but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These are not bad but hard to use.</li>
            <li>Plus, I hate using bobby pins and doing hair in general, but this is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian, and have straight hair with a little body, about to the middle of my back.  </li>

            <li> I would not recommend it for long hair....</li>
            <li> I was confused at first because the instructions were in a different language, but you can just look up \\&quot;How to use plastic bun maker\\&quot; and video tutorials will come up.</li>

            <li> This bun maker keeps my hair very tight.</li>

            <li> I have hair just past my shoulders and very thick, with some layering.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, these do not work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me... I have super fine hair though so that might be the REAL problem.</li>
            <li> I used to wear these when I was younger and they seemed to disappear from the market.  I was very happy to find them online.  They came in a timely manor and are just as I remember.</li>
            <li> These are not bad but hard to use. I found it slipping out of my hair. Colors were good though</li>
            <li> Love these..  don&#x27;t break your hair like pony tail holders and gives you a nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; tight bun like look.. great deal on here too!</li>
            <li> All three pieces were black, even though the description says &amp;#34;brown, black and burgundy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> doesnt work at all, i bought this for my daughter but never used it even once, hair just fall down/</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad, but really for hair thinner than mine. I&#x27;ve had similar ones from Claire&#x27;s that are longer and sturdier, but a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought some of these many years ago, and have been looking for them again.  I was over the moon that you were stocking them.  They are perfect to hold my hair up during the hot months of summer.  They also give my hair a great curl when I take it down.</li>
            <li> Sadly, these do not work. They do not hold my fine hair. They do not hold my volume of hair. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a wonderful till suddenly SNAP ...it broke in two during first use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my long hair. Would be better for short hair. I would not recommend it for long hair....</li>
            <li> This is a great bun maker. My hair is at the bottom of my back and about medium thickness. It takes some practice!!! So be patient. The instructions are in Chinese so they were no help. I found a video on You Tube, of course, also in Chinese, but it was a clear demonstration. This bun maker keeps my hair very tight. I like how it hooks together at the bottom. I own sponge bun makers, but always have to use a bobby pin to complete. With this type, I don&#x27;t need an additional pin. Super cheap too!!!</li>
            <li> These are ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t be getting anymore. They were harder to use than anticipated and not as flexible as others on the market.</li>
            <li> Got these pretty fast but only TWO in package!! They we&#x27;re also the same color not what I ordered. It does state 3 pcs brown black and burgundy.  Sigh....3$ you get what you pay for:(</li>
            <li> These bun makers are a waste of money.  I tried using them watching a video on youtube but couldn&#x27;t get it to work like it did for the girl on the video.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  If you know what these are, they work.  Don&#x27;t expect any english on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know what these are, you thread your hair through the middle, pull the bun maker to the ends of your hair, roll, clip, and you have your bun.  These won&#x27;t work too well if your hair is down to your waist, or at your collar, or heavily layered.  I have hair just past my shoulders and very thick, with some layering.  So my bun isn&#x27;t perfect (because of the uneven ends) but it keeps my hair out of the way at work and doesn&#x27;t slip around.</li>
            <li> Not only did these arrive super fast (three weeks sooner than the arrival date I was given- I live in Alaska so EVERYTHING takes forever to arrive) but they work like a dream. Every time I wear them I have coworkers and customers asking how I get such perfect buns. They are so easy to figure out, it doesn&#x27;t matter that the instructions are in Chinese. Very sturdy, don&#x27;t pull my hair (like some more expensive bun makers have) and they are seriously so so simple (takes me maybe 5 minutes to get the perfect bun). I can&#x27;t express how much I love them! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Make a good messy bun , but i haven&#x27;t mastered getting a tight bun with it yet.  I used the foam kind  before and thought these might be easier because they clipped together.  They are tough because of the large opening in the middle.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice product easy to use and it looks reallly nice, but they should make it a little bit longer for people with a lot hair like me..</li>
            <li> Delivery was faster than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used only one and it worked well except the size is bigger than my hair volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they have more specified sizes.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks for this product to arrive but it was worth the wait. So easy to use and holds hair in a bun for as long as you like. I can&#x27;t believe these aren&#x27;t more readily available.</li>
            <li> this product is hard to use it falls out easily even if you didnt do anything. It isn&#x27;t good for thin or fine hair</li>
            <li> These had been my favorite things for holing her hair. We had not seen any n the stores for years. Neesdless to say when we found these we stocked up.</li>
            <li> Did NOT like these one but, Very stiff and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve never been good with hair so I can never make buns. Plus, I hate using bobby pins and doing hair in general, but this is such a great product. I like it much more than the sponge bun. The hooks help keep it tighter so it grips better than any other sponge. I was confused at first because the instructions were in a different language, but you can just look up \\&quot;How to use plastic bun maker\\&quot; and video tutorials will come up. It&#x27;s very easy to use. Now I can make a bun in seconds and keep my hair out of my face.&lt;br /&gt;In Love love love with this product. &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> These are fairly brittle plastic and will break eventually, so get several.  But if you need to keep your hair back all day, this will make a neat bun very quickly and it stays put.  I&#x27;ve tried hairagami and other bunmaker products, but this works best for me.  I am Caucasian, and have straight hair with a little body, about to the middle of my back.  Neat hair is a safety issue for my work.  I use this product to tuck hair under instead of making a full oval bun, and it&#x27;s really more attractive that way.  Sometimes i wear a snood over it.  CAVEAT: if you buy this product make sure you get the right size - I need the 8.5 inch size for my hair.  Also, if your hair is much longer than mine, you will have trouble turning it under.  Overall, well worth it, particularly if you dance or do lab work, or do anything else which requires you to get your mane up and keep it up..</li>
            <li> i realy like this items better thn the sponge.Its very easy to put on i recomended very much and it does not cost alot</li>
            <li> these must help you to form bun easy, but they are plastic and not flexible. Bun doesnt come up perfect round shape. I bought it because it seemed like a good idea but dissapointed now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend</li>
            <li> These came earlier actually very earlier than expected. These are very useful and easy to use. I would recommend everyone :)</li>
