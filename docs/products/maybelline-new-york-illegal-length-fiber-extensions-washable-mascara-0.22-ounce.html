            <li>This mascara achieves this tricksy perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Excellent mascara.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mascara hoping to replace a very good lengthing mascara from Avon which is now discontinued.  </li>
            <li>but this is a good addition to my ever growing mascara supply!</li>
            <li>Great mascara</li>
            <li>Great item...fast shipping... will order again</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and women asking me what kind of mascara I use because it is so great.</li>
            <li>Love the length I get from this mascara!  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake either, which is also nice since again</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and does make lashes look longer!  </li>
            <li>This does not leave a smudge mark under my eye by the end of the day which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara and keep ordering it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many, many mascaras.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and invest in a better mascara</li>
            <li>This is a great fiber mascara that leaves your lashes looking so much longer.</li>
            <li>No matter what I will never be able to ever rely on just one mascara</li>
            <li>i am so in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love how MAC mascara has that light rose perfume to it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>it you want more.</li>
            <li>but it does give me some volume too, but I am more concerned with length.</li>
            <li>Everyone is complaining about the mascara not giving full lashes, but it&#x27;s more of a lengthening mascara (hence the name!).</li>
            <li>It also wears well during the day and washes off easily at night.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a cheaper version of the L&#x27;Oreal fiber mascara, but it is, in fact, just cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a great fiber mascara, I also use it as a top coat on my other mascara for longer looking lashes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this low cost fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>I will  be going back to my old mascara by Rimmel as I am VERY happy with that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the full spectrum of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different mascaras and this is one of the better.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel super fancy.</li>
            <li>(didn&#x27;t have to be exact!)</li>
            <li>I think I would probably follow up with Great Lash just to add a little pop at the outsides.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara so far.</li>
            <li>to get it to even do anything worth it.</li>
            <li>kind of move it back and forth while applying upward.</li>
            <li>So users are right</li>
            <li>just need to apply it right.</li>
            <li>I have used Maybelline Great Lash in the past and it flakes off before lunch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to be using this because it is my first Maybelline New York mascara.</li>
            <li>The length of my lashes did not increase enough to be noticed, but the clumps sure got attention.</li>
            <li>I have short but thick lashes, and I was willing to try this out, because I love Maybelline Great Lash...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really the nastiest mascara I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I found that this mascara did ZERO for volume, but it really did add length.</li>
            <li>or it goes on way too much</li>
            <li>Not clumpy at all and works very well.</li>
            <li>Really does lengthen your lashes.  </li>
            <li>So i dont really care for it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it adds as much length as expected, but it does give me alot more length and gives my lashes a fuller look.</li>
            <li>It was not any better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>would give this more stars, but you need to use so much of this that it&#x27;s just not worth the time</li>
            <li>I bought fiber mascara before,but it was decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not dexterous enough to apply falsies convincingly but this mascara gives me similar length!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t give your lashes anymore length than a normal &#x27;length&#x27; mascara.</li>
            <li>When i first opened it, there was barely anything on the brush.</li>
            <li>Take your time for super long lashes.</li>
            <li>I have naturally short little eyelashes, this mascara is my absolute favorite (and I&#x27;m a mascara junkie).</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried a Maybelline product and it will be the last.</li>
            <li>Its not a one-stop shop, but for 8 bucks, a little time will get you some nice long lashes at drug store prices!</li>
            <li>all and definitely lengthens my lashes pretty nice, BUT it takes about 4 sometimes 5 coats before I can actually see anything on my lashes because hardly any mascara comes out on the wand.</li>
            <li>I bought this last week because I wanted to see if it really does what it says...</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this.</li>
            <li>I look for a mascara that improves my natural appearance rather than screaming HELLO</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different mascaras &amp; most of them just made my eyelashes look all clumped together.</li>
            <li>The only downside is it only lasts a couple months before it runs out or dries out, but its still worth it to me.</li>
            <li>After it dries, wait about 20 minutes at least, curl your lashes again and watch out for huge super long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first noticed that the bottle felt almost completely empty.</li>
            <li>I have very thin and pretty short natural lashes and am always trying out new mascaras and have tried everything from cheap drugstore brands, like this, to expensive high end ones and this one is nice and</li>
            <li>, I know I need to open a new tube because I start to see some flaking under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>ok it just wasnt thick enough.</li>
            <li>Only to save as much as this as possible otherwise apply a couple coat of this for the same results</li>
            <li>So the more you use, your lashes end up looking like broken spider legs.</li>
            <li>The brush is very sparse, so forget about separating lashes with it, and the mascara clumps and strings from the end of the wand, almost ensuring you will get it some place OTHER than your lashes.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that once in a while, one of the fibers gets in my eye, but aside from that minor annoyance, I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>so long they nearly reach my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I am always willing to try new maybelline products and this by far is the worse.</li>
            <li>I guess the only thing missing is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pretty smell.</li>

            <li> People will actually remark on how long my eyelashes are!  </li>
            <li> This mascara was the most disappointing mascara ever.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes freakishly long...</li>
            <li> It stays put, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lashes, it works as described.  </li>
            <li> Many think it is a very expensive kind and are shocked when I tell them, explaining to me that they just spent $30+ on a mascara that doesn&#x27;t even come close to how well mine works.</li>
            <li> The commercial for it was very convincing,but unfortunately the mascara wasnt.</li>
            <li> The rest flaked away and smudged up under my eyes over the next few hours.</li>
            <li> It felt as if the tube was empty.</li>
            <li> I thought I got an empty bottle..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not much of a makeup girl, just a tinted moisturizer and mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, and I really think saying it adds 3mm is a bit dramatic.  </li>
            <li> (I know crazy right?!)</li>
            <li> This mascara is bad on so many levels, it is hard to believe anyone at Maybelline actually tested the product before naming it or creating the marketing campaign.</li>
            <li> First, there are NO \\&quot;illegal lengths\\&quot; to be gotten from this product, but it does clump lashes together in unattractive and weird-looking spikes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, no problems.</li>
            <li> The only thing that upset me was that it was late.</li>
            <li> After seeing some of the commercials for Illegal Length, I wondered if this product really worked..</li>
            <li> B0043IX95I Rimmel Lash Accelerator Mascara Black]]</li>
            <li> The previous reviewers were right: this is a *very* thin mascara!</li>
            <li> Sorry I tried something new.</li>
            <li> After a few hours of wearing this product, it began flaking unattractively onto my lower lids, creating the dreaded \\&quot;racoon\\&quot; effect, and without any crying, sweating, or rubbing on my part.</li>
            <li> If you have short, thin lashes, I think you&#x27;ll like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I get asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes or if I have naturally long lashes...</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from my usual make-up remover to specially-formulated lid and lash wash, and it takes three to four washings to get about 80% of it off...</li>
            <li> I usually curl my lashes before applying mascara, so that helps a ton.</li>
            <li> It hardly goes on at all</li>
            <li> I do use another mascara along with it to get the thick lashes I want, but that&#x27;s my choice to use two types.</li>
            <li> Since its so thin, the clumps just work themselves out.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 months and my lashes have broken off in sections on both eyes.</li>
            <li> I suppose it is thin</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thin, but it&#x27;ll make you look</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of lashes to a false eyelash mishap years ago</li>
            <li> I AM WEARING MAKEUP TO FALSELY MAKE MYSELF LOOK PRETTIER.  </li>
            <li> so disappointing, please dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> It does have weird fibers in it, but they WORK.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> adds just the length i need to make my eye lashes look as if i have fake ones on.</li>
            <li> Finally, it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove.</li>
            <li> I had to layer it with the voluminous version of: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Annoying.  </li>
            <li> and I will say I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this mascara and keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> I worked in the cosmetics department at Nordstrom for years and I&#x27;ve tried many, many mascaras.  I am now a student and don&#x27;t want to spend $30 on a tube of mascara so I set out looking for the best one in this price range.  I lost a lot of lashes to a false eyelash mishap years ago and they never grew back so mine our short and sparse.  Volumizing mascaras are too clumpy and make them look shorter.  Mascara is such a personal choice, you have to try them for yourself, but this one works fantastically if you want longer and fuller lashes.  It does have weird fibers in it, but they WORK. I don&#x27;t have to spend forever putting my mascara on in the morning either. This does not leave a smudge mark under my eye by the end of the day which is very important to me.  I wear mascara every day and after about one month of use, I know I need to open a new tube because I start to see some flaking under my eyes.  My favorite mascara so far.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a cheaper version of the L&#x27;Oreal fiber mascara, but it is, in fact, just cheap. It didn&#x27;t apply well, then flaked onto my cheeks within one minute of getting it on. The rest flaked away and smudged up under my eyes over the next few hours. I&#x27;ll just cough up the extra $3 or $4 for the L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried a Maybelline product and it will be the last. This mascara is bad on so many levels, it is hard to believe anyone at Maybelline actually tested the product before naming it or creating the marketing campaign. First, there are NO \\&quot;illegal lengths\\&quot; to be gotten from this product, but it does clump lashes together in unattractive and weird-looking spikes. The length of my lashes did not increase enough to be noticed, but the clumps sure got attention. The brush is very sparse, so forget about separating lashes with it, and the mascara clumps and strings from the end of the wand, almost ensuring you will get it some place OTHER than your lashes. After a few hours of wearing this product, it began flaking unattractively onto my lower lids, creating the dreaded \\&quot;racoon\\&quot; effect, and without any crying, sweating, or rubbing on my part. Then I noticed every time I wore it, my eyes became red and irritated - what the heck is in this stuff? Finally, it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove. I have tried everything from my usual make-up remover to specially-formulated lid and lash wash, and it takes three to four washings to get about 80% of it off...the rest just has to rub off by itself. Really the nastiest mascara I have ever tried. Back to my faithful Diorshow. Sorry I tried something new.</li>
            <li> I bought this last week because I wanted to see if it really does what it says...Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t at all.To start with,when I got the brush out,it was almost no mascara on it;I dipped it several times and tried to apply it on my lashes and it gave no definition,no fullness,no color. It felt as if the tube was empty. I bought fiber mascara before,but it was decent.</li>
            <li> The previous reviewers were right: this is a *very* thin mascara! I have short but thick lashes, and I was willing to try this out, because I love Maybelline Great Lash... I found that this mascara did ZERO for volume, but it really did add length. (I don&#x27;t know about 4mm like the product says... but 1-2mm definitely, which is alot!) You just have to keep applying it. Since its so thin, the clumps just work themselves out. Its not a one-stop shop, but for 8 bucks, a little time will get you some nice long lashes at drug store prices! I think I would probably follow up with Great Lash just to add a little pop at the outsides.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t give your lashes anymore length than a normal &#x27;length&#x27; mascara. It works but doesnt do well with multiple coats, also doesn&#x27;t give volume.  So the more you use, your lashes end up looking like broken spider legs.</li>
            <li> I agree that this mascara is a non-event.  No discernible lengthening or thickening.  Just darkening.  And the enormous, fuzzy brush poke through your lashes and gets mascara all over your eye lids.  Annoying.  Fiber undercoats are the only trick that works.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara wondering if it did something similar to what the commercial said (didn&#x27;t have to be exact!) and I will say I was very disappointed. I will never buy this product again. It hardly goes on at all or it goes on way too much, there is no in between. I had to layer it with the voluminous version of: [[ASIN:B0043IX95I Rimmel Lash Accelerator Mascara Black]] to get it to even do anything worth it. I will  be going back to my old mascara by Rimmel as I am VERY happy with that.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara hoping to replace a very good lengthing mascara from Avon which is now discontinued.  This mascara did NOT lenghten my lashes at all, after several coats my lashes still looked like nothing was even ON them.  I will definitely not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that once in a while, one of the fibers gets in my eye, but aside from that minor annoyance, I love this mascara.  It stays put, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lashes, it works as described.  I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. I have been using it for about 2 months and my lashes have broken off in sections on both eyes. This has never happened to me before in the 10+ years I&#x27;ve been wearing mascara. HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> I have very thin and pretty short natural lashes and am always trying out new mascaras and have tried everything from cheap drugstore brands, like this, to expensive high end ones and this one is nice and all and definitely lengthens my lashes pretty nice, BUT it takes about 4 sometimes 5 coats before I can actually see anything on my lashes because hardly any mascara comes out on the wand. I thought I got an empty bottle.. It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake either, which is also nice since again you need to use about 4 or 5 coats.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this more stars, but you need to use so much of this that it&#x27;s just not worth the time/hassle. Save your money and invest in a better mascara like I&#x27;ll be doing next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, and I really think saying it adds 3mm is a bit dramatic.  After a couple of weeks it dries up a bit and gets clumpy.  Not the worst mascara I have ever tried, but definitely not the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great fiber mascara that leaves your lashes looking so much longer. I&#x27;m super happy with this low cost fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about.  I have used Maybelline Great Lash in the past and it flakes off before lunch.  this mascara stays on all day as well as adds a lot of length.  It is a terrific mascara.  I suppose it is thin but as I always apply several layers anyway i haven&#x27;t noticed it making a difference.</li>
            <li> I did not think the product delivered the promised claims. It was not any better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this. I have no eyelashes. This gave awesome length but I still need volume. No matter what I will never be able to ever rely on just one mascara but this is a good addition to my ever growing mascara supply!</li>
            <li> Love the length I get from this mascara!  I&#x27;m not dexterous enough to apply falsies convincingly but this mascara gives me similar length!</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome! Not clumpy at all and works very well. The only thing that upset me was that it was late. It should have been here between the 11th and 16th but I just got it today on the 18th. Other than that, no problems. I&#x27;m excited to be using this because it is my first Maybelline New York mascara. (I know crazy right?!) Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great mascara this is definitely my go to Mascara for lengthening and long wear.</li>
            <li> i am so in love with this mascara. adds just the length i need to make my eye lashes look as if i have fake ones on. would definitely recommend and continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Really does lengthen your lashes.  I have used many different mascaras and this is one of the better.  Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate</li>
            <li> This is a great fiber mascara, I also use it as a top coat on my other mascara for longer looking lashes... Only to save as much as this as possible otherwise apply a couple coat of this for the same results</li>
            <li> I tried it it went on ok it just wasnt thick enough. So i dont really care for it but it u like that way its for you</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different mascaras &amp; most of them just made my eyelashes look all clumped together. After seeing some of the commercials for Illegal Length, I wondered if this product really worked.. So I tried it &amp; I love it! If you have short, thin lashes, I think you&#x27;ll like this mascara. I usually curl my lashes before applying mascara, so that helps a ton. I can&#x27;t say that it adds as much length as expected, but it does give me alot more length and gives my lashes a fuller look.</li>
            <li> Everyone is complaining about the mascara not giving full lashes, but it&#x27;s more of a lengthening mascara (hence the name!). I&#x27;ve found that does add length to my lashes as promised. I do use another mascara along with it to get the thick lashes I want, but that&#x27;s my choice to use two types. I will continue to buy this!</li>
            <li> I just bought another tube of this because it&#x27;s the only mascara that actually lengthens my lashes.  People will actually remark on how long my eyelashes are!  I&#x27;m not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not much of a makeup girl, just a tinted moisturizer and mascara and I&#x27;m out the door.  I look for a mascara that improves my natural appearance rather than screaming HELLO I AM WEARING MAKEUP TO FALSELY MAKE MYSELF LOOK PRETTIER.  I want people to THINK I am naturally beautiful, those fools!  This mascara achieves this tricksy perfectly.  So users are right, it&#x27;s thin, but it&#x27;ll make you look GAWgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I&#x27;m no mascara expert, so I don&#x27;t know the full spectrum of the stuff.  I guess the only thing missing is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pretty smell. I love how MAC mascara has that light rose perfume to it.  It makes me feel super fancy.</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara.  Easy to apply and does make lashes look longer!  It also wears well during the day and washes off easily at night.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments and women asking me what kind of mascara I use because it is so great. Many think it is a very expensive kind and are shocked when I tell them, explaining to me that they just spent $30+ on a mascara that doesn&#x27;t even come close to how well mine works. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Great item...fast shipping... will order again</li>
            <li> This mascara was the most disappointing mascara ever. I am always willing to try new maybelline products and this by far is the worse. The commercial for it was very convincing,but unfortunately the mascara wasnt. I first noticed that the bottle felt almost completely empty. When i first opened it, there was barely anything on the brush. It also does not add anything to your lashes. no length, no volume, no anything. so disappointing, please dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have naturally short little eyelashes, this mascara is my absolute favorite (and I&#x27;m a mascara junkie). It makes my lashes freakishly long...so long they nearly reach my eyebrows. I get asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes or if I have naturally long lashes... I always get comments and compliments.&lt;br /&gt;You just need to apply it right. When you take the wand out, rub off the excess mascara on the tube and let it sit out for about a minute, curl your lashes, then apply. Let the wand grip your lashes and kind of move it back and forth while applying upward. Take your time for super long lashes. You can apply another coat it you want more. After it dries, wait about 20 minutes at least, curl your lashes again and watch out for huge super long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lengthening mascara but it does give me some volume too, but I am more concerned with length. The only downside is it only lasts a couple months before it runs out or dries out, but its still worth it to me.</li>
