            <li>She was happy to know that after almost 20 years, it was still available and I found it by using &amp;#34;Google&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am not a flowery person - but this is a nice mix.</li>
            <li>When I saw that Amazon was fulfilling the order, I was confident I would receive a good product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter when a woman dresses nice keeps up her appearance and smells good men will love you.  </li>
            <li>Noa By Cacharel is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, one of my all time favorites.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PERFUME AND</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied</li>
            <li>Most people have no idea</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>My all time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this scent I have received many comments on the smell of this perfume I would buy it again</li>
            <li>Top notes are noticed as soon as you apply a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love Noa and cannot find it in stores.</li>
            <li>Very rich for everyone</li>
            <li>Smells delicious and stays all day long.</li>
            <li>This rare gem is 100 percent authentic!</li>
            <li>And most importantly for me, my husband loves it on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A light smell, it stays with you all day.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Original box for Noa came in TWO pieces.</li>
            <li>My wife used to wear this perfume when I first met her many years ago and after a period of time it disappeared from the shelves.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what makes it special.</li>
            <li>great as expected.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of my dear and late Grandmothers peony garden with some beautiful added bonuses!</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t take strong smell parfum and this one is my favorite among others and always get compliments from people on how soft and lingering the sent is.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It came in the original box and the friend I bought it for likes it so much.</li>
            <li>Right stuff</li>
            <li>right price.  </li>
            <li>I am happily married</li>
            <li>yet it is funny every time I wear this fragrance to see the reaction.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but then it mellows and becomes so gentle and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>It smells divine (more about the scent later) and can be worn for any occasion.</li>
            <li>Middle notes emerge just before the top notes dissipate.</li>
            <li>Cacharel was the first to give us designer fragrances at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Thanks very much for the item.</li>
            <li>I love this scent - but next time will definitely buy the perfume as the eau de toilette  is a bit too light for me ...</li>
            <li>for the perfume -- If you&#x27;re looking for something a little lighter, almost floral and something that won&#x27;t make your eyes water because it&#x27;s so unbelievably potent then this is the scent for you!</li>
            <li>and she was very please with it.</li>
            <li>but I do not feel it is the real perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle but stays with me all day</li>
            <li>USEFUL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noa was launched by the design house of Cacharel in 1998 and was classified as a luxurious, gentle, floral fragrance, possessing a blend of fruit and spices.</li>
            <li>The newer ones I dont like as much</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>original would last the whole day, you may just need to re-apply it at the end of the day, if you&#x27;re going out.</li>
            <li>The original Noa would last all day.  </li>
            <li>I felt I smelled like an older lady...</li>
            <li>If you want something delicate, fresh and clean without smelling like a fruity shower gel, this is the right perfume for you.</li>
            <li>nothing else comes close to it.. and the compliments on it is far more than any other I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>WILL BUY NOW FROM WHERE I CAN ACTUALLY SMELL IT FIRST!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it is not made any more, but I have trouble finding it.</li>
            <li>not quite the same smell as the Noa I got from the airport in France, but still was worth of the purchase because of the price.</li>
            <li>Does not smell like it normally does, smells like a knockoff.</li>
            <li>for the scent, it is a very soft, warm, feminine scent with top notes of white musk, peony, freesia, and peach skin, and middle notes of lily, ylang - ylang, and rose, and a woodsy base with touches of incense and coffee.</li>
            <li>and she gets compliments left and right.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little strong for a minute</li>
            <li>It is a clean, fresh and subtle scent.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance and it is so hard to find.</li>
            <li>Testers clearly state that they are not for resale.</li>
            <li>SO FEMININE, SOFT AND SENSUAL.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and tender.</li>
            <li>and it stays for pretty long time, almost 8 hours!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>/&gt;THEY HAVE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS WITH THE BBB IN NEW YORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li>The spray top is also broken.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the fragrance is similar to the original Noa but unusual.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s soft and tender.</li>
            <li> and it stays for pretty long time, almost 8 hours!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;THEY HAVE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS WITH THE BBB IN NEW YORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> The spray top is also broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the fragrance is similar to the original Noa but unusual.  </li>
            <li> smell of the one I got from Amazon doesn&#x27;t last long, too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Yes, it is pricey, but a little tiny application is enough for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Their perfume line is now a division of L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noa, Eau de Toilette, by Cacharel is contained in a crystal clear round glass bottle with a pearl inside it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stays with you all Day long!  </li>
            <li> I also tried the other one from the same collection.</li>
            <li> and I am a middle aged woman carrying a few extra pounds.  </li>
            <li> Disregard those comments refering to a fake perfume, this is the original (didn&#x27;t expected less from Amazon)</li>
            <li> ( As recently as 6 months ago, as I bought a few in Toronto)</li>
            <li> delivered on time, the quality exactly as expected -</li>
            <li> It was received as expected, and on time for the holiday.  </li>
            <li> The package was neat and the item arrived on time if not before expected</li>
            <li> (All fragrances have layers which the perfume industry refers to as top notes, middle notes, and base notes.</li>
            <li> Anyhow first the box is wrong.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t affect people with sensitivities to other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the bottle that I purchased is just too old, and thus \\&quot;gone bad\\&quot;, or if it is a poor copy.  </li>
            <li> since it is an Eau de Toilette and is less concentrated/has less fragrance oils than Eau de parfum or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It smells NOTHING like the other THREE bottles I have ( I like to stock up as this perfum is so hard to find).</li>
            <li> Since it is unavailable in stores, I have to order online which is usually a gamble.</li>
            <li> My mother found it difficult to find NOA at the local department stores.</li>
            <li> And for any of you who don&#x27;t know FAKE perfum typically smells like that.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and it is very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be difficult to find</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> but it has been difficult to find in stores.  </li>

            <li> Noa By Cacharel is my favorite. I&#x27;m using it for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Noa has been my signature summer scent for years. I am not a flowery person - but this is a nice mix. It is a clean, fresh and subtle scent. My husband loves it too! Since it is unavailable in stores, I have to order online which is usually a gamble. When I saw that Amazon was fulfilling the order, I was confident I would receive a good product. It did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. This fragrance is very hard to find. Found it in Europe and couldn&#x27;t find it here in the states</li>
            <li> This the best perfume I have ever used in my life. This is the second time I order this perfurme. I bought it before as a gift for my mother, and she loved it too! I put it on when I go to work and it stays for pretty long time, almost 8 hours!! If you want something delicate, fresh and clean without smelling like a fruity shower gel, this is the right perfume for you.</li>
            <li> I tried Noa by Cacheral 14 years ago and haven&#x27;t used anything else since.&lt;br /&gt;It can be difficult to find so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much! It&#x27;s a great parfum. I really love it! Great service!&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and it is so hard to find. I don&#x27;t know why it is not made any more, but I have trouble finding it.</li>
            <li> I purchased Noa because I can&#x27;t find it in stores.  Unfortunately, the fragrance is similar to the original Noa but unusual.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t last for longer than 10 minutes.  The original Noa would last all day.  I don&#x27;t know if the bottle that I purchased is just too old, and thus \\&quot;gone bad\\&quot;, or if it is a poor copy.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and will not buy it again.  For $53, I thought I had a bargain.  It was definitely a waste of money. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C1Z2AU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title)</li>
            <li> I paid $62.50 for this product and did not expect to get a tester with a barcode stucked over the tester sign. Testers clearly state that they are not for resale. The spray top is also broken. What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this on Amazon. I went ahead and ordered it (good thing I didn&#x27;t order two like I wanted to) Anyhow first the box is wrong. Original box for Noa came in TWO pieces. ( As recently as 6 months ago, as I bought a few in Toronto) This box came in one piece. Second as soon as you spray it on you it smells like alcohol. And for any of you who don&#x27;t know FAKE perfum typically smells like that. It smells NOTHING like the other THREE bottles I have ( I like to stock up as this perfum is so hard to find). I would def return if I could, but because it&#x27;s open I can&#x27;t. Please don&#x27;t buy it is DEF FAKE! &#x3D;-/</li>
            <li> not quite the same smell as the Noa I got from the airport in France, but still was worth of the purchase because of the price. The European version might be a bit different than the US one.</li>
            <li> The price was great, but I don&#x27;t think the product is authentic. Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the one I have been using for over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the one I got from Amazon doesn&#x27;t last long, too.&lt;br /&gt;The original would last the whole day, you may just need to re-apply it at the end of the day, if you&#x27;re going out.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, it is very hard to find. Have been wearing it for over10 years.Not an over powering scent.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite cologne. nothing else comes close to it.. and the compliments on it is far more than any other I have ever used.  Smells FANTASTIC!!!</li>
            <li> A light smell, it stays with you all day. I get compliments every time I wear Noa by Cacharel.  Women want to know what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, one of my all time favorites.  Men follow me around and ask me what I am wearing and I am a middle aged woman carrying a few extra pounds.  It doesn&#x27;t matter when a woman dresses nice keeps up her appearance and smells good men will love you.  I am happily married yet it is funny every time I wear this fragrance to see the reaction.  It reminds me of my dear and late Grandmothers peony garden with some beautiful added bonuses!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume !  So does my boyfriend.!  Stays with you all Day long!  Very  light and  lucious !  Yay</li>
            <li> It came in the original box and the friend I bought it for likes it so much. Good for every season</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  And I lave what it means to her!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PERFUME AND THE COMPLIMENTS I GET ON WEARING IT NEVER ENDS.  SO FEMININE, SOFT AND SENSUAL.</li>
            <li> I have ordered the perfume before, but from a different vendor.  I was impressed with their delivery time and the product was just as advertised.  I will reorder from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I hope Cacharel never stop making NOA.  i can&#x27;t take strong smell parfum and this one is my favorite among others and always get compliments from people on how soft and lingering the sent is.</li>
            <li> delivered on time, the quality exactly as expected - I&#x27;m more than satisfied</li>
            <li> This rare gem is 100 percent authentic! My wife loves it.  It smells amazing on her and she gets compliments left and right.  Most people have no idea what this perfume is abs that&#x27;s what makes it special.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife birthday and she was very please with it. Disregard those comments refering to a fake perfume, this is the original (didn&#x27;t expected less from Amazon)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WENT TO REORDER ONLINE, ORDERED FROM TUCCINI THROUGH AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I RECEIVED WAS WATER IN A CACHEREL BOTTLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAVE RETURNED IT, BUT WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY HAVE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS WITH THE BBB IN NEW YORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BUY NOW FROM WHERE I CAN ACTUALLY SMELL IT FIRST!</li>
            <li> I love this scent - but next time will definitely buy the perfume as the eau de toilette  is a bit too light for me ... I like a stronger scent ... just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am very pleased with the service and price I received!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the only perfume that turns my head. (comment by husband)</li>
            <li> My wife used to wear this perfume when I first met her many years ago and after a period of time it disappeared from the shelves. She was happy to know that after almost 20 years, it was still available and I found it by using &amp;#34;Google&amp;#34;. She is once again happy to have this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like it normally does, smells like a knockoff. Shipping was great and price was great but I do not feel it is the real perfume. I have been using this perfume for over 10 years so I know the smell</li>
            <li> My mom loooved this perfume she used to wear it all the time until they stopped making it can&#x27;t wait to give it to her for Christmas looks just like how I remembered perfect</li>
            <li> This is my favourite parfum. It doesn&#x27;t bother me. it&#x27;s soft and tender. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Admire it. Arrived earlier, in one day..</li>
            <li> This product had been purchased before.  My wife loves it.  It was received as expected, and on time for the holiday.  definatly would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My mother found it difficult to find NOA at the local department stores. So, I found it here. She loves it!</li>
            <li> It was a present for a friend. She loved it and change her all-time favorite for this one! The package was neat and the item arrived on time if not before expected</li>
            <li> My all time favorite perfume. It&#x27;s so gentle but stays with me all day and I get lots of compliments. Yes, it is pricey, but a little tiny application is enough for the entire day. I love it!</li>
            <li> Right stuff right price.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This the best pefume I&#x27;ve ever had. Smells delicious and stays all day long. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! The seller was very fast with the delivery and the perfume arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely buy from this shop again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the perfume -- If you&#x27;re looking for something a little lighter, almost floral and something that won&#x27;t make your eyes water because it&#x27;s so unbelievably potent then this is the scent for you! It smells a little strong for a minute but then it mellows and becomes so gentle and lasts all day! (woo!)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I love this scent I have received many comments on the smell of this perfume I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Smells so good and great price for the amount you get</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume!  I have been wearing it since the 90&#x27;s and wear nothing else.  Try it and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Thanks very much for the item. i bought it for my wife as a gift for returning from a vacation from US; and she loved it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and it is very hard to find in stores. Good price, well packaged.</li>
            <li> I am a BIG fan of white musk frangrances. Noa, Eau de Toilette, by Cacharel is one of my favorites. It smells divine (more about the scent later) and can be worn for any occasion. It doesn&#x27;t affect people with sensitivities to other fragrances. It garners compliments from both men and women (who almost always want to know what fragrance it is and where they can get it). And most importantly for me, my husband loves it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to reapply it mid-day (I sometimes do) since it is an Eau de Toilette and is less concentrated/has less fragrance oils than Eau de parfum or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, it is a very soft, warm, feminine scent with top notes of white musk, peony, freesia, and peach skin, and middle notes of lily, ylang - ylang, and rose, and a woodsy base with touches of incense and coffee. (All fragrances have layers which the perfume industry refers to as top notes, middle notes, and base notes. Top notes are noticed as soon as you apply a fragrance. Middle notes emerge just before the top notes dissipate. Base notes become perceivable about 30 minutes after application.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noa was launched by the design house of Cacharel in 1998 and was classified as a luxurious, gentle, floral fragrance, possessing a blend of fruit and spices.

He took the name Cacharel from that of a native duck in the south of France. Cacharel was the first to give us designer fragrances at an affordable price. Their perfume line is now a division of L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noa, Eau de Toilette, by Cacharel is contained in a crystal clear round glass bottle with a pearl inside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS (Noa, Eau de Toilette, by Cacharel):  Alcohol, Parfum, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Hydroxytcitronellol, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Geraniol, Coumarin, Citronellol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Linalool, Fernesol, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Benzoate.somethyl Ionone, Geraniol, Coumarin, Citronellol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Linalool, Fernesol, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Benzoate.</li>
