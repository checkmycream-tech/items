            <li>and I I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>This helps me get that slick clean and quick shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s often hard to find the smaller Lectic shave bottles which are much more convenient for traveling.  </li>

            <li> My husband and sons have all been using this product for a decade. They love it . They find it perfect for their needs.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to buy a bunch of this on Amazon you must already use it and like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exceeds expectations!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Purchasing the five pack saved me $$$! They are easy to store ... and I probably will go years before I need more!</li>
            <li> If you like lectric shave and want to bring some on-board you need these 3 ounce sizes which are TSA friendly.  Can&#x27;t find them in our local drugstores.</li>

            <li> beats going to drug store!</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised! Best Price! Great Quality.</li>
            <li> These are a great travel size, which you can&#x27;t find in stores.  Good, competitive price as well.  Meets the 3 oz TSA rule.</li>
            <li> easier than going to a store and now  I have it on the shelf.  Don&#x27;t think I will have to get more for a year or so.</li>
            <li> It makes electic shaving smooth and quick.,shaving, much better than thers on the market. it is a pity that it is not available anywhere in Europe...</li>
            <li> I have used William Lectric Shave for many years. It is the best product on the market and I I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and has used it for many years. He likes this brand better than any other.</li>
            <li> We reorder this product from Amazon periodically  It is one of my husband&#x27;s go to items for shaving.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because the seller allowed UPS to dump my order to a local postal carrier which has delayed the delivery of my order, and that now has taken away my ability to fully track my order. The post office does not provide the same level of tracking UPS does, and now if the order gets lost, damaged or stolen, I&#x27;ll have no way to file a proper claim. DO NOT LET YOUR SELLER DUMP YOUR ORDER TO A THIRD PARTY CARRIER. It&#x27;s a service UPS recently rolled out to allow drivers to avoid going into neighborhoods, but it&#x27;s a liabilty customers can&#x27;t afford to risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is actually a great product, so don&#x27;t let the 4 stars fool you. I&#x27;m having to order it online because my local grocery store has stopped carrying it, and I can&#x27;t afford cab fare to a store that does carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve contacted the seller to complain about the dumpting of my order to a third party carrier, and they claim that won&#x27;t happen again. We&#x27;ll see when it&#x27;s time to re-order.</li>
            <li> Best preparation for the electric razor. Never a nick when this is used prior to shaving. This moves fast off the shelves of Walmart and may be hard to find.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product. The shipping to me was extremely fast. It reached me 1 or 2 days sooner than the earlieist anticipated delivery!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price for 5 of these bottles of Williams&#x27; Electric Shave quite reasonable and will buy again when I use up the supply&lt;br /&gt;I have.</li>
            <li> My face had been beaking out from razor burn so I was looking for something that would help prevent that as well as give me a closer shave. I can&#x27;t tell much difference as to the closeness of the shave but it certainly took care of the razor burn. For that alone I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When my local stores quit carrying this product I turned to Amazon. I&#x27;ve used Lectric Shave for decades. First for getting a smooth shave with an electric razor and then I discovered it worked very well if I used this on my skin before I used shave cream. Makes the shave even smoother and surprise - my razor blades last 3 or 4 times longer. I think it has a silicone oil in it that coats the steel keeping regular razor blades sharper longer. Anyway, now I have a supply and don&#x27;t have to worry about burning gas as I run to several stores looking for Lectric Shave. Good product too, I do not want to use the store brands of this.</li>
            <li> This has been my preferred pre-shave lotion for many years and I prefer the 3 oz size for travel.  It is almost impossible to find this size at retail</li>
            <li> This helps me get that slick clean and quick shave. All my local stores stopped carrying it, but why?&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this product is great. And if greatly take free bottles of it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 30 years.  Convenient size for travel due to liquid restrictions at airports.  Packaging was good, no spillage...</li>
