            <li>SOOOOOO glad I decided to check on Amazon and found this company.</li>

            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair more managable and free of tangles.</li>
            <li>Infusium works well for my hair as it gives it a great texture leaving my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I will enjoy using my Infusium Repair leave in treatment.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great price for the quantity - I can&#x27;t even buy this size locally at retail stores here in Manhattan.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and frizz free.. Love this product!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use this in conjunction with other product (i.e. gel or mousse), it works great, but not as a stand alone product.</li>
            <li>I got men stopping me on the street and complimenting my hair from the very first time I used it.     </li>
            <li>This is good for roller setting and styling when hair is dry as well.</li>
            <li>Great for my curly hair...leaves it nice and smooth and not all crazy curly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  been using this product for years and like it very much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember when I first started.  </li>
            <li>I tried it again and again in so many different ways.</li>
            <li>So I was pleased not only to find it online</li>
            <li>It really does what it says!</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have long and unruly hair</li>
            <li>I love long hair.</li>
            <li>and sometimes they dont even have the large bottle.</li>
            <li>Felt like it was pure water..</li>
            <li>but at a decent price!</li>
            <li>every woman that loves her hair as much as I do must have this product.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and kinky hair</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair so much.</li>
            <li>It was absorbing.</li>
            <li>and I really take care of it.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;m already in love and probably won&#x27;t be using any other product.</li>
            <li>More money down the drain.</li>
            <li>The bottle was the older design.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Because I have naturally curly hair like you would not believe and it works wonders!  </li>
            <li>I literally have been using this product for the past 40 years and absolutely love and swear by it.</li>
            <li>So I usually never wear gel nor spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like an natural look.  </li>
            <li>I always have Infusium in my house since it&#x27;s the \\&quot;old reliable\\&quot; product, which makes my curls defined and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far my favourite leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find this online.</li>
            <li>At the local stores they charge so much for this</li>
            <li>I used it anyway thinking maybe it was just old.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and easier to brush through.</li>
            <li>My hair is always thick and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>and now my natural ash blonde color and my hair was completely destroyed.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that not only keeps my hair under control but also soft to the touch and not stiff.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product so badly because I&#x27;ve always read and heard great things about Infusium 23.</li>
            <li>Keeps my very fragile white hair soft and vital.  </li>
            <li>It easily detangles my long, fine, thick hair and keeps my hair flowing freely (it usually clumps together and looks bushy when I don&#x27;t use it).</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail yestersay and only used this once so far</li>
            <li>and it really does help to manage and control the curl, allowing it to be less frizzy and course.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair that flies away easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a large bottle, and I didn&#x27;t want it to go to waste.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I went from black to dark brown to light brown to white then went pink</li>
            <li> I put this stuff in a small spray bottle that I had and sprayed it throughout my hole head last night and instantly I was capable of combing my hair like I never colored it in my life.</li>
            <li> I have long Spanish hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;However this has given my hair a soft, less frizzy feel since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> I was considering trying the original formula, but after the lousy customer service, I&#x27;m just gonna use up the rest of the bottle on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair, and cut my losses.</li>
            <li> Other conditioners seem to attract dirt and dust and also  get gummy especially if used every day. .  </li>
            <li> but actually was only one bottle after reading small print</li>
            <li> Then I turned to Target and it seems as if the leave-in treatment is harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like after the next few weeks</li>
            <li> I wait like about 20 minutes or when hair is half dry and spay the infusion 23</li>
            <li> ; I mix half infusium/ half purified water in a hair spray bottle and use it usually every morning before I brush my hair, sometimes a couple spritz after a shower, or when my hair is feeling dry and needs to be brushed again (without frizzing or blowing out).</li>
            <li> I actually get a little anxious</li>
            <li> It was a watered down.</li>
            <li> My hair is all the way down to my butt</li>
            <li> There was no brushing it without ripping half the hair on my head out.</li>
            <li> Other things designed specifically to hold your hair are just too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> I put mine in a small hair spray pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product - and hate to try anything else!</li>
            <li> If anything this product made my hair drier than usual.</li>
            <li> I use it to set my hair and it usually stays curly for at least two days.  </li>
            <li> at least price-wise.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick curly hair</li>
            <li> well she was right, very disappointing!</li>
            <li> and when I run out of Infusium, my hair is not happy.</li>
            <li> but if I wasn&#x27;t using it maybe it would be worse.</li>
            <li> I returned product as false advertisement.  </li>
            <li> and there is already a seriously dramatic difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Recently however, the price of Infusium in Canada shot up outrageously overnight</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I hate putting product in my hair that feels greasy and oily.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using the Infusium 23 leave in conditioner for so many years I can&#x27;t remember when I first started.  I have thin hair that flies away easily.  I hate putting product in my hair that feels greasy and oily.  I like an natural look.  This is the only leave in conditioner on the market that does the job.  You will not even know it is in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem is my three daughters are always using it and I run out of it too often.</li>
            <li> This product I have bought to a friend, but she has not told me if treatment did work or didn&#x27;t, I am waiting for her answers.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product so badly because I&#x27;ve always read and heard great things about Infusium 23. I have relaxed hair and this stuff made my hair feel like wire. I tried it again and again in so many different ways. I even mixed it with several different leave-in conditioners. I even wrote to the company&#x27;s customer service twice to find out what I needed to do to make it work for me. It&#x27;s such a large bottle, and I didn&#x27;t want it to go to waste. Even though the company&#x27;s website has a form you can submit to ask questions, they never responded to me. This didn&#x27;t make me very happy with them or their product. I was considering trying the original formula, but after the lousy customer service, I&#x27;m just gonna use up the rest of the bottle on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair, and cut my losses. I now use Aphogee products to get the protein I need for my hair.[[ASIN:B000F7E79I ApHogee Pro-Vitamin Leave-In Conditioner]]</li>
            <li> every woman that loves her hair as much as I do must have this product. This stuff will keep your hair healthy regardless of the weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Infusium for the last 30+ years. I have naturally thick curly hair and I&#x27;m Caucasian.  Nothing has worked better on my hair than Infusium and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there on the market.  I always have Infusium in my house since it&#x27;s the \\&quot;old reliable\\&quot; product, which makes my curls defined and not frizzy. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Without doubt the best product I ever used on my hair. Because I have naturally curly hair like you would not believe and it works wonders!  GREAT stuff! Thank you, Katrina!!!</li>
            <li> Like the product a lot and arrived on time. This product has been great in keep my hair moisturised. I add to it oils and Aloe Vera Juice.</li>
            <li> Keeps my very fragile white hair soft and vital.  I love the leave in Infusium 23.</li>
            <li> Great for my curly hair...leaves it nice and smooth and not all crazy curly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Infusium for many many years now and have never found anything that can compare to it... at least price-wise. It&#x27;s by far my favourite leave-in conditioner. It easily detangles my long, fine, thick hair and keeps my hair flowing freely (it usually clumps together and looks bushy when I don&#x27;t use it). I got men stopping me on the street and complimenting my hair from the very first time I used it.     Recently however, the price of Infusium in Canada shot up outrageously overnight (let&#x27;s just say I would be paying close to the price of the 33.8fl oz here for a bottle 1/4 the size!) So I am EXTREMELY happy I found it here at this amazing price!</li>
            <li> I love the value of this 33.8 fl oz (999 ml) bottle.  Infusium 32 leave-in treatment is a great product and this value size makes it the perfect choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, I think even before the internet existed.  I use it after dampening my hair and before combing, and when my hair dries, it has just enough hold to get me thru the day.  Other things designed specifically to hold your hair are just too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> I use it myself AND  I use it on my horse&#x27;s mane and tail (I use a spray bottle).  It is great for keeping the hair tangle free, silky and shiny.  Other conditioners seem to attract dirt and dust and also  get gummy especially if used every day. .  This one does not.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have long and unruly hair and when I run out of Infusium, my hair is not happy. Costco used to sell this size bottle for around $5 or $6 but they haven&#x27;t for years. Then I turned to Target and it seems as if the leave-in treatment is harder and harder to find. SOOOOOO glad I decided to check on Amazon and found this company. I&#x27;m very happy and so is my hair! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Infusium for many years and I haven&#x27;t found anything like it. My hair is always thick and healthy looking. It&#x27;s so convenient to spray it in after a shower and just let it do it&#x27;s work. I would recommend anyone who cares about their hair to try it.</li>
            <li> always a good product</li>
            <li> I put mine in a small hair spray pump bottle. It goes on nicely and drys like it&#x27;s not even there. I purchased this because I recently bleached my hair blonde and I know that caused a lot of damage so everything I can do to put back nutrients and help heal my hair I&#x27;m doing. I haven&#x27;t noticed that it has made any kind of improvement but if I wasn&#x27;t using it maybe it would be worse.</li>
            <li> Great price. I was surprised to find this online. At the local stores they charge so much for this and sometimes they dont even have the large bottle. So I was pleased not only to find it online but at a decent price!</li>
            <li> Love it...always makes for  great Hair Day!  Infusium is the one hair product I always use...I spray it on~! So easy~!</li>
            <li> Our neighborhood Walmart didn&#x27;t have any of this product on its shelves and I was furious!  Repair and Renew Leave in Treatment works but their Moisture one doesn&#x27;t!  All they had was the Moisture one - so I ordered this product from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;  So, our Walmart has it again!  Meanwhile, I will enjoy using my Infusium Repair leave in treatment.&lt;br /&gt;  I use it to set my hair and it usually stays curly for at least two days.  Love this product - and hate to try anything else!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that not only keeps my hair under control but also soft to the touch and not stiff. Love it.</li>
            <li> There was another review from a woman who said that it made her hair feel like wire and I ignored her review thinking how could that be possible......well she was right, very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 24 years. The only reason I purchased it from Amazon is because I can&#x27;t find the 30 oz bottle in my area. The bottle was the older design. I compared the smell with the one I already had. It was not the same. I used it anyway thinking maybe it was just old. This was NOT Infusium. It was a watered down. Something was wrong with it. I won&#x27;t use it. More money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Everytime I come home to visit, I steal a bottle of infusium from my mom&#x27;s room! It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft. Its great for curly hair; I mix half infusium/ half purified water in a hair spray bottle and use it usually every morning before I brush my hair, sometimes a couple spritz after a shower, or when my hair is feeling dry and needs to be brushed again (without frizzing or blowing out). I have been using it for a while and I always get compliments on my curls, definitely an excellent buy :)</li>
            <li> I literally have been using this product for the past 40 years and absolutely love and swear by it. I actually get a little anxious if I forget to pack it when traveling as I know the consistency and texture of my hair will be slightly different without. I have very curly and kinky hair and it really does help to manage and control the curl, allowing it to be less frizzy and course. I&#x27;ve also heard some people use it when grooming and styling their horses manes and tails...who knew?!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product was going to be thicker, as I tend to use leave-ins as the only product I put in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this has given my hair a soft, less frizzy feel since I&#x27;ve been using it.  If you&#x27;re going to use this in conjunction with other product (i.e. gel or mousse), it works great, but not as a stand alone product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for YEARS (since middle school). I swim 2-3x a week and color my hair (gotta hide the grays!). This helps alleviate the damage I do to my hair. I use it after I get out of the shower and on days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, to help freshen/soften it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price for the quantity - I can&#x27;t even buy this size locally at retail stores here in Manhattan.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I used this from I was a teenager. It makes my hair more managable and free of tangles. This is good for roller setting and styling when hair is dry as well. It really does what it says!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using this product for years and like it very much. I recommend others to use this hair product.</li>
            <li> Infusium works well for my hair as it gives it a great texture leaving my hair soft and manageable. It is a most have for me :-)</li>
            <li> Watery! This product did nothing for me. Felt like it was pure water.. If anything this product made my hair drier than usual. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for years on my curly hair after swimming and showering. It makes your hair soft and easier to brush through.</li>
            <li> I returned product as false advertisement.  Picture showed purchase was for two bottles at the listed price but actually was only one bottle after reading small print</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail yestersay and only used this once so far and there is already a seriously dramatic difference in my hair. I bleached my hair so much. I went from black to dark brown to light brown to white then went pink and now my natural ash blonde color and my hair was completely destroyed. I love long hair. My hair is all the way down to my butt and I refused to cutt it but my ends were like straw. There was no brushing it without ripping half the hair on my head out. I&#x27;ve gone through almost every product of oil and deep conditioning you could possibly think of and not even the famous and insanely expensive WEN could fix it. I put this stuff in a small spray bottle that I had and sprayed it throughout my hole head last night and instantly I was capable of combing my hair like I never colored it in my life. Instantly my hair was thanking me for all the moisture and nutrients It was absorbing. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like after the next few weeks but I think I&#x27;m already in love and probably won&#x27;t be using any other product. You definitely got me hooked.</li>
            <li> I have long Spanish hair and I really take care of it. So I usually never wear gel nor spray.&lt;br /&gt;I use this infusion to replace those products, so it won&#x27;t damage my hair. After I put on my&lt;br /&gt;Leave in conditioner I wait like about 20 minutes or when hair is half dry and spay the infusion 23&lt;br /&gt;On. It leaves my hair soft and frizz free.. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This size will last for years! Works great for heat or peroxide damaged hair.</li>
