            <li>I&#x27;m using this product along with mama butter for my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>This is my go to while pregnant.</li>

            <li>More than anything, I love that I know it is safe to use without any hidden harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients</li>

            <li>I used this for my first pregnacy and had no stretch marks (and trust me, they run in my family)</li>
            <li>I used this for my first pregnancy along with the Mambino Organics Body Butter.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me with my first pregnancy, but it&#x27;s bothering me with this one.</li>

            <li> Yum! This stuff smells amazing and is well absorbed. I love the way it settles into my skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy, but very nourishing. Absolutely love the scent. So fresh and rich! Looking forward to exploring the other products this line has to offer.</li>
            <li> During my pregnancy, I tried several different lotions and oils, and this is one that I preferred best. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Mambino products! I use the toning oil in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00112RH9I Mambino Organics Oh Baby! Belly Butter 4oz / 114g ~ Winner! Disney&#x27;s iParenting Media Award; Outstanding Product]].I am 9 months pregnant and nothing has worked better. I could feel a real difference from the toning oil I was using previously.They smell and feel fantastic and so far I have had no issues with stretch marks or itching.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s OK, It does keep my skin moisturized all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price. I&#x27;ll  stick to Shea butter 16 oz (3 times the value for almost the same price) and get better results.&lt;br /&gt;It does not absorb that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet citrus smell. I don&#x27;t like smelling like an orange peel.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone has not improved, like it says it should.</li>
            <li> I am 33 weeks pregnant and love this oil, I also have the belly butter too, a great comibination and it is organic too! Smells great!</li>
            <li> works really well and smells even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very happy with this spray. it absorbs well and lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> Am 12 weeks pregnant and using this. I can&#x27;t say for certain if it&#x27;s working at preventing stretch marks but it does feel nice and hydrates my skin. This is my fourth pregnancy and usually if I get any stretch marks they don&#x27;t appear until after  I&#x27;ve had my babies. I only have a few not really noticeable ones (used made a starch marks therapy previously for those), so time will tell and we&#x27;ll see if I get news ones. Either way this product does feel nice on my skin. It&#x27;s also reassuring to know it&#x27;s safe to use during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks using this during pregnancy. Smells so good too! Love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Smells like oranges, moisturizes well. Was not expecting the spray attachment which probably isn&#x27;t as efficient as a pump, but is nice to be able to spray it anyway</li>
            <li> I have been using this Moisture Me Toning Oil along with the Mambino Belly Butter throughout my 3rd trimester of pregnancy. I use it once daily, after showering. It absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and has a nice smell. My skin hasn&#x27;t been itchy and I don&#x27;t have any apparent stretch marks (though I&#x27;m doubtful that any product can truly have any impact on stretch marks). I really like this toning oil and plan on continuing using it postpartum. Note: Originally I bought the Mambino Organics Bun in the Oven set, just to try out the products. The toning oil and belly butter used together both lasted about 1 month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to thick or oily, it rubs on nicely. It also smells great. I&#x27;m using this product along with mama butter for my pregnant belly. So far so good!</li>
            <li> This is my go to while pregnant. I used this for my first pregnacy and had no stretch marks (and trust me, they run in my family) Now for my second I purchased again. Feels and smells amazing, you know it&#x27;s working. Just love it! Plus if you order from amazon you&#x27;d be saving 1/2 than if you buy directly from their site.</li>
            <li> I used this for my first pregnancy along with the Mambino Organics Body Butter. Even though I gained 60 pounds, I ended up with very few stretch marks. Did this help? I don&#x27;t know. However, I am pregnant again and am using it again. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell. It&#x27;s a strong-smelling citrus smell. It didn&#x27;t bother me with my first pregnancy, but it&#x27;s bothering me with this one.</li>
            <li> So soothing for itchy stretch marks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks and we used this to massage during labor.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use after I get out of the shower! My skin feels hydrated and soft throughout the entire day. I&#x27;ve been using this product while I was pregnant and continued to use it ever since! The scent is a huge plus. No chemical or cheap perfume smells....</li>
            <li> I love that this oil makes my skin feel soft and silky for a few days after i use it.  Use after showering, smells great and makes your skin feel great too.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product zero if I could. This product will cause skin irritation. After applied the toning oil, it didn&#x27;t provide the even skin color throughout the body. You will look like Vitiligo. You won&#x27;t have your natural beauty again! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!</li>
            <li> I started using it during pregnancy and have been using it ever since.  I love the smell and how silky it makes my skin feel.  More than anything, I love that I know it is safe to use without any hidden harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not a stretch mark from my pregnancy.  I used daily, only once as I was on bed rest and wasn&#x27;t doing anything more that necessary.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy.  I used it throughout my pregnancy along with coco butter and didn&#x27;t have one stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the feel. Everything. This stuff is my go-to pregnancy oil. I like it just by itself and not with the lotion they recommend.</li>
