            <li> Can,t say I see that it is doing anything.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  Most serums are very thin like water.  This serum has a luxurious glide on feel.  My skin looked energized right after applying.  Love this product and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as a member of Nicci&#x27;s review team and I&#x27;m really happy with it!  Actually, I love everything I&#x27;ve purchased from this line.

            <li> Love this line of products! Excellent quality, no garbage ingredients, and you use very little each time. I am SOLD :) Looking for trustworthy websites to look up products for safety? Here are two: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ and http://www.goodguide.com/</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. This product did not irritate my skin. It does gradually smooth wrinkles. It takes about one month to notice any difference. Be patient.</li>
            <li> Delivery good.  too early for  results but seems to help with eyes</li>
            <li> See difference in skin. Love product</li>
            <li> I love the texture and finish this leaves! It is so light!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Gives your skin a youthful glow!</li>
            <li> Did not do as well as I thought it would!  If you have WRINKLES !!!!!!! No not expect them to disappear!</li>
            <li> I love Nicci products, I used this for a day now,I woke up this morning and my face not greasy, looks like I&#x27;m glowing, ladies absolutely no smell at all,that&#x27;s a plus,I also use their other products, Hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin C,A,E please look at my review under that product ,for the price this is the best I found .</li>
            <li> LOVE this Product....I use this Vitamin C Serum in combination with Nicci Marie Anti-Aging Moisturizing Cream with Matrixyl and I love these products. This new Nicci Marie Vitamin C Serum makes my skin feel like SILK. Since using the Nicci Marie Skincare products I no longer have the need for foundation and/or powder. My skin has NO wrinkles, NO crows’ feet, my dark under eye circles and dark spots have vanished. I have a 15yr old and often get asked “How old are You?” when I reply “40” I get told WoW I would have said “27”. I definitely recommend this product along with all Nicci Marie Skincare products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for two days now and so far so good. I noticed my skin isn&#x27;t as oily as it usually is and remains balanced. I will update if I see any difference or if my skin reacts. I&#x27;m pretty acne-prone so I&#x27;ll really have to observe this as I continue using it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a change in formula, but so far, so good. Absorbs well</li>
            <li> Love this C Serum!  I have tried a few, and this one is great.  No scent, for those of you sensitive to smells.  Makes the skin very soft and smooth!  Go ahead and buy this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this new serum!  It absorbs quickly and completely.  I have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin while using this product!</li>
            <li> Love this new product !  Makes my skin look fresh ... very smooth !  Great new skin care line. Love the moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but have been using it for 3 weeks and no change in skin!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This product is just fantastic, I have used 2 others from another brand, but this is hands down the best.  My skin is really clear, soft and smooth.  I started seeing results about 10 days later, it doest splash all over the place (and mirror) it is gel like and you control how uc you use.  I really love it</li>
            <li> use it everyday, love it</li>
            <li> I love Nicci Marie products. This new face serum feels great on my skin with no unpleasant odor. I think it&#x27;s going to work great!</li>
            <li> Really nice Vitamin C Serum - absolutely NO fragrance at all which is great because it doesn&#x27;t compete with the BB cream I use.  I give it thumbs up, and reviewed it on YouTube too!  http://youtu.be/ihh3vRfdgYY</li>
            <li> I love this product. Seems to make a difference with visible results in a short amount of time. I will buy this product again. Thankyou.</li>
            <li> Product okay but definitely not a miracle worker</li>
            <li> This definitely seems to working great!</li>
            <li> I have used Nicci Marie Skincare for a while now and love it. The new serum is even better. You have to try it to see the difference.</li>
