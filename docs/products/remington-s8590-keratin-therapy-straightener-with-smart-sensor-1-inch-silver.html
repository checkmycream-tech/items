            <li>I gotta say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Love this thing!  </li>
            <li>First - delivery was AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say I notice any difference from the keratin, or how long the infusion lasts on the ceramic, but the product is very good and does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>I received it very quickly and it works great</li>
            <li>Is easy to use, very useful, I am very happy with this product, I recommend to buy it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I did not buy this on Amazon, but was so thrilled I wanted to leave a review for others considering</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a kertain kick for my hair &amp; my hair is loving me because of it.</li>
            <li>But she buys her own tools, and won&#x27;t spend money on \\&quot;professional\\&quot; tools that don&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li>It heats up in 30 seconds, the digital heat setting is awesome, the swivel cord is great and the auto-shutoff is so handy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not going to risk my health to have nice hair.</li>
            <li>my new best friend....</li>
            <li>Because it was awesome and new and stuff.</li>
            <li>pads close to edge making it very easy to burn oneself</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite straightener I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>the best straighter ive owned so far!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with the iron.</li>
            <li>Received it today and I love it, works amazing</li>
            <li>I was very happy with my old Remington Straightener but wanted an upgrade after 5 years.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best straightner I have owned !</li>
            <li>But it is a great product and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it, does a great job quickly.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair shiny and feeling healthy afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I love the smoothness of the plates.</li>
            <li>Love the auto shut off feature.</li>
            <li>I love that the plates are coated with keratin - I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the shine and smoothness of my hair whenever I use this thing to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I really love this thing</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this straightener.</li>
            <li>It fit nicely in my hand and was a cinch to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plates are thinner than what Im used to, and that was my favorite feature on this iron.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>It has settings up to 410 degrees, but my hair gets done on 375 which is more than sufficient.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, which is great and is lightweight for it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love the color</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love, love,  love this straightener.</li>
            <li>Really love all the features and the fact that if I forget, it shuts itself off for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>like this even better than the Shine Therapy styler.  </li>
            <li>The switches are on the side, rather than the top of the styler.  </li>
            <li>This model works better</li>
            <li>So I love that this adjusts to your hair.  </li>
            <li>i got for me and for my sisters and in laws they all love it&lt;</li>
            <li>It has lovely design and does the job well.</li>
            <li>I just love this product</li>
            <li>It is much better than the discount store/drugstore ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly I love it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the leap on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Small can feel to take more time with longer hair</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Damage Sensor\\&quot; and \\&quot;Keratin\\&quot; seem more like a gimmick to me at this point.</li>
            <li>im in love with it</li>
            <li>I love the heat control feature.  </li>
            <li>The top silver finish bubbled as I used the straightener</li>
            <li>but I want to highlight it to make sure it isn&#x27;t a health issue.  </li>
            <li>but it def does the job :)</li>
            <li>I love that this straightener has temperature choices, my favorite being 340 degrees.</li>
            <li>It protects my bathroom counter top from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps others might have better luck with this product, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this choice - this is my third straightener and it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>The Keratin strip that&#x27;s built into the flat iron plate is friggin awesome!  </li>
            <li>And Remington you&#x27;re flat irons are great!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is awesome.  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased by Remington to date!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good straightener for that.</li>
            <li>What I liked about this Remington S8590 model is that it heats up quickly, it turns itself off when not being used.  </li>
            <li>(Thermafuse Smoothing Treatment - the best smoothing treatment in the world - keratin and formaldehyde free currently in my hair).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the $30 I paid for it, and so far I am quite happy with it!</li>
            <li>Good product 100% positive.</li>
            <li>All what I love in a straightener, heats up fast and easy to use!!</li>
            <li>It has a strip on it that is supposed to be able to tell if your hair is damaged/brittle/too fine and adjust the temp accordingly, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li>The plates meet better with the Keratin Therapy, though this is nit-picking; the plates are fine on both.  </li>
            <li>This is a very fine and unique product.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really happy with this straightener.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that works at one swing and more importantly something that does not spoil the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found out about this thanks to a glowing recommendation from Good HouseKeeping decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>This is a good reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li>I would be interested to hear how many others have noticed a very strong smell coming from this product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend to others who are looking for an affordable, good quality straightener!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy fix.</li>
            <li>Some people didn&#x27;t like the placement of the switches on the Shine Therapy because it was easy to bump them.  </li>
            <li>It also heated up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly, getting up to 400°F in about 40 seconds.  </li>
            <li>The controls are easy to work and see.  </li>
            <li>The size makes it easy to handle when I&#x27;m doing curling.</li>
            <li>So far so good with this Remington :)</li>
            <li>and I now have a strong wave/curl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how versatile styling irons are, and this one is first class.wever, is lighter and easier to hold than the Shine Therapy, so I give it five stars.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how versatile styling irons are, and this one is first class.</li>
            <li>All the information is true and love the heat sensor to keep from damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s new it seems like the keratin-infused plates give off a light, pleasant scent, but I imagine it will dissipate over time.  </li>
            <li>good new product in accordance with my purchase .</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>Love the sensor that lets me know when its too hot, and love that it turns itself off too.</li>
            <li>model straigtened my hair more quickly and did a nicer job.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, heats up very quickly and straightens on the first try.  </li>
            <li>It straightens great the only problem I have is the iron won&#x27;t go thru my hair as easy</li>
            <li>this iron gets my hair super straight!!!!</li>
            <li>the Remington S8590 Keratin Therapy Straightener with Smart Sensor is amazing</li>
            <li>They said it heats up very fast!!  </li>
            <li>This Keratin Therapy Straightener with Smart Sensor is excellent at the current price of $31...</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Its important to me to have these built in safety features.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wipe clean of products and it&#x27;s floating plates help with the ease of straightening my hair or creating curls.</li>
            <li>How Smooth It Runs Through My Hair.</li>
            <li>The casing on this did not seem to fit correctly (the buttons were not set</li>
            <li>Quicker is important to me.  </li>
            <li>It did take a couple of passes with each section of hair to straighten but it left it very silky and soft, and so fair it has stayed that way which I am very happy about!</li>
            <li>Amazon was great about processing my refund and I ended up purchasing different one.</li>
            <li>so I can not say that the Remington is the best ever at straighting, what I can say is this product warms up quickley and shuts off on its own after some time so you dont have to worry about starting a fire if left on.  </li>
            <li>with every straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned, there is a tendency for the iron to tip over on its side, so I&#x27;ve discovered a fabulous \\&quot;stand\\&quot; for it -- just a cheap metal napkin holder that I got from Target.</li>
            <li>this ok i like it  verry good and fast thanks</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So I grab a fabric softener sheet and that takes the static right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that this flat iron is great.</li>
            <li>Remington flat irons feel great in my hand.</li>
            <li>packaging is high-end, and the addition of Keratin in a flat iron is welcome, if one has frizzy</li>
            <li>I love this straightener, it is very sleek, light weight ,easy to use</li>
            <li>It heated quickly, has three temperature settings and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Very easy and fast to heat up.</li>
            <li>Overall it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>I have since bought other products from the Keratin Therapy line and loved every one of them!</li>
            <li>Heats up super quick!</li>
            <li>First time I used it, I was pleased.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend was really excited about this straightener/flat iron and all of it&#x27;s features.</li>
            <li>We can not ALL look like the star of the original \\&quot;Footloose\\&quot; with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived nicely packed in new condition.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and straightens smoothly without pulling or breaking my hair.  </li>
            <li>positive is that I was able to return the product for free and I did get a quick rebate.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair looks when I use them, shiny, tidy, easy to handle, but on the other hand, use it twice and my hair starts to show all the signs of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Returned for a full refund though.</li>
            <li>I still recommend the Shine Therapy, but this is a sleeker, more modern product, and it is an improvement.  </li>
            <li>The straightener has lasted well for several months which is a good sign.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s not a bad straighter for the price.  </li>
            <li>Hey, time is important, right?  </li>
            <li>The fact that one can control the temperature: Super easy to determine which temperature to use to straighten your hair, great for people like me that have hair that is thin and easy to straighten but also easy to damage.</li>
            <li>Have told other gals about this because the product is great and so was the price.</li>
            <li>Great price, performs as expected!</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great product and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really quick.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and stays on.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a super performer.  </li>
            <li>Sections of hair pass through the blades so quickly</li>
            <li>It has the advantage of being super malleable, I can do whatever I want with it and the disadvantage of getting ruined by just whispering at it.</li>
            <li>I am lucky in that my hair straightes with ease</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does not pull my hair.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and the plates don&#x27;t damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I need a straighter that I can use very hot.  </li>
            <li>As a girl whose been using Chi&#x27;s strictly  for 9 years to find a straightener that was such a reasonable price and better was amazing.</li>
            <li>great feature, that it automatically shuts off after a while, just in case you forget and it also has a locking mechanism that makes burning yourself less</li>
            <li>The iron is very lightweight and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>I use a higher setting on my original one</li>
            <li>I am an AA with really think hair and this flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li>Although it took a little longer than I wanted to receive (patience is not my strong suit), the flat iron is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good Hair straightener,it does the job well and has several different heat levels.</li>
            <li>I really like the light weight.</li>
            <li>Just used this flat iron and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s worth what it cost.</li>
            <li>so many extra features for such a good price....</li>
            <li>/&gt;First thing I noticed when I turned it on is that the buttons are sort of recessed into the side, which was really nice since I wasn&#x27;t actually turning the straightener off or changing the temp while doing my hair.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth the $50</li>
            <li>It straightened my hair faster than my old straightener and didn&#x27;t seem to leave as many fried ends.</li>
            <li>Remington is kind enough to send a replacement (on the way) -</li>
            <li>This does not sit very flat or safely on the countertop; it constantly wants to roll over since it&#x27;s rounded on the top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks, and it does a very nice job with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Right on time, my hair was in danger of being cut off so that I could from scratch.</li>
            <li>The first flat iron to leave my hair completely straight after a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement for my other Remington Flat iron!!</li>
            <li>I cant say much for the keratin therapy since I have not been using it very long all in all good value for the price.</li>
            <li>My niece has very thick course hair and after her first use, her hair was smooth and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The power controls are easy to use and the blue lighting on the body, I find pretty, modern and stylish.</li>
            <li>She just had a standard one (a $25 or $30 model recently purchased) but I was really impressed with how sleek and soft her hair was after.</li>
            <li>I would say it is well worth the slightly higher price versus an entry-level product.</li>
            <li>This is a very high class straight  for cheap.</li>
            <li>and you are attentive about avoiding new growth hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why Remington tries to make their products sound like they can perform magic.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why Remington tries to make their products sound like they can perform magic.  </li>
            <li>It does it quickly and it does it very well.</li>
            <li>I own so many flat iron straighteners - heard a review on this one on the Today Show - decided - maybe this one would be the holy grail of all flat irons &amp; IT</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel in your hands its not too big, or small-love the swivle cord it also heats up incredibly fast and gets really, really hot.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly but I haven&#x27;t had much experience with the sensor technology</li>
            <li>However, the smart sensor doesn&#x27;t seem entirely accurate as I&#x27;ve noticed frizzed sections of hair which happen when the temperature of the straightener is too high.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>my hair has a burnt smell even on a lower setting, but not with this one...........even on higher settings.  </li>
            <li>hair glides through and straightens first time.</li>
            <li>think this unit runs rather hot.  </li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, it was at a default setting of 375 degrees.  </li>
            <li>It worked well for my frizzy curly hair, so I would try this one first.</li>
            <li>I would buy a gift to my mother, who remained haunted since I began using the first day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have a different Remington model straightener that I like better.</li>
            <li>others have noted, the iron tends to run a bit hot.  </li>
            <li>Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\\&quot;]]  did a much better job of moving through my hair without snagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a guy, one needs this size or smaller for most cuts.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>My 2nd one started to bubble on the top.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience using a straightener on my unruly, curly hair.</li>
            <li>+ model, so I&#x27;ll forgive Remington and gladly keep the extra $50 in my wallet.</li>
            <li>Afterward, I&#x27;ll often use electric curlers to give more body to my hair -- yes, a time-consuming, yet essential step to give me the confidence to be seen in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first straightener I&#x27;ve had with an on-off switch</li>
            <li>after the first use, I looked like I had just stepped out of my salon.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t move through your hair like a ceramic plate does, but I am willing to trade off this glide for a flat iron that will keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I used to use a CHI straightener, which was great, but this is just fine if you don&#x27;t have difficult hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I really love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I bought one for my sister, who is such a dinosaur she was still using a curling brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought more expensive styling irons, and none of them were as good as a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought more expensive styling irons, and none of them were as good as a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure if it is actually sensing and adapting to how much moisture is in my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>Bought this after hearing good things about it when my last flat iron crapped out.</li>
            <li>MOST kertain therapy straightening irons are much more expensive than this one, so I was THRILLED to only pay $30.00.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this</li>
            <li>This one straightens her hair quickly and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This tool gets extremely hot but if you are careful and your hair can handle the heat, you will LOVE the results.  </li>
            <li>I have a ghd and bought this for the smart sensor aswell as the keratin therapy for the hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the smoothing products, and they work to a certain degree.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit has a smart sensor to reduce heat if you over process the hair ( probably not an issue for guys, but might be for gal&#x27;s with longer</li>
            <li>This is happening to the new growth hair which tends to be finer and more fragile along the temples, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product is great and does not burn your hair is so thin bright sheet reaches the root and smooth in a few past and why my hair is wavy strong</li>
            <li>took 2 years back and still works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell whether the Keratin infusion and smart sensor are anything more than gimmicks, but as a ceramic flat iron it gets the job done, if not quite as smoothly as higher priced units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t really tell if the Smart Sensor is making a difference, I think the Keratin is working.</li>
            <li>hinge lock is great, to help prevent little (or big) hands from accidental burns.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fry my hair and left it very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>My Remington straightener is comfortable to use, very well made, and I can only hope</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t run smoothly over my hair, it does feel like my hair catches on the plates and pulls a bit, which makes me nervous because I don&#x27;t want to break my hair, especially considering it is summer</li>
            <li>Your hair stays straight</li>
            <li>all day- even through high humidity!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>is the real deal</li>
            <li>and I could feel the difference it left my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>straightens my hair FAST.  </li>
            <li>I really like this straightener.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d NEVER seen my hair that straight (besides the times I had it straightened at the salon).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated that part of the purchase.</li>
            <li>Both heat up fast, but the Keratin Therapy doesn&#x27;t require the user to lock in the chosen temperature.  </li>
            <li>you have straight hair, you can learn how to use a styling iron by watching your stylist, or check out youtube.  </li>
            <li>you have straight hair, you can learn how to use a styling iron by watching your stylist, or check out youtube.  </li>
            <li>This straightener works very well.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it does not move smoothly over my hair, there is some resistence.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>, it did the trick without damaging my hair too much.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if it is really \\&quot;infused\\&quot; with conditioners or not.</li>
            <li>I really need it</li>
            <li>&quot; really work?&lt;br /&gt;-Does</li>
            <li>it really \\&quot;infuse Keratin?</li>
            <li>The only critique I have, however, is that the plates aren&#x27;t smooth ceramic, like I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Heat up really fast.</li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference from the keratin-infused plates; my hair still breaks and frizzes a lot.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and FRIZZY.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use it only once so far.</li>
            <li>Better than Paul Mitchell and other straighteners</li>
            <li>i wasnt sure if it was just me until i read the other review.</li>
            <li>The button placement is better on this one than the other one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order a used item, but this was definitely used and out of its original packaging.</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten my hair in just 15 minutes and my hair shows no sign of breakage and absolutely no frizz (even with high humidity today).  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and this tool</li>
            <li>Some other good features are that it has a lock to keep the straightener shut and the cord is not too long.  </li>
            <li>It straightens my hair easily with minimal damage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how it could possibly adjust so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased a Remington S8590 before and it was a high quality straightener.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the road, this will fix being out in the rain, or high humidity events, and get you looking polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It straightens very easily and leaves very little frizz</li>
            <li>This is my new fave simply for how well it handles and how quickly I can get through my hair.</li>
            <li>must say I used it a  couple of times and so far, it doesn&#x27;t look like it is damaging my hair too much,</li>
            <li>Just received but really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting quite a few compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I was also able to achieve a small flip at the bottom of my hair so it doesn&#x27;t stick straight.  </li>
            <li>No tool has ever really been hot enough until now.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, no other flat iron runs as smoothly as the KQC.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that was the original intention, but even my hair stylist hardly ever uses a curling iron on customers&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>Because of its size, I can actually leave my hair a bit curly and use the straightener to smooth out my hair a bit, so it doesn&#x27;t look so wild/frizzy and that is enough for me to recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a mid-priced, decent straightener.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all and this on is as good as, if not better than, the costly flat irons on the market!  </li>
            <li>it is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair as smooth &amp; shiny as my other straightener.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it feels in my hand and how easy it is to fit in my hair (not too wide, not too narrow).</li>
            <li>Not only did my curls come out fantastic but it also re-straightened my curl instantly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sensor strip in the panel didn&#x27;t really seem to affect the process; only once at the very end</li>
            <li>biggest difference between this and more expensive irons is how smoothly they glide through the hair.  </li>
            <li>I straightened my hair in layers and it only took one pass to go from very curly to completely straight.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much will be taken into account for the next</li>
            <li>The S8590 is a different color, is infused with keratin, and heats to 450 degrees instead of the S8500&#x27;s 430 maximum, but otherwise very much like the similarly-priced 8500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The keratin and vitamins are applied from a strip that is in the middle of the hot plates.</li>
            <li>I had to have the first one returned and replaced because the silver coating/decoration on the body started to come up, since it hasn&#x27;t happened with the one I currently have, I&#x27;m assuming it was just a defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For one thing, the smart sensor didn&#x27;t really work as well as I thought it would, and no matter how much I turned the initial setting down, it still felt too hot for me.  </li>
            <li>I had a ceramic flat iron, it was around $100 (higher end one, but not the highest end one).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been getting use every day for the better part of the year and still going, but other than that I can&#x27;t comment on how long this product will go until it dies.</li>
            <li>So much better than my last non-keratin flat iron which tended to dry out, even burn my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In fact, several people asked if I got my hair professionally straightened or commented about how straight my hair was.</li>
            <li>I did not give 5 stars because of having to be extra careful handling it and because it does not allow hair to pass through as smoothly as would like.</li>
            <li>As an African-American woman who wears my hair natural, I&#x27;m hesitant to straighten myself too often for fear of damage and pulling from the plates.  </li>
            <li>Who ever thought that Remington would put out such a high quality product and you can&#x27;t beat the price either!  </li>
            <li>Thought this was worth noting because it happens constantly, even though I am conscious of it &amp; use smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and gets frizzy in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Her old one didn&#x27;t have adjustable heat settings or keratin infused plates.</li>
            <li>I really like it overall and will update this review if I have any problems with it.</li>
            <li>i sectioned off the bottom hair and after going over it again and again for 10 mins it was finally straight enought for me to go onto the next section.</li>
            <li>but the metal plates that straighten and the straightener are far apart</li>
            <li>By the time I am near the end of my hair I feel like the plates of the iron are snagging on my hair.  </li>
            <li>As far as the damage done to my hair over time, I can&#x27;t say that I notice a difference yet.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old</li>
            <li>This gives a similar result, but works much faster.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that upon closing the iron, there is a noticeable gap, so it&#x27;s important to squeeze firmly to get the hair straight.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the swivel cord, that kept me from doing that cord dance when you are forced to twist and turn and pivot to avoid tangling up in the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say this product is for more of thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I have spent a lifetime using a variety of hot curlers, a selection of straightening irons, curling irons of every size as well as chasing hope with every new tool and hair product that has been invented.  </li>
            <li>My wife has wavy hair, she sometimes likes her hair completely straight, other times very curly.  </li>
            <li>Amazing straightener, got it at half the price on black Friday.</li>
            <li>Heats very quickly &amp; evenly &amp; truly cuts down on the frizz I usually get in this hot, humid DC area!</li>
            <li>I broke down and bought the Remington only because it was available for a lightning deal.  </li>
            <li>one has a strip down the center of one of the plates that&#x27;s supposed to sense the hair and automatically adjust the temperature to make sure it&#x27;s not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this straightener after having read through several reviews.  </li>
            <li>It can be set as low as 300 or as high as 450, but I can&#x27;t imagine whose hair could withstand that temperature.</li>
            <li>I set it lower than I do with a more expensive 1/2\\&quot; flat iron, both in order not to damage my hair, but also as the larger size of this iron is more likely to come in contact with one&#x27;s ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it gives off an odd odor and doesn&#x27;t make my hair as smooth as my last straightener did before it bit the dust</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that has the features of a very expensive straightener, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Be careful it gets smoking hot.</li>
            <li>Granted, using it in the lowest setting can make the straightening process a little longer and a little less effective, but it is worth it for every day use if you don&#x27;t want to ruin your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remington S9500 and S8590 are essentially the same aside from the fact that the S8590 adds Keratin and the Smart Sensor.</li>
            <li>I like the controls, the visual look of this product, how it feels in the hand and how quickly it heats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin fine hair currently with lots of split ends.  </li>
            <li>will be bringing back to walmart and trying a new one.</li>
            <li>Remington&#x27;s parent company, Spectrum, took back the faulty product and replaced it with a brand new one.  </li>
            <li>However, I just run the flat iron a little slower over my hair and it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive products than this one and the Remington holds up to ones that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the function of a flat iron is to get your hair smooth, and this definitely does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Does not burn has as much as the only flat irons</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, prior to getting this flat iron my hair would be mostly straight but STILL have a bit of curl.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Overall this iron is decent for the money and will provide you with the basic functions of straightening your hair.  </li>
            <li>not wide</li>
            <li>Left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>(apparently the heat was melting the finish as I used it to curl my hair).  </li>
            <li>I also sometimes use it to do a little wavy curl through my hair and it seems to be just the right width and size for doing that as well.</li>
            <li>so I need to calm it down before going out in public.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, thick hair that I like to straighten sometimes to look a little more polished, or just to have a different style.  </li>
            <li>I did noticed a slight acrid smell when it first turned on, and it disappeared after a minute or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected it to last longer, especially considering the fact that I barely used it in the first 6 months I had it.</li>
            <li>And I have extremely curly hair, so I was amazed how straight my hair had gotten.</li>
            <li>However, when the Remington finally arrived, it actually straightened better and was less than half the price of the CHI.</li>
            <li>Let me list myself (african american woman with natural hair</li>
            <li>The smart sensor  turns the heat down when it senses the hair is damaged.</li>
            <li>cause its telling me to because apparently a 5 star rating isnt enough credit for the hair straightener, it requires me to praise it with an essay.</li>
            <li>the past 5 years or so, I have seen more Remington flat irons on TV and film sets than any other brand, which is telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not see any of the smooth Keratin Therapy results that this iron is supposed to do; it&#x27;s just like every other iron I have used except the piece in the middle is not smooth and snags your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty seriously damaged and this seems to keep any new damage from forming.</li>
            <li>i used it after a shower after letting my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I can straighten my hair in half the time of my old one!!!</li>
            <li>So I did a little research and ordered this model with the keratin because I have thick, slightly frizzy wavy/curly hair that damages fairly easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say if your hair is badly damaged, turn off the heat sensor, from what I can tell it turns up the heat for the damaged parts to get it straight, but will actually damage your hair more.</li>

            <li> I gotta say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!  </li>
            <li> First - delivery was AWESOME!  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say I notice any difference from the keratin, or how long the infusion lasts on the ceramic, but the product is very good and does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> I received it very quickly and it works great</li>
            <li> Is easy to use, very useful, I am very happy with this product, I recommend to buy it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this on Amazon, but was so thrilled I wanted to leave a review for others considering</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a kertain kick for my hair &amp; my hair is loving me because of it.</li>
            <li> But she buys her own tools, and won&#x27;t spend money on \\&quot;professional\\&quot; tools that don&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li> It heats up in 30 seconds, the digital heat setting is awesome, the swivel cord is great and the auto-shutoff is so handy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not going to risk my health to have nice hair.</li>
            <li> my new best friend....</li>
            <li> Because it was awesome and new and stuff.</li>
            <li> pads close to edge making it very easy to burn oneself</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite straightener I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> the best straighter ive owned so far!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with the iron.</li>
            <li> Received it today and I love it, works amazing</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my old Remington Straightener but wanted an upgrade after 5 years.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightner I have owned !</li>
            <li> But it is a great product and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it, does a great job quickly.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair shiny and feeling healthy afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I love the smoothness of the plates.</li>
            <li> Love the auto shut off feature.</li>
            <li> I love that the plates are coated with keratin - I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the shine and smoothness of my hair whenever I use this thing to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this thing</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this straightener.</li>
            <li> It fit nicely in my hand and was a cinch to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plates are thinner than what Im used to, and that was my favorite feature on this iron.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> It has settings up to 410 degrees, but my hair gets done on 375 which is more than sufficient.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast, which is great and is lightweight for it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> and I love the color</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love, love,  love this straightener.</li>
            <li> Really love all the features and the fact that if I forget, it shuts itself off for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> like this even better than the Shine Therapy styler.  </li>
            <li> The switches are on the side, rather than the top of the styler.  </li>
            <li> This model works better</li>
            <li> So I love that this adjusts to your hair.  </li>
            <li> i got for me and for my sisters and in laws they all love it&lt;</li>
            <li> It has lovely design and does the job well.</li>
            <li> I just love this product</li>
            <li> It is much better than the discount store/drugstore ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly I love it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the leap on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Small can feel to take more time with longer hair</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Damage Sensor\\&quot; and \\&quot;Keratin\\&quot; seem more like a gimmick to me at this point.</li>
            <li> im in love with it</li>
            <li> I love the heat control feature.  </li>
            <li> The top silver finish bubbled as I used the straightener</li>
            <li> but I want to highlight it to make sure it isn&#x27;t a health issue.  </li>
            <li> but it def does the job :)</li>
            <li> I love that this straightener has temperature choices, my favorite being 340 degrees.</li>
            <li> It protects my bathroom counter top from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps others might have better luck with this product, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this choice - this is my third straightener and it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> The Keratin strip that&#x27;s built into the flat iron plate is friggin awesome!  </li>
            <li> And Remington you&#x27;re flat irons are great!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is awesome.  </li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased by Remington to date!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good straightener for that.</li>
            <li> What I liked about this Remington S8590 model is that it heats up quickly, it turns itself off when not being used.  </li>
            <li> (Thermafuse Smoothing Treatment - the best smoothing treatment in the world - keratin and formaldehyde free currently in my hair).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the $30 I paid for it, and so far I am quite happy with it!</li>
            <li> Good product 100% positive.</li>
            <li> All what I love in a straightener, heats up fast and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> It has a strip on it that is supposed to be able to tell if your hair is damaged/brittle/too fine and adjust the temp accordingly, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li> The plates meet better with the Keratin Therapy, though this is nit-picking; the plates are fine on both.  </li>
            <li> This is a very fine and unique product.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really happy with this straightener.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that works at one swing and more importantly something that does not spoil the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found out about this thanks to a glowing recommendation from Good HouseKeeping decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> This is a good reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> I would be interested to hear how many others have noticed a very strong smell coming from this product.  </li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend to others who are looking for an affordable, good quality straightener!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy fix.</li>
            <li> Some people didn&#x27;t like the placement of the switches on the Shine Therapy because it was easy to bump them.  </li>
            <li> It also heated up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly, getting up to 400°F in about 40 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The controls are easy to work and see.  </li>
            <li> The size makes it easy to handle when I&#x27;m doing curling.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this Remington :)</li>
            <li> and I now have a strong wave/curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how versatile styling irons are, and this one is first class.wever, is lighter and easier to hold than the Shine Therapy, so I give it five stars.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how versatile styling irons are, and this one is first class.</li>
            <li> All the information is true and love the heat sensor to keep from damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s new it seems like the keratin-infused plates give off a light, pleasant scent, but I imagine it will dissipate over time.  </li>
            <li> good new product in accordance with my purchase .</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> Love the sensor that lets me know when its too hot, and love that it turns itself off too.</li>
            <li> model straigtened my hair more quickly and did a nicer job.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, heats up very quickly and straightens on the first try.  </li>
            <li> It straightens great the only problem I have is the iron won&#x27;t go thru my hair as easy</li>
            <li> this iron gets my hair super straight!!!!</li>
            <li> the Remington S8590 Keratin Therapy Straightener with Smart Sensor is amazing</li>
            <li> They said it heats up very fast!!  </li>
            <li> This Keratin Therapy Straightener with Smart Sensor is excellent at the current price of $31...</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its important to me to have these built in safety features.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wipe clean of products and it&#x27;s floating plates help with the ease of straightening my hair or creating curls.</li>
            <li> How Smooth It Runs Through My Hair.</li>
            <li> The casing on this did not seem to fit correctly (the buttons were not set</li>
            <li> Quicker is important to me.  </li>
            <li> It did take a couple of passes with each section of hair to straighten but it left it very silky and soft, and so fair it has stayed that way which I am very happy about!</li>
            <li> Amazon was great about processing my refund and I ended up purchasing different one.</li>
            <li> so I can not say that the Remington is the best ever at straighting, what I can say is this product warms up quickley and shuts off on its own after some time so you dont have to worry about starting a fire if left on.  </li>
            <li> with every straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned, there is a tendency for the iron to tip over on its side, so I&#x27;ve discovered a fabulous \\&quot;stand\\&quot; for it -- just a cheap metal napkin holder that I got from Target.</li>
            <li> this ok i like it  verry good and fast thanks</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So I grab a fabric softener sheet and that takes the static right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that this flat iron is great.</li>
            <li> Remington flat irons feel great in my hand.</li>
            <li> packaging is high-end, and the addition of Keratin in a flat iron is welcome, if one has frizzy</li>
            <li> I love this straightener, it is very sleek, light weight ,easy to use</li>
            <li> It heated quickly, has three temperature settings and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Very easy and fast to heat up.</li>
            <li> Overall it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> I have since bought other products from the Keratin Therapy line and loved every one of them!</li>
            <li> Heats up super quick!</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I was pleased.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was really excited about this straightener/flat iron and all of it&#x27;s features.</li>
            <li> We can not ALL look like the star of the original \\&quot;Footloose\\&quot; with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived nicely packed in new condition.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and straightens smoothly without pulling or breaking my hair.  </li>
            <li> positive is that I was able to return the product for free and I did get a quick rebate.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair looks when I use them, shiny, tidy, easy to handle, but on the other hand, use it twice and my hair starts to show all the signs of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Returned for a full refund though.</li>
            <li> I still recommend the Shine Therapy, but this is a sleeker, more modern product, and it is an improvement.  </li>
            <li> The straightener has lasted well for several months which is a good sign.  </li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s not a bad straighter for the price.  </li>
            <li> Hey, time is important, right?  </li>
            <li> The fact that one can control the temperature: Super easy to determine which temperature to use to straighten your hair, great for people like me that have hair that is thin and easy to straighten but also easy to damage.</li>
            <li> Have told other gals about this because the product is great and so was the price.</li>
            <li> Great price, performs as expected!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great product and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really quick.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and stays on.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a super performer.  </li>
            <li> Sections of hair pass through the blades so quickly</li>
            <li> It has the advantage of being super malleable, I can do whatever I want with it and the disadvantage of getting ruined by just whispering at it.</li>
            <li> I am lucky in that my hair straightes with ease</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does not pull my hair.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and the plates don&#x27;t damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I need a straighter that I can use very hot.  </li>
            <li> As a girl whose been using Chi&#x27;s strictly  for 9 years to find a straightener that was such a reasonable price and better was amazing.</li>
            <li> great feature, that it automatically shuts off after a while, just in case you forget and it also has a locking mechanism that makes burning yourself less</li>
            <li> The iron is very lightweight and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I use a higher setting on my original one</li>
            <li> I am an AA with really think hair and this flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> Although it took a little longer than I wanted to receive (patience is not my strong suit), the flat iron is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> This is a very good Hair straightener,it does the job well and has several different heat levels.</li>
            <li> I really like the light weight.</li>
            <li> Just used this flat iron and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s worth what it cost.</li>
            <li> so many extra features for such a good price....</li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing I noticed when I turned it on is that the buttons are sort of recessed into the side, which was really nice since I wasn&#x27;t actually turning the straightener off or changing the temp while doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth the $50</li>
            <li> It straightened my hair faster than my old straightener and didn&#x27;t seem to leave as many fried ends.</li>
            <li> Remington is kind enough to send a replacement (on the way) -</li>
            <li> This does not sit very flat or safely on the countertop; it constantly wants to roll over since it&#x27;s rounded on the top and bottom.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks, and it does a very nice job with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Right on time, my hair was in danger of being cut off so that I could from scratch.</li>
            <li> The first flat iron to leave my hair completely straight after a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my other Remington Flat iron!!</li>
            <li> I cant say much for the keratin therapy since I have not been using it very long all in all good value for the price.</li>
            <li> My niece has very thick course hair and after her first use, her hair was smooth and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> The power controls are easy to use and the blue lighting on the body, I find pretty, modern and stylish.</li>
            <li> She just had a standard one (a $25 or $30 model recently purchased) but I was really impressed with how sleek and soft her hair was after.</li>
            <li> I would say it is well worth the slightly higher price versus an entry-level product.</li>
            <li> This is a very high class straight  for cheap.</li>
            <li> and you are attentive about avoiding new growth hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Remington tries to make their products sound like they can perform magic.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Remington tries to make their products sound like they can perform magic.  </li>
            <li> It does it quickly and it does it very well.</li>
            <li> I own so many flat iron straighteners - heard a review on this one on the Today Show - decided - maybe this one would be the holy grail of all flat irons &amp; IT</li>
            <li> It has a nice feel in your hands its not too big, or small-love the swivle cord it also heats up incredibly fast and gets really, really hot.</li>
            <li> It gets hot quickly but I haven&#x27;t had much experience with the sensor technology</li>
            <li> However, the smart sensor doesn&#x27;t seem entirely accurate as I&#x27;ve noticed frizzed sections of hair which happen when the temperature of the straightener is too high.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> my hair has a burnt smell even on a lower setting, but not with this one...........even on higher settings.  </li>
            <li> hair glides through and straightens first time.</li>
            <li> think this unit runs rather hot.  </li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, it was at a default setting of 375 degrees.  </li>
            <li> It worked well for my frizzy curly hair, so I would try this one first.</li>
            <li> I would buy a gift to my mother, who remained haunted since I began using the first day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have a different Remington model straightener that I like better.</li>
            <li> others have noted, the iron tends to run a bit hot.  </li>
            <li> Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\\&quot;]]  did a much better job of moving through my hair without snagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a guy, one needs this size or smaller for most cuts.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> My 2nd one started to bubble on the top.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience using a straightener on my unruly, curly hair.</li>
            <li> + model, so I&#x27;ll forgive Remington and gladly keep the extra $50 in my wallet.</li>
            <li> Afterward, I&#x27;ll often use electric curlers to give more body to my hair -- yes, a time-consuming, yet essential step to give me the confidence to be seen in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first straightener I&#x27;ve had with an on-off switch</li>
            <li> after the first use, I looked like I had just stepped out of my salon.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t move through your hair like a ceramic plate does, but I am willing to trade off this glide for a flat iron that will keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I used to use a CHI straightener, which was great, but this is just fine if you don&#x27;t have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I really love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I bought one for my sister, who is such a dinosaur she was still using a curling brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more expensive styling irons, and none of them were as good as a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more expensive styling irons, and none of them were as good as a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure if it is actually sensing and adapting to how much moisture is in my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> Bought this after hearing good things about it when my last flat iron crapped out.</li>
            <li> MOST kertain therapy straightening irons are much more expensive than this one, so I was THRILLED to only pay $30.00.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this</li>
            <li> This one straightens her hair quickly and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This tool gets extremely hot but if you are careful and your hair can handle the heat, you will LOVE the results.  </li>
            <li> I have a ghd and bought this for the smart sensor aswell as the keratin therapy for the hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the smoothing products, and they work to a certain degree.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit has a smart sensor to reduce heat if you over process the hair ( probably not an issue for guys, but might be for gal&#x27;s with longer</li>
            <li> This is happening to the new growth hair which tends to be finer and more fragile along the temples, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product is great and does not burn your hair is so thin bright sheet reaches the root and smooth in a few past and why my hair is wavy strong</li>
            <li> took 2 years back and still works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell whether the Keratin infusion and smart sensor are anything more than gimmicks, but as a ceramic flat iron it gets the job done, if not quite as smoothly as higher priced units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t really tell if the Smart Sensor is making a difference, I think the Keratin is working.</li>
            <li> hinge lock is great, to help prevent little (or big) hands from accidental burns.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fry my hair and left it very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> My Remington straightener is comfortable to use, very well made, and I can only hope</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t run smoothly over my hair, it does feel like my hair catches on the plates and pulls a bit, which makes me nervous because I don&#x27;t want to break my hair, especially considering it is summer</li>
            <li> Your hair stays straight</li>
            <li> all day- even through high humidity!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> is the real deal</li>
            <li> and I could feel the difference it left my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> straightens my hair FAST.  </li>
            <li> I really like this straightener.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d NEVER seen my hair that straight (besides the times I had it straightened at the salon).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated that part of the purchase.</li>
            <li> Both heat up fast, but the Keratin Therapy doesn&#x27;t require the user to lock in the chosen temperature.  </li>
            <li> you have straight hair, you can learn how to use a styling iron by watching your stylist, or check out youtube.  </li>
            <li> you have straight hair, you can learn how to use a styling iron by watching your stylist, or check out youtube.  </li>
            <li> This straightener works very well.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does not move smoothly over my hair, there is some resistence.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> , it did the trick without damaging my hair too much.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if it is really \\&quot;infused\\&quot; with conditioners or not.</li>
            <li> I really need it</li>
            <li> &quot; really work?&lt;br /&gt;-Does</li>
            <li> it really \\&quot;infuse Keratin?</li>
            <li> The only critique I have, however, is that the plates aren&#x27;t smooth ceramic, like I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Heat up really fast.</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference from the keratin-infused plates; my hair still breaks and frizzes a lot.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and FRIZZY.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use it only once so far.</li>
            <li> Better than Paul Mitchell and other straighteners</li>
            <li> i wasnt sure if it was just me until i read the other review.</li>
            <li> The button placement is better on this one than the other one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order a used item, but this was definitely used and out of its original packaging.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten my hair in just 15 minutes and my hair shows no sign of breakage and absolutely no frizz (even with high humidity today).  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and this tool</li>
            <li> Some other good features are that it has a lock to keep the straightener shut and the cord is not too long.  </li>
            <li> It straightens my hair easily with minimal damage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how it could possibly adjust so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a Remington S8590 before and it was a high quality straightener.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the road, this will fix being out in the rain, or high humidity events, and get you looking polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It straightens very easily and leaves very little frizz</li>
            <li> This is my new fave simply for how well it handles and how quickly I can get through my hair.</li>
            <li> must say I used it a  couple of times and so far, it doesn&#x27;t look like it is damaging my hair too much,</li>
            <li> Just received but really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting quite a few compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I was also able to achieve a small flip at the bottom of my hair so it doesn&#x27;t stick straight.  </li>
            <li> No tool has ever really been hot enough until now.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, no other flat iron runs as smoothly as the KQC.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that was the original intention, but even my hair stylist hardly ever uses a curling iron on customers&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> Because of its size, I can actually leave my hair a bit curly and use the straightener to smooth out my hair a bit, so it doesn&#x27;t look so wild/frizzy and that is enough for me to recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a mid-priced, decent straightener.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all and this on is as good as, if not better than, the costly flat irons on the market!  </li>
            <li> it is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair as smooth &amp; shiny as my other straightener.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it feels in my hand and how easy it is to fit in my hair (not too wide, not too narrow).</li>
            <li> Not only did my curls come out fantastic but it also re-straightened my curl instantly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sensor strip in the panel didn&#x27;t really seem to affect the process; only once at the very end</li>
            <li> biggest difference between this and more expensive irons is how smoothly they glide through the hair.  </li>
            <li> I straightened my hair in layers and it only took one pass to go from very curly to completely straight.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much will be taken into account for the next</li>
            <li> The S8590 is a different color, is infused with keratin, and heats to 450 degrees instead of the S8500&#x27;s 430 maximum, but otherwise very much like the similarly-priced 8500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The keratin and vitamins are applied from a strip that is in the middle of the hot plates.</li>
            <li> I had to have the first one returned and replaced because the silver coating/decoration on the body started to come up, since it hasn&#x27;t happened with the one I currently have, I&#x27;m assuming it was just a defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For one thing, the smart sensor didn&#x27;t really work as well as I thought it would, and no matter how much I turned the initial setting down, it still felt too hot for me.  </li>
            <li> I had a ceramic flat iron, it was around $100 (higher end one, but not the highest end one).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been getting use every day for the better part of the year and still going, but other than that I can&#x27;t comment on how long this product will go until it dies.</li>
            <li> So much better than my last non-keratin flat iron which tended to dry out, even burn my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In fact, several people asked if I got my hair professionally straightened or commented about how straight my hair was.</li>
            <li> I did not give 5 stars because of having to be extra careful handling it and because it does not allow hair to pass through as smoothly as would like.</li>
            <li> As an African-American woman who wears my hair natural, I&#x27;m hesitant to straighten myself too often for fear of damage and pulling from the plates.  </li>
            <li> Who ever thought that Remington would put out such a high quality product and you can&#x27;t beat the price either!  </li>
            <li> Thought this was worth noting because it happens constantly, even though I am conscious of it &amp; use smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and gets frizzy in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Her old one didn&#x27;t have adjustable heat settings or keratin infused plates.</li>
            <li> I really like it overall and will update this review if I have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> i sectioned off the bottom hair and after going over it again and again for 10 mins it was finally straight enought for me to go onto the next section.</li>
            <li> but the metal plates that straighten and the straightener are far apart</li>
            <li> By the time I am near the end of my hair I feel like the plates of the iron are snagging on my hair.  </li>
            <li> As far as the damage done to my hair over time, I can&#x27;t say that I notice a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old</li>
            <li> This gives a similar result, but works much faster.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that upon closing the iron, there is a noticeable gap, so it&#x27;s important to squeeze firmly to get the hair straight.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the swivel cord, that kept me from doing that cord dance when you are forced to twist and turn and pivot to avoid tangling up in the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say this product is for more of thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I have spent a lifetime using a variety of hot curlers, a selection of straightening irons, curling irons of every size as well as chasing hope with every new tool and hair product that has been invented.  </li>
            <li> My wife has wavy hair, she sometimes likes her hair completely straight, other times very curly.  </li>
            <li> Amazing straightener, got it at half the price on black Friday.</li>
            <li> Heats very quickly &amp; evenly &amp; truly cuts down on the frizz I usually get in this hot, humid DC area!</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought the Remington only because it was available for a lightning deal.  </li>
            <li> one has a strip down the center of one of the plates that&#x27;s supposed to sense the hair and automatically adjust the temperature to make sure it&#x27;s not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this straightener after having read through several reviews.  </li>
            <li> It can be set as low as 300 or as high as 450, but I can&#x27;t imagine whose hair could withstand that temperature.</li>
            <li> I set it lower than I do with a more expensive 1/2\\&quot; flat iron, both in order not to damage my hair, but also as the larger size of this iron is more likely to come in contact with one&#x27;s ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it gives off an odd odor and doesn&#x27;t make my hair as smooth as my last straightener did before it bit the dust</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that has the features of a very expensive straightener, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Be careful it gets smoking hot.</li>
            <li> Granted, using it in the lowest setting can make the straightening process a little longer and a little less effective, but it is worth it for every day use if you don&#x27;t want to ruin your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remington S9500 and S8590 are essentially the same aside from the fact that the S8590 adds Keratin and the Smart Sensor.</li>
            <li> I like the controls, the visual look of this product, how it feels in the hand and how quickly it heats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin fine hair currently with lots of split ends.  </li>
            <li> will be bringing back to walmart and trying a new one.</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s parent company, Spectrum, took back the faulty product and replaced it with a brand new one.  </li>
            <li> However, I just run the flat iron a little slower over my hair and it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive products than this one and the Remington holds up to ones that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the function of a flat iron is to get your hair smooth, and this definitely does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Does not burn has as much as the only flat irons</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, prior to getting this flat iron my hair would be mostly straight but STILL have a bit of curl.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Overall this iron is decent for the money and will provide you with the basic functions of straightening your hair.  </li>
            <li> not wide</li>
            <li> Left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> (apparently the heat was melting the finish as I used it to curl my hair).  </li>
            <li> I also sometimes use it to do a little wavy curl through my hair and it seems to be just the right width and size for doing that as well.</li>
            <li> so I need to calm it down before going out in public.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick hair that I like to straighten sometimes to look a little more polished, or just to have a different style.  </li>
            <li> I did noticed a slight acrid smell when it first turned on, and it disappeared after a minute or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected it to last longer, especially considering the fact that I barely used it in the first 6 months I had it.</li>
            <li> And I have extremely curly hair, so I was amazed how straight my hair had gotten.</li>
            <li> However, when the Remington finally arrived, it actually straightened better and was less than half the price of the CHI.</li>
            <li> Let me list myself (african american woman with natural hair</li>
            <li> The smart sensor  turns the heat down when it senses the hair is damaged.</li>
            <li> cause its telling me to because apparently a 5 star rating isnt enough credit for the hair straightener, it requires me to praise it with an essay.</li>
            <li> the past 5 years or so, I have seen more Remington flat irons on TV and film sets than any other brand, which is telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not see any of the smooth Keratin Therapy results that this iron is supposed to do; it&#x27;s just like every other iron I have used except the piece in the middle is not smooth and snags your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty seriously damaged and this seems to keep any new damage from forming.</li>
            <li> i used it after a shower after letting my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair in half the time of my old one!!!</li>
            <li> So I did a little research and ordered this model with the keratin because I have thick, slightly frizzy wavy/curly hair that damages fairly easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say if your hair is badly damaged, turn off the heat sensor, from what I can tell it turns up the heat for the damaged parts to get it straight, but will actually damage your hair more.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it is not simply due to the fact the older one is on the decline since I have been using it for two years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> so I have been searching for the right one for at least a year now.  </li>
            <li> I guess I expected a miracle or something, but not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron actually straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that is does not lie flat on the counter</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, wavy/curly hair and this makes my hair pin straight, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li> I finally found a flat iron that does what I need it to do (straighten)!  </li>
            <li> The ONLY negative thing that I would say about this, is that it doesn&#x27;t have as smooth of a glide down my hair as my KQC flat iron.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight</li>
            <li> so I wanted a flat iron with adjustable heat setting.</li>
            <li> but I was also using a flat iron spray on each section before ironing.</li>
            <li> I got to use this flat iron twice before my son&#x27;s fiancee borrowed it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She does have a suggestion for flat iron manufacturers out there...</li>
            <li> this flat iron is supposed to have to protect hair from damage.</li>
            <li> We have all used a flat iron by now.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on affordable flat irons.</li>
            <li> I bit the bullet and bought this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works miracles.  </li>
            <li> I have gone days without having to flat iron my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> Like a flat iron, it smoothed/straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> A flat iron making my hair look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with all flat irons of this size, one needs to learn how to use it, to avoid a 1960&#x27;s \\&quot;Troll Doll\\&quot; effect  ( not understanding that?</li>
            <li> With this flat iron, it&#x27;s on the lowest setting and boy the difference in my hair!  </li>
            <li> When she needs her hair straight this does the job without making her work too hard at it.</li>
            <li> for a long while.</li>
            <li> cord is over 5 feet long and swivel style, which is convenient.  </li>
            <li> Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates,</li>
            <li> Having thick curly hair, I appreciated the strength of the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to send the first one back as it was not functioning properly.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected when purchasing a $40 flat iron.</li>
            <li> The other comments that say it&#x27;s a European plug</li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t see any damage from that, but I am not sure long term</li>
            <li> I used a CHI for about 10 years because it was the only thing that would straighten my wavy hair and not have it frizz back up in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> have a wider ionic iron that I loved until it wore down. :(</li>
            <li> However I did feel like it could have lasted longer than a single use.</li>
            <li> Also, my other flat irons would pull my hair and cause it to break off...not with this iron.</li>
            <li> with other Remington&#x27;s - a flat iron is multi-use for guys.  </li>
            <li> default temperature is 375 degrees, so I have to remember to dial it down to the next lower setting, which is 340 degrees.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly from the root down and extremely thick.  </li>
            <li> It smoothed down the natural, thick wave in my hair with no frizz later.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I doesn&#x27;t work or if my hair just hasn&#x27;t be tormented to any major damage by this thing</li>
            <li> Only thing is it pulls on the hair a little</li>
            <li> As the sad owner of fine, frizzy hair, I&#x27;m always looking for a straightener that can tame my unruly locks without damage.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it working for me, so hopefully it means my damage is minimal to not an issue.</li>
            <li> She says the 2 inch is too wide and the 1 inch</li>
            <li> If you need to change it be careful or you can get</li>
            <li> I plugged it into a few different outlets and it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> As you run your hair sections through the plates, a LOT of heat is generated and you need to careful about burning hands, scalp, fingers, ears, etc.  </li>
            <li> straightener has a few key features that help with that:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> well spent</li>
            <li> I would recommend but be careful</li>
            <li> Because this one was harder to slide my hair through, it took me longer to use it.</li>
            <li> Not much of a learning curve here -</li>
            <li> The box this came in was not a Remington box but a plain white box with a barcode label on the end (leading me to believe that it was a refurbished item).  </li>
            <li> With this while my edges get a little rough still, I have about a week that I can go without using it, as long as I keep my head wrapped at night.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that I find my hair curling up faster than usual.</li>
            <li> I have expensive $$$ ones but this takes the prize for first place.  </li>
            <li> With the other one $$$</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling healthier, smoother, and softer than other products.</li>
            <li> #34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Conditioner&amp;#34; the day before when I washed my hair, and that product is supposed to help protect from heat damage, among other things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I do know it works well and does not damage my hair like some other ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the other hand, this is an inexpensive straightener and to expect it to work as well as one twice its price is probably unreasonable.  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m used to with my other straightener&lt;br /&gt;-Heat</li>
            <li> On my other Remington one the buttons are so conveniently-placed on the outside that it&#x27;s hard not to push them by mistake.</li>
            <li> If this one has the same toxic smell - there is a huge problem - Ive notice several other reviews have commented on the &#x27;nasty smell&#x27; -</li>
            <li> Usually I have to set my flat irons on the highest temp to get my hair half way under control.  </li>
            <li> She showed my sister how to take at least ten minutes off her morning</li>
            <li> Hair straightener works very well, and doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that they can sometimes get when they heat up.</li>
            <li> Also it seems that the black half gets hotter than the other.</li>
            <li> After this one got lost in the mail, I broke down and bought a CHI.</li>
            <li> , i have to set it down on its side</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t require an unlock before powering down.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s two less button pushes per use.  </li>
            <li> but I wish it was less than that as a safety feature in case</li>
            <li> That cost me about $7 in shipping, but still much less than replacing the product on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer sides that are slightly</li>
            <li> The Remington Straightener fits well in the hand and runs though thick long hair</li>
            <li> i added a little thermal control serum to my hair and turned the straightener on at the lowest temp.</li>
            <li> sides are a little sharper-edged than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I usually use a jumbo curler to curl my ends up and it is always hard after flat ironing.</li>
            <li> This one is sleek but not quite as heavy.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but nearly.  </li>
            <li> Thin, frizzy hair, not exactly curly, though not straight either and with a tendency to occupy three times its volume.</li>
            <li> In summer months it is a lot of extra heat that may cause you to want to jump back in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;I am very skeptical about the sensor feature.  </li>
            <li> I have thin but lots of long hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioning works fantastically but the sensor part is a little confusing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a faulty one, but it&#x27;s past the point of return.  </li>
            <li> My hair usually is frizzy after a day or two after straightening.  </li>
            <li> After noticing how often my stylists were using a small one, I felt the need to try one myself.</li>
            <li> it is not magical.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what this is about.</li>
            <li> ) fail after a couple of years of (almost daily) use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the straightner or my hair or my not knowing just how to make one work on my hair like my hairdressor does</li>
            <li> and if I am in a hurry which I usually am</li>
            <li> I appreciate the swiveling cord, which keeps it from falling off my small bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and this straightens it no problem.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair</li>
            <li> , I have thick wavy hair and also with the hair type sensor, I trust the straightener to take care of my damaged spots like the ends by reducing the temp for me automatically.</li>
            <li> What do I mean by that?</li>
            <li> but I was pulling the straightener down at a weird angle so that may have contributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was ridiculously affordable.</li>
            <li> But after reading some of things about regular flat irons being terrible for hair and basically stripping it of all kertain; I begun my search for this iron.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had a few issues in which I decided to return this item.  </li>
            <li> Tried another Andis (Not sure which one) and that failed me also.  </li>
            <li> have been using this for a month now, previously i would just go with my curls and hesitate to style my hair every time because i was afraid it would damage my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick</li>
            <li> I have curly, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> admit I don&#x27;t begin to understand the technology behind this appliance</li>
            <li> as I would like I have to put power behind it</li>
            <li> : Helps the hair look shiny and keeps it protected, though I think it gives the straightner an odd and a little nasty smell when heated.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one ladies.....</li>
            <li> (I know lame)</li>
            <li> I gave the Shine Therapy four stars because of the silly claim of infusing it with avocado oil.  </li>
            <li> I gave the Shine Therapy four stars because of the silly claim of infusing it with avocado oil.  </li>
            <li> I am also skeptical about infusing Keratin into my hair by using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I had an expensive one that didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> It is not overly expensive, so I would say to try this one before you go and buy a CHI or an expensive salon one.</li>
            <li> Weird stone strip rips my hair out sometimes.</li>
            <li> Some hair is easier to straighten than others and if your hair is the difficult.  </li>
            <li> I got this product hoping I could use it to straighten out my hair without a lot of hassle, but I ended up being rather disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> The dial for the temp gauge is in a very awkward place however.</li>
            <li> but i didnt get the base it was supposed to come with.</li>
            <li> plus did not leave any unpleasant odor on my hair!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product and great price</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a faulty one, but it&#x27;s past the point of return.  I&#x27;ve only had it like 6 weeks though.</li>
            <li> I really love this ! It has worked wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> This works so well.  My hair usually is frizzy after a day or two after straightening.  With this while my edges get a little rough still, I have about a week that I can go without using it, as long as I keep my head wrapped at night.  Best straightener I have had.</li>
            <li> Works great and adjusts in temperature.  Does not burn has as much as the only flat irons and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this as a Birthday gift.  Although it took a little longer than I wanted to receive (patience is not my strong suit), the flat iron is wonderful!  Usually I have to set my flat irons on the highest temp to get my hair half way under control.  With this flat iron, it&#x27;s on the lowest setting and boy the difference in my hair!  It looks shinier, healthier, and that look lasts!!!!  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This flat iron actually straightens my hair. My hair texture by the is very coarse so, this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite straightener I have ever owned!  I have really thick hair, and this straightens it no problem.  It also leaves my hair shiny and feeling healthy afterwards.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so silky and smooth. The first flat iron to leave my hair completely straight after a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Best straightened ever</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have known, but this straightener caught my hair and yanked it.&lt;br /&gt;I have a wider ionic iron that I loved until it wore down. :( Guess I should not have changed brands.</li>
            <li> Was what ordered and happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is well made and has different settings which was a plus.</li>
            <li> Arrived nicely packed in new condition. I&#x27;ve been able to use it only once so far. I really like the light weight. It&#x27;s also very stylish looking. My hair is fine so I wanted a flat iron with adjustable heat setting. Didn&#x27;t fry my hair and left it very shiny and smooth. So far I&#x27;m very happy with the iron. Very pleased that I chose this one after all the research. Shipping was really quick. Would definitely recommend and order from this seller again. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product my girlfriends hair has been straighter</li>
            <li> good new product in accordance with my purchase .</li>
            <li> Love this!  Tames my frizzed hair immediately without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> It works well. I love the smoothness of the plates.</li>
            <li> I had no idea it was a European plug! Lot of good that does me!😡</li>
            <li> the product is great and does not burn your hair is so thin bright sheet reaches the root and smooth in a few past and why my hair is wavy strong</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my other Remington Flat iron!! Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> Very easy and fast to heat up.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and good seller</li>
            <li> Received this gift for the holiday and it wouldn&#x27;t even power on.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair and it seems to be doing the trick. Love the auto shut off feature.</li>
            <li> BEST STRAIGHTENER EVER. Ok this thing is amazing - the heat settings are perfect for my hair, I have thick wavy hair and also with the hair type sensor, I trust the straightener to take care of my damaged spots like the ends by reducing the temp for me automatically. I love that the plates are coated with keratin - I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the shine and smoothness of my hair whenever I use this thing to straighten my hair. I also sometimes use it to do a little wavy curl through my hair and it seems to be just the right width and size for doing that as well. I really love this thing, I use it after I use the Keratin Dryer from Remington as well, and my hair is model status. Don&#x27;t forget to use a heat protecting spray though no matter what whenever applying heat to the hair!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  All the information is true and love the heat sensor to keep from damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> My Remington straightener is comfortable to use, very well made, and I can only hope it will&lt;br /&gt;last for a long while.</li>
            <li> This Keratin Therapy Straightener with Smart Sensor is excellent at the current price of $31... purchased it as a gift and the recipient  loved it..</li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick hair that I like to straighten sometimes to look a little more polished, or just to have a different style.  I&#x27;ve tried literally dozens of hair straighteners.  What I like in a straightener is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-display with temp&lt;br /&gt;-easy to tell if it&#x27;s on or off&lt;br /&gt;-a lock for storage&lt;br /&gt;-not too heavy&lt;br /&gt;-ceramic plates&lt;br /&gt;-easy to change the settings without reading the manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington S8590 does have all of these features.  I like the way it feels in my hand and how easy it is to fit in my hair (not too wide, not too narrow). The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair as smooth &amp; shiny as my other straightener.  It has a strip on it that is supposed to be able to tell if your hair is damaged/brittle/too fine and adjust the temp accordingly, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  It also doesn&#x27;t run smoothly over my hair, it does feel like my hair catches on the plates and pulls a bit, which makes me nervous because I don&#x27;t want to break my hair, especially considering it is summer and my hair is already taking a beating with the sun, surf and chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad straighter for the price.  Because of its size, I can actually leave my hair a bit curly and use the straightener to smooth out my hair a bit, so it doesn&#x27;t look so wild/frizzy and that is enough for me to recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a mid-priced, decent straightener.</li>
            <li> So happy with my purchase. Same results as salon ones. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this straightener. After this one got lost in the mail, I broke down and bought a CHI. However, when the Remington finally arrived, it actually straightened better and was less than half the price of the CHI. I have since bought other products from the Keratin Therapy line and loved every one of them! Your hair stays straight all day- even through high humidity! Definitely would recommend to others who are looking for an affordable, good quality straightener!</li>
            <li> Absolutley the best straightener ever! The price was ridiculously affordable. Only drawback is the iron causes the lights in my house to flicker???? Lol</li>
            <li> I have only used the larger straighteners. After noticing how often my stylists were using a small one, I felt the need to try one myself. This Remington S8590 heated up in the same amount of time as its larger counterparts. It fit nicely in my hand and was a cinch to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure about the &#x27;damage sensor&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t notice it working for me, so hopefully it means my damage is minimal to not an issue. I was pleased with the swivel cord, that kept me from doing that cord dance when you are forced to twist and turn and pivot to avoid tangling up in the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I was happy to see a 60 min cut off. Its important to me to have these built in safety features.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. You turn it on and can adjust the temp up to 450 degrees. The keratin and vitamins are applied from a strip that is in the middle of the hot plates. The plates are thinner than what Im used to, and that was my favorite feature on this iron. It heats up quickly and stays on. It straightens very easily and leaves very little frizz but I was also using a flat iron spray on each section before ironing. I also noticed that it was easier to curl my ends. I usually use a jumbo curler to curl my ends up and it is always hard after flat ironing. Not after using this. The only downside is that I find my hair curling up faster than usual. My hair does look shinier after using, but that is also temporary. This is my new fave simply for how well it handles and how quickly I can get through my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use. My hair is fairly straight to begin with, I just use a straightener to iron out the few waves that I have. This straightener does the job well and seems to be keeping my hair in good shape while doing it.</li>
            <li> Just used this flat iron and I love it! Works just as good as my $200 one. Heats up super quick! Love the sensor that lets me know when its too hot, and love that it turns itself off too. Not to mention the great price! It also does amazing curls!! Had no idea that it curled hair as well since it didn&#x27;t say it on the box. Not only did my curls come out fantastic but it also re-straightened my curl instantly. The ONLY negative thing that I would say about this, is that it doesn&#x27;t have as smooth of a glide down my hair as my KQC flat iron. As a matter of fact, no other flat iron runs as smoothly as the KQC. However, I just run the flat iron a little slower over my hair and it&#x27;s totally fine. I haven&#x27;t experienced any pulling or snagging. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I got to use this flat iron twice before my son&#x27;s fiancee borrowed it. She refuses to give it back because she likes it so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She does have a suggestion for flat iron manufacturers out there...make a 1 1/2 inch iron for people with longer hair so you don&#x27;t have to keep going over it. She says the 2 inch is too wide and the 1 inch not wide enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the two times I got to use it I really liked it. It smoothed down the natural, thick wave in my hair with no frizz later. We get a lot of rain here and my hair does tend to start frizzing when the humidity gets up there, but this took care of it all day. It&#x27;s why I wanted it back. LOL. Plus I got to set the temperature for what I needed, not some preset iron. The dial for the temp gauge is in a very awkward place however. If you need to change it be careful or you can get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been getting use every day for the better part of the year and still going, but other than that I can&#x27;t comment on how long this product will go until it dies.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this on Amazon, but was so thrilled I wanted to leave a review for others considering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased while on vacation after my 200.00 Keratin brand straightener died on me after 6 months.  I was skeptical because of the price.  I didn&#x27;t want to end up with junk.  I am in love with this iron!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all and this on is as good as, if not better than, the costly flat irons on the market!  I spend a lot of money on my hair, and don&#x27;t trust it to any piece of junk on the market. You can&#x27;t beat this one, try it!!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this flat iron.  As an African-American woman who wears my hair natural, I&#x27;m hesitant to straighten myself too often for fear of damage and pulling from the plates.  But this is great.  Heats up quickly and straightens smoothly without pulling or breaking my hair.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I had to have the first one returned and replaced because the silver coating/decoration on the body started to come up, since it hasn&#x27;t happened with the one I currently have, I&#x27;m assuming it was just a defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this flat iron is great. It straightens my hair easily with minimal damage. The power controls are easy to use and the blue lighting on the body, I find pretty, modern and stylish. It&#x27;s easy to wipe clean of products and it&#x27;s floating plates help with the ease of straightening my hair or creating curls. It gets hot quickly but I haven&#x27;t had much experience with the sensor technology this flat iron is supposed to have to protect hair from damage. Not sure if I doesn&#x27;t work or if my hair just hasn&#x27;t be tormented to any major damage by this thing</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever used!  I have expensive $$$ ones but this takes the prize for first place.  The Keratin strip that&#x27;s built into the flat iron plate is friggin awesome!  It has settings up to 410 degrees, but my hair gets done on 375 which is more than sufficient.  With the other one $$$ my hair has a burnt smell even on a lower setting, but not with this one...........even on higher settings.  Who ever thought that Remington would put out such a high quality product and you can&#x27;t beat the price either!  Let me list myself (african american woman with natural hair (Thermafuse Smoothing Treatment - the best smoothing treatment in the world - keratin and formaldehyde free currently in my hair).&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal and it&#x27;s a super performer.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one ladies.....I promise!</li>
            <li> I love this! I can straighten my hair in half the time of my old one!!!</li>
            <li> very good product, it is recommended this purchase, delivery was done on time and without problems. thank you very much will be taken into account for the next</li>
            <li> it gives off an odd odor and doesn&#x27;t make my hair as smooth as my last straightener did before it bit the dust</li>
            <li> Amazing! That&#x27;s all that needs to be said. I am an AA with really think hair and this flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because everyone raved about it.  I like it.....it is not magical.  It heats up fast, which is great and is lightweight for it&#x27;s size.  Yes, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My hair catches &amp; gets snagged in the gap at the tip of this product where the plates meet the plastic. Thought this was worth noting because it happens constantly, even though I am conscious of it &amp; use smaller sections of hair. Also it seems that the black half gets hotter than the other. Not sure what this is about.</li>
            <li> This is a very high class straight  for cheap. I LOVE How Smooth It Runs Through My Hair. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair looks and feels so healthy. So much better than my last non-keratin flat iron which tended to dry out, even burn my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a month. I have used about 3 times. (I know lame) I&#x27;m a SAHM so don&#x27;t go anywhere often. I love it! I have thin but lots of long hair. I would say this product is for more of thick curly hair. It works great it just makes my hair staticky. So I grab a fabric softener sheet and that takes the static right away. Easy fix. I&#x27;m hoping this product last longer then a year but if not I&#x27;m not worried because i did buy for only $35. This product works just as good as a chii. I was a fan of then until your putting out $100&#x27;s of dollars every year and I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s worth what it cost. So far so good with this Remington :)</li>
            <li> Received it today and I love it, works amazing and I could feel the difference it left my hair silky smooth. And IT does NOT pull hair I don&#x27;t know why people are lying seeing it does when it doesn&#x27;t and I love the color and it&#x27;s features.! Thanks amazon. And Remington you&#x27;re flat irons are great!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really happy with this straightener.  I have long, fine hair and this tool straightens my hair FAST.  Since it&#x27;s new it seems like the keratin-infused plates give off a light, pleasant scent, but I imagine it will dissipate over time.  I used to use a CHI straightener, which was great, but this is just fine if you don&#x27;t have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> is a very good and important, quality is excellent, of good material and it does the job properly without any problem</li>
            <li> my new best friend....lol...so many extra features for such a good price....hair glides through and straightens first time. My hair is naturally curly and gets frizzy in humid weather. A really good product for the price and a really good looking flatiron as well....has a good feel to it in reference to weight.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling healthier, smoother, and softer than other products.</li>
            <li> I really like this straightener.  I have a ghd and bought this for the smart sensor aswell as the keratin therapy for the hair.  I only use this on my hair now.  I no longer use the ghd.  The result is a shinier finish to my hair.  I love this product.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> i like the straightener and i dont have any problem with it but i didnt get the base it was supposed to come with.</li>
            <li> Very good straightener</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves it! Her old one didn&#x27;t have adjustable heat settings or keratin infused plates. This one straightens her hair quickly and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Beautiful design and works great.</li>
            <li> Love, love,  love this straightener.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this. Have told other gals about this because the product is great and so was the price. Really love all the features and the fact that if I forget, it shuts itself off for me. Better than Paul Mitchell and other straighteners I&#x27;ve bought for MUCH MUCH more money!!! :D</li>
            <li> i like it but i wish it had a stand, i have to set it down on its side</li>
            <li> Product arrived damaged.  Returned for a full refund though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a kertain kick for my hair &amp; my hair is loving me because of it. But after reading some of things about regular flat irons being terrible for hair and basically stripping it of all kertain; I begun my search for this iron. MOST kertain therapy straightening irons are much more expensive than this one, so I was THRILLED to only pay $30.00.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this I had a ceramic flat iron, it was around $100 (higher end one, but not the highest end one).&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, prior to getting this flat iron my hair would be mostly straight but STILL have a bit of curl.&lt;br /&gt;But this iron gets my hair super straight!!!! And I have extremely curly hair, so I was amazed how straight my hair had gotten. I&#x27;d NEVER seen my hair that straight (besides the times I had it straightened at the salon).&lt;br /&gt;In fact, several people asked if I got my hair professionally straightened or commented about how straight my hair was. Also, my other flat irons would pull my hair and cause it to break off...not with this iron. I don&#x27;t look like a cat shreading it fur for the summer after a use. Wonderful!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I received it very quickly and it works great</li>
            <li> I received a product that did not work. I plugged it into a few different outlets and it would not turn on. Not only did it not work, the product appeared to be a knock-off. I have purchased a Remington S8590 before and it was a high quality straightener. The casing on this did not seem to fit correctly (the buttons were not set correctly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One positive is that I was able to return the product for free and I did get a quick rebate. I appreciated that part of the purchase.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it time we stop calling these straightening or flattening irons, and start calling them styling irons?  It&#x27;s true that was the original intention, but even my hair stylist hardly ever uses a curling iron on customers&#x27; hair.  She uses a \\&quot;styling iron\\&quot; (and I will call it that), and she does great hair.  I don&#x27;t know what styling iron she uses; I can&#x27;t see the brand.  But she buys her own tools, and won&#x27;t spend money on \\&quot;professional\\&quot; tools that don&#x27;t deliver.  She uses consumer-level straightening irons, one-inch to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description for this styling iron is similar to [[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\\&quot;]], which I received from Vine and reviewed.  I love it so much, I bought one for my sister, who is such a dinosaur she was still using a curling brush.  Don&#x27;t worry, my niece knows how to use a styling iron.  She showed my sister how to take at least ten minutes off her morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this even better than the Shine Therapy styler.  I still recommend the Shine Therapy, but this is a sleeker, more modern product, and it is an improvement.  The switches are on the side, rather than the top of the styler.  Some people didn&#x27;t like the placement of the switches on the Shine Therapy because it was easy to bump them.  I don&#x27;t know what they were talking about; I never had a problem with that.  Nevertheless, that problem is solved with this product.  Both stylers can be set to temperatures as low as 300F, and both have a turbo function.  Both heat up fast, but the Keratin Therapy doesn&#x27;t require the user to lock in the chosen temperature.  It also doesn&#x27;t require an unlock before powering down.  That&#x27;s two less button pushes per use.  Hey, time is important, right?  The display is easier for me to read on the Keratin Therapy.  The plates meet better with the Keratin Therapy, though this is nit-picking; the plates are fine on both.  This model, however, is lighter and easier to hold than the Shine Therapy, so I give it five stars.  Oh, yes, it also has a lock feature to hold the plates together for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the two, you can shop for price or shop for functionality.  I gave the Shine Therapy four stars because of the silly claim of infusing it with avocado oil.  I&#x27;m not going to bother removing a star for the claims of keratin infusion on this item.  You already know keratin is part of your hair, and hair can burn.  I don&#x27;t know why Remington tries to make their products sound like they can perform magic.  They don&#x27;t need to do that.  I&#x27;ve bought more expensive styling irons, and none of them were as good as a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have straight hair, you can learn how to use a styling iron by watching your stylist, or check out youtube.  It&#x27;s amazing how versatile styling irons are, and this one is first class.wever, is lighter and easier to hold than the Shine Therapy, so I give it five stars.

            <li> I already use a Remington straightener.  This model works better but I am not sure if it is not simply due to the fact the older one is on the decline since I have been using it for two years.&lt;br /&gt;This model straigtened my hair more quickly and did a nicer job.  Quicker is important to me.  It has a lock feature that I like to have and it also has an automatic shut off--it shuts off after 60 minutes but I wish it was less than that as a safety feature in case I ever forget to shut it off. I always unplug my straighteners when I am done, but it is always good to have a safety feature.&lt;br /&gt;I think this unit runs rather hot.  When I first turned it on, it was at a default setting of 375 degrees.  I use a higher setting on my original one so I also tried 410.  Either way, you run the risk of burning yourself with those settings--I ultimately moved to 345. As you run your hair sections through the plates, a LOT of heat is generated and you need to careful about burning hands, scalp, fingers, ears, etc.  In summer months it is a lot of extra heat that may cause you to want to jump back in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;I am very skeptical about the sensor feature.  Sections of hair pass through the blades so quickly I don&#x27;t see how it could possibly adjust so quickly.  I am also skeptical about infusing Keratin into my hair by using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Hair definitely does not glide through the plates as I am used to.  In fact, there is some resistance while passing it over sections of hair and I hope that is not damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the straightener.  I did not give 5 stars because of having to be extra careful handling it and because it does not allow hair to pass through as smoothly as would like.</li>
            <li> So I love that this adjusts to your hair.  We have all used a flat iron by now.  What I liked about this Remington S8590 model is that it heats up quickly, it turns itself off when not being used.  I also loved that it adjusted the heat level to the damange level of your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t move through your hair like a ceramic plate does, but I am willing to trade off this glide for a flat iron that will keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with Zimba&#x27;s hair, my hair can be described as a Lion&#x27;s mane. What do I mean by that? Thin, frizzy hair, not exactly curly, though not straight either and with a tendency to occupy three times its volume. It has the advantage of being super malleable, I can do whatever I want with it and the disadvantage of getting ruined by just whispering at it. That means, I have a love-hate relationship with hair straighteners since I was twelve. I love how my hair looks when I use them, shiny, tidy, easy to handle, but on the other hand, use it twice and my hair starts to show all the signs of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener has a few key features that help with that:&lt;br /&gt;- The Keratin Therapy Bath: Helps the hair look shiny and keeps it protected, though I think it gives the straightner an odd and a little nasty smell when heated.&lt;br /&gt;- The fact that one can control the temperature: Super easy to determine which temperature to use to straighten your hair, great for people like me that have hair that is thin and easy to straighten but also easy to damage. Granted, using it in the lowest setting can make the straightening process a little longer and a little less effective, but it is worth it for every day use if you don&#x27;t want to ruin your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I used it a  couple of times and so far, it doesn&#x27;t look like it is damaging my hair too much, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature, that it automatically shuts off after a while, just in case you forget and it also has a locking mechanism that makes burning yourself less likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this, so here is her review.  This straightener works very well.  It is a great product at a great price.  I like that you can change the heat setting and that it has automatic shut-off.  Some other good features are that it has a lock to keep the straightener shut and the cord is not too long.  Great for storage and travel.  I have been using this for a few weeks, and it does a very nice job with my hair.  I don&#x27;t know that I see a difference from the keratin, but the Remington S8590 works just as well as my more expensive straightener.  The only downside is that it does not move smoothly over my hair, there is some resistence.  So far, I don&#x27;t see any damage from that, but I am not sure long term what that means to my hair.  I have never had a straightener do that.  If you are looking for a product that has the features of a very expensive straightener, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> the best straighter ive owned so far!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I had an expensive one that didn&#x27;t work as well.  I&#x27;m happy I chose this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very good Hair straightener,it does the job well and has several different heat levels. It has a nice feel in your hands its not too big, or small-love the swivle cord it also heats up incredibly fast and gets really, really hot. I cant say much for the keratin therapy since I have not been using it very long all in all good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron &amp;lt;3 it&#x27;s amazing i got for me and for my sisters and in laws they all love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its the best remington i&#x27;ve tried ever!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I found out about this thanks to a glowing recommendation from Good HouseKeeping decided to give this a try.  I&#x27;ve been using this flatiron for a month and love it! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected a miracle or something, but not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra money.  Seems like just a run of the mill product.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price, performs as expected! Great hair iron! Would recommend to everyone I could! Does not burn hair, heats quckily and has a great display and form!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> took 2 years back and still works fine.</li>
            <li> Just received but really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after doing a friend&#x27;s hair for her using her Remington straightener. She just had a standard one (a $25 or $30 model recently purchased) but I was really impressed with how sleek and soft her hair was after. So I did a little research and ordered this model with the keratin because I have thick, slightly frizzy wavy/curly hair that damages fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed when I turned it on is that the buttons are sort of recessed into the side, which was really nice since I wasn&#x27;t actually turning the straightener off or changing the temp while doing my hair. It also heated up very quickly. I did noticed a slight acrid smell when it first turned on, and it disappeared after a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned on the sensor for the damage control, and set it to 340 degrees based on the hair type chart that came with the product. It did take a couple of passes with each section of hair to straighten but it left it very silky and soft, and so fair it has stayed that way which I am very happy about! Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight that well. I had used &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Conditioner&amp;#34; the day before when I washed my hair, and that product is supposed to help protect from heat damage, among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensor strip in the panel didn&#x27;t really seem to affect the process; only once at the very end I felt it catch on a couple strands of hair but I was pulling the straightener down at a weird angle so that may have contributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the $30 I paid for it, and so far I am quite happy with it!</li>
            <li> Right on time, my hair was in danger of being cut off so that I could from scratch. First time I used it, I was pleased.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was really excited about this straightener/flat iron and all of it&#x27;s features. Unfortunately I had to send the first one back as it was not functioning properly. Amazon was great about processing my refund and I ended up purchasing different one.</li>
            <li> I love it, does a great job quickly. Be careful it gets smoking hot.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener!! I was very happy with my old Remington Straightener but wanted an upgrade after 5 years. It has lovely design and does the job well. Adjustable temp is great.</li>
            <li> I had a CHI for 2 1/2 years but it broke two months ago. I did a lot of research on affordable flat irons. Finally after reading alove the reviews, comparisons etc. I bit the bullet and bought this flat iron. I really like it. It heats up in 30 seconds, the digital heat setting is awesome, the swivel cord is great and the auto-shutoff is so handy. Only thing is it pulls on the hair a little but that is to be expected when purchasing a $40 flat iron. I really like it overall and will update this review if I have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> This Remington straightener keeps my curly hair under control. I like the temperature sensor on the face of it as well as the fact that the controls are on the side. The smart sensor  turns the heat down when it senses the hair is damaged. This is a good reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> Left my hair shiny and soft. I like this straightener, it did the trick without damaging my hair too much. It is not overly expensive, so I would say to try this one before you go and buy a CHI or an expensive salon one. It worked well for my frizzy curly hair, so I would try this one first.</li>
            <li> well i had bought a conair infinity straightener at walmart and loved it but after one day of use it stopped working. so i returned it and paid the extra 10 bucks and bought this one. i used it after a shower after letting my hair dry naturally. i added a little thermal control serum to my hair and turned the straightener on at the lowest temp. i sectioned off the bottom hair and after going over it again and again for 10 mins it was finally straight enought for me to go onto the next section. i kept increasing the temp until i saw smoke but still it didnt seam to help with the frizz or the ends which i just got trimmed. i wasnt sure if it was just me until i read the other review. will be bringing back to walmart and trying a new one.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine and unique product. I specifically like the features of automatic heat control and the Keratin protein infused plates that provide essential vitamins. Not too pricey either.</li>
            <li> Because it was awesome and new and stuff. And im just gonna keep writing cause its telling me to because apparently a 5 star rating isnt enough credit for the hair straightener, it requires me to praise it with an essay.</li>
            <li> the Remington S8590 Keratin Therapy Straightener with Smart Sensor is amazing I just love this product it&#x27;s money well spent</li>
            <li> I finally found a flat iron that does what I need it to do (straighten)!  My Andis eventually just stopped straightening my hair so I have been searching for the right one for at least a year now.  I did try the Chi...Was not at all impressed.  Tried another Andis (Not sure which one) and that failed me also.  I broke down and bought the Remington only because it was available for a lightning deal.  All I can say is THANK YOU LIGHTNING DEAL!  This flat iron works miracles.  I have gone days without having to flat iron my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> this ok i like it  verry good and fast thanks</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightner I have owned !My hair looks silky and healthy ! The other comments that say it&#x27;s a European plug I don&#x27;t get because the one I got is a USA plug ! Worth the money</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly. Works great. I love it! You won&#x27;t need the extra boost of heat unless your hair is especially curly and unruly. Very pleased. Worth the $50</li>
            <li> I would buy a gift to my mother, who remained haunted since I began using the first day. I hope soon to buy another piece</li>
            <li> The S8590 is an excellent product.  I already have the Shine Therapy S8500 model and have found it to be a reliable product which performs well.  Out of the box, the S8590 is similar.  The S8590 is a different color, is infused with keratin, and heats to 450 degrees instead of the S8500&#x27;s 430 maximum, but otherwise very much like the similarly-priced 8500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a 1 inch ceramic plate.  It heats very quickly, getting up to 400°F in about 40 seconds.  There are numerous heat settings, ranging from 300 through 450 degrees. The controls are easy to work and see.  There is a power button, a hinge lock, a temperature control, a display, and a heat sensor indicator light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is over 5 feet long and swivel style, which is convenient.  I believe every Remington straightener my family has owned has had a cord of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hinge lock is great, to help prevent little (or big) hands from accidental burns.  Also, after 60 minutes the product shuts itself ff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The S8590 also comes with Remington&#x27;s excellent 4 year warranty.  I actually had a Remington straightener (S9520) fail after a couple of years of (almost daily) use.  Remington&#x27;s parent company, Spectrum, took back the faulty product and replaced it with a brand new one.  That cost me about $7 in shipping, but still much less than replacing the product on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference from the keratin, or how long the infusion lasts on the ceramic, but the product is very good and does an excellent job.  I would say it is well worth the slightly higher price versus an entry-level product.</li>
            <li> I gotta say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I found after having my kids that my hair had lost a lot of moisture and I now have a strong wave/curl. It&#x27;s also very coarse. I&#x27;ve tried the smoothing products, and they work to a certain degree. After applying product and drying, I used this. Like a flat iron, it smoothed/straightened my hair. It did last all day, even in rain. It didn&#x27;t burn the hair, and I didn&#x27;t see residue from the product building on the heat mechanism. The iron is very lightweight and easy to manipulate. Doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room for travel either. Recommended.</li>
            <li> bien el producto llego en menos de 20 dias  aqui a venezuela lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> I like this straightener. It is much better than the discount store/drugstore ones I&#x27;ve tried. It gets very hot and the plates don&#x27;t damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have a different Remington model straightener that I like better. This one is sleek but not quite as heavy. The button placement is better on this one than the other one. The buttons are on the side and out of the way on this one. On my other Remington one the buttons are so conveniently-placed on the outside that it&#x27;s hard not to push them by mistake. However that one has a button-lock feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a strip down the center of one of the plates that&#x27;s supposed to sense the hair and automatically adjust the temperature to make sure it&#x27;s not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I don&#x27;t begin to understand the technology behind this appliance and I don&#x27;t know if it is really \\&quot;infused\\&quot; with conditioners or not. But I do know it works well and does not damage my hair like some other ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sides are a little sharper-edged than I&#x27;d like. I prefer sides that are slightly rounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell whether the Keratin infusion and smart sensor are anything more than gimmicks, but as a ceramic flat iron it gets the job done, if not quite as smoothly as higher priced units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, the iron tends to run a bit hot.  I set it lower than I do with a more expensive 1/2\\&quot; flat iron, both in order not to damage my hair, but also as the larger size of this iron is more likely to come in contact with one&#x27;s ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference between this and more expensive irons is how smoothly they glide through the hair.  This one pulls a bit, Keratin notwithstanding.  On the other hand, the function of a flat iron is to get your hair smooth, and this definitely does the trick.  A good budget option for hair straightening and smoothing.</li>
            <li> Weird stone strip rips my hair out sometimes. Auto shut off and temp controls are great.</li>
            <li> Gift for my wife. She loves it</li>
            <li> It works perfectly I love it..but the metal plates that straighten and the straightener are far apart and it pulls my hair a lot! I would recommend but be careful</li>
            <li> I started using the Remington S8590 about a week ago. Until then I was using a [[ASIN:B003V249L0 Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington S9500 and S8590 are essentially the same aside from the fact that the S8590 adds Keratin and the Smart Sensor. While I can&#x27;t really tell if the Smart Sensor is making a difference, I think the Keratin is working. Why? Well, since I replaced my S9500 with the S8590 I&#x27;ve been getting quite a few compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks. Go figure! A flat iron making my hair look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Remington flat irons feel great in my hand. Well balanced and sturdy. With the Keratin shine bonus, I&#x27;ll definitely be using my S8590 daily and save the S9500 for travel.</li>
            <li> I like the controls, the visual look of this product, how it feels in the hand and how quickly it heats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin fine hair currently with lots of split ends.  By the time I am near the end of my hair I feel like the plates of the iron are snagging on my hair.  [[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\\&quot;]]  did a much better job of moving through my hair without snagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried changing the temperature but still had snagging problems.</li>
            <li> Some hair is easier to straighten than others and if your hair is the difficult.  I am lucky in that my hair straightes with ease so I can not say that the Remington is the best ever at straighting, what I can say is this product warms up quickley and shuts off on its own after some time so you dont have to worry about starting a fire if left on.  I have used more expensive products than this one and the Remington holds up to ones that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> The Remington Straightener fits well in the hand and runs though thick long hair well.  (My daughter uses this product)  However, the smart sensor doesn&#x27;t seem entirely accurate as I&#x27;ve noticed frizzed sections of hair which happen when the temperature of the straightener is too high.  This is happening to the new growth hair which tends to be finer and more fragile along the temples, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this is an inexpensive straightener and to expect it to work as well as one twice its price is probably unreasonable.  The straightener has lasted well for several months which is a good sign.  So, with the cliched caveat that you are getting what you are paying for, I recommend this product if this is the amount you want to spend and you are attentive about avoiding new growth hair.  Otherwise, you may want to keep on looking.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and I need a straighter that I can use very hot.  The Remington product warped, it looks almost like part of the product melted.  And, yes I know how to use a straighter.</li>
            <li> The product picture in the instruction is not the same of the product I received. Couldn&#x27;t know how to set up the temperature and no place to show the current temperature too. I really need it but I don&#x27;t know should I keep it.</li>
            <li> Amazing straightener, got it at half the price on black Friday. I have never had hair so nice! I&#x27;m so glad I took the leap on this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it to straighten.  I bought it to style with.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the straightner or my hair or my not knowing just how to make one work on my hair like my hairdressor does</li>
            <li> This was a good gift idea and the recipient loves it.  Have already recommended to her friends who have bought one too.</li>
            <li> this was a gift.  The price was like 20 dollars cheaper than in Walmart or Brandsmart USA. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Good product 100% positive. Is easy to use, very useful, I am very happy with this product, I recommend to buy it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for several weeks now and find that it is only so-so. I&#x27;ve reverted back to my salon purchased straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Small&lt;br /&gt;-Automatic shut off after 60 min&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;-Swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;-\\&quot;Damage\\&quot; Sensor&lt;br /&gt;-Lock to keep plates together during storage&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple heat settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Small can feel to take more time with longer hair&lt;br /&gt;-Do \\&quot;Damage Controls\\&quot; really work?&lt;br /&gt;-Does it really \\&quot;infuse Keratin? Into my hair?&lt;br /&gt;-Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to glide through the plates like I&#x27;m used to with my other straightener&lt;br /&gt;-Heat pads close to edge making it very easy to burn oneself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most the PROS can be found on any straightener on the market. The \\&quot;Damage Sensor\\&quot; and \\&quot;Keratin\\&quot; seem more like a gimmick to me at this point. Because this one was harder to slide my hair through, it took me longer to use it.</li>
            <li> Having thick curly hair, I appreciated the strength of the product. It straightened my hair faster than my old straightener and didn&#x27;t seem to leave as many fried ends. The only critique I have, however, is that the plates aren&#x27;t smooth ceramic, like I&#x27;m used to. There is a metal segment running through the middle of the plates (I&#x27;m assuming that has something to do with the &#x27;Keratin Therapy&#x27;), and so my hair would sometimes get stuck in the ridges and the hair strands would break. Other than that, this is a great product and I would recommend it to a friend. As far as the damage done to my hair over time, I can&#x27;t say that I notice a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order a used item, but this was definitely used and out of its original packaging.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Recently had to return another Remington model that quit after one use.  I use it to process my keratin treatment. Heats up quickly and does not pull my hair. My only qualm is that is does not lie flat on the counter and I do not see how you can lock it shut.</li>
            <li> This is my third, over the years, and perhaps the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a guy, one needs this size or smaller for most cuts.  I can style the hair in about 2 minutes, and keep the frizz and wavy stuff away all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all flat irons of this size, one needs to learn how to use it, to avoid a 1960&#x27;s \\&quot;Troll Doll\\&quot; effect  ( not understanding that? Look it up! LOL). We can not ALL look like the star of the original \\&quot;Footloose\\&quot; with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the road, this will fix being out in the rain, or high humidity events, and get you looking polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past 5 years or so, I have seen more Remington flat irons on TV and film sets than any other brand, which is telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit has a smart sensor to reduce heat if you over process the hair ( probably not an issue for guys, but might be for gal&#x27;s with longer hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is high-end, and the addition of Keratin in a flat iron is welcome, if one has frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with other Remington&#x27;s - a flat iron is multi-use for guys.  Press those pants, and shirts on the road, and a tablecloth for a family celebration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great item!</li>
            <li> Not perfect but nearly.  My wife has wavy hair, she sometimes likes her hair completely straight, other times very curly.  When she needs her hair straight this does the job without making her work too hard at it.</li>
            <li> I have curly, very thick hair. I wanted something that works at one swing and more importantly something that does not spoil the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I have found what i am looking for. I love this straightener, it is very sleek, light weight ,easy to use and it has this keratin technology incorporated into the plates which protects the hair from breakage and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a month now, previously i would just go with my curls and hesitate to style my hair every time because i was afraid it would damage my hair but now i can do whatever i want.&lt;br /&gt;I already recommended my friends about this product. I am just too happy i found this one!</li>
            <li> The conditioning works fantastically but the sensor part is a little confusing I&#x27;m not quite sure if it is actually sensing and adapting to how much moisture is in my hair. But it is a great product and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This tool gets extremely hot but if you are careful and your hair can handle the heat, you will LOVE the results.  My hair is very curly from the root down and extremely thick.  The length is also below my shoulders.  I was able to straighten my hair in just 15 minutes and my hair shows no sign of breakage and absolutely no frizz (even with high humidity today).  I straightened my hair in layers and it only took one pass to go from very curly to completely straight.  I was also able to achieve a small flip at the bottom of my hair so it doesn&#x27;t stick straight.  I am 50 years old and I have spent a lifetime using a variety of hot curlers, a selection of straightening irons, curling irons of every size as well as chasing hope with every new tool and hair product that has been invented.  No tool has ever really been hot enough until now.  I have found what I have been searching for after 40 years.  This product does exactly what it says it will do.  It does it quickly and it does it very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome just pulls my hair a bit im in love with it</li>
            <li> Overall it works amazingly! plus did not leave any unpleasant odor on my hair!</li>
            <li> Very Good product for price</li>
            <li> This flat iron is awesome.  It does what it promise and some.  I love the heat control feature.  I will order this again if need be.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased by Remington to date!</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this straightener after having read through several reviews.  Unfortunately I had a few issues in which I decided to return this item.  1. The top silver finish bubbled as I used the straightener (apparently the heat was melting the finish as I used it to curl my hair).  2.  This does not sit very flat or safely on the countertop; it constantly wants to roll over since it&#x27;s rounded on the top and bottom.  3.  The box this came in was not a Remington box but a plain white box with a barcode label on the end (leading me to believe that it was a refurbished item).  4.  I did not see any of the smooth Keratin Therapy results that this iron is supposed to do; it&#x27;s just like every other iron I have used except the piece in the middle is not smooth and snags your hair.  Overall this iron is decent for the money and will provide you with the basic functions of straightening your hair.  However I did feel like it could have lasted longer than a single use.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my niece, she and her mom love it!!  My niece has very thick course hair and after her first use, her hair was smooth and beautiful.  They said it heats up very fast!!  All what I love in a straightener, heats up fast and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but this thing did not heat up at all.</li>
            <li> I used a CHI for about 10 years because it was the only thing that would straighten my wavy hair and not have it frizz back up in a few minutes. This gives a similar result, but works much faster.</li>
            <li> Everithing was in grate conditions</li>
            <li> Used it infrequently for about 8 months with no issue, until one day stopped working. I expected it to last longer, especially considering the fact that I barely used it in the first 6 months I had it.</li>
            <li> It Works like the one used in the Beutysaloon!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Hi there - I am waiting for my third Remington S8590 Straightener.  I would be interested to hear how many others have noticed a very strong smell coming from this product.  It is almost a toxic smell.  My 2nd one started to bubble on the top.  The plates have also lifted on it.  Remington is kind enough to send a replacement (on the way) - If this one has the same toxic smell - there is a huge problem - Ive notice several other reviews have commented on the &#x27;nasty smell&#x27; - but I want to highlight it to make sure it isn&#x27;t a health issue.  In the end, it does a great job - but I&#x27;m not going to risk my health to have nice hair.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Heat up really fast. The size makes it easy to handle when I&#x27;m doing curling. straightens hairs well.</li>
            <li> Hair straightener works very well, and doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that they can sometimes get when they heat up.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my hair looks like Bozo the clowns so I need to calm it down before going out in public. This is a pretty good straightener for that. It straightens great the only problem I have is the iron won&#x27;t go thru my hair as easy as I would like I have to put power behind it and if I am in a hurry which I usually am I get upset but it def does the job :)</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using a straightener on my unruly, curly hair. For the money, it works well. It heated quickly, has three temperature settings and is easy to handle. I appreciate the swiveling cord, which keeps it from falling off my small bathroom counter. My only criticism is that upon closing the iron, there is a noticeable gap, so it&#x27;s important to squeeze firmly to get the hair straight. Then again, it&#x27;s not a $100+ model, so I&#x27;ll forgive Remington and gladly keep the extra $50 in my wallet. Recommended as a bargain alternative.</li>
            <li> As the sad owner of fine, frizzy hair, I&#x27;m always looking for a straightener that can tame my unruly locks without damage. I love that this straightener has temperature choices, my favorite being 340 degrees. My hair gets straightened and stays that way, even when the air is humid. Afterward, I&#x27;ll often use electric curlers to give more body to my hair -- yes, a time-consuming, yet essential step to give me the confidence to be seen in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener grips well and does not have any edges, nooks or crannies that pull out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The default temperature is 375 degrees, so I have to remember to dial it down to the next lower setting, which is 340 degrees. It can be set as low as 300 or as high as 450, but I can&#x27;t imagine whose hair could withstand that temperature. As the iron is heating, the blue temperature setting blinks until the desired temperature is reached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with every straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned, there is a tendency for the iron to tip over on its side, so I&#x27;ve discovered a fabulous \\&quot;stand\\&quot; for it -- just a cheap metal napkin holder that I got from Target. (Please see the photo above.) It protects my bathroom counter top from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first straightener I&#x27;ve had with an on-off switch and I have to remember to press the button. (Not a product flaw, but a character flaw.) No worries, though, since it heats up to the desired temperature in seconds.</li>
            <li> I own so many flat iron straighteners - heard a review on this one on the Today Show - decided - maybe this one would be the holy grail of all flat irons &amp; IT IS!!!!! Heats very quickly &amp; evenly &amp; truly cuts down on the frizz I usually get in this hot, humid DC area! Just ordered a 2nd one for our home in Northern FL!</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping I could use it to straighten out my hair without a lot of hassle, but I ended up being rather disappointed with it.  For one thing, the smart sensor didn&#x27;t really work as well as I thought it would, and no matter how much I turned the initial setting down, it still felt too hot for me.  Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference from the keratin-infused plates; my hair still breaks and frizzes a lot.  Perhaps others might have better luck with this product, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this after hearing good things about it when my last flat iron crapped out. My hair is pretty seriously damaged and this seems to keep any new damage from forming. I will say if your hair is badly damaged, turn off the heat sensor, from what I can tell it turns up the heat for the damaged parts to get it straight, but will actually damage your hair more.</li>
            <li> First - delivery was AWESOME!  Came WAY before I thought it would!&lt;br /&gt;Second - This straightener works like a charm.  Very easy to use, heats up very quickly and straightens on the first try.  My hair is very curly and FRIZZY.  Not much of a learning curve here - after the first use, I looked like I had just stepped out of my salon.  Very happy with this choice - this is my third straightener and it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer after using it at one of my girlfriends houses. After one swipe my hair was straighter than it had already been (I had straightened my hair that night with my Chi). As a girl whose been using Chi&#x27;s strictly  for 9 years to find a straightener that was such a reasonable price and better was amazing. I have thick, long, wavy/curly hair and this makes my hair pin straight, silky, and soft.</li>
