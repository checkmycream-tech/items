            <li>The handy sensitive brush gives me a wonderful massage too, it feels really great.</li>
            <li>They call this one the handy size.</li>
            <li>, This is a nice size, don&#x27;t let the &#x27;handy&#x27; fool you.</li>
            <li>I also own this brush in Pocket size.</li>
            <li>We own 4 or 5 of these brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought the brush for my son when he is much older (40) and he called me telling he was rarely impressed by anything</li>
            <li>It shipped very quickly and arrived in a beautiful retro box with a brush to clean it and instructions on use and care.</li>
            <li>Large upfront cost, but great performance and longevity.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush, have been using these since 1985.</li>
            <li>I love this brush-</li>
            <li>I love the feel and strength of this brush.  </li>
            <li>It is everything and more as advertised.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>We fell in love with the Mason Pearson Boar Bristle Hair Brush while in England attending the Cruft&#x27;s Dog Show.</li>
            <li>I love using the brush....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Better, the brush is fantastic....</li>
            <li>it is more comfortable and easier to use brushing your hair than you could believe.  </li>
            <li>Best money spent!</li>
            <li>Mason Pearson hairbrush is genuine.</li>
            <li>but that the brush was more than &#x27;fantastic&#x27;, for the first time his hair looks really great every time he brushed it.</li>
            <li>You also get a cleaner brush that you run thru the Mason Pearson brush to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>The seller was great-received my brush 2 day early-they responded to my e-mail on my special delivery request.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money I spent on this brush it should make my scalp and hair feel great.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it feels so good brushing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Grate quality and love the box it was shipped in, very retro</li>
            <li>We are breeders &amp; exhibitors of top winning Australian Shepherds.</li>
            <li>Amazon refunded my money, however please be aware to check the box and brush to make sure that it&#x27;s a real Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would enjoy a hairbrush so much.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s larger than my &#x27;handy&#x27; size.</li>
            <li>It is a lot to spend for a brush, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty to see if I would really like a boar bristle brush and looked at the ones they had - no comparison, by far the Mason Pearson is much better.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality brush which is light weight and which will last for a lifetime I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>After a great deal of hoopla, the only way to be certain it is a real Mason Pearson is to send it direct to them which I did.  </li>
            <li>This &#x27;sensitive&#x27; brush has 6 rings of &#x27;fine&#x27; bristle tufts.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and takes a bit of adjustment to get used to, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I love all of them and they all give me different results.</li>
            <li>This is the only brush that stimulates my scalp and does not pull out more hair.</li>
            <li>The sale to us was handled exactly as described and promised.  </li>
            <li>However, the brush is well made and good for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>If you want to really care for your hair, a mason pearson brush and comb are a must.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle yet invigorating.</li>
            <li>It costs much money but it worths.</li>
            <li>So gentle on my scalp and my hair shines after using it.</li>
            <li>The one I received was indeed the real thing the email below.  </li>
            <li>So did what I spend so much money end up being real boar as opposed to a mix or synthetic</li>
            <li>I can easily brush it out and condition it with this brush after it is dry and has tangled without tearing or damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>Was using the nylon/boar bristle combo but in recent years moved to total boar bristle for a more gentle scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>I think brushing my hair with my Mason Pearson brush will be my new addiction!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It calms down my fly away hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem as dry when I brush it for several minutes.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>I have not brushed my hair for many years, I was only able to use a wide tooth comb when wet and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>Their product arrived two weeks early, coming from England to Miami, Florida, USA.</li>
            <li>I decided to replace her old brush with a new one as a Christmas present.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are an old British tradition for when a young man turns 21, a life-long gift (that&#x27;s how well the brushes are made), a rite of adult passage.</li>
            <li>She loves her new brush and can&#x27;t say enough about it.  </li>
            <li>All of them make my hair shiny and soft, but this one actually volumizes my hair as well.</li>
            <li>Third Mason Pearson brush since early 70&#x27;s purchase while a student in London.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite brush, have been using these since 1985.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I have super-fine wavy/curly hair which tangles at the back while it dries. I can easily brush it out and condition it with this brush after it is dry and has tangled without tearing or damaging my hair. I have not brushed my hair for many years, I was only able to use a wide tooth comb when wet and well conditioned.  The handy sensitive brush gives me a wonderful massage too, it feels really great. I think brushing my hair with my Mason Pearson brush will be my new addiction! This is a high quality brush which is light weight and which will last for a lifetime I&#x27;m sure. If you want to really care for your hair, a mason pearson brush and comb are a must. It shipped very quickly and arrived in a beautiful retro box with a brush to clean it and instructions on use and care.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Was using the nylon/boar bristle combo but in recent years moved to total boar bristle for a more gentle scalp treatment. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> it was a present to my friend, who always wanted mason pearson brush. she said it is good and she likes it but there are other brushes that are comparable for much less...</li>
            <li> My wife has had this type of brush for as long as I can remember (43 years).  I decided to replace her old brush with a new one as a Christmas present.  Now, I a hero.  She loves her new brush and can&#x27;t say enough about it.  She just has trouble spending money.  So, I spent it for her.  $143 dollars is a lot for a brush!  But, I&#x27;d do it again in a heart beat.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great company.  Their product arrived two weeks early, coming from England to Miami, Florida, USA.</li>
            <li> It calms down my fly away hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem as dry when I brush it for several minutes. Best money spent!</li>
            <li> I love this brush-I have short hair and it feels so good brushing my hair.  This &#x27;sensitive&#x27; brush has 6 rings of &#x27;fine&#x27; bristle tufts. They call this one the handy size. But it&#x27;s not a purse size-it&#x27;s bigger than that. It&#x27;s confusing the way they explain the sizes, This is a nice size, don&#x27;t let the &#x27;handy&#x27; fool you. my sister has the Medium size &#x27;Small Extra&#x27;B2 (it&#x27;s not small at all)- 7 &#x27;stiff&#x27; bristle tufts and it&#x27;s larger than my &#x27;handy&#x27; size. It is a lot to spend for a brush, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;ve read that some people have had their Mason Pearson for over 20 years.  Before I bought this brush I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty to see if I would really like a boar bristle brush and looked at the ones they had - no comparison, by far the Mason Pearson is much better. You also get a cleaner brush that you run thru the Mason Pearson brush to keep it clean.  This brush does not pull out your hairs.  I have a dry scalp and it helps with getting rid of the flakes. The seller was great-received my brush 2 day early-they responded to my e-mail on my special delivery request. I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would enjoy a hairbrush so much. This brush feels great. it&#x27;s gentle yet invigorating. My hair looks noticeably shinier when I use it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush. . I am very pleased with my purchase. It costs much money but it worths. I will do it again.</li>
            <li> I had to return the item because it is a lot of money for what I thought wasn&#x27;t the value...</li>
            <li> A GREAT BRUSH AT A FAIR PRICE.</li>
            <li> So gentle on my scalp and my hair shines after using it. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush was rather expensive.  However, the brush is well made and good for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Would probably get five stars after break in period. Grate quality and love the box it was shipped in, very retro</li>
            <li> After a great deal of hoopla, the only way to be certain it is a real Mason Pearson is to send it direct to them which I did.  Whoever stated that the people in NY can verify it is incorrect since they told me that specifically.  The one I received was indeed the real thing the email below.  Unfortunate that I cut all my hair off. Now to get it back from England!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Your Mason Pearson hairbrush is genuine. The handle is plastic not wood. The hole is present  intentionally, to allow the air - cushion to operate effectively.\\&quot;aw had multi-color bristles, these are all black.  So did what I spend so much money end up being real boar as opposed to a mix or synthetic I have no idea.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and strength of this brush.  It is everything and more as advertised. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its ok. For the amount of money I spent on this brush it should make my scalp and hair feel great. It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The massage you get on your scalp is addicting! I don&#x27;t want to stop brushing! I have several boar brushes...I love all of them and they all give me different results. All of them make my hair shiny and soft, but this one actually volumizes my hair as well. I can brush and go! No bed-head! I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and after reviewing the package and serial number it turned out to be a fake. Amazon refunded my money, however please be aware to check the box and brush to make sure that it&#x27;s a real Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li> My female hair is thinning at my hairline (sob!) and all other brushes are too rough for my sensitive scalp and hair. This is the only brush that stimulates my scalp and does not pull out more hair. It is very soft and takes a bit of adjustment to get used to, but worth every penny! I also own this brush in Pocket size.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> Third Mason Pearson brush since early 70&#x27;s purchase while a student in London. Large upfront cost, but great performance and longevity.</li>
            <li> We are breeders &amp; exhibitors of top winning Australian Shepherds. We fell in love with the Mason Pearson Boar Bristle Hair Brush while in England attending the Cruft&#x27;s Dog Show. We use them as finishing brushes for our show dogs. We spritz the coat with water then brush the coat down neatly just before entering the show ring for judging. We own 4 or 5 of these brushes. We can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are an old British tradition for when a young man turns 21, a life-long gift (that&#x27;s how well the brushes are made), a rite of adult passage. I bought the brush for my son when he is much older (40) and he called me telling he was rarely impressed by anything but that the brush was more than &#x27;fantastic&#x27;, for the first time his hair looks really great every time he brushed it. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The sale to us was handled exactly as described and promised.  Better, the brush is fantastic....I love using the brush....it is more comfortable and easier to use brushing your hair than you could believe.  Please keep this quality of brush in stock since there are so few products of this level of excellence in our world.</li>
            <li> It does everything they advertise it does.  I waited 4 years to buy one due to the exorbitant price.  I had to save up. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
