            <li>but some weren&#x27;t as fresh as if I was to buy it from a store but VERY HAPPY</li>
            <li>I have used many deodorants/antiperspirants over the years, and never have I experienced these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you like smelling nice.</li>
            <li>Great to put on right after a shower.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance and he&#x27;s never smelled better.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Degree antiperspirant &amp; deodorant combo.  </li>
            <li>Works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the odor protection.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent too.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than others i have used for these reasons, goes on the skin</li>
            <li>and I could have bought more</li>
            <li>I am at the gym most days and am a pretty good sweater</li>
            <li>It just works so well from keeping me dry to the awesome scent.</li>
            <li>caking, has a pleasant smell but not too much smell, works all day for me against odor.</li>
            <li>In my experience, Degree Adrenaline is a very effective antiperspirant, working better than many other brands that I tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Degree often sends out free samples of their deodorants.</li>
            <li>The first of the four sticks worked fine.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh and manly are the three words I&#x27;d use to describe it.   </li>
            <li>I bought this in quanitity because you can&#x27;t find it in many places at the stores where I live.</li>
            <li>To top it off, I opened a new one, and the raising mechanism does not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most deodorants/antiperspirants don&#x27;t last the full day.</li>
            <li>He says it keeps him drier longer and doesn&#x27;t smell funny after he has been sweating.</li>
            <li>When I wear this specific type, the V-12,  I can smell (refreshing citrus)</li>
            <li>I thought this was a solid deal on deodorant and the reviews seemed to be OK.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty steep</li>
            <li>so I have struggled to find a strong enough deodorant to carry me through the day.</li>
            <li>Because I fear that this product may no longer be produced, I bought a rather large amount.  </li>
            <li>If you order this, you will NOT be getting the \\&quot;Absolute</li>
            <li>Thanks and I will look forward to your reply.</li>
            <li>While I feel that other deodorants may smell better, I continue to use this product because it works so well.</li>
            <li>He likes it better than any other deodorant he has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After many years of using Old Spice, I kind of got tired of their scents and decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>So i bought it and after the first few days I had to admit that this was my new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had better results in terms of sweating ALOT less.</li>
            <li>but I guess its better than paying 50% less for cheaper stuff</li>
            <li>We love this long lasting Degree.</li>
            <li>until this new Degree deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>until this new Degree deodorant.</li>
            <li>After trying this product out for a couple of months, I have noticed that it wears off after 12+ hours and does not hold-up well overnight, especially when you hit the gym first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This has worked out to be better than several other deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried (Axe Dry, Old Spice High Endurance, SpeedStick Active off the top of my head)</li>
            <li>Old Spice was \\&quot;it\\&quot; for him</li>
            <li>They send travel sizes that are more than enough to use a few times and decide wether you like it or not.</li>
            <li>you can imagine, I am extremely disenchanted with the product at this point in time, and based on my experience I would recommend that you take a good hard look at your QC procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hubby has used various Old Spice deodorants for many years now and it has been his usual brand.</li>
            <li>Works all day long, no matter how much i sweat...</li>
            <li>Definitely my new daily stick.</li>
            <li>Only ever so often would he even try something new.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for having this product at such a low price.</li>
            <li>Definitely try this one out and leave your old \\&quot;Old</li>
            <li>Degree is the first deodorant/anti perspirant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor and sweat protection.</li>
            <li>It goes on slightly cake-y (as do most antiperspirants, so no surprise there) but doesn&#x27;t flake or turn into a mess underneath your arms.</li>

            <li> To him, that was a big plus, as well as staying drier much longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I was looking for different brand than the previous old spice.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this out until my return window closed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - just buy the product you&#x27;ll actually be receiving instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I started to apply it today, and the last half inch came right out of the applicator and fell to the floor, useless now and what a waste.</li>
            <li> He said that usually, when he sweats while working or working out, by the time he is done the deodorant and his armpits smell kinda gross.</li>
            <li> when he uses other deodorants, he comes home all stinky.</li>
            <li> Hubby had never liked any of them enough to switch brands....</li>
            <li> Previously I had to use the others in combination with &#x27;Certain-Dri&#x27;</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself would get an odd smell after sweating, I guess.</li>
            <li> We get them in the mail every few months and hubby would try them out.</li>
            <li> I saw a few commercials for Degree&#x27;s Adrenaline Series and said why not?    </li>
            <li> Seriously what else can I say about this other than it works exremely well??     </li>
            <li> At least for me, it doesn&#x27;t stain t-shirts and holds up well in stressful times.</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacturer with a complaint about the product in November 2012 and to date they have not even had the decency to respond.</li>
            <li> The other three won&#x27;t dispense when the base is twisted.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day without fail.   </li>
            <li> Spice\\&quot; behind!</li>
            <li> Guaranteed to smell, badly.</li>
            <li> The base just spins.</li>
            <li> Absolutely AWFUL Customer Service and Support for the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for having this product at such a low price. Didn&#x27;t find this product in local market. I was looking for different brand than the previous old spice. This smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I found good replacement. Happy!</li>
            <li> The first of the four sticks worked fine. The other three won&#x27;t dispense when the base is twisted. The base just spins. I didn&#x27;t find this out until my return window closed.</li>
            <li> This has worked out to be better than several other deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried (Axe Dry, Old Spice High Endurance, SpeedStick Active off the top of my head) and I&#x27;ve had better results in terms of sweating ALOT less. Previously I had to use the others in combination with &#x27;Certain-Dri&#x27; but with this I feel like the Anti-Perspirant does a great job that lasts all day. A++</li>
            <li> If you order this, you will NOT be getting the \\&quot;Absolute Protection.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve ordered this twice, from two different sellers. Both times I received the \\&quot;Adrenaline Series\\&quot; instead of the product I ordered. They look similar but the Adrenaline Series doesn&#x27;t help me at all with sweating. Don&#x27;t waste your money - just buy the product you&#x27;ll actually be receiving instead.</li>
            <li> In my experience, Degree Adrenaline is a very effective antiperspirant, working better than many other brands that I tried. One or two swipes is enough, and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. When I use this product, I have confidence that I won&#x27;t develop body odor throughout the day. While I feel that other deodorants may smell better, I continue to use this product because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Most deodorants/antiperspirants don&#x27;t last the full day. I am at the gym most days and am a pretty good sweater so I have struggled to find a strong enough deodorant to carry me through the day. This stuff has a lot of aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly (I think it&#x27;s 18.5%) which means it&#x27;s just below the max (20%) that can be in a non-prescription formula. It goes on slightly cake-y (as do most antiperspirants, so no surprise there) but doesn&#x27;t flake or turn into a mess underneath your arms. It lasts all day without fail.   The scent, in my opinion, is great. It&#x27;s a little strong but not overpowering. Clean fresh and manly are the three words I&#x27;d use to describe it.   Definitely my new daily stick.</li>
            <li> Degree does it again.  Another great product that does what it says.  Works all day long, no matter how much i sweat... I don&#x27;t smell anything but the fragrance in Degree.</li>
            <li> This is a review from my husband&#x27;s perspective. As I am a female, I have not actually used the product myself lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree sent us this deodorant as a sample and after a week of use hubby said to buy it for him. He says it keeps him drier longer and doesn&#x27;t smell funny after he has been sweating. He said that usually, when he sweats while working or working out, by the time he is done the deodorant and his armpits smell kinda gross. Not because of the actual smell of perspiration, but the mixture of the deodorant and perspiration. The deodorant itself would get an odd smell after sweating, I guess. He says this one does not do that and it still smells the same at the end of the day. To him, that was a big plus, as well as staying drier much longer than usual. He likes it better than any other deodorant he has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby has used various Old Spice deodorants for many years now and it has been his usual brand. Only ever so often would he even try something new. Old Spice was \\&quot;it\\&quot; for him and he wanted to hear nothing of anything else... until this new Degree deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree often sends out free samples of their deodorants. They send travel sizes that are more than enough to use a few times and decide wether you like it or not. We get them in the mail every few months and hubby would try them out. Hubby had never liked any of them enough to switch brands....until this new Degree deodorant.</li>
            <li> After many years of using Old Spice, I kind of got tired of their scents and decided to try something new. I saw a few commercials for Degree&#x27;s Adrenaline Series and said why not?    So i bought it and after the first few days I had to admit that this was my new favorite deodorant. It just works so well from keeping me dry to the awesome scent. Seriously what else can I say about this other than it works exremely well??     Definitely try this one out and leave your old \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot; behind!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance and he&#x27;s never smelled better. We love this long lasting Degree. He works long hours and I can still smell this on him when he returns from work.</li>
            <li> one of them broke on my son already. the white came out and it broke in half. So I hope the others work</li>
            <li> I bought this in quanitity because you can&#x27;t find it in many places at the stores where I live. It works and smells great throughout the day and protect well from body odor. At least for me, it doesn&#x27;t stain t-shirts and holds up well in stressful times. When I wear this specific type, the V-12,  I can smell (refreshing citrus) it all throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t stain. Last about month using it daily.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> GODD GOOODD GOOD GOOOD GOOD DOOF ASFPOI  FPO AFA GOOD GOOD GOOD DGOOD GIIO&#x3D;D GOODDD GOODDD LOVE IT LOVEWE GOODD</li>
            <li> Because I fear that this product may no longer be produced, I bought a rather large amount.  It is my favorite. If you can get it, try it.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a solid deal on deodorant and the reviews seemed to be OK. After trying this product out for a couple of months, I have noticed that it wears off after 12+ hours and does not hold-up well overnight, especially when you hit the gym first thing in the morning. Guaranteed to smell, badly.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this for my husband because its the only doeodrant he says he loves and that works well for him. The price is pretty steep but I guess its better than paying 50% less for cheaper stuff then he has to wear double.   I will definetely buy again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Degree antiperspirant &amp; deodorant combo.  Works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the odor protection.  Use it once in the morning and I can go all day and night with no BO.  I don&#x27;t have a BO problem but with this I never have to worry about it</li>
            <li> Degree is the first deodorant/anti perspirant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor and sweat protection. Put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day.  I now use this brand and nothing else.  This 4 pack is a bit overpriced here.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the way this smells on me. I love the scent too. Great to put on right after a shower.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than others i have used for these reasons, goes on the skin&lt;br /&gt;without caking, has a pleasant smell but not too much smell, works all day for me against odor.The 4 pack price through Amazon works as well. I also have 3 boys using this as well, so buying in bulk is a must.</li>
            <li> wish they did not discontinue this fragrance and I could have bought more</li>
            <li> Good antiperspirant, but smells like bug spray somewhat.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, my husband and I use this deodorant. He works outside and he when he uses other deodorants, he comes home all stinky. Ever since we started using this deodorant , has helped control odor. As a female I tried everything on the shelf, which don&#x27;t control my odor. That&#x27;s why I use this deodorant only. I know theres others alike but they don&#x27;t work well as this one.</li>
            <li> It is way cheaper to buy it here than in the store I recommend it if you like smelling nice.</li>
            <li> I was very happy they had it but some weren&#x27;t as fresh as if I was to buy it from a store but VERY HAPPY I FOUND SOME IN STOCK</li>
            <li> Do not under any circumstances buy Degree Products. I contacted the manufacturer with a complaint about the product in November 2012 and to date they have not even had the decency to respond. Absolutely AWFUL Customer Service and Support for the product. The text of my contact follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months ago I purchased some degree V12 Antiperspirant from Amazon, based on an effectiveness study I conducted. I must say I am impressed at how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I started to apply it today, and the last half inch came right out of the applicator and fell to the floor, useless now and what a waste. To top it off, I opened a new one, and the raising mechanism does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To recap, there was considerable waste on the first one I tried, and the second one is 100% waste. I have used many deodorants/antiperspirants over the years, and never have I experienced these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can imagine, I am extremely disenchanted with the product at this point in time, and based on my experience I would recommend that you take a good hard look at your QC procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect you will reimburse me for my loss. Thanks and I will look forward to your reply.</li>
