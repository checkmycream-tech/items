            <li>Pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It is made in Germany for good quality reputation.</li>

            <li>wife likes it good price</li>
            <li>We have found this product to be good for my husband.  </li>

            <li>The best and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Im very pleased with the product and the prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would use it after reading so many on line reviews of how great it was.</li>
            <li>so I can pair it with my favorite perfume, and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I think the closest comparison I could come up with when trying to describe the smell is that it&#x27;s kind of like baby powder, but not quite as good.</li>
            <li>Anything SebaMed is of excellent quality and I have enjoyed this product as my primary shower soap.</li>
            <li>Very gentle product great for greasy skin!</li>

            <li>I Love this product!</li>
            <li>This body wash is so much better than Moisturizing SOAPS!</li>
            <li>It is amazing and lasts over a year.  </li>
            <li>This is quite simply an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I am 48 and my skin feels and looks amazing</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like aloe.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and great fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Study their website and you will see what kind of company they are.</li>
            <li>This smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and smells wonderful, like violets.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s offered here on Amazon all of the time.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best I use it</li>

            <li>Great for my kid who has mild eczema.</li>
            <li>great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li>BEST body wash for those of us with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>and since I have been using this product I don&#x27;t have any rashes, love love this wash!</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of it and you can also use it for washing your hair (although they make a really nice shampoo).  </li>
            <li>Best face wash so far</li>
            <li>We have fallen in love with this amazing cleanser</li>
            <li>Works great on my skin and makes me feel fresh but not stripped of oils</li>
            <li>The wonder of this product is that it is suitable to wash every part of my body.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was expecting better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Huge bottle for a good price--far cheaper than retail prices.  </li>
            <li>The scent is clean and pleasant but not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, and does not linger on the skin after drying.  </li>
            <li>So, maybe a more clinical kind of product is what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the fragrance is WAY TOO STRONG!.</li>
            <li>I do not get any in my eyes but the strong scent makes my eyes burn!</li>
            <li>It smells good, cleans well, and most importantly does not in any way irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is great too; I would describe it as smelling very clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>It smells great clean and light, even my husband loves it.  </li>
            <li>The lady began speaking of the body wash and had me feel her arm, it was very smooth, she proceeded to tell me she doesn&#x27;t use lotion.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth, everywhere.</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>Very light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results and look forward to more positive results from Sebamed.</li>
            <li>Very good for my sensitive skin, that it&#x27;s not drying.</li>
            <li>You can think of sebamed as a soap because it does all the things soap does, but it isn&#x27;t a soap because there is no lye in it, and it leaves NO residue on your skin, and if you have never felt your skin after it has been washed with a balanced pH cleaner you may not be able to appreciate how that feels, but I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for the world.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;highly recommend:)</li>
            <li>This is a great body wash for the whole family.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using this product, I am still amazed and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried everything from Cetaphil to Chanel to La Mer, but this product is not only the Best Bang for your Buck$, It also WORKS!</li>
            <li>I also love their Hand &amp; Nail Balm.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>of the best products tested by independent agencies in Germany.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it</li>
            <li>I also love that I can use it on my face as well as my body.</li>
            <li>Love the smell; definately refreshing.</li>
            <li>I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite refreshing as well.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this over in Germany.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t breakout, but Sebamed has improved my skin even more.</li>
            <li>Still, overall, it&#x27;s the best product for her.....</li>
            <li>Some had fragrances that her doctor theorized maybe causing her to break out even more.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product online and discovered that Amazon carried it and can opt the Subscribe-and-Save on this product (free shipping!)  </li>
            <li>This body wash is refreshing and leaves no film on my skin.</li>
            <li>Like it more for a face wash.</li>
            <li>Like better than anything found in a drug store.</li>
            <li>I love this soapless soap.  </li>
            <li>product seems pricey, but another thing I love about this product is that it is verrrrry spreadable.  </li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>I ran out and haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact this isn&#x27;t like soap.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>My skin never felt better.</li>
            <li>I have been using the body wash for more then 3 years.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it, my daughter loves it, even my husband loves it.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li>i have tried many thru the years.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>We love all of the Sebamed products.</li>
            <li>I have to say I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I wish it smelled more like to soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all Seba med products.</li>
            <li>Better price at Costco when they have it on the road shows, but this will do.</li>
            <li>I love this product for so many reasons.</li>
            <li>My wife it in love with this product and can&#x27;t seem to go without.</li>
            <li>I am glad it works for others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not have a lovely fragrance</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin looking and feeling better within a week.</li>
            <li>Love Sebamed.</li>
            <li>I love that it is odorless</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t itch any more.</li>
            <li>My skin is completely better.</li>
            <li>Excellent for overall use.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>But I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash</li>
            <li>Most individuals who struggle with acne tend to purchase the leading brands expecting to see results.</li>
            <li>I have not tried this brands lotion, I have always  recommended Cetaphil lotion, or even light olive oil!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>, she plays sports and we live on a beautiful tropical island.  </li>
            <li>Once I tried it I was very impressed because my skin, while clean and not oily, was not totally dried out.  </li>
            <li>It is also not as expensive as Aveeno, so I am very satisfied and happy with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels great, highly recommend</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy, it has a very clean feeling to it.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and sift no residue love love love</li>
            <li>With the auto-order program, easy to make sure I have it on hand.</li>
            <li>This product would make an excellent body wash for those who have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from dry skin all my life and this stuff is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>After reading about it, I thought it could be a good product for my aging skin, probably more gentle than what I&#x27;d been using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No problem, they have an entire fragrance free line and my face is so happy!  </li>
            <li>…this is THE product you should be using to clean your lady parts!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>And most importantly...</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Received on time works great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>think Sebamed is great for some sensitive skin types, but just not for people who are allergic to fragrances.</li>
            <li>This is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I would give it more stars if they were available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This soap is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it leave my body feeling great and soft..</li>
            <li>Nice sort of a fresh cut hay scent to me.  </li>
            <li>Now my whole family is using also makes skin feel so good, but CLEANS</li>
            <li>very well, lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>for the whole \\&quot;PH balanced is good / soap</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Cleans very well and leaves my face feeling good.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it; the smell reminds me of the soap Ivory Spring but much more mild.</li>
            <li>I totally do not believe all the good reviews on here!</li>
            <li>I get rashes easily.  </li>
            <li>Very mild scent.</li>
            <li>Verynice clean and refreshing</li>
            <li>We also love the larger size - it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t have this issue, though, so that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s good for teenagers rather than older folks like me.  </li>
            <li>When I started washing my face with Sebamed (pH balanced) face wash, the problem - caused by washing my face with strong body liquid soap - disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I am giving it four stars instead of five because, for me, the fragrance is too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, yet an effective cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is great ph balance and just enough suds to make your face feel very clean</li>
            <li>It is a fine product though</li>
            <li>I stopped using the Sebamad, and began using my Dermalogica body wash, and after a day, I was fine</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, so mild</li>
            <li>I love the PH value of this product which also absorbs quickly and the pump that goes with</li>
            <li>If you love a strongly scented, fresh smelling product, that will be a plus for you.</li>
            <li>I purchased a 1oz from the travel section of a pharmacy; and was in love with this product after the first use!</li>
            <li>and I noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>for my comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a chemical free type lotion and ran across this brand at a Costco road show, I had never heard of it before.</li>
            <li>Also, I continued to use cheap bar soaps as I had always used.</li>
            <li>I have been graced with great skin my entire life, but this product changed my skin care regime.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and since I&#x27;ve started using it, my skin has looked the best it has looked in many years (maybe my whole adult life).  </li>
            <li>This is a great cleansing soap, especially if you have skin problems.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of Sebamed, and that was all it took.  </li>
            <li>and they offer cheaper prices $$ and FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25.  </li>
            <li>It was once available at Costco, but they have since quit carrying it.</li>
            <li>I saw this on sale at CVS Pharmacy (buy one get one free).</li>
            <li>I recommend using a lotion that is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>just because a product says fragrance free, does not make it alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say tear free, but I haven&#x27;t seen them having an issue getting soap in their eyes yet.</li>
            <li>it has mild pleasant fragrance, it also feels mild but cleanse very well.</li>
            <li>This product is far superior to cetaphil and aveeno products.</li>
            <li>I love the way I feel clean and fresh without feeling stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the fresh clean smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a great body wash helps my dry skin and keeps it smooth.</li>
            <li>I just think this is a super good brand which is completely inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Bought this first time from Costco and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I was attracted to the unique pH 5.5 and \\&quot;soap-freeness\\&quot; of this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally in Costco.</li>
            <li>I wish is was more affordable, but I&#x27;m willing to pay.</li>
            <li>Smell is fresh and I always come out of the shower feeling like a million bucks!</li>
            <li>I stopped using it - reverted to my original cleanse and in two days problem solved.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing &amp; gentle!</li>
            <li>It has a unique smell that I like</li>
            <li>bathe with it,and clean my face with it.</li>
            <li>I leaves my skin feeling clean without any residue.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Sebamed leaves you feeling clean without the dryness often felt with soap products.  </li>
            <li>This product is still by far the one of the best products that has worked for my teenage daughter for her acne.  </li>
            <li>Gets you clean without drying out your skin or smelling too &amp;#34;purfumey&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>As stated for sensitive skin it has really been great for my daughter&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it lathers ( most soap for sensitive skin doesnt)</li>
            <li>Maybe all that &amp;#34;soap and alkali-free&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;pH blah-blah&amp;#34; implies that it doesn&#x27;t clean</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this cleanser does not irritate and how clean it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I use it to cleanse my face, and it takes the smallest amount to lather and clean.</li>
            <li>I love the large bottle I get from here that you cannot find in stores.</li>
            <li>I found this soap at Costco when they were doing a special with Sebamed.</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>Full of dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I believed her, and I wasn&#x27;t really looking for body wash, but I bought it to try anyways.</li>
            <li>Not only will YOU be delighted, your boyfriend/husband/partner/lover will thank you.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff I wash very time with it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>love this product, so gentle</li>
            <li>I used to stock up on this product during my multiple trips to Germany as it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>Love this product, so gentle on face and body.</li>
            <li>As someone in the health industry, I can not say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this PH5 body wash, leaves your skin so nice and never feeling dry.</li>
            <li>is bad\\&quot; pitch - and that may be true but I know perfume so strong it stung my eyes the first time I went to wash my face with it</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and fresh after using the Sebamed Face and Body Wash.  Will continue to use and recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best soap to use.</li>
            <li>It is especially good for cleaning cuts and wounds because it&#x27;s so gentle and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>great stuff, but much cheaper over at the big box store</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema on legs, and am allergic to soap, as well as fragrances.</li>
            <li>I am however convinced that the U.S. version is slightly more potent than the German version.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I found it here.  </li>
            <li>I go through it too quick to bother with.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Most other products I have used tend to dry my face out, but this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it just as much as the first day</li>
            <li>Good for those with sensitive/easily irritated skin or during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>So excited to try this, as I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experience with other Sebamed products.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and most shampoos irritate my scalp</li>
            <li>The large size we use lasts a long time and Face and Body Wash is effective and good for sensitive skin, too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this after reading all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a normal active perspiring man, especially if you go to a gym -- no doubt you&#x27;ll stink even after a good bath using this body wash lol.</li>
            <li>great face wash, i have ordered it a few times now.</li>
            <li>I recently also bought their hand cream which is also amazing.  </li>
            <li>IMO this is worth it.</li>
            <li>so this is kind of a big deal.)</li>
            <li>My skin is ultra sensitive and I have never been able to use skin care products with fragrance in them.</li>
            <li>Fresh and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the amount of money that is charged for this product.</li>
            <li>Product worth the money</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Sebamed is worth</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong scent, just leaves the skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the strong perfumey smell and the intense greenish-blue color.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh smell and leaves skin feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>have acne, and other soaps were causing more and more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face clean, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>Right away my skin felt so much cleaner &amp; smoother, but of course I was cautious about getting too excited.</li>
            <li>Very mild and gentle but strong enough to give a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They were right.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>Everything is just right about it, including the Ph of 5.5</li>
            <li>and it cleared right up.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous - Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Great for dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been lucky - for the last 24 years I have either been able to pick up a bottle or two (or four) in Germany myself or friends</li>
            <li>With this wash, I stay smelling fresh during the day and night, a first for me.</li>
            <li>However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US</li>
            <li>It is great for my skin and it makes you feel so clean, we even use it on our hair occasionally to get rid of any build up from the other shampoos.</li>
            <li>very gentle even for babies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and suitable for a whole body wash and shampoo that leaves you feeling fresh and clean without leaving a residue or feeling dry</li>
            <li>it leaves your fresh feeling fresh &amp; clean, but not dry or filmy, and it&#x27;s super gentle.</li>
            <li>I was interested in the pH balanced formula.</li>
            <li>It is reputed to be one of the top facial washes in the world.</li>
            <li>Sebamed is exactly this.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 3 years now, and it is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>At first it seemed ok, but eventually my skin starting itching again.  </li>
            <li>My first layer of skin on my hands started to peel.</li>
            <li>love it big time.</li>
            <li>This is the first body wash that has combined all the elements.</li>
            <li>Great smell and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Costco for the first time, after one use I never used soap again.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty</li>
            <li>I first bought this at a Costco store.  </li>
            <li>First off, I fell</li>
            <li>And yet at first I didn&#x27;t think it was caused by the wash but was maybe caused by some freaky hormonal thing.</li>
            <li>I came to Sebamed first through the Cleansing Oil for Body which I like</li>
            <li>I was leary at first to use this product</li>
            <li>I told my ophthalmologist during my next eye exam and he was pleased, but had no clue that soap could have been the cause of my problem.</li>
            <li>I would be interested in knowing if others have had an allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>I feel like it keeps my skin very moisturized!</li>
            <li>product is OK, I used the entire bottle, and had stop.</li>
            <li>Using it on my face cleared up my skin, and using it as a shower body wash made my skin smooth, soft and itch-free.  </li>
            <li>So, I was surprised when I was at Costco and came across this body wash and that it had the cruelty free icon on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve been able to use is California Baby Super Sensitive Wash and Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>I would not go back to even the most gentle</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I used high quality creams and lotions to reverse the damage, without any success.</li>
            <li>I think this will go a long way toward bolstering healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I liked this so much that I tried some of their other products as well.</li>
            <li>This wash gives me that squeaky clean antiseptic feeling like I am really really clean but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make any of us itch.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this is fragrance free as it definitely has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Then I tried the Purpose brand which is better at cleaning off dirt but leaves my face a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>We both love and use this as a body wash and it has helped with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Before leaving, I made certain that I took something to prevent malaria.</li>
            <li>I like the large bottles.</li>
            <li>These PH skin friendly soaps haven&#x27;t usually been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Within a week my skin&#x27;s texture &amp; breakouts had improved significantly, and my skin was still not dry!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve used some pretty \\&quot;strong\\&quot; facial wash products over the years to get my face clean.</li>
            <li>I looked on the ingredients and the fragrance is listed pretty high up on the list.  </li>
            <li>I just used it for once, and I felt it is really PH5.5</li>
            <li>IT FOAMS VERY WELL .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It ever so gently removes eye make-up, EVEN waterproof eyeliner...</li>
            <li>I used to be the lotion queen, but the wash really works.  </li>
            <li>Does this work like the intimate wash?</li>
            <li>The reviews were very favorable, so I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Service is fast and product is as advertized.</li>
            <li>It gently washes my face.</li>
            <li>it with no too much expectation.</li>
            <li>this product is so gentle I use it to give my toodlers a bath.</li>
            <li>Gentle and cleansing, but it doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very upset with the results of this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for carrying Sebamed.</li>
            <li>My family really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>It is much improved after switching to Sebamed.</li>
            <li>Fast and troublesome delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and no leakage.</li>
            <li>it is very convenient to use</li>
            <li>We use it with a body sponge and it really cleans well.</li>
            <li>The PH balance thing really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>and I guess if you really like it you will pay the money.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says without hype and without too much perfume/scent.</li>
            <li>if you have combination skin really balances it out</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work very well with my nylon washcloth</li>
            <li>so I went looking for another gentle, moisturizing body wash.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>works really well.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue using this product, and I want to try others in the line.</li>
            <li>I can gently wash my eyelids and eyelashes with this wash and it does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work for me</li>
            <li>Gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>and you can really use it on your face as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a body wash without foam, and that a bit unusual.</li>
            <li>It is very nourishing to the skin.</li>
            <li>It just seemed very clinical and medicinal.</li>
            <li>It is really gentle.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my acne and keeps my face feeling really balanced.  </li>
            <li>It feels soothing, and because I am so allergic to scent, my whole family uses it to keep from causing me a reaction.</li>
            <li>and I think the balanced PH really helps with that.</li>
            <li>You could buy it at costco for a while, but I think because the bottle looks kind of medicinal (and it&#x27;s not cheap), people didn&#x27;t try it out much.  </li>
            <li>Excellent face and body wash - low on irritating chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>like I do with so many other products.</li>
            <li>this face wash works better than all other washes i have tried.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and most soaps and cleansers make me very dry or very irritated, lots of them give me a rash.  </li>
            <li>(My skin has a tendency to dry out really easily</li>
            <li>and this is the only non-soap body wash that is does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how gentle or effective this is because I could not get passed the smell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean without dryness, and the scent of the product is pleasing enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I use to get my skin squeaky clean in the shower these days.</li>
            <li>It has a clean, fresh scent and more importantly, I&#x27;m not itchy from dry skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and very cost affective.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is the first body wash that completely takes care of any underarm odor I have.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate the area with good old fashioned sugar, or salt, (please do not use course exfoliates on your face it will just spread the bacteria from breakouts to other pores, and possibly damage capillaries under the skin causing redness. )</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used MANY of the other big names in skincare (Proactive, Murad, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena,  </li>
            <li>I started using this product in Germany where I lived at the time, now I live in the US, and, thanks to Amazon, I can get it here.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for dry or irritated skin.</li>
            <li>In fact, you can see the before and after pictures in the image section on the main page.</li>
            <li>It is a mild cleanser and the only one that has worked for us.</li>
            <li>&quot; (high chlorine).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap for any skin type.</li>
            <li>Great for camping or taking other places where you can&#x27;t shower everyday.</li>
            <li>Found this product as a result from Costco, and it has worked extremely well on my daughter, who is fair skinned and would get blotchy with raised pink rashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with truly clean skin, clear pores, and no residue.  </li>
            <li>I am older with fair, thin skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50, so have some changing/aging skin, but I really like that this product is not harsh, not creamy, not oily.  </li>
            <li>I was not going to use the mens room&#x27;s pink soap that was supplied for free.</li>
            <li>Keeps me feeling fresh into the next day.  </li>
            <li>Since using this my skin has improved dramatically with no negative side effects.</li>
            <li>As a organ, the ph of the skin profoundly affects its ability to function and I really appreciate that this is ph balanced.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s now mid April) and am pleased to report it has really helped not only with the acne on her face but also her back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally disappointed and surprised to see so many good reviews...</li>
            <li>I try it before I order a brand new bottle of it online.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I use less than a pump to clean my whole body.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be strong enough to cut through my oils and gentle enough to not completely dry out her skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My son has milk, egg, peanut allergies and VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried using the Cetaphil brand for a while, but gave up on it because it didn&#x27;t do any better at cleaning my face than just plain water does, though it never dried out my face.  </li>
            <li>In one use it&#x27;s made my skin feel softer, given it more color and decreased the saggy look on my right cheek.</li>
            <li>I had bought the first one at Costco, but they don&#x27;t have it anymore, except for occasional road shows.  </li>
            <li>I picked up my first bottle of Seba Med at costco because I had read an article about it in a health related magazine.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with or without sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>and if I am taking a bath with my toddler, that she and I can share the same soap,even though most of the time, she uses SebaMed baby or some other kid formulated cleaner.</li>
            <li>I am switching back but decided to try this first since it was recommended by a lot on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>I picked up my first items at my local Fred Meyers, but found their website</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has also complimented my soft skin!</li>
            <li>The only other product that used to work on my sensitive skin was Aveeno&#x27;s fragrance-free body wash, but this one feels way better on my skin because of its ph balance.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have suffered with lifelong mild acne and was swayed by the claim that an alkaline pH is what we should use on our skin.  </li>
            <li>It lathers great, it doesn&#x27;t have a saccharine sweet fragrance (i hate floral and fruity scents) and it is ph balanced.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s pricey, it lasts long and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh without the use of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love SebaMed and sometimes it is so hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to help clear my blemishes</li>
            <li>As a teenager, I had perfectly clear skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That was 2 days ago and my face is now clear and no longer itchy.</li>
            <li>Even my 84 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s delicate skin looks so healthy using this product.</li>
            <li>With these 2 together the whole family gets soft skin till the next shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000BRSHXE Sebamed Moisturing Cream, Sensitive Skin]]</li>
            <li>B000BRPMJQ Sebamed Hand &amp; Nail Balm for Sensitive Skin 2.6 oz (75 ml)]]</li>
            <li>My 23 year old daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li>My kids come out of the tub so soft that I don&#x27;t even need to lube them up with skin lotions now.  </li>
            <li>So far it has worked.  </li>
            <li>I use this product to avoid soap sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Then I got this and wow-  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t soap, and it doesn&#x27;t really lather, however that isn&#x27;t necessary for getting clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still have a ways to go since some spots have not healed completely, as you can see.</li>
            <li>This could be a natural scent though.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This works wonders for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has (honestly) never felt better.  </li>
            <li>The whole family uses it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have used  this product  for years and like the way it rinses off completely.  </li>
            <li>It also far outlasted bar soap.  </li>
            <li>This is the only line of siap that is gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>but it cleans my sensitive, acne-prone skin without over drying or causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>I used to use Dove, but after years of sun, my skin was looking like my husband&#x27;s 90-year old grandmother&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sebamed products for over 11 years and may recommend them to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Works alright, bought it for a 14 year old and</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m 40, I&#x27;m busy combatting wrinkles along with the acne.  </li>
            <li>Our faces are soft, clear and not flaky.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that if there is any perfume/parfum in it, my face is toast.  </li>
            <li>Cuts facial oils and grime very well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft not vreasy and it doesn&#x27;t make m  itch.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Well, maybe it is at Whole Foods but not at a regular grocery store.</li>
            <li>I bought this since my children have sensitive skin,  </li>
            <li>This product is an acid on the ph scale which will maintain your skins natural layer of defense.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>I decided to use it for a few days, and to be sure to use just a tiny bit each time so as not to overdo it, and see if my skin would somehow adjust to it.</li>
            <li>It is the only one that has cleared my pores and kept them clean, such as the blackheads on my nose (the \\&quot;strips\\&quot; are only temporary).</li>
            <li>We live in a dry, sometimes very windy state, Sebamed Face and Body Wash has helped reduce the dryness on the body and face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive facial skin and Sebamed is gentle and leaves your face soft not dry.</li>
            <li>We have been through every brand of high dollar non-toxic organic bath soaps, lotions and what not and have never really found something that really agrees with his skin.  </li>
            <li>It just got more tight, dry and rough-feeling.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for this purpose, but the smell and color is similar to a generic hand soap you&#x27;d find in a gas station bathroom.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to call it soap, because it doesn&#x27;t contain the high ph of all american soap/body wash products.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having gone through all the products I&#x27;ve tried with the conditions that I have with my skin, and to have such positive results, I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of this product.</li>
            <li>Forget douching, feminine sprays, or constant washing…it is incompatible with the normal ph, causing said parts to go into overdrive to compensate</li>
            <li>I have other Sebamed products and like them very much, but I have no idea what they&#x27;re thinking with the smell of this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years, really helps relieve dry skin problems caused by heated homes in winter.</li>
            <li>product is not cheap, but well worth it if you need something for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use on your face as well as your entire body.  </li>
            <li>So far this has been a decent body wash that doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out like others.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have discovered that I&#x27;m allergic to numerous skin care products.</li>
            <li>but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>She first purchased it at Costco, But they only sell it at limited times.</li>
            <li>Well, actually, seborrheic dermatitis, which means my skin is not only sensitive but gets pretty dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous expensive face washes and this by far is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>and I saw her clear back</li>
            <li>…the low ph means your skin is never dried out or irritated.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s the only product that is working for her.</li>
            <li>The only thing that has worked for me is Kirklands Natural Citrus Body wash.  </li>
            <li>Only body wash that I have found that works on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, if you prefer less strongly scented, or unscented product, as I do, due to allergies, then this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily,  I highly recommnd if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have used other body washes only to find that my wash cloths were dingy with residue that didn&#x27;t wash out even after washing with hot water and bleach.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin, so my dermatologist suggested I use soap that contains moisture creams, which worked fine for a few years until my skin starting itching in places.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely allergic to scent, and this body wash has just been very helpful for my health.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way - a quarter squirt into the hand will do for the face and one full pump onto a mesh pouf for the rest of the body.</li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas where the air is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only body wash that keeps my skin clear of a red rash.</li>
            <li>In fact, until recently, it could only be purchased by mail directly from the company, because it didn&#x27;t meet the U.S. minimum ph requirements for &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>and I bought one for my husband who suffers from skin problems and he only uses dermatologist recommended products he loved it too</li>
            <li>It is soft and I need less lotion than I normally wear.</li>
            <li>In addition, my face feels very dry and tight after washing, just like most other washing agents.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and my back acne is actually starting to clear up, which also probably has something to do with me not touching it as much because I&#x27;m not as itchy as I used to be.</li>
            <li>Its pricey but the product will last much longer than any other brand</li>
            <li>I live in CO where it is very dry.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;This should last for a pretty long time (compared with the price and size of other face wash tubes).&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne for about half of my lifetime, and this product works really well with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin  and psoriasis.</li>
            <li>But certainly not unpleasant, at least to me.</li>
            <li>My skin has completely cleared up &amp; it has never once felt or looked dry!</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A few months ago I saw the large pump bottle of this product at my local Costco warehouse.</li>
            <li>It is great for my little toddler who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li>The thing is tho, other than the occasional pimple on my chin, I have very clear skin...</li>

            <li> Im very pleased with the product and the prompt delivery.  </li>

            <li> so I can pair it with my favorite perfume, and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I think the closest comparison I could come up with when trying to describe the smell is that it&#x27;s kind of like baby powder, but not quite as good.</li>

            <li> I had purchased the soap bars but this is way better!</li>
            <li> I Love this product!</li>
            <li> This body wash is so much better than Moisturizing SOAPS!</li>
            <li> It is amazing and lasts over a year.  </li>
            <li> This is quite simply an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I am 48 and my skin feels and looks amazing</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like aloe.  </li>
            <li> Good quality and great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Study their website and you will see what kind of company they are.</li>
            <li> This smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and smells wonderful, like violets.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s offered here on Amazon all of the time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best I use it</li>
            <li> It is very gentle while a very good cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to wash out and clean cuts/abrasions on people and pets and it works great.  </li>
            <li> He went through high school with a beautiful complexion!</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant scent and does the job of cleaning very well.  </li>
            <li> Great for my kid who has mild eczema.</li>
            <li> great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> BEST body wash for those of us with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> and since I have been using this product I don&#x27;t have any rashes, love love this wash!</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of it and you can also use it for washing your hair (although they make a really nice shampoo).  </li>
            <li> Best face wash so far</li>
            <li> We have fallen in love with this amazing cleanser</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin and makes me feel fresh but not stripped of oils</li>
            <li> The wonder of this product is that it is suitable to wash every part of my body.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was expecting better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for a good price--far cheaper than retail prices.  </li>
            <li> The scent is clean and pleasant but not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, and does not linger on the skin after drying.  </li>
            <li> So, maybe a more clinical kind of product is what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the fragrance is WAY TOO STRONG!.</li>
            <li> I do not get any in my eyes but the strong scent makes my eyes burn!</li>
            <li> It smells good, cleans well, and most importantly does not in any way irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is great too; I would describe it as smelling very clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> It smells great clean and light, even my husband loves it.  </li>
            <li> The lady began speaking of the body wash and had me feel her arm, it was very smooth, she proceeded to tell me she doesn&#x27;t use lotion.</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth, everywhere.</li>
            <li> It is very light</li>
            <li> Very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results and look forward to more positive results from Sebamed.</li>
            <li> Very good for my sensitive skin, that it&#x27;s not drying.</li>
            <li> You can think of sebamed as a soap because it does all the things soap does, but it isn&#x27;t a soap because there is no lye in it, and it leaves NO residue on your skin, and if you have never felt your skin after it has been washed with a balanced pH cleaner you may not be able to appreciate how that feels, but I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for the world.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash for the whole family.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using this product, I am still amazed and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried everything from Cetaphil to Chanel to La Mer, but this product is not only the Best Bang for your Buck$, It also WORKS!</li>
            <li> I also love their Hand &amp; Nail Balm.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> of the best products tested by independent agencies in Germany.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it</li>
            <li> I also love that I can use it on my face as well as my body.</li>
            <li> Love the smell; definately refreshing.</li>
            <li> I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this over in Germany.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t breakout, but Sebamed has improved my skin even more.</li>
            <li> Still, overall, it&#x27;s the best product for her.....</li>
            <li> Some had fragrances that her doctor theorized maybe causing her to break out even more.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product online and discovered that Amazon carried it and can opt the Subscribe-and-Save on this product (free shipping!)  </li>

            <li> I love this soapless soap.  </li>
            <li> product seems pricey, but another thing I love about this product is that it is verrrrry spreadable.  </li>
            <li> Sure</li>
            <li> I ran out and haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact this isn&#x27;t like soap.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  </li>

            <li> i have tried many thru the years.</li>

            <li> I have to say I love this product.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I wish it smelled more like to soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all Seba med products.</li>
            <li> Better price at Costco when they have it on the road shows, but this will do.</li>
            <li> I love this product for so many reasons.</li>
            <li> My wife it in love with this product and can&#x27;t seem to go without.</li>
            <li> I am glad it works for others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have a lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin looking and feeling better within a week.</li>

            <li> Excellent for overall use.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> But I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash</li>
            <li> Most individuals who struggle with acne tend to purchase the leading brands expecting to see results.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this brands lotion, I have always  recommended Cetaphil lotion, or even light olive oil!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> , she plays sports and we live on a beautiful tropical island.  </li>
            <li> Once I tried it I was very impressed because my skin, while clean and not oily, was not totally dried out.  </li>
            <li> It is also not as expensive as Aveeno, so I am very satisfied and happy with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels great, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy, it has a very clean feeling to it.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and sift no residue love love love</li>
            <li> With the auto-order program, easy to make sure I have it on hand.</li>
            <li> This product would make an excellent body wash for those who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin all my life and this stuff is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> After reading about it, I thought it could be a good product for my aging skin, probably more gentle than what I&#x27;d been using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No problem, they have an entire fragrance free line and my face is so happy!  </li>
            <li> …this is THE product you should be using to clean your lady parts!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> And most importantly...</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Received on time works great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> think Sebamed is great for some sensitive skin types, but just not for people who are allergic to fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I would give it more stars if they were available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This soap is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it leave my body feeling great and soft..</li>
            <li> Nice sort of a fresh cut hay scent to me.  </li>
            <li> Now my whole family is using also makes skin feel so good, but CLEANS</li>
            <li> very well, lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> for the whole \\&quot;PH balanced is good / soap</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Cleans very well and leaves my face feeling good.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it; the smell reminds me of the soap Ivory Spring but much more mild.</li>
            <li> I totally do not believe all the good reviews on here!</li>
            <li> I get rashes easily.  </li>
            <li> Very mild scent.</li>
            <li> Verynice clean and refreshing</li>
            <li> We also love the larger size - it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily.  </li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t have this issue, though, so that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s good for teenagers rather than older folks like me.  </li>
            <li> When I started washing my face with Sebamed (pH balanced) face wash, the problem - caused by washing my face with strong body liquid soap - disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I am giving it four stars instead of five because, for me, the fragrance is too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, yet an effective cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It is great ph balance and just enough suds to make your face feel very clean</li>
            <li> It is a fine product though</li>
            <li> I stopped using the Sebamad, and began using my Dermalogica body wash, and after a day, I was fine</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, so mild</li>
            <li> I love the PH value of this product which also absorbs quickly and the pump that goes with</li>
            <li> If you love a strongly scented, fresh smelling product, that will be a plus for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 1oz from the travel section of a pharmacy; and was in love with this product after the first use!</li>
            <li> and I noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> for my comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a chemical free type lotion and ran across this brand at a Costco road show, I had never heard of it before.</li>
            <li> Also, I continued to use cheap bar soaps as I had always used.</li>
            <li> I have been graced with great skin my entire life, but this product changed my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and since I&#x27;ve started using it, my skin has looked the best it has looked in many years (maybe my whole adult life).  </li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing soap, especially if you have skin problems.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of Sebamed, and that was all it took.  </li>
            <li> and they offer cheaper prices $$ and FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25.  </li>
            <li> It was once available at Costco, but they have since quit carrying it.</li>
            <li> I saw this on sale at CVS Pharmacy (buy one get one free).</li>
            <li> I recommend using a lotion that is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> just because a product says fragrance free, does not make it alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say tear free, but I haven&#x27;t seen them having an issue getting soap in their eyes yet.</li>
            <li> it has mild pleasant fragrance, it also feels mild but cleanse very well.</li>
            <li> This product is far superior to cetaphil and aveeno products.</li>
            <li> I love the way I feel clean and fresh without feeling stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the fresh clean smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a great body wash helps my dry skin and keeps it smooth.</li>
            <li> I just think this is a super good brand which is completely inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this first time from Costco and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I was attracted to the unique pH 5.5 and \\&quot;soap-freeness\\&quot; of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally in Costco.</li>
            <li> I wish is was more affordable, but I&#x27;m willing to pay.</li>
            <li> Smell is fresh and I always come out of the shower feeling like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it - reverted to my original cleanse and in two days problem solved.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing &amp; gentle!</li>
            <li> It has a unique smell that I like</li>
            <li> bathe with it,and clean my face with it.</li>
            <li> I leaves my skin feeling clean without any residue.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Sebamed leaves you feeling clean without the dryness often felt with soap products.  </li>
            <li> This product is still by far the one of the best products that has worked for my teenage daughter for her acne.  </li>
            <li> Gets you clean without drying out your skin or smelling too &amp;#34;purfumey&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> As stated for sensitive skin it has really been great for my daughter&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it lathers ( most soap for sensitive skin doesnt)</li>
            <li> Maybe all that &amp;#34;soap and alkali-free&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;pH blah-blah&amp;#34; implies that it doesn&#x27;t clean</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this cleanser does not irritate and how clean it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I use it to cleanse my face, and it takes the smallest amount to lather and clean.</li>
            <li> I love the large bottle I get from here that you cannot find in stores.</li>
            <li> I found this soap at Costco when they were doing a special with Sebamed.</li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> Full of dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I believed her, and I wasn&#x27;t really looking for body wash, but I bought it to try anyways.</li>
            <li> Not only will YOU be delighted, your boyfriend/husband/partner/lover will thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I wash very time with it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> love this product, so gentle</li>
            <li> I used to stock up on this product during my multiple trips to Germany as it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Love this product, so gentle on face and body.</li>
            <li> As someone in the health industry, I can not say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this PH5 body wash, leaves your skin so nice and never feeling dry.</li>
            <li> is bad\\&quot; pitch - and that may be true but I know perfume so strong it stung my eyes the first time I went to wash my face with it</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and fresh after using the Sebamed Face and Body Wash.  Will continue to use and recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best soap to use.</li>
            <li> It is especially good for cleaning cuts and wounds because it&#x27;s so gentle and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> great stuff, but much cheaper over at the big box store</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on legs, and am allergic to soap, as well as fragrances.</li>
            <li> I am however convinced that the U.S. version is slightly more potent than the German version.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I found it here.  </li>
            <li> I go through it too quick to bother with.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Most other products I have used tend to dry my face out, but this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it just as much as the first day</li>
            <li> Good for those with sensitive/easily irritated skin or during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> So excited to try this, as I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experience with other Sebamed products.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and most shampoos irritate my scalp</li>
            <li> The large size we use lasts a long time and Face and Body Wash is effective and good for sensitive skin, too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this after reading all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a normal active perspiring man, especially if you go to a gym -- no doubt you&#x27;ll stink even after a good bath using this body wash lol.</li>
            <li> great face wash, i have ordered it a few times now.</li>
            <li> I recently also bought their hand cream which is also amazing.  </li>
            <li> IMO this is worth it.</li>
            <li> so this is kind of a big deal.)</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra sensitive and I have never been able to use skin care products with fragrance in them.</li>
            <li> Fresh and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the amount of money that is charged for this product.</li>
            <li> Product worth the money</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> Sebamed is worth</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong scent, just leaves the skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the strong perfumey smell and the intense greenish-blue color.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean fresh smell and leaves skin feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> have acne, and other soaps were causing more and more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face clean, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> Right away my skin felt so much cleaner &amp; smoother, but of course I was cautious about getting too excited.</li>
            <li> Very mild and gentle but strong enough to give a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They were right.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> Everything is just right about it, including the Ph of 5.5</li>
            <li> and it cleared right up.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous - Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great for dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been lucky - for the last 24 years I have either been able to pick up a bottle or two (or four) in Germany myself or friends</li>
            <li> With this wash, I stay smelling fresh during the day and night, a first for me.</li>
            <li> However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US</li>
            <li> It is great for my skin and it makes you feel so clean, we even use it on our hair occasionally to get rid of any build up from the other shampoos.</li>
            <li> very gentle even for babies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and suitable for a whole body wash and shampoo that leaves you feeling fresh and clean without leaving a residue or feeling dry</li>
            <li> it leaves your fresh feeling fresh &amp; clean, but not dry or filmy, and it&#x27;s super gentle.</li>
            <li> I was interested in the pH balanced formula.</li>
            <li> It is reputed to be one of the top facial washes in the world.</li>
            <li> Sebamed is exactly this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 years now, and it is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> At first it seemed ok, but eventually my skin starting itching again.  </li>
            <li> My first layer of skin on my hands started to peel.</li>
            <li> love it big time.</li>
            <li> This is the first body wash that has combined all the elements.</li>
            <li> Great smell and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco for the first time, after one use I never used soap again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty</li>
            <li> I first bought this at a Costco store.  </li>
            <li> First off, I fell</li>
            <li> And yet at first I didn&#x27;t think it was caused by the wash but was maybe caused by some freaky hormonal thing.</li>
            <li> I came to Sebamed first through the Cleansing Oil for Body which I like</li>
            <li> I was leary at first to use this product</li>
            <li> I told my ophthalmologist during my next eye exam and he was pleased, but had no clue that soap could have been the cause of my problem.</li>
            <li> I would be interested in knowing if others have had an allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like it keeps my skin very moisturized!</li>
            <li> product is OK, I used the entire bottle, and had stop.</li>
            <li> Using it on my face cleared up my skin, and using it as a shower body wash made my skin smooth, soft and itch-free.  </li>
            <li> So, I was surprised when I was at Costco and came across this body wash and that it had the cruelty free icon on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve been able to use is California Baby Super Sensitive Wash and Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I would not go back to even the most gentle</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I used high quality creams and lotions to reverse the damage, without any success.</li>
            <li> I think this will go a long way toward bolstering healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much that I tried some of their other products as well.</li>
            <li> This wash gives me that squeaky clean antiseptic feeling like I am really really clean but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make any of us itch.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is fragrance free as it definitely has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Then I tried the Purpose brand which is better at cleaning off dirt but leaves my face a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> We both love and use this as a body wash and it has helped with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Before leaving, I made certain that I took something to prevent malaria.</li>
            <li> I like the large bottles.</li>
            <li> These PH skin friendly soaps haven&#x27;t usually been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Within a week my skin&#x27;s texture &amp; breakouts had improved significantly, and my skin was still not dry!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used some pretty \\&quot;strong\\&quot; facial wash products over the years to get my face clean.</li>
            <li> I looked on the ingredients and the fragrance is listed pretty high up on the list.  </li>
            <li> I just used it for once, and I felt it is really PH5.5</li>
            <li> IT FOAMS VERY WELL .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It ever so gently removes eye make-up, EVEN waterproof eyeliner...</li>
            <li> I used to be the lotion queen, but the wash really works.  </li>
            <li> Does this work like the intimate wash?</li>
            <li> The reviews were very favorable, so I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Service is fast and product is as advertized.</li>
            <li> It gently washes my face.</li>
            <li> it with no too much expectation.</li>
            <li> this product is so gentle I use it to give my toodlers a bath.</li>
            <li> Gentle and cleansing, but it doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very upset with the results of this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for carrying Sebamed.</li>
            <li> My family really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> It is much improved after switching to Sebamed.</li>
            <li> Fast and troublesome delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and no leakage.</li>
            <li> it is very convenient to use</li>
            <li> We use it with a body sponge and it really cleans well.</li>
            <li> The PH balance thing really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> and I guess if you really like it you will pay the money.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says without hype and without too much perfume/scent.</li>
            <li> if you have combination skin really balances it out</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work very well with my nylon washcloth</li>
            <li> so I went looking for another gentle, moisturizing body wash.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> works really well.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue using this product, and I want to try others in the line.</li>
            <li> I can gently wash my eyelids and eyelashes with this wash and it does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work for me</li>
            <li> Gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> and you can really use it on your face as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a body wash without foam, and that a bit unusual.</li>
            <li> It is very nourishing to the skin.</li>
            <li> It just seemed very clinical and medicinal.</li>
            <li> It is really gentle.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my acne and keeps my face feeling really balanced.  </li>
            <li> It feels soothing, and because I am so allergic to scent, my whole family uses it to keep from causing me a reaction.</li>
            <li> and I think the balanced PH really helps with that.</li>
            <li> You could buy it at costco for a while, but I think because the bottle looks kind of medicinal (and it&#x27;s not cheap), people didn&#x27;t try it out much.  </li>
            <li> Excellent face and body wash - low on irritating chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> like I do with so many other products.</li>
            <li> this face wash works better than all other washes i have tried.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and most soaps and cleansers make me very dry or very irritated, lots of them give me a rash.  </li>
            <li> (My skin has a tendency to dry out really easily</li>
            <li> and this is the only non-soap body wash that is does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how gentle or effective this is because I could not get passed the smell.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean without dryness, and the scent of the product is pleasing enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use to get my skin squeaky clean in the shower these days.</li>
            <li> It has a clean, fresh scent and more importantly, I&#x27;m not itchy from dry skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and very cost affective.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is the first body wash that completely takes care of any underarm odor I have.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate the area with good old fashioned sugar, or salt, (please do not use course exfoliates on your face it will just spread the bacteria from breakouts to other pores, and possibly damage capillaries under the skin causing redness. )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MANY of the other big names in skincare (Proactive, Murad, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena,  </li>
            <li> I started using this product in Germany where I lived at the time, now I live in the US, and, thanks to Amazon, I can get it here.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for dry or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, you can see the before and after pictures in the image section on the main page.</li>
            <li> It is a mild cleanser and the only one that has worked for us.</li>
            <li> &quot; (high chlorine).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap for any skin type.</li>
            <li> Great for camping or taking other places where you can&#x27;t shower everyday.</li>
            <li> Found this product as a result from Costco, and it has worked extremely well on my daughter, who is fair skinned and would get blotchy with raised pink rashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with truly clean skin, clear pores, and no residue.  </li>
            <li> I am older with fair, thin skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50, so have some changing/aging skin, but I really like that this product is not harsh, not creamy, not oily.  </li>
            <li> I was not going to use the mens room&#x27;s pink soap that was supplied for free.</li>
            <li> Keeps me feeling fresh into the next day.  </li>
            <li> Since using this my skin has improved dramatically with no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> As a organ, the ph of the skin profoundly affects its ability to function and I really appreciate that this is ph balanced.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s now mid April) and am pleased to report it has really helped not only with the acne on her face but also her back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally disappointed and surprised to see so many good reviews...</li>
            <li> I try it before I order a brand new bottle of it online.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I use less than a pump to clean my whole body.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be strong enough to cut through my oils and gentle enough to not completely dry out her skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My son has milk, egg, peanut allergies and VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried using the Cetaphil brand for a while, but gave up on it because it didn&#x27;t do any better at cleaning my face than just plain water does, though it never dried out my face.  </li>
            <li> In one use it&#x27;s made my skin feel softer, given it more color and decreased the saggy look on my right cheek.</li>
            <li> I had bought the first one at Costco, but they don&#x27;t have it anymore, except for occasional road shows.  </li>
            <li> I picked up my first bottle of Seba Med at costco because I had read an article about it in a health related magazine.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with or without sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> and if I am taking a bath with my toddler, that she and I can share the same soap,even though most of the time, she uses SebaMed baby or some other kid formulated cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am switching back but decided to try this first since it was recommended by a lot on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I picked up my first items at my local Fred Meyers, but found their website</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has also complimented my soft skin!</li>
            <li> The only other product that used to work on my sensitive skin was Aveeno&#x27;s fragrance-free body wash, but this one feels way better on my skin because of its ph balance.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have suffered with lifelong mild acne and was swayed by the claim that an alkaline pH is what we should use on our skin.  </li>
            <li> It lathers great, it doesn&#x27;t have a saccharine sweet fragrance (i hate floral and fruity scents) and it is ph balanced.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s pricey, it lasts long and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh without the use of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love SebaMed and sometimes it is so hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to help clear my blemishes</li>
            <li> As a teenager, I had perfectly clear skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That was 2 days ago and my face is now clear and no longer itchy.</li>
            <li> Even my 84 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s delicate skin looks so healthy using this product.</li>
            <li> With these 2 together the whole family gets soft skin till the next shower.&lt;br</li>

            <li> My 23 year old daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li> My kids come out of the tub so soft that I don&#x27;t even need to lube them up with skin lotions now.  </li>
            <li> So far it has worked.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to avoid soap sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Then I got this and wow-  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t soap, and it doesn&#x27;t really lather, however that isn&#x27;t necessary for getting clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still have a ways to go since some spots have not healed completely, as you can see.</li>
            <li> This could be a natural scent though.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has (honestly) never felt better.  </li>
            <li> The whole family uses it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have used  this product  for years and like the way it rinses off completely.  </li>
            <li> It also far outlasted bar soap.  </li>
            <li> This is the only line of siap that is gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> but it cleans my sensitive, acne-prone skin without over drying or causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> I used to use Dove, but after years of sun, my skin was looking like my husband&#x27;s 90-year old grandmother&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sebamed products for over 11 years and may recommend them to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Works alright, bought it for a 14 year old and</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m 40, I&#x27;m busy combatting wrinkles along with the acne.  </li>
            <li> Our faces are soft, clear and not flaky.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that if there is any perfume/parfum in it, my face is toast.  </li>
            <li> Cuts facial oils and grime very well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft not vreasy and it doesn&#x27;t make m  itch.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Well, maybe it is at Whole Foods but not at a regular grocery store.</li>
            <li> I bought this since my children have sensitive skin,  </li>
            <li> This product is an acid on the ph scale which will maintain your skins natural layer of defense.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li> I decided to use it for a few days, and to be sure to use just a tiny bit each time so as not to overdo it, and see if my skin would somehow adjust to it.</li>
            <li> It is the only one that has cleared my pores and kept them clean, such as the blackheads on my nose (the \\&quot;strips\\&quot; are only temporary).</li>
            <li> We live in a dry, sometimes very windy state, Sebamed Face and Body Wash has helped reduce the dryness on the body and face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive facial skin and Sebamed is gentle and leaves your face soft not dry.</li>
            <li> We have been through every brand of high dollar non-toxic organic bath soaps, lotions and what not and have never really found something that really agrees with his skin.  </li>
            <li> It just got more tight, dry and rough-feeling.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for this purpose, but the smell and color is similar to a generic hand soap you&#x27;d find in a gas station bathroom.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to call it soap, because it doesn&#x27;t contain the high ph of all american soap/body wash products.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having gone through all the products I&#x27;ve tried with the conditions that I have with my skin, and to have such positive results, I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of this product.</li>
            <li> Forget douching, feminine sprays, or constant washing…it is incompatible with the normal ph, causing said parts to go into overdrive to compensate</li>
            <li> I have other Sebamed products and like them very much, but I have no idea what they&#x27;re thinking with the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years, really helps relieve dry skin problems caused by heated homes in winter.</li>
            <li> product is not cheap, but well worth it if you need something for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use on your face as well as your entire body.  </li>
            <li> So far this has been a decent body wash that doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out like others.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have discovered that I&#x27;m allergic to numerous skin care products.</li>
            <li> but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> She first purchased it at Costco, But they only sell it at limited times.</li>
            <li> Well, actually, seborrheic dermatitis, which means my skin is not only sensitive but gets pretty dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous expensive face washes and this by far is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> and I saw her clear back</li>
            <li> …the low ph means your skin is never dried out or irritated.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s the only product that is working for her.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has worked for me is Kirklands Natural Citrus Body wash.  </li>
            <li> Only body wash that I have found that works on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, if you prefer less strongly scented, or unscented product, as I do, due to allergies, then this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily,  I highly recommnd if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used other body washes only to find that my wash cloths were dingy with residue that didn&#x27;t wash out even after washing with hot water and bleach.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so my dermatologist suggested I use soap that contains moisture creams, which worked fine for a few years until my skin starting itching in places.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely allergic to scent, and this body wash has just been very helpful for my health.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - a quarter squirt into the hand will do for the face and one full pump onto a mesh pouf for the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas where the air is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only body wash that keeps my skin clear of a red rash.</li>
            <li> In fact, until recently, it could only be purchased by mail directly from the company, because it didn&#x27;t meet the U.S. minimum ph requirements for &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> and I bought one for my husband who suffers from skin problems and he only uses dermatologist recommended products he loved it too</li>
            <li> It is soft and I need less lotion than I normally wear.</li>
            <li> In addition, my face feels very dry and tight after washing, just like most other washing agents.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and my back acne is actually starting to clear up, which also probably has something to do with me not touching it as much because I&#x27;m not as itchy as I used to be.</li>
            <li> Its pricey but the product will last much longer than any other brand</li>
            <li> I live in CO where it is very dry.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;This should last for a pretty long time (compared with the price and size of other face wash tubes).&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for about half of my lifetime, and this product works really well with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin  and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> But certainly not unpleasant, at least to me.</li>
            <li> My skin has completely cleared up &amp; it has never once felt or looked dry!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A few months ago I saw the large pump bottle of this product at my local Costco warehouse.</li>
            <li> It is great for my little toddler who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> The thing is tho, other than the occasional pimple on my chin, I have very clear skin...</li>
            <li> Since I have started using Sebamed my adult acne has cleared up and I have not have any problems with fungal infections or other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to soap your whole body so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Too artificial, too strong, doesn&#x27;t rinse off completely.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve been committed to trying cruelty free products, I&#x27;ve unfortunately found that some of those products aggravated my skin (and yes, I realize it&#x27;s possibly because they don&#x27;t have the same testing standards as the products that do test on animals).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, and the large bottle appeared to have a hefty price tag, but after comparing it to other body washes, I found it was actually cheaper ounce-per-ounce.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, psoriasis, eczema, back acne, and food allergies</li>
            <li> Sebamed is the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t worsen his dry skin condition.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star because when I started to use the product shortly after my daughter, it started to dry my face</li>
            <li> It is dry, red, and I have a ton of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> it deep cleans the oil but never leaves my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, I found the smell of it too synthetic, strong and disturbing.</li>
            <li> Not very natural at all.  </li>
            <li> Using most other soaps caused my skin to itch uncomfortably.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry his skin like other baby body washes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got the huge bottle, so I guess I&#x27;ll be using it as a shower gel.</li>
            <li> The smell bothered me for a long time, but now I don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> This body wash seems pricey compared to others but it lasts a long time in this convenient pump.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long way you do not need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I,ve been using this on my sensitive skin face for a few years now, and I like how it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it is just thick enough that it applies very well to the face even if you have wet hands.</li>
            <li> I always used to use Dove soap because regular soap dried me out, and this does not dry my skin out either.</li>
            <li> He has diabetes and doctored for a long time for dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Recently I ordered the shampoo and it also washes out well and seems to rid hair of build up from other hair products.  </li>
            <li> have used this product for the last couple of years already and the skin feels the difference when switching with other products.</li>
            <li> Most of the leading products geared towards acne are not good at maintaining that barrier, leading to multiple breakouts or even worse skin than when you start, or you break out horrendously when you stop using the product.</li>
            <li> I have very delicate, sensitive skin and was dealing with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I use to have a problem w/ combination skin: oily and dry in patches.</li>
            <li> This does not irritate or dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> In the winter my skin is always itchy and dry, and in the summer my skin gets rashes from the humidity and in the areas that are covered or sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I use this to bathe my 93 YO father who has horribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Dry patches and eczema on myself and my child have cleared up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face dry or feel hurt.</li>
            <li> I sometimes forget to put on body lotion, so this wash helps me to keep my skin from extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It also seems to leave my skin rather dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and tend to get rashes.</li>
            <li> My skin used to be dry and a bit &#x27;scaly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother (94yo) because she was having he skin tear while toweling dry after showering.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT MAKE THE SKIN FEEL DRY, EVEN IN AZ.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a body wash that didn&#x27;t leave my skin so dry.</li>
            <li> It never leaves your skin dry or itchy and has no overpowering smell.  </li>
            <li> I am on the oily side of things and she is on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> I was developing dry skin in the winter...</li>
            <li> After you exfoliate the dry areas on your arms, or legs, follow up by cleansing the area with Sebamed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
            <li> I had not changed anything else but face and body wash - no new detergents for washing clothes ...</li>
            <li> Perhaps, that&#x27;s due to absence of soap, this body wash doesn&#x27;t work as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Costco no longer carries it as it was a limited offer</li>
            <li> I tried several drugstore face washes &amp; toners, but they only seemed to initially clear up my skin &amp; then make it worse.</li>
            <li> Prior to using it, I&#x27;d have to apply deodorant morning and night, and still I&#x27;d have a sour smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry and tight...best soap ever (even over spa/cosmetic company lines!).</li>
            <li> I use this product because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin very dry after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I now use it head to toe, as I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Here in Florida she had very dry skin until she started using Sebamed.  </li>
            <li> The wash smells bad like a strong chemical and irritates my skin on my face just as much as regular body wash or shampoo.  </li>
            <li> the next day I woke up to itchy skin and a million little pimples all over my forehead, chin and around my hairline.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as other washes because of the 5.5 PH.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin like other soap.</li>
            <li> I have looked for years for soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin to the extreme or make me break out.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it seems hard to rinse off completely.  </li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry although it was very cold and dry weather, and I felt more relieved from the dry patches of skin I had.</li>
            <li> Once I hit my late 20&#x27;s, I developed adult-onset acne.  </li>
            <li> Once I hit the ripe &#x27;ole age of 25, my skin started freaking out for some still unknown reason.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my entire body.</li>
            <li> Not much else to be said.</li>
            <li> The pump part never popped up after turning it, so I had to buy an additional empty pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve expected I scented</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Five years later I finally remembered Seba Med and my skin is slowly clearing up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it and even push it on my friends and have changed at least a few to users.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin, which gets worse in dry SoCal winter.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As soon as I quit using it and went back to my usual face wash - [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I would like to try other products of it sometime.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> other soaps cause me to develop rashes, this doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Would not use any other Body wash.  </li>
            <li> you will become a convert and start using the other products in the line...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably put this review on the other Sebamed face and body wash also.</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to differentiate from other regular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy it at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> So gentle on my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> My ophthalmologist suggested that I had &amp;#34;dry eyes&amp;#34; when I complained about burning and the constant need to put drops in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried about the fragrance alone irritating the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I would have a product for face, a product for down under and a body wash.</li>
            <li> In the past year I have noticed that the dry patches in my skin has disappeared and I get fewer break outs.</li>
            <li> No more dry, itchy skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li> B002Z72REI Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Scrub, Pink Grapefruit]] - no more dry, tight skin, and the roughness went away in a few days.</li>
            <li> I also tried pricier options like Lush &amp; Clinique, but I kept getting the same disappointing results.</li>
            <li> My skin can be picky, and half of the scents out there are too feminine or mediciney smelling.  </li>
            <li> Has a slight fragrance.</li>
            <li> And for bathroom products, that&#x27;s not very easy to find.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> and I buy it for my 2 little grandsons as well.  </li>
            <li> My one and only complaint is the dispenser!  </li>
            <li> Little pricey.</li>
            <li> I try to use it diluted and that helps a little.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your face dried out and tight.</li>
            <li> Benzyl Peroxide was too harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> I erroneously assumed the product would also be fairly natural.  </li>
            <li> I found that this stuff is quite harsh.</li>
            <li> everyday my daughter use</li>
            <li> I found this at a Costco a few years ago and have ordered it from Amazon ever since.</li>
            <li> Had a few acne pimples here and there</li>
            <li> It was worse on my left hand.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, my Rite Aid pharmacy was selling this at a steep discount and I bought two containers.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I never, ever get flakey skin on my legs or elbows anymore - even during harsh winters.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I just have a few flare ups here</li>
            <li> For whatever reason they stopped carrying it in the store which is one of the things I hate about Costco as this seems far too common, however, they do carry it at their website or on Amazon through Costco at a much increased price.  </li>
            <li> and my face kept getting worse until finally my boyfriend asked what the hell was going on with my face.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years now and ever since Cosco stopped selling it, I had to look elsewhere for this size bottle.</li>
            <li> Just to see if it was a bad bottle, I came across this item at two major retailers and it still smelled the same!</li>
            <li> No more messy soaps in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Cal Baby is too expensive and Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t lather so I&#x27;ve been looking for something a little cheaper that actually lathers.</li>
            <li> Since moving to the desert my entire family developed terrible dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Very little required to wash one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have used Sebamed products for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a color, slightly green (at least that&#x27;s from one I purchased in the store), but that doesn&#x27;t seem to cause me any issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There will be no more bar soaps in this house when showering or washing up after a job around the house.  </li>
            <li> The pumps on the small ones don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> She has gotten some dryness but not sure if it&#x27;s caused by our water.  </li>
            <li> but this definitely has a musty, weird smell.</li>
            <li> However, as there was nothing left of the product by the time I received it, I was unable to try it.</li>
            <li> No more soap for me.</li>
            <li> After talking to my doctor about it - she said I was one of the very few that develops reaction to product.</li>
            <li> That blue - and I mean ELECTRIC BLUE crap I had been smearing on my face must be the culprit!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive but I like the fact that it is Neurtal PH - don&#x27;t dry skin out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, due to haphazard packing, the bottle leaked &amp; spilled product all over the inside of the package, &amp; onto the other items I purchased with it.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t stain anything else, so I&#x27;m grateful for that small favor at least.</li>
            <li> On Guam, we have what they call \\&quot;hard water\\</li>
            <li> Duh.  </li>
            <li> she complained in the begining of using it that she thought it was causing her to break out and made her itchy, although she&#x27;s still using it</li>
            <li> It does not leave soap scum in the tub.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been cleaning up my diet and health &amp; beauty regimen--</li>
            <li> Completely controls my eczema with regular use and I had terrible eczema on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with it, I was surprised and disappointed by the tightness and dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she had bad acne on her back and chest and nothing worked for her.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this, they&#x27;ve decreased significantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> only gave 4 stars because I absolutely hate its scent.</li>
            <li> …Please forgive me for being indelicate, but this soap is a marvel, and a well-kept secret.  </li>
            <li> a side note, the bottle I received had a broken pump.</li>
            <li> Made my fiance&#x27;s and my acne worse....</li>
            <li> The bottle was delivered timely, but the pump which is already installed in the bottle is broken.</li>
            <li> but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> so finding products can be difficult for me.</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper!</li>
            <li> EVEN MY EXPENSIVE BODY WASHES.</li>
            <li> This is the worst facial wash I have ever used!</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry for trying this...</li>
            <li> When I switched to this rather than all the myriad soaps I&#x27;ve tried it helped to control that horrible itching from allergies and dry skin.</li>
            <li> The drug I was given had an unpleasant  side effect.</li>
            <li> and I would have a really bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> is bad for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I had really bad acne as a teenager</li>
            <li> so I assume it is not as bad as she&#x27;d thought in the begining.</li>
            <li> is BAD</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> , BAD, BAD!</li>
            <li> like an idiot, I still went ahead and washed my face with it...</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> However, after using this product for about 5 days my skin is terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Sebamed since I was an exchange student in Germany in 1987.  I have been lucky - for the last 24 years I have either been able to pick up a bottle or two (or four) in Germany myself or friends have sent it to me.  You can think of sebamed as a soap because it does all the things soap does, but it isn&#x27;t a soap because there is no lye in it, and it leaves NO residue on your skin, and if you have never felt your skin after it has been washed with a balanced pH cleaner you may not be able to appreciate how that feels, but I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for the world.  Since I started using Sebamed, I have found nothing that compares to it - at any price.  It is especially good for cleaning cuts and wounds because it&#x27;s so gentle and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of harsh chemicals. I also love the smell of it and you can also use it for washing your hair (although they make a really nice shampoo).  My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy it at the drug store.  You could buy it at costco for a while, but I think because the bottle looks kind of medicinal (and it&#x27;s not cheap), people didn&#x27;t try it out much.  (They should have started with smaller bottles or had samples to give away in store.)</li>
            <li> I love this. was recommended by my dermatologist over ten years ago. I don&#x27;t use anything but it. No moisturizing cream, no serum...nothing.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> I got to know this product from my wife, who did some research online. It is made in Germany for good quality reputation. I just used it for once, and I felt it is really PH5.5 for my comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> Found this product as a result from Costco, and it has worked extremely well on my daughter, who is fair skinned and would get blotchy with raised pink rashes.  I use it for myself as well.  I always used to use Dove soap because regular soap dried me out, and this does not dry my skin out either.</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim because I saw it at Costco and thought I\\&quot;d give it a try. I was interested in the pH balanced formula. I was not disappointed. My skin feels softer and I haven&#x27;t had a problem w/ acne. I&#x27;ve been trying to ween myself off of my acne cream for years (almost 30 and was still breaking out like I was 15) but nothing ever worked. Benzyl Peroxide was too harsh for my skin and I would have a really bad allergic reaction. Sulfer or salicylic acid based products didn&#x27;t work. I kept breaking out and my skin looked shiny and greasy. I use to have a problem w/ combination skin: oily and dry in patches. Now my skin looks and feels great. I don&#x27;t even feel like I need makeup/foundation. IMO this is worth it.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested I get this  a year or so ago.It is reputed to be one of the top facial washes in the world.The smell and feel hooked me.It just is a luxury every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I bathe with it,and clean my face with it.It takes a quarter-sized  portion to bathe.Very little required to wash one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;The pricing on Amazon was the lowest I have found.</li>
            <li> best shampoo/body wash that I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash for the whole family. My husband has bouts of eczema and this wash works best for him. During winter months it helps counteract the drying effects of the weather.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have suffered with lifelong mild acne and was swayed by the claim that an alkaline pH is what we should use on our skin.  I erroneously assumed the product would also be fairly natural.  The first thing I noticed was the strong perfumey smell and the intense greenish-blue color.  Full of dyes and perfumes. Not very natural at all.  But I went with it.  For some reason, it seems hard to rinse off completely.  My face still feels a bit slippery after rinsing well.  And after a month or so of use, nothing has changed about my face.  In addition, my face feels very dry and tight after washing, just like most other washing agents.  So I see no benefit to this product, and I will not buy it again.  Unfortunately, I got the huge bottle, so I guess I&#x27;ll be using it as a shower gel.</li>
            <li> This is my second quart of Sebamed.  I had bought the first one at Costco, but they don&#x27;t have it anymore, except for occasional road shows.  I was happy to find a good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  I have used it for years and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> Once I hit the ripe &#x27;ole age of 25, my skin started freaking out for some still unknown reason. I tried several drugstore face washes &amp; toners, but they only seemed to initially clear up my skin &amp; then make it worse. I also tried pricier options like Lush &amp; Clinique, but I kept getting the same disappointing results. My mom read about this in Costco &amp; bought it for me to try. Right away my skin felt so much cleaner &amp; smoother, but of course I was cautious about getting too excited. Within a week my skin&#x27;s texture &amp; breakouts had improved significantly, and my skin was still not dry! (My skin has a tendency to dry out really easily so this is kind of a big deal.) I have now added their moisturizing cream &amp; body lotion to my skin care routine &amp; I love every product! I have been using this product for a little over a month now &amp; I love it just as much as the first day I tried it. My skin has completely cleared up &amp; it has never once felt or looked dry! The smell is great too; I would describe it as smelling very clean &amp; fresh. I am so grateful that I no longer have to worry about my skin!</li>
            <li> Best face wash so far</li>
            <li> Have used this product before buying at Amazon.  Very good for my sensitive skin, that it&#x27;s not drying. Even then need to use a moisturizer after bath for optimum result.</li>
            <li> I get rashes easily.  This does not irritate or dry my skin.  I would recommend it especially if you have eczema or sensitivw skin issues.</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra sensitive and I have never been able to use skin care products with fragrance in them. In the winter my skin is always itchy and dry, and in the summer my skin gets rashes from the humidity and in the areas that are covered or sweat a lot. I decided to try Sebamed, although I knew it had fragrance because I heard great things about it. After using this body wash just once, I was amazed. My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry although it was very cold and dry weather, and I felt more relieved from the dry patches of skin I had. After a week of using this product, I am still amazed and absolutely love it. I love the smell of it; the smell reminds me of the soap Ivory Spring but much more mild. The only other product that used to work on my sensitive skin was Aveeno&#x27;s fragrance-free body wash, but this one feels way better on my skin because of its ph balance. It is also not as expensive as Aveeno, so I am very satisfied and happy with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> 10 plus years. I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT LIKE SOAPS THAT MAKE SLIPPERY AFTER BATH, SO I DO NOT LIKE IT. IT FOAMS VERY WELL .</li>
            <li> I picked up my first bottle of Seba Med at costco because I had read an article about it in a health related magazine.  I have a daughter with excema and I have very sensitive skin.  We have fallen in love with this amazing cleanser and I buy it for my 2 little grandsons as well.  Costco no longer carries it as it was a limited offer so now I buy it here on AMAZON and it&#x27;s the same price as it was at \\&quot;discounted \\&quot; Costco.  Love, Love, Love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> great product for skin cleansing</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, so mild</li>
            <li> I discovered this product at Costco over a year ago.  Costco no longer sell this product. It is amazing and lasts over a year.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as other washes because of the 5.5 PH.  Great for camping or taking other places where you can&#x27;t shower everyday. Keeps me feeling fresh into the next day.  Nice scent, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Bought this first time from Costco and fell in love with it.  Works great on my skin and makes me feel fresh but not stripped of oils like some do.  Nice sort of a fresh cut hay scent to me.  I never run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an oily-to-mixed complexion all my life, with some acne problems. So I&#x27;ve used some pretty \\&quot;strong\\&quot; facial wash products over the years to get my face clean. A few months ago I saw the large pump bottle of this product at my local Costco warehouse. After reading about it, I thought it could be a good product for my aging skin, probably more gentle than what I&#x27;d been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I found that this stuff is quite harsh. After washing my face with it, I was surprised and disappointed by the tightness and dryness of my skin. I decided to use it for a few days, and to be sure to use just a tiny bit each time so as not to overdo it, and see if my skin would somehow adjust to it. But it didn&#x27;t. It just got more tight, dry and rough-feeling. As soon as I quit using it and went back to my usual face wash - [[ASIN:B002Z72REI Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Scrub, Pink Grapefruit]] - no more dry, tight skin, and the roughness went away in a few days. (Ironically, a related product - [[ASIN:B000BRSHXE Sebamed Moisturing Cream, Sensitive Skin]] - is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found that works and doesn&#x27;t trigger breakouts. I learned about it because I found this face/body wash product, so in a way buying this stuff wasn&#x27;t a total mistake.)</li>
            <li> So gentle on my troubled skin. I use it everyday on my entire body. Don&#x27;t at all drying.</li>
            <li> Love this facewash! Can&#x27;t switch to anything else.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  I leaves my skin feeling clean without any residue.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, psoriasis, eczema, back acne, and food allergies so finding products can be difficult for me. The only thing I&#x27;ve been able to use is California Baby Super Sensitive Wash and Cetaphil. Cal Baby is too expensive and Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t lather so I&#x27;ve been looking for something a little cheaper that actually lathers. Sebamed is exactly this. I use it on my face and body and I don&#x27;t get itchy afterward like I do with so many other products. I moisturize immediately after showing with CeraVe products because I couldn&#x27;t imagine switching from those. This combination has improved my skin drastically. My skin is soft and my back acne is actually starting to clear up, which also probably has something to do with me not touching it as much because I&#x27;m not as itchy as I used to be. I highly recommend this product! I picked mine up at CVS.</li>
            <li> I use this to bathe my 93 YO father who has horribly dry skin. Sebamed is the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t worsen his dry skin condition. I will continue to use it exclusively for him.</li>
            <li> I tried this brand after seeing it in Costco. I was attracted to the unique pH 5.5 and \\&quot;soap-freeness\\&quot; of this product. I have very sensitive skin and have discovered that I&#x27;m allergic to numerous skin care products. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried everything from Cetaphil to Chanel to La Mer, but this product is not only the Best Bang for your Buck$, It also WORKS! It ever so gently removes eye make-up, EVEN waterproof eyeliner...it leaves your fresh feeling fresh &amp; clean, but not dry or filmy, and it&#x27;s super gentle. I also love their Hand &amp; Nail Balm. [[ASIN:B000BRPMJQ Sebamed Hand &amp; Nail Balm for Sensitive Skin 2.6 oz (75 ml)]]</li>
            <li> I was looking for a chemical free type lotion and ran across this brand at a Costco road show, I had never heard of it before. I was intrigued by the neutral ph balance. The lady began speaking of the body wash and had me feel her arm, it was very smooth, she proceeded to tell me she doesn&#x27;t use lotion. I wasn&#x27;t sure I believed her, and I wasn&#x27;t really looking for body wash, but I bought it to try anyways. She was right! I used to be the lotion queen, but the wash really works.  My skin is very smooth, everywhere. I would have to use lotion after the shower especially on my legs, but now it&#x27;s like I already have the lotion on. The wonder of this product is that it is suitable to wash every part of my body. I would have a product for face, a product for down under and a body wash. Now I only need to use SebaMed.</li>
            <li> Use as body wash too.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry and tight...best soap ever (even over spa/cosmetic company lines!).</li>
            <li> Does this work like the intimate wash?</li>
            <li> I have tried many face wash products through the years and this one is the best. It leaves your face feeling clean without drying it out. My 23 year old daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to help clear my blemishes</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have sensitive facial skin and Sebamed is gentle and leaves your face soft not dry. It&#x27;s the only cleanser I use</li>
            <li> wife likes it good price</li>
            <li> Hydrates skin and kills facial acne. Best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> I found this out at Costco and figured what the heck.  My son has milk, egg, peanut allergies and VERY sensitive skin.  We have been through every brand of high dollar non-toxic organic bath soaps, lotions and what not and have never really found something that really agrees with his skin.  Sebamed is a life, or is thins case, skin saver.  My kids come out of the tub so soft that I don&#x27;t even need to lube them up with skin lotions now.  It has a very pleasant scent and does the job of cleaning very well.  I would recommend this to anyone with or without sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 years now, and it is exactly what I needed.  I have dry skin, so my dermatologist suggested I use soap that contains moisture creams, which worked fine for a few years until my skin starting itching in places.  I then tried going back to regular soap, believing perhaps the cream or scent in the moisture soaps might be the cause.  At first it seemed ok, but eventually my skin starting itching again.  I saw this product at Costco and looked into it online.  The reviews were very favorable, so I tried it.  So far it has worked.  I have not itched since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not cheap, but well worth it if you need something for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product to avoid soap sensitive skin.  It is gentle enough to use on your face as well as your entire body.  Pleasant smell.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive but worth the money. Excellent face and body wash - low on irritating chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best products tested by independent agencies in Germany.</li>
            <li> everyday my daughter use it！&lt;br /&gt;long times ago I buy frist bottle in china,its good! so we always use it !</li>
            <li> I order this cleaner for our household. I love that I can use it and if I am taking a bath with my toddler, that she and I can share the same soap,even though most of the time, she uses SebaMed baby or some other kid formulated cleaner. I also love that I can use it on my face as well as my body. Love the smell; definately refreshing.</li>
            <li> The best and delivered quickly. Only soap equivalent that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin yet cleans.</li>
            <li> Started using sebamed a couple of years ago.  I&#x27;m 50, so have some changing/aging skin, but I really like that this product is not harsh, not creamy, not oily.  It&#x27;s just right.  The smell bothered me for a long time, but now I don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebamed products for the past 7 years. I moved to the US a year ago and came with a supply of the products. When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream. I found Sebamed here but the packaging was different. I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of. However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were right. It even smells the same, so I will definitely buy again from Amazon when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Since moving to the desert my entire family developed terrible dry itchy skin.  This wash gives me that squeaky clean antiseptic feeling like I am really really clean but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make any of us itch.  Dry patches and eczema on myself and my child have cleared up.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. Best price, too. Service is fast and product is as advertized. Not much else to be said.</li>
            <li> I try it before I order a brand new bottle of it online. I have acne problem for my face. It doesn&#x27;t make my face dry or feel hurt. It gently washes my face. My sisters also use it as make up remover. We all like the products!!! I would like to try other products of it sometime.</li>
            <li> These PH skin friendly soaps haven&#x27;t usually been my favorite.  I tried using the Cetaphil brand for a while, but gave up on it because it didn&#x27;t do any better at cleaning my face than just plain water does, though it never dried out my face.  Then I tried the Purpose brand which is better at cleaning off dirt but leaves my face a bit dry.  Then I got this and wow-  I get the cleanliness I got from the purpose brand along with the moisture retention of the Cetaphil brand.  And it has a really nice scent to it to boot! Fresh and not overpowering.  Kind of smells like aloe.  I use this not only to wash my face but also my hands.  I haven&#x27;t used it as a body wash yet, but I will this summer when I go camping.  It&#x27;ll be so convenient to have an all in one soap for traveling.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and fresh after using the Sebamed Face and Body Wash.  Will continue to use and recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I dilute as instructed and use for shampoo!  I have very sensitive skin, and most shampoos irritate my scalp, this works good for me!</li>
            <li> Sebamed leaves you feeling clean without the dryness often felt with soap products.  It rinses easily,  I highly recommnd if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the item after my friend recommended it. To be honest, I was expecting better results.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to differentiate from other regular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it with no too much expectation.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very sensitive skin and this is the only body wash that keeps my skin clear of a red rash. You only need a small amount to soap your whole body so it last a long time. It is well worth the amount of money that is charged for this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin very dry after taking a shower. I sometimes forget to put on body lotion, so this wash helps me to keep my skin from extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I love the way I feel clean and fresh without feeling stripped of moisture. The scent is quite refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> This body wash seems pricey compared to others but it lasts a long time in this convenient pump.  It lathers and rinses well.  It has a clean, fresh scent and more importantly, I&#x27;m not itchy from dry skin after a shower.  As a face wash it may be too drying but as a body wash it is excellent.  This is the only brand I use.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this over in Germany.  Huge bottle for a good price--far cheaper than retail prices.  Could never find it at my local Costco.  My skin can be picky, and half of the scents out there are too feminine or mediciney smelling.  This has a great herbal scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face and body washes I&#x27;ve ever used. It isn&#x27;t soap, and it doesn&#x27;t really lather, however that isn&#x27;t necessary for getting clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne, and other soaps were causing more and more breakouts. Once I started using this, they&#x27;ve decreased significantly.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a color, slightly green (at least that&#x27;s from one I purchased in the store), but that doesn&#x27;t seem to cause me any issues.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell, but the scent isn&#x27;t from fragrance but the ingredients, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin. It is very light and I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;This should last for a pretty long time (compared with the price and size of other face wash tubes).&lt;br /&gt;You can wash your entire body with this, and not worry about drying.&lt;br /&gt;The pump also makes it last a lot longer. I use 2-3 pumps for my face and body.</li>
            <li> We have found this product to be good for my husband.  He has diabetes and doctored for a long time for dry, itchy skin. I found this at a Costco a few years ago and have ordered it from Amazon ever since.</li>
            <li> I grew up with this soap in Germany. Had a few acne pimples here and there but nothing dramatic. Moved to the US for college, started using American skin care products and my skin kept getting worse. Five years later I finally remembered Seba Med and my skin is slowly clearing up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave 4 stars because I absolutely hate its scent. Too artificial, too strong, doesn&#x27;t rinse off completely. It also seems to leave my skin rather dry. (My skin is getting flaky, which has previously only happened with products containing Salicylic Acid or Benzoyl Peroxide.)</li>
            <li> In 2006, I went to The Philippines for business and a vacation too. Before leaving, I made certain that I took something to prevent malaria. The drug I was given had an unpleasant  side effect. My first layer of skin on my hands started to peel. It was worse on my left hand. In fact, you can see the before and after pictures in the image section on the main page. Afterwards, I used high quality creams and lotions to reverse the damage, without any success. Also, I continued to use cheap bar soaps as I had always used. For years, nothing worked. I was beginning to believe that I would take this problem to my grave. A few weeks ago, my Rite Aid pharmacy was selling this at a steep discount and I bought two containers. What could I possibly lose, I said to myself? I took one container to work and used Sebamed when I had to wash up at work. I was not going to use the mens room&#x27;s pink soap that was supplied for free. I was determined to use this product and see if I could get rid of this problem once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the photos I posted! Can you believe it?? In two weeks, my skin is finally well on its way to recovery. I still have a ways to go since some spots have not healed completely, as you can see. There will be no more bar soaps in this house when showering or washing up after a job around the house.  Do yourself a favor and try this. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great on my daughter&#x27;s eczema. Not too harsh. Not sure if this is fragrance free as it definitely has a pleasant scent. This could be a natural scent though. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my daughter&#x27;s skin, but it doesn&#x27;t strip her skin of moisture either. It still cleans well too and I use it to wash my kids&#x27; hair too. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> it has mild pleasant fragrance, it also feels mild but cleanse very well. very gentle even for babies. love it big time.</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash helps my dry skin and keeps it smooth. It goes a long way you do not need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product worth the money</li>
            <li> I tried this product by chance through samples from Costco. I was hooked. I have been graced with great skin my entire life, but this product changed my skin care regime. It is the only one that has cleared my pores and kept them clean, such as the blackheads on my nose (the \\&quot;strips\\&quot; are only temporary). I don&#x27;t breakout, but Sebamed has improved my skin even more. I HIGHLY recommend it and even push it on my friends and have changed at least a few to users.  I sometimes feel like I should be selling for them!</li>
            <li> Best product I have came across. Very mild and gentle but strong enough to give a clean feeling. Very light fragrance. this product is so gentle I use it to give my toodlers a bath. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right.  This is the perfect body wash.  I hesitate to call it soap, because it doesn&#x27;t contain the high ph of all american soap/body wash products.  In fact, until recently, it could only be purchased by mail directly from the company, because it didn&#x27;t meet the U.S. minimum ph requirements for &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.  Duh.  I don&#x27;t get it…the low ph means your skin is never dried out or irritated.  I&#x27;ve used this to wash out and clean cuts/abrasions on people and pets and it works great.  Gentle and cleansing, but it doesn&#x27;t sting.  And most importantly...(TMI warning here) ATTENTION ALL WOMEN…this is THE product you should be using to clean your lady parts!  Forget douching, feminine sprays, or constant washing…it is incompatible with the normal ph, causing said parts to go into overdrive to compensate…Please forgive me for being indelicate, but this soap is a marvel, and a well-kept secret.  Not only will YOU be delighted, your boyfriend/husband/partner/lover will thank you.</li>
            <li> Good quality and great fresh smell. Lasts for a long time. I like the large bottles. The pumps on the small ones don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap.  Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first body wash that has combined all the elements. It smells good, cleans well, and most importantly does not in any way irritate my skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It does not leave a film or residue on your skin. Does not dry your skin out. Leaves you feeling soft. I love the large bottle I get from here that you cannot find in stores.</li>
            <li> Im very pleased with the product and the prompt delivery.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Update Jan 8, 2015:  This product is still by far the one of the best products that has worked for my teenage daughter for her acne.  (Others have worked for short time)  She has gotten some dryness but not sure if it&#x27;s caused by our water.  On Guam, we have what they call \\&quot;hard water\\&quot; (high chlorine).  Still, overall, it&#x27;s the best product for her.....again, not for me as I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now and my once-majorly-oily-skin is now drying out.  I still give it four stars because of this reason.........&lt;br /&gt;Original post on April 14, 2013:  Purchased this product after doing online research looking for something to help with my teenage daughter&#x27;s acne problem.  Before purchasing this, I bought her face wash that contained salicylic acid.  Some had fragrances that her doctor theorized maybe causing her to break out even more.  Add to this, she plays sports and we live on a beautiful tropical island.  I saw this product online and discovered that Amazon carried it and can opt the Subscribe-and-Save on this product (free shipping!)  It arrived mid-January (it&#x27;s now mid April) and am pleased to report it has really helped not only with the acne on her face but also her back.  I gave it a four star because when I started to use the product shortly after my daughter, it started to dry my face so I used it infrequently.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t have this issue, though, so that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s good for teenagers rather than older folks like me.  Since May to July are the hotter months, we plan to continue assessing to see whether this is a keeper.  So far, it&#x27;s the only product that is working for her.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and tend to get rashes. This body wash is refreshing and leaves no film on my skin. I use it daily</li>
            <li> Use this as a face wash besides a body wash. Like it more for a face wash. Have combination skin and this wash makes my face feel wonderful. Like better than anything found in a drug store.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve had eczema since a kid and this is the only non-soap body wash that is does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li> My skin used to be dry and a bit &#x27;scaly&#x27;. Since using this my skin has improved dramatically with no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Anything SebaMed is of excellent quality and I have enjoyed this product as my primary shower soap. Great smell and last a long time. Study their website and you will see what kind of company they are. Very impressive!</li>
            <li> I love this soapless soap.  It is so gentle on my skin.  I buy it three of the largest size bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> This is quite simply an amazing product.  We use it in the shower as a body wash.  My skin has (honestly) never felt better.  My skin feels so smooth and hydrated.  I never, ever get flakey skin on my legs or elbows anymore - even during harsh winters.  There is no tightness after washing with this product, just plumpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems pricey, but another thing I love about this product is that it is verrrrry spreadable.  I use less than a pump to clean my whole body.  I&#x27;d say I use about 3/4 pump.  And I don&#x27;t even have to make an effort to make it go that far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap is bad for your skin.  Stop using soap.  Use this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for a few years now. The whole family uses it on a daily basis. Sure it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am very upset with the results of this product.  I had really bad acne as a teenager but now in my twenties I just have a few flare ups here and there but nothing major.  However, after using this product for about 5 days my skin is terrible.  It is dry, red, and I have a ton of breakouts.  I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap free cleanser ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this originally in Costco. I ran out and haven&#x27;t been able to find it. I love the fact this isn&#x27;t like soap.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Very mild scent. Great for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and will likely be buying another bottle when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, the bottle I received had a broken pump. The pump part never popped up after turning it, so I had to buy an additional empty pump bottle.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect face &amp; body wash.  i used to ask friends visiting from germany to bring it to NYC, i am happy i found it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how gentle or effective this is because I could not get passed the smell. It&#x27;s not good. I would&#x27;ve expected I scented but this definitely has a musty, weird smell. Just to see if it was a bad bottle, I came across this item at two major retailers and it still smelled the same! Yuck! I have other Sebamed products and like them very much, but I have no idea what they&#x27;re thinking with the smell of this. I&#x27;ll find something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use on my acne-prone face, but decided against it because the fragrance is so overpowering. I&#x27;m worried about the fragrance alone irritating the sensitive skin on my face. Also, the container is enormous (didn&#x27;t realize this upon purchasing...woops!), so there&#x27;s no room for it on the sink. It lives in the shower now, and I&#x27;m trying to get through the bottle by using it as a body wash. It works pretty well for this purpose, but the smell and color is similar to a generic hand soap you&#x27;d find in a gas station bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have used  this product  for years and like the way it rinses off completely.  No soap residue.  I have used other body washes only to find that my wash cloths were dingy with residue that didn&#x27;t wash out even after washing with hot water and bleach.  If you can&#x27;t get it out of the wash cloths in the laundry why would you want it on your body?  Recently I ordered the shampoo and it also washes out well and seems to rid hair of build up from other hair products.  It also far outlasted bar soap.  I recommend the body wash and the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  I wish is was more affordable, but I&#x27;m willing to pay.</li>
            <li> Verynice clean and refreshing</li>
            <li> Received on time works great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco for the first time, after one use I never used soap again. Then they stopped carrying it. Thanks to Amazon for carrying Sebamed. My skin never felt better. It smells great clean and light, even my husband loves it.  I have been using the body wash for more then 3 years.  I use this on my face too!  No more messy soaps in the shower.  No surprise this product is made in Europe.</li>
            <li> This is the only line of siap that is gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin. Been using it since he was 3 months</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty but it cleans my sensitive, acne-prone skin without over drying or causing breakouts. A little goes a long way - a quarter squirt into the hand will do for the face and one full pump onto a mesh pouf for the rest of the body. It leaves my skin clean and soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave itchy residue.</li>
            <li> I have used this product exclusively for about 5 years.  It&#x27;s very gentle, yet an effective cleanser.  My doctor recommended it for use after hemorrhoid surgery.  I now use it head to toe, as I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My family really likes this product.  Gets you clean without drying out your skin or smelling too &amp;#34;purfumey&amp;#34;.  Good for those with sensitive/easily irritated skin or during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> It is the best product ever! Now my whole family is using also makes skin feel so good, but CLEANS</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I used to use Dove, but after years of sun, my skin was looking like my husband&#x27;s 90-year old grandmother&#x27;s. It is much improved after switching to Sebamed.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face only, and I still go through it!  It has a clean fresh smell and leaves skin feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> other soaps cause me to develop rashes, this doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;cleans very well, lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> great stuff, but much cheaper over at the big box store</li>
            <li> I have been using Sebamed products for over 11 years and may recommend them to anyone with sensitive skin.  I started using this product in Germany where I lived at the time, now I live in the US, and, thanks to Amazon, I can get it here.  Perfect product, reasonable price and excellent results.  Fast and troublesome delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and no leakage. Love SebaMed and sometimes it is so hard to find in the stores. Have noticed a difference in skin with my face and it does not break out as often.</li>
            <li> I use this as a body wash. I have oily skin and it cleans well without drying my skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> The wash smells bad like a strong chemical and irritates my skin on my face just as much as regular body wash or shampoo.  The only thing that has worked for me is Kirklands Natural Citrus Body wash.  I am switching back but decided to try this first since it was recommended by a lot on amazon.  May work for you, but definitely didn&#x27;t for me.  If it don&#x27;t for you, try Kirklands.</li>
            <li> Made my fiance&#x27;s and my acne worse....</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations! Would recommend without reservation!&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
            <li> Great for my kid who has mild eczema. Does not dry his skin like other baby body washes. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the PH value of this product which also absorbs quickly and the pump that goes with it is very convenient to use</li>
            <li> this is a good body wash, good for any skin and your face too, i recomend it to everybody, realy good</li>
            <li> Works alright, bought it for a 14 year old and she complained in the begining of using it that she thought it was causing her to break out and made her itchy, although she&#x27;s still using it so I assume it is not as bad as she&#x27;d thought in the begining.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for about half of my lifetime, and this product works really well with my oily skin.  I&#x27;ve used MANY of the other big names in skincare (Proactive, Murad, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena,  etc. etc.)  and this is my favorite.  It&#x27;s gentle and since I&#x27;ve started using it, my skin has looked the best it has looked in many years (maybe my whole adult life).  I have also used the moisturizer, and it like them both.</li>
            <li> Being from Germany, I use SEBAMED since 1978.&lt;br /&gt;A skin doctor recommended SEBAMED to me.&lt;br /&gt;I lost all my skin problems and never used anything else&lt;br /&gt;until today even for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;7 stars..... but only 5 possible</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother (94yo) because she was having he skin tear while toweling dry after showering. Since she&#x27;s been using the Sebamed, she no longer has a problem with her skin.</li>
            <li> This body wash works great. We use it with a body sponge and it really cleans well. Smell is fresh and I always come out of the shower feeling like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> As a teenager, I had perfectly clear skin.  Once I hit my late 20&#x27;s, I developed adult-onset acne.  Now that I&#x27;m 40, I&#x27;m busy combatting wrinkles along with the acne.  Sebamd takes care of my acne without drying out my face.  I&#x27;m left with truly clean skin, clear pores, and no residue.  My skin feels smooth and healthy.  I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and could not be happier!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face soap - best I have ever used.  Over the years I have used the SebaMed bars as well.  Leaves your face clean, smooth, and soft. The PH balance thing really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> My one and only complaint is the dispenser!  This order was for two bottles.  Both pumps have quit working before even a fourth of the wash was gone.  The bottles arrived dented so maybe that explains the faulty pumps.  I have no complaints about the wash itself.  Now, however, it&#x27;s a chore to use it .  Not a happy camper!</li>
            <li> I first bought this at a Costco store.  For whatever reason they stopped carrying it in the store which is one of the things I hate about Costco as this seems far too common, however, they do carry it at their website or on Amazon through Costco at a much increased price.  It is a fine product though and I guess if you really like it you will pay the money.  Still looking at Costco to see if they start carrying it again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I wash very time with it I feel clean and sift no residue love love love it works great for eczema on my baby  I am 48 and my skin feels and looks amazing</li>
            <li> USE IT ALL THE TIME. DOES NOT MAKE THE SKIN FEEL DRY, EVEN IN AZ.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sebamed for years now. It really helps my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best wash I have ever used--all through this hot and humid summer no heat rash or bumps or anything else--great for face also--gets all the makeup off-not drying -will use forever</li>
            <li> Let me just say don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.  I bought this for my daughter because she had bad acne on her back and chest and nothing worked for her.  I saw this at Costco and I thought why not give it a try.  After about a month all of her acne was gone! She didn&#x27;t even realize that all of her acne was gone until we were in a dressing room trying clothes on and I saw her clear back and I freaked out.  She couldn&#x27;t believe it either.  She thought it was just another product that I made her try it.  Believe me I bought everything from the dermatologist prescription to over the counter products to ProActive.  She tried them all.  This smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Would not use any other Body wash.  It does not leave soap scum in the tub.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing soap, especially if you have skin problems. It does what it says without hype and without too much perfume/scent.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this after reading all of the positive reviews. I have mild eczema on legs, and am allergic to soap, as well as fragrances. After using the Sebamed for about 4 days, my skin began to itch and burn and my eczema had flared up. I stopped using the Sebamad, and began using my Dermalogica body wash, and after a day, I was fine and I&#x27;m no longer itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Sebamed is great for some sensitive skin types, but just not for people who are allergic to fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and most soaps and cleansers make me very dry or very irritated, lots of them give me a rash.  I got a free sample of Sebamed, and that was all it took.  I love it, my daughter loves it, even my husband loves it.  Our faces are soft, clear and not flaky.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> BEST body wash for those of us with sensitive skin! Won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> love this product, so gentle and my skin feels great, highly recommend if you have combination skin really balances it out</li>
            <li> I WAS HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY WITH MY SKIN AND I GAVE SEBAMED A TRY. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD NEVER GO BACK TO SOAP--EVEN MY EXPENSIVE BODY WASHES. MY SKIN IS SO BALANCED NOW. CAN BE FOUND IN CVS STORES AND THROUGH AMAZON.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this PH5 body wash, leaves your skin so nice and never feeling dry.</li>
            <li> i have rosacea and acne prone skin. this face wash works better than all other washes i have tried. i have tried many thru the years. costco use to sell it but now i find amazons price to be second to costco.  it deep cleans the oil but never leaves my skin feeling dry. try it i think you may like it as well!</li>
            <li> Smells great-  Aroma doesn&#x27;t knock you to the ground like some of the acrid store-bought liquid washes/ soaps.  I am however convinced that the U.S. version is slightly more potent than the German version.  I used to stock up on this product during my multiple trips to Germany as it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin like other soap. Little pricey.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 1oz from the travel section of a pharmacy; and was in love with this product after the first use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a body wash that didn&#x27;t leave my skin so dry. I FOUND IT!!!!! Sebamed is worth it&#x27;s weight in Gold!!!</li>
            <li> I returned all the Sebamed products I ordered since all the rest had a fragrance to them.  My skin is so sensitive that if there is any perfume/parfum in it, my face is toast.  I instead tried the Earth Science Clarifying cleansing lotion and Daily moisturizing lotion and Apricot night cream.  No problem, they have an entire fragrance free line and my face is so happy!  I picked up my first items at my local Fred Meyers, but found their website and they offer cheaper prices $$ and FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25.  That is a deal for me.</li>
            <li> I totally do not believe all the good reviews on here! This is the worst facial wash I have ever used! First off, I fell for the whole \\&quot;PH balanced is good / soap is bad\\&quot; pitch - and that may be true but I know perfume so strong it stung my eyes the first time I went to wash my face with it is BAD, BAD, BAD! And I&#x27;m not saying it got in my eyes, just the smell of it hurt my eyes and nose!&lt;br /&gt;But like an idiot, I still went ahead and washed my face with it... the next day I woke up to itchy skin and a million little pimples all over my forehead, chin and around my hairline. And yet at first I didn&#x27;t think it was caused by the wash but was maybe caused by some freaky hormonal thing. The thing is tho, other than the occasional pimple on my chin, I have very clear skin... So I kept using it and my face kept getting worse until finally my boyfriend asked what the hell was going on with my face. I told him I didn&#x27;t know, my face just started breaking out! He asked if I had changed soaps and that&#x27;s when it hit me! That blue - and I mean ELECTRIC BLUE crap I had been smearing on my face must be the culprit!&lt;br /&gt;That was 2 days ago and my face is now clear and no longer itchy. Dyes and perfume are toxic to your skin! I&#x27;m going to avoid this product like the plague!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive but I like the fact that it is Neurtal PH - don&#x27;t dry skin out. smells good.</li>
            <li> I came to Sebamed first through the Cleansing Oil for Body which I like but it doesn&#x27;t work very well with my nylon washcloth so I went looking for another gentle, moisturizing body wash.&lt;br /&gt;This works really well.  It lathers great, it doesn&#x27;t have a saccharine sweet fragrance (i hate floral and fruity scents) and it is ph balanced.&lt;br /&gt;My nephews have excema and I plan to let them try this out and I&#x27;ll subscribe if it helps them.  Lately I have been cleaning up my diet and health &amp; beauty regimen--that is trying to remove chemicals and processed products.  As a organ, the ph of the skin profoundly affects its ability to function and I really appreciate that this is ph balanced.  I think this will go a long way toward bolstering healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is true that the smell while not offensive, it is not the best either. The smell does not linger on your skin, but the benefits do. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first body wash that completely takes care of any underarm odor I have. Prior to using it, I&#x27;d have to apply deodorant morning and night, and still I&#x27;d have a sour smell. With this wash, I stay smelling fresh during the day and night, a first for me. My skin feels clean without dryness, and the scent of the product is pleasing enough. I will absolutely continue using this product, and I want to try others in the line.</li>
            <li> Very effective cleanser. Leaves no soapy residue. Cuts facial oils and grime very well. Highly recommended and very cost affective.</li>
            <li> Costco used to carry this but then they quit.  Luckily I found it here.  It never leaves your skin dry or itchy and has no overpowering smell.  Everything is just right about it, including the Ph of 5.5</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin.  The problem we cannot buy it locally.  It was once available at Costco, but they have since quit carrying it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years.  I hope I never have to do without it.  It takes off even eye makeup!</li>
            <li> I tried this from Costco and it burned my face...the smell alone is unbareable....now I have a rash from the burn on my face.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! When I switched to this rather than all the myriad soaps I&#x27;ve tried it helped to control that horrible itching from allergies and dry skin. I just love it and swear by it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!! As stated for sensitive skin it has really been great for my daughter&#x27;s skin.  We also love the larger size - it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> This is the best facewash.  It&#x27;s gentle and smells wonderful, like violets.  I can gently wash my eyelids and eyelashes with this wash and it does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sebamed Face and Body Wash for several years and it is the only body wash I will use.  It cleans well without drying out the skin.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I,ve been using this on my sensitive skin face for a few years now, and I like how it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  Works great at cleaning.  Nice fresh scent.  I don&#x27;t use anything else to wash my face, just this.</li>
            <li> We love all of the Sebamed products. So good for your skin! Even my 84 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s delicate skin looks so healthy using this product. You will not be sorry for trying this...you will become a convert and start using the other products in the line...you skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> Since I have started using Sebamed my adult acne has cleared up and I have not have any problems with fungal infections or other skin irritations. I would suggest everyone try it!</li>
            <li> This is the best face cleaning product I could find on the market.  Although it&#x27;s pricey, it lasts long and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh without the use of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I use this body wash.  I am on the oily side of things and she is on the dry side.  It seems to be strong enough to cut through my oils and gentle enough to not completely dry out her skin.  We have been using this for well over a year and I reorder it each time we run out.  It does not have a strong scent, just leaves the skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love this product. In one use it&#x27;s made my skin feel softer, given it more color and decreased the saggy look on my right cheek. It&#x27;s very gentle. A bit overly perfumed but that&#x27;s my only criticism of the product. I do feel from using it that it does what it says. I bought two of these bottles for a total of $14 at the local supermarket so the price is a bit steep however for those who can&#x27;t find it locally you can order it here. I had purchased it on sale but the regular price at the supermarket is $9.99. I won&#x27;t use anything else again for my face or body except for this wonderful product. I had purchased the soap bars but this is way better! There is a good amount of it so it should last a while. The flakes on my skin fell off after using this and my skin was not left irritated. I&#x27;m happy with the results and look forward to more positive results from Sebamed. I may try using this as a shampoo or just purchase the shampoo here on amazon as i can&#x27;t find the shampoo or conditioner locally.</li>
            <li> I would give it more stars if they were available. I have dry, sensitive skin  and psoriasis. I was leary at first to use this product but I am so glad I tried it.  I love the way it lathers ( most soap for sensitive skin doesnt) and I LOVE the fresh clean smell.  I would highly recommend this product . I also purchased some of the moisturizing lotion and I like it too. Leaves my skin soft not vreasy and it doesn&#x27;t make m  itch.  Has a slight fragrance. I wish it smelled more like to soap.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Love this product, so gentle on face and body. With the auto-order program, easy to make sure I have it on hand.</li>
            <li> My ophthalmologist suggested that I had &amp;#34;dry eyes&amp;#34; when I complained about burning and the constant need to put drops in my eyes.  When I started washing my face with Sebamed (pH balanced) face wash, the problem - caused by washing my face with strong body liquid soap - disappeared.  I keep a supply in the shower and at the sink and only wash my (rather oily) face with it.  Great stuff.  I told my ophthalmologist during my next eye exam and he was pleased, but had no clue that soap could have been the cause of my problem.</li>
            <li> It is great ph balance and just enough suds to make your face feel very clean and it smells great. I love all Seba med products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally disappointed and surprised to see so many good reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a normal active perspiring man, especially if you go to a gym -- no doubt you&#x27;ll stink even after a good bath using this body wash lol. Perhaps, that&#x27;s due to absence of soap, this body wash doesn&#x27;t work as a body wash. Maybe all that &amp;#34;soap and alkali-free&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;pH blah-blah&amp;#34; implies that it doesn&#x27;t clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I found the smell of it too synthetic, strong and disturbing. Finally, after a couple of weeks of using this body wash I gave up and ordered another product.</li>
            <li> It caused breakout on me so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I Love this product! I have been living with skin allergies all of my life and since I have been using this product I don&#x27;t have any rashes, love love this wash!</li>
            <li> Perfect for skin.  I&#x27;ve tried all the rest.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Completely controls my eczema with regular use and I had terrible eczema on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is irritated by regular cleansers, so I tried this when I found it at Costco. I like the fact that this cleanser does not irritate and how clean it makes my face feel. No oily feeling when I am done cleansing. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for dry or irritated skin. Better price at Costco when they have it on the road shows, but this will do.</li>
            <li> I love this product for so many reasons. It is great for my skin and it makes you feel so clean, we even use it on our hair occasionally to get rid of any build up from the other shampoos.</li>
            <li> My wife it in love with this product and can&#x27;t seem to go without. &amp;#34;A happy wife a happy life&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is a great product, whether you have skin issues or not. I use it to cleanse my face, and it takes the smallest amount to lather and clean. It is not drying, and leaves your skin feeling great. I bought the 33.8 oz size and it will last forever! My daughter and her friends keep taking \\&quot;samples\\&quot; home to try it. It works wonders on acne.</li>
            <li> I saw this on sale at CVS Pharmacy (buy one get one free). I thought I would use it after reading so many on line reviews of how great it was. I thought the PH balance would help. I had not need to change products for body and face - but wanted to try something different. On the fourth day, I woke up with a bunch of tiny whiteheads all over by face - I found out it was mila.  I could not stand the itching on body. I can only surmise that this product did not work for me - I had not changed anything else but face and body wash - no new detergents for washing clothes ...ect..So I could only attribute an allergic reaction to this product. After talking to my doctor about it - she said I was one of the very few that develops reaction to product. I stopped using it - reverted to my original cleanse and in two days problem solved.  I really wanted this product to work for me but it did not. I am glad it works for others. I took the product to CVS Pharmacy to get my refund. I would be interested in knowing if others have had an allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> great face wash, i have ordered it a few times now.</li>
            <li> The bottle was delivered timely, but the pump which is already installed in the bottle is broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sebamed face/body wash for about two years.  I live in Las Vegas where the air is extremely dry.  Using most other soaps caused my skin to itch uncomfortably.  I decided to try this product and after about two weeks the problem was solved.</li>
            <li> We live in a dry, sometimes very windy state, Sebamed Face and Body Wash has helped reduce the dryness on the body and face.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gentle on your skin and you can really use it on your face as well. Smells fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for the last couple of years already and the skin feels the difference when switching with other products.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin so I did not break out in a rash. However, the fragrance is WAY TOO STRONG!. I do not get any in my eyes but the strong scent makes my eyes burn! I try to use it diluted and that helps a little. I bought this in CVS for 70% off the regular price (should&#x27;ve been a warning) , otherwise I would definitely return it.</li>
            <li> So excited to try this, as I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experience with other Sebamed products. Unfortunately, due to haphazard packing, the bottle leaked &amp; spilled product all over the inside of the package, &amp; onto the other items I purchased with it. At least it didn&#x27;t stain anything else, so I&#x27;m grateful for that small favor at least. However, as there was nothing left of the product by the time I received it, I was unable to try it. Disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is great for my little toddler who suffers from eczema. It is a mild cleanser and the only one that has worked for us.</li>
            <li> This body wash is so much better than Moisturizing SOAPS! I would not go back to even the most gentle soap.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a lovely fragrance and it&#x27;s not a sudsy wash ~you&#x27;ll get used to that. But it makes your skin feel its healthiest and softest!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best soap to use. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face dried out and tight. Cleans very well and leaves my face feeling good. I highly recommend this soap for any skin type. I noticed my skin looking and feeling better within a week. Doesn&#x27;t have over powering fragrances, which is very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Its pricey but the product will last much longer than any other brand&lt;br /&gt;because a little goes a long way. Refreshing &amp; gentle!</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower as my facial cleanser.  Most other products I have used tend to dry my face out, but this one is perfect.  It has a unique smell that I like and it is just thick enough that it applies very well to the face even if you have wet hands.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous - Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin this is perfect for you I love it!</li>
            <li> I use SebaMed exclusively now, as both face and body wash.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  I like everything about it except the fragrance - smells a bit like hand soap in hospitals or doctors&#x27; offices.  Would be 5 stars if it were unscented.</li>
            <li> Great face and body wash, which is also useable as a shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin, but cleans well. Fragrance is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love Sebamed. It is all I use now for showers. No more soap for me.</li>
            <li> I had a friend tell me about this.  I live in CO where it is very dry.  My husband and I both shower with this.  I feel like it keeps my skin very moisturized!</li>
            <li> I don;&#x27;t use anything elese anymore.</li>
            <li> I tried this body wash after reading reviews here on Amazon. I was skeptical at first, and the large bottle appeared to have a hefty price tag, but after comparing it to other body washes, I found it was actually cheaper ounce-per-ounce. I have used this for over a month and I noticed a huge difference in my skin. It is soft and I need less lotion than I normally wear. My boyfriend has also complimented my soft skin! I love that it is odorless so I can pair it with my favorite perfume, and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Very gentle product great for greasy skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is a great body wash and can also be used as a shampoo.  I have Psoriasis and&lt;br /&gt;this is a must product.  I found my best price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great stuff arrived on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years, really helps relieve dry skin problems caused by heated homes in winter.</li>
            <li> I was developing dry skin in the winter...winter eczema my dermatologist said.  Started using this and it cleared right up.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing I have ever used. I have psoriasis and very sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t remember how I Was introduced this but God help them!! I am amazed at this product I don&#x27;t itch any more. My skin is completely better. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> product is OK, I used the entire bottle, and had stop. It&#x27;s a body wash without foam, and that a bit unusual. I thought I&#x27;ll get used to it, but It didn&#x27;t happen</li>
            <li> Excellent for overall use.</li>
            <li> Using it on my face cleared up my skin, and using it as a shower body wash made my skin smooth, soft and itch-free.  The scent is clean and pleasant but not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, and does not linger on the skin after drying.  I liked this so much that I tried some of their other products as well.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this product religiously. She loves it. It is very nourishing to the skin. She first purchased it at Costco, But they only sell it at limited times. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s offered here on Amazon all of the time. I am giving it four stars instead of five because, for me, the fragrance is too strong. If you love a strongly scented, fresh smelling product, that will be a plus for you. However, if you prefer less strongly scented, or unscented product, as I do, due to allergies, then this product may not be for you. The product itself is excellent however.</li>
            <li> Great for dry sensitive skin.  I am older with fair, thin skin.  Love this product.  It has strengthened my skin, I believe.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I just placed my 2nd order,the price seemed steep though. After going through my Amazon order history I found out the price increased by 24% in the last 8 months....a bit peeved about price inflation</li>
            <li> Only body wash that I have found that works on my sensitive skin. Finally no rash!</li>
            <li> I have looked for years for soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin to the extreme or make me break out.  I have very delicate, sensitive skin and was dealing with adult acne.  I found this soap at Costco when they were doing a special with Sebamed. Once I tried it I was very impressed because my skin, while clean and not oily, was not totally dried out.  This is the only body/face soap my husband or I use anymore.  He likes it because it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  I like it because it isn&#x27;t ruining the protective lipid barrier of my skin.  I would recommend this to any skin type and will continue using.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this cleanser.  It is gentle and suitable for a whole body wash and shampoo that leaves you feeling fresh and clean without leaving a residue or feeling dry (I sometimes forget to apply moisturizer after a shower ).  This product is far superior to cetaphil and aveeno products.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. Well, actually, seborrheic dermatitis, which means my skin is not only sensitive but gets pretty dry and flaky. I also try to use products that don&#x27;t test on animals. And for bathroom products, that&#x27;s not very easy to find. Well, maybe it is at Whole Foods but not at a regular grocery store. So, I was surprised when I was at Costco and came across this body wash and that it had the cruelty free icon on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was put off by the label and the name. It just seemed very clinical and medicinal. But I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Though I&#x27;ve been committed to trying cruelty free products, I&#x27;ve unfortunately found that some of those products aggravated my skin (and yes, I realize it&#x27;s possibly because they don&#x27;t have the same testing standards as the products that do test on animals). So, maybe a more clinical kind of product is what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have commented on the smell. I think the closest comparison I could come up with when trying to describe the smell is that it&#x27;s kind of like baby powder, but not quite as good. But certainly not unpleasant, at least to me. But my focus is on the results. When I used this, my skin felt great. Not itchy, not flaky. Just moist and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having gone through all the products I&#x27;ve tried with the conditions that I have with my skin, and to have such positive results, I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of this product. Maybe if I didn&#x27;t have issues with my skin, I&#x27;d be somewhat indifferent about it. But it has made such a difference for me, that I am solidly in the Sebamed camp.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I bought this since my children have sensitive skin,  My son (a teenager) used it and found that this cleared up any acne. He went through high school with a beautiful complexion!</li>
            <li> Have used nothing but Sebamed for three years and even take some of it when I travel.  The very best.  Washes off easily.  Leaves no aroma to interfere with your perfume.</li>
            <li> Sebamed has been a very good product for us. The large size we use lasts a long time and Face and Body Wash is effective and good for sensitive skin, too. The container works well on the counter or in the shower.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years now and ever since Cosco stopped selling it, I had to look elsewhere for this size bottle. The drugstores, CVS, Rite Aide, only offer the much smaller size and for $13. I go through it too quick to bother with.&lt;br /&gt;As it&#x27;s in my favorites, I see a notification that the price has increased by $7.00!!!!!  Ouch, Really??&lt;br /&gt;Might have to look for coupons to defray the increase somewhat.....</li>
            <li> This soap is great for sensitive skin. I use it on my face and body. It is really gentle. It doesn&#x27;t burn even if you get it in your eyes. This soap is the best!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin and so does my granddaughter.  We both love and use this as a body wash and it has helped with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash it leave my body feeling great and soft.. I never had any issues with this brand..</li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to soaps, but he can use this successfully!</li>
            <li> As someone in the health industry, I can not say enough good things about this product. Most individuals who struggle with acne tend to purchase the leading brands expecting to see results. However, our skin has an acid barrier to protect and fight off bacteria from entering pores. Most of the leading products geared towards acne are not good at maintaining that barrier, leading to multiple breakouts or even worse skin than when you start, or you break out horrendously when you stop using the product. This product is an acid on the ph scale which will maintain your skins natural layer of defense. Please give this product a try! I would recommend the small bottle first to test. I&#x27;ll probably put this review on the other Sebamed face and body wash also. This product would make an excellent body wash for those who have dry skin. Exfoliate the area with good old fashioned sugar, or salt, (please do not use course exfoliates on your face it will just spread the bacteria from breakouts to other pores, and possibly damage capillaries under the skin causing redness. ) After you exfoliate the dry areas on your arms, or legs, follow up by cleansing the area with Sebamed. I recommend using a lotion that is alcohol free. * Also note , just because a product says fragrance free, does not make it alcohol free.  I have not tried this brands lotion, I have always  recommended Cetaphil lotion, or even light olive oil!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by Sebamed.  It is very gentle while a very good cleaner.  Here in Florida she had very dry skin until she started using Sebamed.  That has been several years ago.  It is a bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best I use it and I bought one for my husband who suffers from skin problems and he only uses dermatologist recommended products he loved it too</li>
            <li> So far this has been a decent body wash that doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out like others.  The scent is enough to gag you, though. You don&#x27;t notice it when you&#x27;re rinsed off, but when you have to wash your face it&#x27;s really overwhelming.  I looked on the ingredients and the fragrance is listed pretty high up on the list.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it but may not buy again unless I find an unscented version.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous expensive face washes and this by far is my favorite!  It has cleared up my acne and keeps my face feeling really balanced.  I noticed a difference after the first time I used it and have been using it for the past 2 years.  I recently also bought their hand cream which is also amazing.  I just think this is a super good brand which is completely inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive and I&#x27;m extremely allergic to scent, and this body wash has just been very helpful for my health. It feels soothing, and because I am so allergic to scent, my whole family uses it to keep from causing me a reaction. Although it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy, it has a very clean feeling to it.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. It&#x27;s the only thing I use to get my skin squeaky clean in the shower these days. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and I think the balanced PH really helps with that.</li>
            <li> Started using Sebamed over a year ago. I have very dry sensitive skin, which gets worse in dry SoCal winter. In the past year I have noticed that the dry patches in my skin has disappeared and I get fewer break outs. I switched my kids to using this and their skin has improved as well. It doesn&#x27;t say tear free, but I haven&#x27;t seen them having an issue getting soap in their eyes yet. I switched to Sebamed baby lotion as well. With these 2 together the whole family gets soft skin till the next shower.&lt;br /&gt;33oz lasts about 6 months for us.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin all my life and this stuff is wonderful!! No more dry, itchy skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Use it as a bath wash. Non-drying. Love it.</li>
