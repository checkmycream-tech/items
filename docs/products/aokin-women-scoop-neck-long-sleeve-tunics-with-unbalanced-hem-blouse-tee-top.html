            <li> Cute top but not made in Anerican sizes! I got an extra large and it was too tight. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;, 160 lbs and a size 10 normally. Had to send it back.</li>
            <li> This top is Great! I love the look and can&#x27;t wait to wear it! Runs really small, so be sure you check the size. I normally wear a medium but ordered this in XL and it fit perfect.</li>
            <li> Love the blouse I ordered a extralarge and it came back as an small even though the blouse says extra large so I can&#x27;t ware the the thing. My first time ordering clothing from amazon, but now I&#x27;m kind of afraid to order anymore clothing if there not going to come back the right size. I&#x27;ll haffta give it away to someone who can ware it .I was very disappointed. One star for just liking the blouse.</li>
            <li> Nice shirt and I would have liked it except I do not know anyone small enough to wear it!  I normally wear a Medium and ordered XL because of other reviews.  I could not even get it over my head.  It would be more suitable for a child&#x27;s size.  It costs more to return than it is worth, so I will donate it instead.

            <li> Nice but sizing is incorrect???</li>

            <li> I ordered big so it would fit, still a bit snug but it is cute.  The main drawback for me is the sheerness of it.  Very see-thru</li>
            <li> sized smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Cut very small. I know I waited to long but would love to send it back.</li>
            <li> Really stylish, cute top! Unfortunately, the sizing is all wrong! I normally take a ladies medium but ordered this in a large &amp; it was still too small!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered an XL and this might fit a medium size person .  It is a beautiful top will give as gift</li>
            <li> This top was sized for a infant!!  It was a nice fabric and style but again was sized for a small girl.  Too Bad I liked the style.</li>
            <li> I was not told in advance that this item was shipping from China!!!  I ordered a 1X (Women&#x27;s 18) and what I received was marked 1X but it was the equivalent of a size 8.  There were no return instructions in the small envelope the item was stuffed in to so I can&#x27;t even return it and get my money back.  I am extremely unhappy with the way the shipping of this item was handled.</li>
            <li> I wear a size 14, bought the XL and could not get it over to my head, gave it to a size 6 friend who loves it but says it is very fitted, not a tunic length either</li>
            <li> Gorgeous will order more!!</li>
            <li> This blouse is beautifully made and very feminine when worn.  It is lined, soft, and flowing.  I only wish that it had longer sleeve lengths.  I am 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; and my arm length is 36&amp;#34; .  Unfortunately, the sleeves were about 3&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34; too short.  (I wish designers would make Tall sizes)  I would have kept it, but gave it to a friend who looks very pretty in it.  She is shorter than me, about 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; .  I also bought a black tunic, and it looks great on her.  I am jealous that I can&#x27;t wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the designer will add TALLS- 33-36&amp;#34; in this blouse.  I hope so.  Lynn</li>
            <li> The sizing is way off.  A XL would fit a 10 year old.</li>
