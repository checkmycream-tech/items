            <li>Not as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li>Thank you keep making more of this product!</li>
            <li>Nice smell, convenient packaging,  but irritates the parts that it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent but that is about all I like about it.</li>
            <li>The best intimate wash in the market</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to know I&#x27;m not putting so many chemicals on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you are looking for something that cleanse and smells nice, don&#x27;t get this cleaner.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for young and grown up girls!</li>
            <li>Nice and very light smell.</li>
            <li>However this lathers great, and to just the right degree.</li>
            <li>Love this product, lite natural smell, great on the body!</li>
            <li>I first got it, I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be very effective as it smelt and felt so neutral</li>
            <li>This product was my favorite it dose&#x27;nt mask an odor</li>
            <li>You can determine the amount you use by how many pumps you want.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take line for the product to get here, and it worked better than advertised.</li>
            <li>I will definelty be buying more soon,</li>
            <li>I find that I use more of the product than I am sure I am supposed to just to feel like it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>I love it already.</li>
            <li>And more to the point, this works.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I wanted a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light lather which does not leave me feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I love that it is easy to pump and</li>
            <li>This is a great all natural product.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that that this is the most gentlest product Ive ever use before it is lightly scented and is 100 percent organic.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>this comes in as schedule, this was also the first time we order this kind, my wife likes this</li>
            <li>Smell is fine, and good for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I can feel and tell a huge difference without it.</li>
            <li>the foam comes out smoothly.</li>
            <li>The pump gets stuck quite often and does not function smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it is gentle and safe...</li>
            <li>Exceptional natural product!</li>
            <li>Feels very fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy to support the women entrepreneurs behind this company and their successful efforts to provide quality all-natural products.</li>
            <li>It truly is all natural, and it very enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s barely any fragrance which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>Because it is a foam, I can forsee running out a lot quicker than I did with my old brand of feminine wash, so I will have to purchase more frequently or more</li>
            <li>Rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Unlike the mainstream products with their endless chemicals which can even withstand the apocalypse, many natural products are best kept in a cool environment.</li>
            <li>Really good personal wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never noticed any scent, but it leaves me clean and happy down there</li>
            <li>it is truly better than summers eve products I live it!</li>
            <li>Clean fresh and no irritation.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive, but I have used better products.</li>
            <li>it lathers really nicely and it has a sublet fragrance to it and it makes you feel very fresh and clean without dryness or any residue like other soaps.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me although, it did make me feel fresh and clean at first.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy I tried this product it really does leave you fresh &amp; clean &amp; worry less....</li>
            <li>I expected it to smell good.</li>
            <li>it left me feeling fresh, clean and confident.</li>
            <li>I love the natural scent it has and it is very, very gentle.</li>
            <li>I really am glad I purchased this one and will continue to use it as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t left me feeling &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, i kind of like a little bit of a menthol feel but to each their own.</li>
            <li>Always want something natural and gentle as famine wash, glad I found this line.</li>
            <li>I very much missed it after two weeks.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is a very gentle foam.</li>
            <li>I would like to thank this company for making safe products and ones that ACTUALLY do what they say they do.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t drying, doesn&#x27;t leave any strange residue, and is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I am ecstatic that I finally have something that cleanses well and won&#x27;t cause any irritation. :-)</li>
            <li>Even if you live in an area up north where cool months stretch into the Spring and Fall, remember that the product is probably coming from a warmer State.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t buy more product than you need for that year, because they don&#x27;t have a long shelf life due to the absence of chemicals that extend life of products (which is a good thing!)</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned about running through the product too quickly because I need about 3-4 pumps to get the job done, but it&#x27;s lasted 3 months so far (which is my minimum bar for personal-care products b/c</li>
            <li>but after a month of use I can say it is just as effective as previous products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for this product.</li>
            <li>So, you won&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is perfectly sized and doesn&#x27;t look awkward in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>In fact, it has virtually no odor...and the use of this foam for cleaning doesn&#x27;t really make me feel that I&#x27;ve really cleaned myself either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to purchase something every month), so the lather issue really doesn&#x27;t concern me at this point.</li>
            <li>Unless you absolutely have to buy during the warmer months, stock up on these items in the Winter months.</li>
            <li>The anal glands are masters at absorbing things</li>
            <li>must be absorbing from the mainstream wipes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but very cleansing.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It comes out a foam and one pump is enough to clean yourself thoroughly.</li>
            <li>it does not smells like flower or something means it is pretty natural.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s gentle enough for the sensitive skin of the female genital area, it&#x27;s good enough for all skin.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something that works, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the packaging design needs a little help.  </li>
            <li>I feel better about using a wash that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t foam up it&#x27;s not hard to rinse off</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for those with sensitive skin and to stay ph balanced!</li>
            <li>, I recommend this to anyone that needs freshen and lively throughout the day</li>
            <li>Smell is subtle and nice.</li>
            <li>I am hesitant to buy new things, as I have very sensitive skin and my vaginal area</li>
            <li>This product is better than I expected!!!!</li>
            <li>No shady chemicals.</li>
            <li>i&amp;#34;ve had ordinary bars of soap that cleansed me better.</li>
            <li>The smell is actually very mild, a little herbal like lavender.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other body washes- pretty much</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t expect it to foam like the lather from soap, it&#x27;s a very light foam, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li>It is a natural product</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this product worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Just natural, good-for-you ingredients.</li>
            <li>I used to buy sensitive skin gel washes.  </li>
            <li>tip for buying all natural products.</li>
            <li>Gave it 3 stars because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to and the fact that it has all natural ingredients is a plus.</li>
            <li>and she uses it frequently</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not usually one to review personal hygiene products</li>
            <li>I feel so good about using their products - no chemicals or artificial anything.</li>
            <li>Really is ph balanced and does not irritate like other soaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m looking for chemical-free organic and natural flushable wet wipes for adults (to replace Natural Choice, Cottonelle, Scott, etc.)</li>
            <li>Compared to Summer&#x27;s Eve Simply Sensitive, which lathers way too much (all that Laureth Sulphate perhaps), this product lathers less, but I find the lather not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li>It has a nice delicate fragrance and you only need a little which makes the larger bottle last quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cleaning but after trying it i can tell that this product is a waste of money, you won&#x27;t  feel clean after using it, it is very diluted, very weak cleaner.</li>
            <li>Works all month, works well, works with little product, and is extremely gentle.</li>

            <li> , don&#x27;t expect it to foam like the lather from soap, it&#x27;s a very light foam, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> It is a natural product</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this product worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Just natural, good-for-you ingredients.</li>
            <li> I used to buy sensitive skin gel washes.  </li>
            <li> tip for buying all natural products.</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to and the fact that it has all natural ingredients is a plus.</li>
            <li> and she uses it frequently</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually one to review personal hygiene products</li>
            <li> I feel so good about using their products - no chemicals or artificial anything.</li>
            <li> Really is ph balanced and does not irritate like other soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for chemical-free organic and natural flushable wet wipes for adults (to replace Natural Choice, Cottonelle, Scott, etc.)</li>
            <li> Compared to Summer&#x27;s Eve Simply Sensitive, which lathers way too much (all that Laureth Sulphate perhaps), this product lathers less, but I find the lather not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li> It has a nice delicate fragrance and you only need a little which makes the larger bottle last quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleaning but after trying it i can tell that this product is a waste of money, you won&#x27;t  feel clean after using it, it is very diluted, very weak cleaner.</li>
            <li> Works all month, works well, works with little product, and is extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> Essential oils and organic natural substances break down and are rendered ineffective (even if you can&#x27;t see a change) in heat.</li>
            <li> Packages sit in hot trucks and warehouses for a couple of days at least, long enough to spoil your organic product, even if you can&#x27;t see the spoilage.</li>
            <li> Gentle, virtually fragrance-free product that keeps you feeling fresh and clean without nasty</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally give reviews, and I especially don&#x27;t like leaving bad ones, but I really don&#x27;t like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the other name brands you get at the drugstores.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 7-year-old daughter to use because regular soap stings her \\&quot;down</li>
            <li> My bottle was a little sticky on the outside</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different cleansers but they always irritated me and some even gave me yeast infections.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Recently I moved and went out of town on a trip, not able to bring this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying their other products for babies.</li>
            <li> No reaction like I had had with other products.</li>
            <li> (if you&#x27;re used to conventional chemical-laden products)</li>
            <li> Even though this is a foam in a small container it seems to waste less product than gel cleaners because it only takes a couple of pumps of foam to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I use less that way.</li>
            <li> But i felt as though that work for a little while</li>
            <li> so I believe a little must have leaked out during shipping.  </li>
            <li> There is not a strong scent (which is what I wanted) and it does not moisturize well at all.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had problems with genital irritation and yeast infections.</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Real waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product does not lather and the pump is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying this product base on some of the negative reviews I read about it .But</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this product. It didn&#x27;t work for me although, it did make me feel fresh and clean at first.  But i felt as though that work for a little while and i gave it chance and used it for two weeks before i actually wrote a review. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Hope they never stop making this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually one to review personal hygiene products but this works, and it works without any sort of irritation or toxins. Wish they would also make feminine wipes with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that works, I highly recommend this. It is a natural product so you probably can&#x27;t hang onto it for 3 years, otherwise I&#x27;d buy it all up so I&#x27;d never run out. Great product to take camping, too. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Used to get yeast infections constantly. Ever since using this wash, they have stopped</li>
            <li> Smell is subtle and nice. I like the ingredients. Lather is sufficient to do the job well. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great feminine wash. Smell is fine, and good for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Quality ingredients. No shady chemicals. I stopped using vagisil because of the ingredients. This does the job- and it&#x27;s natural. I recommend this!</li>
            <li> This product was my favorite it dose&#x27;nt mask an odor it does&#x27;nt irritate ...it was awesome it left me feeling fresh, clean and confident. I was so happy I tried this product it really does leave you fresh &amp; clean &amp; worry less....it is truly better than summers eve products I live it! Thank you keep making more of this product!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 7-year-old daughter to use because regular soap stings her \\&quot;down there.\\&quot; This is now a staple for us both. I love the natural scent it has and it is very, very gentle. Excellent product for young and grown up girls!</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t like the smell!</li>
            <li> I would like to thank this company for making safe products and ones that ACTUALLY do what they say they do.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  So, you won&#x27;t need much.  Very easy to use with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this product worked for me.  I am hesitant to buy new things, as I have very sensitive skin and my vaginal area is very fragile. I love that it is easy to pump and the foam comes out smoothly. The bottle is perfectly sized and doesn&#x27;t look awkward in the bathroom. You can determine the amount you use by how many pumps you want. I really am glad I purchased this one and will continue to use it as long as it is available.  UPDATE I have been using this product now for several months. Recently I moved and went out of town on a trip, not able to bring this. I very much missed it after two weeks. I can feel and tell a huge difference without it.</li>
            <li> This is a great all natural product.  It isn&#x27;t drying, doesn&#x27;t leave any strange residue, and is gentle yet effective.  I feel better about using a wash that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals.  I will never go back to the other name brands you get at the drugstores.  Do yourself a favor and try this.  One note, don&#x27;t expect it to foam like the lather from soap, it&#x27;s a very light foam, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy! My wife loves it!!!! It didn&#x27;t take line for the product to get here, and it worked better than advertised.</li>
            <li> Really good personal wash. I do recommend it. It comes out a foam and one pump is enough to clean yourself thoroughly. Nice and very light smell. Feels very fresh.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, convenient packaging,  but irritates the parts that it&#x27;s intended for. I&#x27;ll be trying their other products for babies.</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing for me. i&amp;#34;ve had ordinary bars of soap that cleansed me better. i actually threw it away</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a very gentle foam. I like the pump that&#x27;s included which dispensers the perfect amount of wash.</li>
            <li> I feel so good about using their products - no chemicals or artificial anything. Just natural, good-for-you ingredients. Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying this product base on some of the negative reviews I read about it .But I  for me I decided I would be the judge of that,so I went ahead and bought It...and I must say that that this is the most gentlest product Ive ever use before it is lightly scented and is 100 percent organic.&lt;br /&gt;This product has become a staple in my feminine hygiene routine I will definelty be buying more soon,</li>
            <li> it lathers really nicely and it has a sublet fragrance to it and it makes you feel very fresh and clean without dryness or any residue like other soaps. i will use this the rest of my life</li>
            <li> Really is ph balanced and does not irritate like other soaps. Would highly recommend for those with sensitive skin and to stay ph balanced!</li>
            <li> I used to buy sensitive skin gel washes.  Even though this is a foam in a small container it seems to waste less product than gel cleaners because it only takes a couple of pumps of foam to do the job.  It foams well in my experience.  There&#x27;s not a lot of chemicals and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me, even though it has essential oils.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh and no irritation.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this company&#x27;s organic grapeseed oil, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Given all the fragrant ingredients (lavender, floral extracts, etc.) I expected it to smell good. In fact, it has virtually no odor...and the use of this foam for cleaning doesn&#x27;t really make me feel that I&#x27;ve really cleaned myself either. I&#x27;m sure that it is gentle and safe...but so is water.</li>
            <li> it is really good. it does not smells like flower or something means it is pretty natural. it also has some guidelines.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a feminine wash. In the past I&#x27;ve had problems with genital irritation and yeast infections. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now, and no yeast infections yet! So that&#x27;s a good sign for me! I&#x27;ve never noticed any scent, but it leaves me clean and happy down there (yay for pH balanced soaps!). It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other body washes- pretty much the foam that comes out of the bottle is what you have to work with. At first I was concerned about running through the product too quickly because I need about 3-4 pumps to get the job done, but it&#x27;s lasted 3 months so far (which is my minimum bar for personal-care products b/c I don&#x27;t want to purchase something every month), so the lather issue really doesn&#x27;t concern me at this point. It hasn&#x27;t affected the value I&#x27;ve gotten out of this bottle, so I just think of it as &amp;#34;pre-lathered&amp;#34; soap! It truly is all natural, and it very enjoyable to use. I&#x27;ve never had problems with the dispenser either. I&#x27;m really happy to support the women entrepreneurs behind this company and their successful efforts to provide quality all-natural products. I would recommend this soap to anyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally give reviews, and I especially don&#x27;t like leaving bad ones, but I really don&#x27;t like this product very much. It has a nice scent but that is about all I like about it. It&#x27;s a very light lather which does not leave me feeling very clean. I find that I use more of the product than I am sure I am supposed to just to feel like it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s designed to do. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Put some on my elbow &amp; it made a scab.What would have happened if I put it on my feminine parts ? BEWARE.</li>
            <li> After reading another review, I didn&#x27;t expect this to lather enough. However this lathers great, and to just the right degree. Compared to Summer&#x27;s Eve Simply Sensitive, which lathers way too much (all that Laureth Sulphate perhaps), this product lathers less, but I find the lather not too much and not too little. Perfect. I love it already. Got rid of the Summer&#x27;s Eve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this on the face and body. Can be used as a pH balanced all over wash. Also great for guys. After all skin is skin. If it&#x27;s gentle enough for the sensitive skin of the female genital area, it&#x27;s good enough for all skin. There&#x27;s barely any fragrance which is a good thing. It isn&#x27;t drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip for buying all natural products. Unless you absolutely have to buy during the warmer months, stock up on these items in the Winter months. But don&#x27;t buy more product than you need for that year, because they don&#x27;t have a long shelf life due to the absence of chemicals that extend life of products (which is a good thing!) Unlike the mainstream products with their endless chemicals which can even withstand the apocalypse, many natural products are best kept in a cool environment. Essential oils and organic natural substances break down and are rendered ineffective (even if you can&#x27;t see a change) in heat. Packages sit in hot trucks and warehouses for a couple of days at least, long enough to spoil your organic product, even if you can&#x27;t see the spoilage. Even if you live in an area up north where cool months stretch into the Spring and Fall, remember that the product is probably coming from a warmer State. Of course we don&#x27;t know when the products were delivered to Amazon warehouses and under what conditions. Hey, we can only do what we can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for chemical-free organic and natural flushable wet wipes for adults (to replace Natural Choice, Cottonelle, Scott, etc.) The anal glands are masters at absorbing things and I hate to think of all the chemicalsthey must be absorbing from the mainstream wipes. If anyone knows of any, please leave a comment below. Nature Certified, the makers of this feminine wash, if you&#x27;re reading this review, do develop one.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle but very cleansing. Since it doesn&#x27;t foam up it&#x27;s not hard to rinse off and I don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any residue.</li>
            <li> Always want something natural and gentle as famine wash, glad I found this line. I will buy in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t cause any irritation when I came across this. I have tried quite a few different cleansers but they always irritated me and some even gave me yeast infections. I am ecstatic that I finally have something that cleanses well and won&#x27;t cause any irritation. :-)</li>
            <li> This product is better than I expected!!!! I feel great and more confident after each use!!! The best intimate wash in the market</li>
            <li> In addition to a feminine wash, I use this on my face. My skin has never looked so good! Buy it!!</li>
            <li> Gentle, virtually fragrance-free product that keeps you feeling fresh and clean without nasty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be very effective as it smelt and felt so neutral (if you&#x27;re used to conventional chemical-laden products) but after a month of use I can say it is just as effective as previous products I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s good to know I&#x27;m not putting so many chemicals on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your body a favor and make the switch!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam up at all.  Don&#x27;t feel clean after using it.  Hard to get out of the bottle.  Will never buy again.  Real waste of money.</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because of the natural ingredients. Dislike the fragrance and Foam cleansers. Still, it does gt the job done.</li>
            <li> It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to and the fact that it has all natural ingredients is a plus. Because it is a foam, I can forsee running out a lot quicker than I did with my old brand of feminine wash, so I will have to purchase more frequently or more than one when I reorder. Wish it could be made in a liquid solution.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the foam, as I knew that&#x27;s how it was dispensed when I got it. I feel like I use less that way. The smell is actually very mild, a little herbal like lavender. But not offensive or overbearing at all. And more to the point, this works. Works all month, works well, works with little product, and is extremely gentle. Rinses clean. Will be a staple of mine.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the packaging design needs a little help.  The pump gets stuck quite often and does not function smoothly.  Otherwise it would have been a five star review!</li>
            <li> This product is good, didn&#x27;t irritate me at all. It didn&#x27;t left me feeling &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, i kind of like a little bit of a menthol feel but to each their own. I would still suggest this product!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleaning but after trying it i can tell that this product is a waste of money, you won&#x27;t  feel clean after using it, it is very diluted, very weak cleaner. if you are looking for something that cleanse and smells nice, don&#x27;t get this cleaner.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped. Does the job. I am very sensitive, but I have used better products.</li>
            <li> this comes in as schedule, this was also the first time we order this kind, my wife likes this and she uses it frequently, I recommend this to anyone that needs freshen and lively throughout the day</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; feminine wash that wasn&#x27;t made by Summer&#x27;s Eve. The product does not lather and the pump is a little awkward. There is not a strong scent (which is what I wanted) and it does not moisturize well at all. I will continue to use it until it is gone (which will probably be awhile) but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, lite natural smell, great on the body!</li>
            <li> Exceptional natural product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I really like it. No reaction like I had had with other products. It has a nice delicate fragrance and you only need a little which makes the larger bottle last quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My bottle was a little sticky on the outside so I believe a little must have leaked out during shipping.  I will order this product again.</li>
