            <li>I absolutely loved this brush.  </li>
            <li>I loved using this, but the motor burned out in a month.  </li>
            <li>I bought this about 2 months ago and LOVED it until yesterday when it just died...</li>

            <li>it held your hair good.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good alternative to the instyler..</li>
            <li>Loved this while it worked.</li>
            <li>GOOD Job.</li>
            <li>I loved it until it died.  </li>
            <li>Good idea.  </li>
            <li>Loved it when it worked</li>
            <li>This product was good, while it worked.  </li>
            <li>the design is convenient and gives good lift underneath the hair when drying.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED THIS BRUSH...</li>
            <li>It is a good size.</li>
            <li>Then it burnt out and despite my best efforts to revive it (letting it cool, reseting the plug, etc.)</li>
            <li>Loved the results,  However, when I used it on my own</li>
            <li>The John freida one is way better!</li>
            <li>Well, I like this one EVEN BETTER!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I used to have to use my hot iron and now this makes everything perfect every morning</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>This looked like the perfect hot air brush; however, after just 3-4 uses it burned up and was no longer functional.  </li>
            <li>I always buy a spare excellent hot air brush.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, great product.</li>
            <li>It is a great idea and makes blow drying easy</li>
            <li>She liked it and bought her own</li>
            <li>People comment on how nice it looks and that has never happened to me before.</li>
            <li>And I was thrilled -- for all of three minutes.</li>
            <li>As someone who really hates using curling irons because of burnt fingers, this brush is awesome in that you can touch the bristles without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>bought as a gift and they liked it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>, it just did this on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Nice while it worked - (ha-ha).  </li>
            <li>It did a nice job styling my hair, and I think the anti-static ionic feature made a difference.</li>
            <li>had an older version of this brush for 10 years and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>For those who wind up with a head full of frizz using a dryer, this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I loved it!  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this product - easy to use and doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy as can be!</li>
            <li>Great product, the first one lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment of time, though - nice hair styler!</li>
            <li>She was so happy to received what  Hot Tool.</li>
            <li>but maybe the price here is too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice and easy.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll look for another company&#x27;s dryer that may be more reliable.</li>
            <li>Love the brush otherwise.   </li>
            <li>and I have shoulder length, maybe shorter hair would work better.</li>
            <li>Just love it</li>
            <li>The Air Brush is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still tryiong to get  used to it because a used another product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair styler.</li>
            <li>Top part came off while I was doing my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this Dryer/</li>
            <li>love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you. :)</li>
            <li>I was glad that I could still get another one.</li>
            <li>This product was just ok for me.</li>
            <li>I like that and love it.</li>
            <li>While waiting for a shipping label to return the brush, I tried it one more time.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>and I totally love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love that I no longer need my curling iron and have taken 5-10 minutes off my morning routine with this.  </li>
            <li>This air brush works better than most models, but be prepared to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t order - more of a hassle to return.  </li>
            <li>I really love the product</li>
            <li>I will order a replacement and hope I have better luck.</li>
            <li>but amazon&#x27;s moronic system requires me to write more to leave their requested review.</li>
            <li>love love love, my mom has one too.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks and feels  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a styling product rather than a drying product</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This product is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I believe this model is more of a risk than anything else...</li>
            <li>Probably a good thing, being that it is defective, that the motor burned out right away</li>
            <li>(Mainly because of their great electric cords that don&#x27;t &#x27;snarl&#x27; up)  </li>
            <li>I think the concentrator tools are really a gimmick, but the brush itself works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My friend has one of these hot air brushes, and I loved it, so I got one just like it.</li>
            <li>The older one I had just like this one, I liked better (dropped on ceramic tile and broke it!)</li>
            <li>Great power, great heat, perfect barrel length, but the bristles are too short for thick hair.</li>
            <li>this one work fine, but seems to make my hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li>Finishing out a rough blow-out or air-dry with this is awesome.</li>
            <li>It has good heat, but the whole thing seems like any moment its going to stop working.  </li>
            <li>the barrel comes off easily and needs a more secure connection.  </li>
            <li>Returned it to the manufacturer for a full refund!</li>
            <li>The barrel stays on, but is easy to remove in order to use the concentrator attachment.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and does a grat job.</li>
            <li>and they responded very quickly in giving me a refund.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li>Powerful but doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, very easy to use, hair does not get tangled at all.</li>
            <li>I liked the Hot Tool</li>
            <li>but I use the buttons on the plug and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine until the beginning of March.</li>
            <li>I have had this brand before and they have been fine but not this one.</li>
            <li>If I have time then it&#x27;s good, it smooths my hair down &amp; looks really good...</li>
            <li>and I loved the soft waves I got!</li>
            <li>It adds volume and makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Great styling tool I had one before for several years</li>
            <li>I think it has potential to be a great product and depends on your skill.</li>
            <li>Like TeaKayPea, I found this brush to be great on my hair, but faulty overall.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these about four years ago and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and for the first time in my life I have full looking, non static hair.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in 2002 and used it in my salon.</li>
            <li>Love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this hot air brush for years and just love it.</li>
            <li>The heat, and power are exactly what I wanted, and I love the barrel length.</li>
            <li>But as of now, I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more Hot Tools products.</li>
            <li>The way that I&#x27;ve been able to keep it from not burning is that I&#x27;ll use the hot setting</li>
            <li>I really love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the hot tools product line.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a fair amount, cut in a short graduated bob (chin length).  </li>
            <li>I have owned many air brushes over the years and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping love the item</li>
            <li>Start with a cool temp.</li>
            <li>I unplugged it, waited for it to cool</li>
            <li>My hair comes out full and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>They are definitely made as good as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>This product broke after not even a full week of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to purchase my 3rd one because it&#x27;s the best hot air styler I&#x27;ve found so far, but I definitely don&#x27;t enjoy replacing it yearly.</li>
            <li>as if it were burning I turned it off allowing it to cool.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush makes it easy to recreate blowouts yourself.</li>
            <li>Spend a bit more money and get a better one that will last.</li>
            <li>but luckily I bought it through Amazon</li>
            <li>I have real fine hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be large but it curl my hair fast and soft</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for to smooth and style my hair.</li>
            <li>When I turned on this product for the very first time, the motor started smoking.  </li>
            <li>it can be very hot to dry..or recurl your hair</li>
            <li>It is get for traveling because it folds down making it great for packing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, dries hair quite quickly and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Hot tools makes the best hair care products period as I have purchased their curling irons and other products over the years &amp; wouldn&#x27;t own any other brand.  </li>
            <li>but since I don&#x27;t have time to mess around with it in the morning before work it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li>Used this hot air brush for four months and it died!</li>
            <li>However, I received the Hot Air Brush not in it&#x27;s original box.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use, gives AMAZING body, shine and softness, and doesn&#x27;t make your arms feel like they are going to fall off when done like when using a round brush and blow dryer!  </li>
            <li>The hot air brush works wonderfully, then it stops suddenly, often becoming very hot and smelly,after just a few months.</li>
            <li>As with other reviewers, it seemed very nice at first but after about a dozen uses, the motor literally burned out.</li>
            <li>great while it worked, then it overheated a few months after</li>
            <li>It worked great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I received my brush and it worked great for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>My hair soft and looking healthy</li>
            <li>Used to be far better quality.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll take practice and a tired arm, but this dryer brush is great!</li>
            <li>I ordered this after my hair dresser used it after a fresh perm.</li>
            <li>I was right - this thing is seriously powerful.</li>
            <li>If you want to straighten unruly hair while you style it plus have the ease of one-hand holding, then this is exactly what you&#x27;ll want to get the job done - and quickly.</li>
            <li>I felt the first one burned out too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I got this thing thinking that it would just be nice for curling my ends, but that I would still have to flat iron my hair as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But they were right too -</li>
            <li>For more curl, simply twist the brush at the ends of the hair, and then set the curl with the cool shot.  </li>
            <li>Also, the design is such that it is very easy to cover the intake vents with your hand.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cool button, because I think it helps set the curl/wave/etc.  </li>
            <li>So many of these barely blow air</li>
            <li>poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have paid more attention to all the other reviews that also mention how the motor burns out very quickly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are short, almost too short to grasp hair - but it works well with my mid-length hair, and will work great for longer hair.</li>
            <li>I had the same item and liked it so much that I wanted another one.</li>
            <li>I want a new one!!!</li>
            <li>I rarely, rarely use the high setting as this is what burns these things out quickly;  however, I don&#x27;t need to</li>
            <li>I already own the 500 watt Revlon Hot Brush and it works, but it takes longer for me to style my hair because I have to use my blow dryer until my hair is almost dry before I can even use the styling brush.  </li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and it works great for styling it without to much heat that causes damage.</li>
            <li>All I can say is keep EVERYTHING relating to the purchase so that you can contact the interested parties IMMEDIATELY</li>
            <li>If I was willing to spend another $20 in shipping costs, the seller said they would send me another of the $20 item.  </li>
            <li>It was extremely hot and stunk up my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I find it easier then hot rollers.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser turned me on to the Hot Tools Ionic Blow Dryer</li>
            <li>I will be using Hot Tools products from now on.</li>
            <li>I get ready in no time!</li>
            <li>I thought maybe the first one was defective and decided to give the Hot Tools another chance.</li>
            <li>(I purchased this hot iron from Ulta, not Amazon.com).</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing another Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>I kept purchasing this product even after they WOULD burn out because I couldn&#x27;t find another appliance that got as hot or seemed to work comparably.</li>
            <li>and then use the Hot Air Brush to brush under or curl.</li>
            <li>I have used this same brand of air brush for many years.</li>
            <li>when i first got it</li>
            <li>I have been using this same dryer for years, it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>It makes your hair really soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It is hot</li>
            <li>I had this hot brush for over a year now</li>
            <li>and then I use the hot brush.  </li>
            <li>The handle got really hot</li>
            <li>I love the look of blowouts, but I don&#x27;t seem to be coordinated to hold a brush and dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li>Then one day, it sputtered and got really hot and stopped working.</li>
            <li>it gets hot at the end</li>
            <li>, they make sure no hair gets caught in the filter for the air dryer, and the brush just stopped working all of a sudden.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>It is hot and burns my hands</li>
            <li>The Hot Tools</li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>The first time I turned it on, it started smoking and it burned up.</li>
            <li>I have been useing the hot tool for years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was eager to receive my hot air brush in the mail.</li>
            <li>The plastic section of the handle became extremely hot and tripped the circuit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first time with a Hot Tools product.</li>
            <li>The first lasted only one year, but I liked the results and the end is bigger than the original Hot Tools</li>
            <li>So, I got on Amazon and got very excited to see that I could still order the exact same brush, so I did.  </li>
            <li>Perfect tool to blow dry and style your hair everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, amazon, for processing my refund right away.</li>
            <li>It works so well on my straight hair...giving my hair just the right curl and body to go through the day.</li>
            <li>Makes taking the frizz out of my grey hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li>this product straightened my hair better than any flat iron could.  </li>
            <li>to hot and hold, then cool down again before unwrapping, that will hold the curl much better.</li>
            <li>and it would come back on, worked fine for one or two uses then the burning smell started right after I turned it on yesterday</li>
            <li>To get straight, smooth style with lots of body, simply pull it straight through the hair, curling the ends a bit under, and end with a cool shot.  </li>
            <li>My lady was looking for this brand specifically, based on positive comments from her friends</li>
            <li>I bought this hot air brush a few months ago and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and I use this hot air brush to straighten my hair, it does not make it pin straight</li>
            <li>I have stick straight super fine hair and it dried my hair quickly, gave me much needed volume, and even let me give my hair some shape and curls!  </li>
            <li>I do my hair in layers, holding the top layer up with a clip while I dry the under layer.  </li>
            <li>This is why I appreciate companies like Amazon (and Costco) -- they are customer friendly and supportive, not like other companies who have told me I have to deal directly with the manufacturer if I have a problem.</li>
            <li>I had intended for it to replace my blow dryer also, but I found the best solution for me is to blow dry my hair 80% dry and then use the hot air brush to dry the rest of the way for volume and curl.  </li>
            <li>I love the other Hot Tools hair products.</li>
            <li>I have shorter, fine hair as mentioned earlier.</li>
            <li>as the low setting does just fine.</li>
            <li>It is fast and works well with curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but the reasonable cost allows it to be replaced without hesitation.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I used it 3-4 days a week for about 5 minutes each time, so the quality is very</li>
            <li>A real fire hazard.  </li>
            <li>I really like this tool.</li>
            <li>This brush works very well, when it works.  </li>
            <li>She really uses it alot.</li>
            <li>On the second one the blower doesn&#x27;t come on at all; it makes a whiny sound but no air blows out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;II expected to be able to use it at list for one year</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>so really it shouldn&#x27;t have went out so soon.</li>
            <li>Really bummed because it worked so well and seemed well made, bummer.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to use on my hair when it was longer, however it really does not work well on shorter hair.</li>
            <li>but this one really blows.  </li>
            <li>This works great to straighten my thin, curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate it&#x27;s ease.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair with the Hot Tools Hair Dryer and then style it with this Brush and my hair is smooth and straight</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>My fine, thin hair looks full and smooth.  </li>
            <li>so I usually buy two at a time, just to be safe!</li>
            <li>It could be made a wee bit longer with more of a tip at the end to hold with your other hand.  </li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t live without it everyday.  </li>
            <li>I thought I liked the product, however by the time I located the paperwork I was past the guarantee period</li>
            <li>This is my second Hot Tools Hot Air Brush.</li>
            <li>I should have listened to the other reviews and purchased the original Hot Tools Curling Brush (i had one of those for two years</li>
            <li>I have not found any cons, and would highly recommend this styling tool.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a little more reliable.</li>
            <li>This thing actually styles and dries my hair completely, giving it a nice curl at the ends with bounce, and minimizing frizz so much that I only have to flat iron a few strands on top, instead of spending 30 minutes ironing my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries my hair faster than my normal blow dryer and gives tons of volume.</li>
            <li>I love using it on my fringe since a flat iron makes it too flat for my liking.</li>
            <li>I own four curling irons and a BROKEN Hot Air Brush, trying to decided if I should take a chance and buy another one?</li>
            <li>The cord is super long and rotates.  </li>
            <li>But this new one looks like it has a new plug design.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m stuck with this brand new non-functioning air brush.</li>
            <li>The item was delivered in what appeared to be new packaging.  </li>
            <li>I have thin,fine and straight hair and the only thing that really works for me is a brush curling iron with curl release.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to get another Wahl Styling Brush for travel, but apparently they are discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I have owned two Hot Tools hot air brushes in the last 5 years, same model.  </li>
            <li>My first one seemed to have gotten a short in it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than using a regular dryer and a round brush, and the results are better.  </li>
            <li>On the first one the on-off button didn&#x27;t work properly; I had to unplug it to get it to turn off.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted longer than the second one but neither made it through a year.  </li>
            <li>This is my third Hot Tools air brush.  </li>
            <li>The last 2 stopped blowing hot air after the warranty was up.  </li>
            <li>I find I would need smaller brush barrel on top of my head and bigger brush barrel in the back.</li>
            <li>Ordered my hot air bush in August and it burned out last night.</li>
            <li>When it worked ...it was fabulous, but certainly not worth the danger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a period of over twenty years, I had 2 different hot air brushes from Conair.</li>
            <li>i begin to braid it, so i decide to try something different, and brought the hot brush, and when i it use it on her hair, her hair dry quickly and is was soft, i braid her</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had others like this that have worked very well, but this particular product did not last!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long this product will last, based on reviews I read, but I am taking care to keep the vents free from hair and the intake area clear of dust.  </li>
            <li>just as i expected, I&#x27;m able to get my hair dry and styled in one setting.</li>
            <li>I read other posts from people saying that the motor burned out quickly</li>
            <li>This was a great product unfortunately it completley broke only 6 months in.</li>
            <li>and this is the only thing that will actually keep it straight for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>it is of professional quality &amp;</li>
            <li>Plus, the motor is not as loud</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>You have to know how to use this brush as taught by a professional.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron adds too much curl and not enough volume.</li>
            <li>She gets her hair done by professional hairdressers when she goes on TV.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in early January and here it is March</li>
            <li>This thing has changed and is a complete piece of junk now.  </li>
            <li>I get much more volume than I did with the hair dryer and round brush as it seemed like that method actually pulled the volume out of my hair instead of adding volume.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair (down to my middle back), and surprisingly haven&#x27;t had any issues with my hair getting tangled or burnt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hot air brushes to dry and curl my hair for over 10 years</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair, I first dry my hair with a blower for just a min.</li>
            <li>I bought a second and had only used it for two months when the motor burned out complete with a hot handle, glowing innards, and stinky smoke.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hot air brush for years, and recently purchased my third one.  </li>
            <li>I used the hot air brush only occasionally, perhaps 2 times a week.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that I sometimes like to dry straight, but not always pin straight as with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>ordered two - one was great - the other&#x27;s slide button is so loose, hard to control.</li>
            <li>I normally use it on the low heat setting because</li>
            <li>Really works well with my thin, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I have thin, straight, long hair and it gives a nice shape but curls do not really last.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good... a little awkward at first, definitely takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like this hot air brush and have been purchasing one every year for the past 10 years or so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud but it&#x27;s the same as a loud blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>But for me that is a pro, not a con, because if it were any less powerful, it wouldn&#x27;t do the killer job</li>
            <li>I use this hot air brush everyday, and really recommend it if you want a smooth style, not very curly as the brush is 1 inch and a half.</li>
            <li>but apparently it was pulled off the shelf-good riddance!</li>
            <li>I have no other comments</li>
            <li>I partially dry my hair with a traditional hair dryer, then use this hot air brush to style it as I finish drying.  </li>
            <li>The higher wattage allows you to dry and style your hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The only down fall is it burns out quickly</li>
            <li>Other than that, I like the long card, the cool shot, and the sturdy feel of it.</li>
            <li>I would say definitely get this thing if you have thick hair like me, but avoid it if you have fine hair, or are sensitive to heat.</li>
            <li>when i saw this one had a Cold Shot button, i was thrilled and decided that it was just a coincidence all those other units burnt out so quickly.  </li>
            <li>and then you have to pay to have it fixed and shipped back.  </li>
            <li>I turned it off and back on again (thinking the smoke may have been from something stuck near the motor that just burned)-</li>
            <li>this WOW, it stayed all day, even when I woke up the next morning</li>
            <li>Brush barely grabs my hair and when I try to use my hand to wrap it around</li>
            <li>It seems that the last two didn&#x27;t last as long as the first two I bought.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really blow enough to help dry.  </li>
            <li>This IS more expensive than other brands, but its worth it.</li>
            <li>The air pushed out is strong and gets my hair dried in half the time my old air brush did.  </li>
            <li>I figured if it&#x27;s hot enough to burn you, it&#x27;s hot enough for my thick frizz ball hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new brand as much, Frieda, because it doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly or dry my hair as fast or as well, but at least it is still working.</li>
            <li>Sad thing is I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>so I would dry it almost completely with a hair dryer then use the brush to add body and curl under ends</li>
            <li>and I have tried quite a few different hot air brushes.</li>
            <li>your hair isn&#x27;t super thick, definitely buy it.</li>
            <li>later, a friend who owns one suggested that i turn off the ion button, and i&#x27;ve found that as long as i keep that off, it will keep running normally through the time i need to dry my hair.  </li>

            <li> Loved it when it worked</li>
            <li> This product was good, while it worked.  </li>
            <li> the design is convenient and gives good lift underneath the hair when drying.  </li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS BRUSH...</li>
            <li> It is a good size.</li>
            <li> Then it burnt out and despite my best efforts to revive it (letting it cool, reseting the plug, etc.)</li>
            <li> Loved the results,  However, when I used it on my own</li>
            <li> The John freida one is way better!</li>
            <li> Well, I like this one EVEN BETTER!  </li>
            <li> I love this thing, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I used to have to use my hot iron and now this makes everything perfect every morning</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  </li>
            <li> This looked like the perfect hot air brush; however, after just 3-4 uses it burned up and was no longer functional.  </li>
            <li> I always buy a spare excellent hot air brush.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great product.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea and makes blow drying easy</li>
            <li> She liked it and bought her own</li>
            <li> People comment on how nice it looks and that has never happened to me before.</li>
            <li> And I was thrilled -- for all of three minutes.</li>
            <li> As someone who really hates using curling irons because of burnt fingers, this brush is awesome in that you can touch the bristles without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and they liked it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> , it just did this on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> Nice while it worked - (ha-ha).  </li>
            <li> It did a nice job styling my hair, and I think the anti-static ionic feature made a difference.</li>
            <li> had an older version of this brush for 10 years and it was awesome.</li>
            <li> For those who wind up with a head full of frizz using a dryer, this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I loved it!  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this product - easy to use and doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy as can be!</li>
            <li> Great product, the first one lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment of time, though - nice hair styler!</li>
            <li> She was so happy to received what  Hot Tool.</li>
            <li> but maybe the price here is too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> This is really nice and easy.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look for another company&#x27;s dryer that may be more reliable.</li>
            <li> Love the brush otherwise.   </li>
            <li> and I have shoulder length, maybe shorter hair would work better.</li>
            <li> Just love it</li>
            <li> The Air Brush is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still tryiong to get  used to it because a used another product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair styler.</li>
            <li> Top part came off while I was doing my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this Dryer/</li>
            <li> love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you. :)</li>
            <li> I was glad that I could still get another one.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok for me.</li>
            <li> I like that and love it.</li>
            <li> While waiting for a shipping label to return the brush, I tried it one more time.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> and I totally love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love that I no longer need my curling iron and have taken 5-10 minutes off my morning routine with this.  </li>
            <li> This air brush works better than most models, but be prepared to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order - more of a hassle to return.  </li>
            <li> I really love the product</li>
            <li> I will order a replacement and hope I have better luck.</li>
            <li> but amazon&#x27;s moronic system requires me to write more to leave their requested review.</li>
            <li> love love love, my mom has one too.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks and feels  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a styling product rather than a drying product</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.  </li>
            <li> I believe this model is more of a risk than anything else...</li>
            <li> Probably a good thing, being that it is defective, that the motor burned out right away</li>
            <li> (Mainly because of their great electric cords that don&#x27;t &#x27;snarl&#x27; up)  </li>
            <li> I think the concentrator tools are really a gimmick, but the brush itself works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My friend has one of these hot air brushes, and I loved it, so I got one just like it.</li>
            <li> The older one I had just like this one, I liked better (dropped on ceramic tile and broke it!)</li>
            <li> Great power, great heat, perfect barrel length, but the bristles are too short for thick hair.</li>
            <li> this one work fine, but seems to make my hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li> Finishing out a rough blow-out or air-dry with this is awesome.</li>
            <li> It has good heat, but the whole thing seems like any moment its going to stop working.  </li>
            <li> the barrel comes off easily and needs a more secure connection.  </li>
            <li> Returned it to the manufacturer for a full refund!</li>
            <li> The barrel stays on, but is easy to remove in order to use the concentrator attachment.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and does a grat job.</li>
            <li> and they responded very quickly in giving me a refund.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li> Powerful but doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, very easy to use, hair does not get tangled at all.</li>
            <li> I liked the Hot Tool</li>
            <li> but I use the buttons on the plug and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine until the beginning of March.</li>
            <li> I have had this brand before and they have been fine but not this one.</li>
            <li> If I have time then it&#x27;s good, it smooths my hair down &amp; looks really good...</li>
            <li> and I loved the soft waves I got!</li>
            <li> It adds volume and makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Great styling tool I had one before for several years</li>
            <li> I think it has potential to be a great product and depends on your skill.</li>
            <li> Like TeaKayPea, I found this brush to be great on my hair, but faulty overall.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these about four years ago and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and for the first time in my life I have full looking, non static hair.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in 2002 and used it in my salon.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this hot air brush for years and just love it.</li>
            <li> The heat, and power are exactly what I wanted, and I love the barrel length.</li>
            <li> But as of now, I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more Hot Tools products.</li>
            <li> The way that I&#x27;ve been able to keep it from not burning is that I&#x27;ll use the hot setting</li>
            <li> I really love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I love the hot tools product line.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a fair amount, cut in a short graduated bob (chin length).  </li>
            <li> I have owned many air brushes over the years and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping love the item</li>
            <li> Start with a cool temp.</li>
            <li> I unplugged it, waited for it to cool</li>
            <li> My hair comes out full and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> They are definitely made as good as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> This product broke after not even a full week of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase my 3rd one because it&#x27;s the best hot air styler I&#x27;ve found so far, but I definitely don&#x27;t enjoy replacing it yearly.</li>
            <li> as if it were burning I turned it off allowing it to cool.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush makes it easy to recreate blowouts yourself.</li>
            <li> Spend a bit more money and get a better one that will last.</li>
            <li> but luckily I bought it through Amazon</li>
            <li> I have real fine hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be large but it curl my hair fast and soft</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to smooth and style my hair.</li>
            <li> When I turned on this product for the very first time, the motor started smoking.  </li>
            <li> it can be very hot to dry..or recurl your hair</li>
            <li> It is get for traveling because it folds down making it great for packing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, dries hair quite quickly and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Hot tools makes the best hair care products period as I have purchased their curling irons and other products over the years &amp; wouldn&#x27;t own any other brand.  </li>
            <li> but since I don&#x27;t have time to mess around with it in the morning before work it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> Used this hot air brush for four months and it died!</li>
            <li> However, I received the Hot Air Brush not in it&#x27;s original box.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use, gives AMAZING body, shine and softness, and doesn&#x27;t make your arms feel like they are going to fall off when done like when using a round brush and blow dryer!  </li>
            <li> The hot air brush works wonderfully, then it stops suddenly, often becoming very hot and smelly,after just a few months.</li>
            <li> As with other reviewers, it seemed very nice at first but after about a dozen uses, the motor literally burned out.</li>
            <li> great while it worked, then it overheated a few months after</li>
            <li> It worked great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I received my brush and it worked great for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> My hair soft and looking healthy</li>
            <li> Used to be far better quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take practice and a tired arm, but this dryer brush is great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after my hair dresser used it after a fresh perm.</li>
            <li> I was right - this thing is seriously powerful.</li>
            <li> If you want to straighten unruly hair while you style it plus have the ease of one-hand holding, then this is exactly what you&#x27;ll want to get the job done - and quickly.</li>
            <li> I felt the first one burned out too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got this thing thinking that it would just be nice for curling my ends, but that I would still have to flat iron my hair as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they were right too -</li>
            <li> For more curl, simply twist the brush at the ends of the hair, and then set the curl with the cool shot.  </li>
            <li> Also, the design is such that it is very easy to cover the intake vents with your hand.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cool button, because I think it helps set the curl/wave/etc.  </li>
            <li> So many of these barely blow air</li>
            <li> poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have paid more attention to all the other reviews that also mention how the motor burns out very quickly.</li>
            <li> The bristles are short, almost too short to grasp hair - but it works well with my mid-length hair, and will work great for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I had the same item and liked it so much that I wanted another one.</li>
            <li> I want a new one!!!</li>
            <li> I rarely, rarely use the high setting as this is what burns these things out quickly;  however, I don&#x27;t need to</li>
            <li> I already own the 500 watt Revlon Hot Brush and it works, but it takes longer for me to style my hair because I have to use my blow dryer until my hair is almost dry before I can even use the styling brush.  </li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and it works great for styling it without to much heat that causes damage.</li>
            <li> All I can say is keep EVERYTHING relating to the purchase so that you can contact the interested parties IMMEDIATELY</li>
            <li> If I was willing to spend another $20 in shipping costs, the seller said they would send me another of the $20 item.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely hot and stunk up my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I find it easier then hot rollers.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to the Hot Tools Ionic Blow Dryer</li>
            <li> I will be using Hot Tools products from now on.</li>
            <li> I get ready in no time!</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the first one was defective and decided to give the Hot Tools another chance.</li>
            <li> (I purchased this hot iron from Ulta, not Amazon.com).</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing another Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> I kept purchasing this product even after they WOULD burn out because I couldn&#x27;t find another appliance that got as hot or seemed to work comparably.</li>
            <li> and then use the Hot Air Brush to brush under or curl.</li>
            <li> I have used this same brand of air brush for many years.</li>
            <li> when i first got it</li>
            <li> I have been using this same dryer for years, it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> It makes your hair really soft and smooth</li>
            <li> It is hot</li>
            <li> I had this hot brush for over a year now</li>
            <li> and then I use the hot brush.  </li>
            <li> The handle got really hot</li>
            <li> I love the look of blowouts, but I don&#x27;t seem to be coordinated to hold a brush and dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li> Then one day, it sputtered and got really hot and stopped working.</li>
            <li> it gets hot at the end</li>
            <li> , they make sure no hair gets caught in the filter for the air dryer, and the brush just stopped working all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> It is hot and burns my hands</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools</li>
            <li> It gets really hot</li>
            <li> The first time I turned it on, it started smoking and it burned up.</li>
            <li> I have been useing the hot tool for years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was eager to receive my hot air brush in the mail.</li>
            <li> The plastic section of the handle became extremely hot and tripped the circuit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first time with a Hot Tools product.</li>
            <li> The first lasted only one year, but I liked the results and the end is bigger than the original Hot Tools</li>
            <li> So, I got on Amazon and got very excited to see that I could still order the exact same brush, so I did.  </li>
            <li> Perfect tool to blow dry and style your hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, amazon, for processing my refund right away.</li>
            <li> It works so well on my straight hair...giving my hair just the right curl and body to go through the day.</li>
            <li> Makes taking the frizz out of my grey hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> this product straightened my hair better than any flat iron could.  </li>
            <li> to hot and hold, then cool down again before unwrapping, that will hold the curl much better.</li>
            <li> and it would come back on, worked fine for one or two uses then the burning smell started right after I turned it on yesterday</li>
            <li> To get straight, smooth style with lots of body, simply pull it straight through the hair, curling the ends a bit under, and end with a cool shot.  </li>
            <li> My lady was looking for this brand specifically, based on positive comments from her friends</li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush a few months ago and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and I use this hot air brush to straighten my hair, it does not make it pin straight</li>
            <li> I have stick straight super fine hair and it dried my hair quickly, gave me much needed volume, and even let me give my hair some shape and curls!  </li>
            <li> I do my hair in layers, holding the top layer up with a clip while I dry the under layer.  </li>
            <li> This is why I appreciate companies like Amazon (and Costco) -- they are customer friendly and supportive, not like other companies who have told me I have to deal directly with the manufacturer if I have a problem.</li>
            <li> I had intended for it to replace my blow dryer also, but I found the best solution for me is to blow dry my hair 80% dry and then use the hot air brush to dry the rest of the way for volume and curl.  </li>
            <li> I love the other Hot Tools hair products.</li>
            <li> I have shorter, fine hair as mentioned earlier.</li>
            <li> as the low setting does just fine.</li>
            <li> It is fast and works well with curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but the reasonable cost allows it to be replaced without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I used it 3-4 days a week for about 5 minutes each time, so the quality is very</li>
            <li> A real fire hazard.  </li>
            <li> I really like this tool.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well, when it works.  </li>
            <li> She really uses it alot.</li>
            <li> On the second one the blower doesn&#x27;t come on at all; it makes a whiny sound but no air blows out.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;II expected to be able to use it at list for one year</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> so really it shouldn&#x27;t have went out so soon.</li>
            <li> Really bummed because it worked so well and seemed well made, bummer.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use on my hair when it was longer, however it really does not work well on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> but this one really blows.  </li>
            <li> This works great to straighten my thin, curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate it&#x27;s ease.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair with the Hot Tools Hair Dryer and then style it with this Brush and my hair is smooth and straight</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> My fine, thin hair looks full and smooth.  </li>
            <li> so I usually buy two at a time, just to be safe!</li>
            <li> It could be made a wee bit longer with more of a tip at the end to hold with your other hand.  </li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t live without it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I thought I liked the product, however by the time I located the paperwork I was past the guarantee period</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools Hot Air Brush.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews and purchased the original Hot Tools Curling Brush (i had one of those for two years</li>
            <li> I have not found any cons, and would highly recommend this styling tool.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little more reliable.</li>
            <li> This thing actually styles and dries my hair completely, giving it a nice curl at the ends with bounce, and minimizing frizz so much that I only have to flat iron a few strands on top, instead of spending 30 minutes ironing my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries my hair faster than my normal blow dryer and gives tons of volume.</li>
            <li> I love using it on my fringe since a flat iron makes it too flat for my liking.</li>
            <li> I own four curling irons and a BROKEN Hot Air Brush, trying to decided if I should take a chance and buy another one?</li>
            <li> The cord is super long and rotates.  </li>
            <li> But this new one looks like it has a new plug design.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m stuck with this brand new non-functioning air brush.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered in what appeared to be new packaging.  </li>
            <li> I have thin,fine and straight hair and the only thing that really works for me is a brush curling iron with curl release.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to get another Wahl Styling Brush for travel, but apparently they are discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I have owned two Hot Tools hot air brushes in the last 5 years, same model.  </li>
            <li> My first one seemed to have gotten a short in it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than using a regular dryer and a round brush, and the results are better.  </li>
            <li> On the first one the on-off button didn&#x27;t work properly; I had to unplug it to get it to turn off.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted longer than the second one but neither made it through a year.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Hot Tools air brush.  </li>
            <li> The last 2 stopped blowing hot air after the warranty was up.  </li>
            <li> I find I would need smaller brush barrel on top of my head and bigger brush barrel in the back.</li>
            <li> Ordered my hot air bush in August and it burned out last night.</li>
            <li> When it worked ...it was fabulous, but certainly not worth the danger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a period of over twenty years, I had 2 different hot air brushes from Conair.</li>
            <li> i begin to braid it, so i decide to try something different, and brought the hot brush, and when i it use it on her hair, her hair dry quickly and is was soft, i braid her</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others like this that have worked very well, but this particular product did not last!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this product will last, based on reviews I read, but I am taking care to keep the vents free from hair and the intake area clear of dust.  </li>
            <li> just as i expected, I&#x27;m able to get my hair dry and styled in one setting.</li>
            <li> I read other posts from people saying that the motor burned out quickly</li>
            <li> This was a great product unfortunately it completley broke only 6 months in.</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing that will actually keep it straight for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> it is of professional quality &amp;</li>
            <li> Plus, the motor is not as loud</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> You have to know how to use this brush as taught by a professional.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron adds too much curl and not enough volume.</li>
            <li> She gets her hair done by professional hairdressers when she goes on TV.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in early January and here it is March</li>
            <li> This thing has changed and is a complete piece of junk now.  </li>
            <li> I get much more volume than I did with the hair dryer and round brush as it seemed like that method actually pulled the volume out of my hair instead of adding volume.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (down to my middle back), and surprisingly haven&#x27;t had any issues with my hair getting tangled or burnt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot air brushes to dry and curl my hair for over 10 years</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, I first dry my hair with a blower for just a min.</li>
            <li> I bought a second and had only used it for two months when the motor burned out complete with a hot handle, glowing innards, and stinky smoke.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hot air brush for years, and recently purchased my third one.  </li>
            <li> I used the hot air brush only occasionally, perhaps 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I sometimes like to dry straight, but not always pin straight as with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> ordered two - one was great - the other&#x27;s slide button is so loose, hard to control.</li>
            <li> I normally use it on the low heat setting because</li>
            <li> Really works well with my thin, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight, long hair and it gives a nice shape but curls do not really last.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good... a little awkward at first, definitely takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I really, really like this hot air brush and have been purchasing one every year for the past 10 years or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud but it&#x27;s the same as a loud blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> But for me that is a pro, not a con, because if it were any less powerful, it wouldn&#x27;t do the killer job</li>
            <li> I use this hot air brush everyday, and really recommend it if you want a smooth style, not very curly as the brush is 1 inch and a half.</li>
            <li> but apparently it was pulled off the shelf-good riddance!</li>
            <li> I have no other comments</li>
            <li> I partially dry my hair with a traditional hair dryer, then use this hot air brush to style it as I finish drying.  </li>
            <li> The higher wattage allows you to dry and style your hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall is it burns out quickly</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like the long card, the cool shot, and the sturdy feel of it.</li>
            <li> I would say definitely get this thing if you have thick hair like me, but avoid it if you have fine hair, or are sensitive to heat.</li>
            <li> when i saw this one had a Cold Shot button, i was thrilled and decided that it was just a coincidence all those other units burnt out so quickly.  </li>
            <li> and then you have to pay to have it fixed and shipped back.  </li>
            <li> I turned it off and back on again (thinking the smoke may have been from something stuck near the motor that just burned)-</li>
            <li> this WOW, it stayed all day, even when I woke up the next morning</li>
            <li> Brush barely grabs my hair and when I try to use my hand to wrap it around</li>
            <li> It seems that the last two didn&#x27;t last as long as the first two I bought.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really blow enough to help dry.  </li>
            <li> This IS more expensive than other brands, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> The air pushed out is strong and gets my hair dried in half the time my old air brush did.  </li>
            <li> I figured if it&#x27;s hot enough to burn you, it&#x27;s hot enough for my thick frizz ball hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new brand as much, Frieda, because it doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly or dry my hair as fast or as well, but at least it is still working.</li>
            <li> Sad thing is I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> so I would dry it almost completely with a hair dryer then use the brush to add body and curl under ends</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few different hot air brushes.</li>
            <li> your hair isn&#x27;t super thick, definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> later, a friend who owns one suggested that i turn off the ion button, and i&#x27;ve found that as long as i keep that off, it will keep running normally through the time i need to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> HT1074 Anti-Static Ionic Hot Air Brush hot air brush dried my hair quickly (I have long, thick hair), shiny and straight, however it is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> It does get awfully hot, so you have to be a little careful with the positioning of it around your ears.</li>
            <li> It has a one-year life for me, and I baby it to make it last as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Flat irons just make your hair flat.  </li>
            <li> The cords are also extra long</li>
            <li> I found it easier to flat iron.</li>
            <li> BUT.... it don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> And who knows how long it will last...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Hot Tools products in the past, which only last about 6 months tops--</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I use mine after I blow dry my hair with a blow dryer to get the extra volume and take out the frizzies.</li>
            <li> When it gave out recently it was impossible to get the same healthy look with standard products.  </li>
            <li> The barrel is too big for shorter lengths, but I can still use it to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> So, this works to style and dry my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not hard to use or heavy, and has a long cord too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This newer model is hard to grip since the handle is so large.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to get one like my hair dresser with the firm bristles, this one does not have the firm bristles like I expected;  the bristles are too soft so they don&#x27;t really hold the hair when you are styling, you have to wrap and hold yourself.  </li>
            <li> I too have fine, thin hair and this product worked well for a COUPLE MONTHS AT THE LONGEST!  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now, purchasing one after the other has the poop-out, which unfortunately is happening more frequently.  </li>
            <li> Each new one heated up quickly and dried my long, thick hair in about 15 minutes, unfortunately in a few months the motor burned out.</li>
            <li> I love using this product and have had several because I can&#x27;t find a similar product that works as well, but it&#x27;s so badly made, it is probably a fire hazard.  </li>
            <li> I think my hair is to long for it</li>
            <li> so I started using it on my long layers</li>
            <li> It moght work with long hair.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t want to hold it in one place to long.  </li>
            <li> but I expected to last a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was strange.  </li>
            <li> Well, a few days after that, it completely died, went up in a poof of smoke.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it for  long periods.</li>
            <li> My other brus was smaller.</li>
            <li> Made very strange noises.  </li>
            <li> Easiest way for me to dry my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I had to go to work with funky hair because I couldn&#x27;t dry my bangs...</li>
            <li> so doesn&#x27;t take much to dry</li>
            <li> and I let it air dry</li>
            <li> I used it about 3 or 4 days a week, to style my hair after drying it with an average drier, and sure enough, one day it made a sad little noise and started smoking...totally on the fritz.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last half the time as the other one before doing the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Just not worth your money since it is short lived.</li>
            <li> but I am skeptical about being able to return it if it fails in the near future.  </li>
            <li> I have used my second one even less</li>
            <li> Bought it in January, it burned out on me this week, less than 3 months and only ocassional use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item in September, only to have it burn up in less than 4 months.</li>
            <li> Could not live without it!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they do not last long.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry until about half dry, then use this styling tool.  </li>
            <li> For longest life, start with hair that is not dripping wet.  </li>
            <li> I have seen reviews of this same product claiming that the motor burns out within a few months.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money and now I&#x27;m off to find another brush.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have now had this product roughly a month</li>
            <li> I can dry and style my hair with this product alone in less than 15 minutes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bristles are much shorter than the older version and don&#x27;t come close to cutting through my super thick hair.</li>
            <li> and now I have no Hot Air Brush</li>
            <li> This is about my fifth order for this same brush over the past 10 to 15 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product  for the past several years.</li>
            <li> now I get frustrated because the brush falls off so easily.</li>
            <li> I use this hair appliance once in the morning for a few minutes on semi-damp, sometimes dry hair.</li>
            <li> hair usually does not stay curled for long with a curling iron, or conventional curlers.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> At that price, I have to say it was not worth it.  </li>
            <li> not worth buying.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the brush slips off the handle when I am using it  </li>
            <li> At least I know it will last.</li>
            <li> and then it would slow down and rev back up all on</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, damaged by repeatedly bleaching, coloring, and flat ironing it, so</li>
            <li> Compared to others, it is less noisy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It burned out in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I like how the tool worked, but after less than 6 weeks it burned out, and did not work.  </li>
            <li> or I can have it slightly wavy too, if I want.</li>
            <li> My plan is to try the John Frieda product if this one conks out in less than a year.</li>
            <li> a typical blow dryer just makes my hair frizzy and</li>
            <li> The previous one I bought lasted less than 6 months</li>
            <li> Had to replace it and purchased one by Revlon with 2 barrel sizes and a diffuser for a lot less from Walmart</li>
            <li> it is every thing I expected until yesterday ,I used it as usual</li>
            <li> the issue i&#x27;ve had is the power -- in several uses the motor would overheat and stop after only a few minutes, causing me to have to wait 5 min to resume drying my hair - very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It handled my thick, wavy hair without a single snag.</li>
            <li> My wife loves loves loves this little device.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are too short and weak to hold your hair and the dryer makes your hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> After using my brush daily for four years, it started getting weak</li>
            <li> The  motor on my last one lasted 8 months, and when it went it flamed and shocked me when I touched the end of the unit near where the cord comes out.  </li>
            <li> broke after a few months</li>
            <li> A few days after the sellers guarantee and</li>
            <li> &amp; it burned out after 5 months, even with my tiny amount of thin hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t style my hair with it - dried with no style.  </li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.      </li>
            <li> This one was dead after a week.  </li>
            <li> , it was DEAD.  </li>
            <li> we use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Before the motor burned out there was a burning burning odor (it&#x27;s probably an electrical hazard too), then it overheated a few times and stopped working.</li>
            <li> No I didn&#x27;t return them (too much trouble), I just tossed them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have owned this for a while now and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Dry in small sections of about one or two inches thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just returned my sixth one - this one I&#x27;ve had less than one month!  </li>
            <li> Customer service is weak in that the warranty isn&#x27;t long at all</li>
            <li> i bought this brush because i had trouble dryin and braiding my dauhter hair, every time i wash it, it was always hard when i finish blowing it, and she would be crying everytime</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Poor quality which is highly disappointing from Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately after only 2 months and a dozen uses, it burned out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now found another brand that works as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two of these in the past month that had to be returned because they were defective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is</li>
            <li> Then I found it at my local SPCA thrift shop for $3.00 and figured I can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I got on Amazon to return it and was 2 days past the 30 day return period.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard for my hair to keep any sort of curl or wave.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li> Like it would be blowing really hard</li>
            <li> return for another one, but too late and don&#x27;t want to risk another one buring out, as it appears to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that if I&#x27;d have left it on any longer, it would have burst into flames.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m going to give it 3 stars because lately it&#x27;s been heating up and turning off.  </li>
            <li> (my hair isn&#x27;t particulary thick).  </li>
            <li> , I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I found it was difficult to use on other people.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and still bought it thinking the purchasers did something to cause the machine to fail.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Hot Tools HT1074 because I am terrible at using a round brush and blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product has burned out from excessive use - just a poorly made product.  </li>
            <li> the smoke was terrible and the motor was very, very hot.  </li>
            <li> Not a good deal.</li>
            <li> overall just  disappointed in the quality would not buy  this item  again.</li>
            <li> I had the previous model for years, but l left it at the gym and it was taken, so I replaced it with this newer model - terrible.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and</li>
            <li> It should not have broken.  </li>
            <li> I hate that i have to do extra work in the morning to use it.</li>
            <li> The item was used approximately twice (2x) a week.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, listen to the reviews, or be prepared to buy another one in about 6 months.  :-(</li>
            <li> The heating element stopped working, unfortunately I had no recourse to anyone.  </li>
            <li> should the item fail as mine did.  </li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>
            <li> I am sorry that I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> The product went wrong  in one month</li>
            <li> I am also unable to return it for a refund because it is after the &amp;#34;return date&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So sadly, I had to switch brands.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had the motor burn out on 2 units already.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the motor never ran an even speed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Conair no longer makes the model that I used.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and then I have to switch to the cold setting if not it will heat up and turned off.  </li>
            <li> and then you have a Cold Shot to set the style...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dangerous.</li>
            <li> Just inconvenient.</li>
            <li> But the tool dried my hair out terribly?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, its motor burned out in 3 weeks!  </li>
            <li> I thought it was just my bad luck, however, after checking all the reviews on line -</li>
            <li> My friend has had hers for years and it still works, so perhaps I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> Soo bad, it burnt after two weeks of purchased.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> So I gave up &amp; used the base just for heat (no brush)</li>
            <li> So annoying.</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed and would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely disgusting and I do not recommend buying from this seller.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot air brushes to dry and curl my hair for over 10 years and this is by far the best one.  I have never seen this in stores.  I normally use it on the low heat setting because and it works great.  This IS more expensive than other brands, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 of these... They burn out within weeks! Don&#x27;t waste your money! The John freida one is way better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and this one is by far the best.  It does get awfully hot, so you have to be a little careful with the positioning of it around your ears. Other than that, I like the long card, the cool shot, and the sturdy feel of it.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool to blow dry and style your hair everyday. Powerful but doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, very easy to use, hair does not get tangled at all. I use this hot air brush everyday, and really recommend it if you want a smooth style, not very curly as the brush is 1 inch and a half.</li>
            <li> broke after a few months</li>
            <li> Great styling tool I had one before for several years but this ones motor burned out after only two months of use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get another Wahl Styling Brush for travel, but apparently they are discontinued.  Well, I like this one EVEN BETTER!  My fine, thin hair looks full and smooth.  I love this thing, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools Hot Air Brush. I love it. Could not live without it! Gets me the look I want and out the door faster.</li>
            <li> A few days after the sellers guarantee and the A-Z Guarantee ran out (30 days). The heating element stopped working, unfortunately I had no recourse to anyone.  All I can say is keep EVERYTHING relating to the purchase so that you can contact the interested parties IMMEDIATELY should the item fail as mine did.  I thought I liked the product, however by the time I located the paperwork I was past the guarantee period and now I have no Hot Air Brush and I am out $30, which included a $10.96 shiping charge.  If I was willing to spend another $20 in shipping costs, the seller said they would send me another of the $20 item.  My math tells me that the $20 item would end up costing me $50.  At that price, I have to say it was not worth it.  I&#x27;ll look for another company&#x27;s dryer that may be more reliable.</li>
            <li> I have owned two Hot Tools hot air brushes in the last 5 years, same model.  My first one seemed to have gotten a short in it so I had to  stop using it because it would stop.  I thought I would try another one to see if this one pooping out was a fluke.  I have used my second one even less and it didn&#x27;t last half the time as the other one before doing the same thing.  Poor quality which is highly disappointing from Hot Tools.  Customer service is weak in that the warranty isn&#x27;t long at all and then you have to pay to have it fixed and shipped back.  Love the brush otherwise.   Just not worth your money since it is short lived.</li>
            <li> It has good heat, but the whole thing seems like any moment its going to stop working.  I think my hair is to long for it and I have shoulder length, maybe shorter hair would work better. overall just  disappointed in the quality would not buy  this item  again.</li>
            <li> i bought this brush because i had trouble dryin and braiding my dauhter hair, every time i wash it, it was always hard when i finish blowing it, and she would be crying everytime i begin to braid it, so i decide to try something different, and brought the hot brush, and when i it use it on her hair, her hair dry quickly and is was soft, i braid her and she didn&#x27;t even notice, all she was asking me mom u soon finish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this brush.  I have stick straight super fine hair and it dried my hair quickly, gave me much needed volume, and even let me give my hair some shape and curls!  UNFORTUNATELY I bought this brush just 3 weeks ago and after regular use the motor burned out this morning.  It was extremely hot and stunk up my bathroom. Definitely a fire hazard.  Hopefully I can find something similar that&#x27;s a little more reliable.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in 2002 and used it in my salon. I found it was difficult to use on other people. It was packed away for 10 years. A customer asked about it so I lent it to her. She liked it and bought her own so I started using it on my long layers and I loved the soft waves I got! I used it for 3 more years until the plastic became so weak it fell apart- due to being in a fl attic for 10 years and several drops.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one but my mistake it&#x27;s smaller and my hair is longer so it doesn&#x27;t give me the same result but I still like it. I find it easier then hot rollers.</li>
            <li> ordered two - one was great - the other&#x27;s slide button is so loose, hard to control.</li>
            <li> This item worked for me for maybe 10 times, then shut off.  I could not get it to work.  It turned on, I think when it cooled off, just once.  It smelled an electrical burning, then died.  The product should work for tons of times....  It should not have broken.  I want a new one!!! to replace this lemon one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, dries hair quite quickly and is reasonably priced.  I have tried dryers and straighteners of every fashion and have found this product to be superb.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush.  This is my 4th one.  I keep an extra one just in case and one at my second home.  The switch broke on one of them but I use the buttons on the plug and it works fine.  Hope they never stop making this product.  Easiest way for me to dry my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have owned many air brushes over the years and this one is by far my favorite.  My hairdresser turned me on to the Hot Tools Ionic Blow Dryer so I figured I would like this product as well.  The cord is super long and rotates.  The air pushed out is strong and gets my hair dried in half the time my old air brush did.  I will be using Hot Tools products from now on.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews and purchased the original Hot Tools Curling Brush (i had one of those for two years and i dropped and broke it)...when i saw this one had a Cold Shot button, i was thrilled and decided that it was just a coincidence all those other units burnt out so quickly.  Not so. I used it about 3 or 4 days a week, to style my hair after drying it with an average drier, and sure enough, one day it made a sad little noise and started smoking...totally on the fritz.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, listen to the reviews, or be prepared to buy another one in about 6 months.  :-(</li>
            <li> I have used this produt for years. Over 10 years I have bought two. This is why I bought two again just incase the product would go out of business I have a spare. Just love it I get ready in no time!</li>
            <li> stopped working after 6 months</li>
            <li> I love the other Hot Tools hair products. (Mainly because of their great electric cords that don&#x27;t &#x27;snarl&#x27; up)  I loved this one, it worked really great. Unfortunately after only 2 months and a dozen uses, it burned out!!</li>
            <li> This was a great product unfortunately it completley broke only 6 months in. I have short hair use on bangs only</li>
            <li> Great tool.  It is fast and works well with curly hair.  This is my second one.  We wore the 1st one out after 3 years.  Will purchase some for xmas for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> Really like this but after a few uses the switch stopped working and I was beyond the 30-days for returning by two days.  I now must pay $10 plus postage and return it to Helen of Troy for a replacement.  Not a good deal.</li>
            <li> Product is GREAT!!! Use it almost daily and I have shoulder length hair. Dries my hair faster than my normal blow dryer and gives tons of volume.</li>
            <li> If you want to straighten unruly hair while you style it plus have the ease of one-hand holding, then this is exactly what you&#x27;ll want to get the job done - and quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush.  The only down fall is it burns out quickly but the reasonable cost allows it to be replaced without hesitation.</li>
            <li> The Air Brush is okay. Compared to others, it is less noisy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer an independent Controller for heat and power.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping love the item</li>
            <li> I have been using this hot air brush for years and just love it. I use mine after I blow dry my hair with a blow dryer to get the extra volume and take out the frizzies. I have very curly hair and this is the only thing that will actually keep it straight for the whole day.  Flat irons just make your hair flat.  This makes your hair shine and have volume.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.  I loved using this, but the motor burned out in a month.  I used it 3-4 days a week for about 5 minutes each time, so the quality is very poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have paid more attention to all the other reviews that also mention how the motor burns out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 months ago and LOVED it until yesterday when it just died...I thought-maybe overheated so I waited a bit...tried again-nada...I had to go to work with funky hair because I couldn&#x27;t dry my bangs...so DO NOT buy this product (I didn&#x27;t order it from amazon.com) I got it at Target-I went back last night to see if they had another one but apparently it was pulled off the shelf-good riddance!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product on the market- it is of professional quality &amp; this one was a gift to a hair dresser who loves it (I already own 2)! Hot tools makes the best hair care products period as I have purchased their curling irons and other products over the years &amp; wouldn&#x27;t own any other brand.  The cords are also extra long and of course swivel so never any cord tangle and they last for years.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to smooth and style my hair.</li>
            <li> For those who wind up with a head full of frizz using a dryer, this is a great solution.  The brush and blower all in one hand.  For longest life, start with hair that is not dripping wet.  It leaves great texture, shine and curl (if you like) while taming the wayward strands.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are so flexible &amp; short that they don&#x27;t catch &amp; hold hair.  So I gave up &amp; used the base just for heat (no brush) &amp; it burned out after 5 months, even with my tiny amount of thin hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this hot air brush.  I partially dry my hair with a traditional hair dryer, then use this hot air brush to style it as I finish drying.  It&#x27;s much easier than using a regular dryer and a round brush, and the results are better.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves. My hair soft and looking healthy</li>
            <li> My lady was looking for this brand specifically, based on positive comments from her friends I bought her one in October 2013 for my lady. It lasted about 4-5 months before it would not turn on anymore. I thought maybe the first one was defective and decided to give the Hot Tools another chance.I ordered a second one for her in November 2014. It worked fine until the beginning of March. My lady said it started to smell like it was burning. She unplugged it and found her hair was singed. She hasn&#x27;t used it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Ultimately she bought a Conair from a brick and mortar store, just in case she has to return it.</li>
            <li> I had this item just 4 months, when it started smoking and now the heating element is burned out.  I probably used it 6 times.  Would like&lt;br /&gt;to return for another one, but too late and don&#x27;t want to risk another one buring out, as it appears to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still tryiong to get  used to it because a used another product for many years.  My other brus was smaller.</li>
            <li> When I turned on this product for the very first time, the motor started smoking.  I turned it off and back on again (thinking the smoke may have been from something stuck near the motor that just burned)- the smoke was terrible and the motor was very, very hot.  I&#x27;m afraid that if I&#x27;d have left it on any longer, it would have burst into flames.  Buyer beware!    (I purchased this hot iron from Ulta, not Amazon.com).</li>
            <li> This is my second.  The first lasted only one year, but I liked the results and the end is bigger than the original Hot Tools so I didn&#x27;t burn my fingers.  I bought a second and had only used it for two months when the motor burned out complete with a hot handle, glowing innards, and stinky smoke.  A real fire hazard.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing another Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hot Tools HT1074 because I am terrible at using a round brush and blow dryer.  I have curly hair that I sometimes like to dry straight, but not always pin straight as with a flat iron. This product is very easy to use, gives AMAZING body, shine and softness, and doesn&#x27;t make your arms feel like they are going to fall off when done like when using a round brush and blow dryer!  I really like the cool button, because I think it helps set the curl/wave/etc.  I can dry and style my hair with this product alone in less than 15 minutes (my hair isn&#x27;t particulary thick).  You can create different styles with the tool depending on how you use it.  To get straight, smooth style with lots of body, simply pull it straight through the hair, curling the ends a bit under, and end with a cool shot.  For more curl, simply twist the brush at the ends of the hair, and then set the curl with the cool shot.  I do my hair in layers, holding the top layer up with a clip while I dry the under layer.  Dry in small sections of about one or two inches thick.  I let my hair air dry until about half dry, then use this styling tool.  The barrel stays on, but is easy to remove in order to use the concentrator attachment.  I have not found any cons, and would highly recommend this styling tool.</li>
            <li> I do like this. A good price and it does help with some of the frizz. I have thin, straight, long hair and it gives a nice shape but curls do not really last.</li>
            <li> I love using this product and have had several because I can&#x27;t find a similar product that works as well, but it&#x27;s so badly made, it is probably a fire hazard.  The  motor on my last one lasted 8 months, and when it went it flamed and shocked me when I touched the end of the unit near where the cord comes out.  You can prolong the motor&#x27;s life by drying your hair with a hair dryer, and then just using this for styling afterward.  It&#x27;s still the fastest easiest thing to use to style.  I need to stop buying them and will look for something else.</li>
            <li> I too have fine, thin hair and this product worked well for a COUPLE MONTHS AT THE LONGEST!  I kept purchasing this product even after they WOULD burn out because I couldn&#x27;t find another appliance that got as hot or seemed to work comparably. I&#x27;ve just returned my sixth one - this one I&#x27;ve had less than one month!  I have shorter, fine hair as mentioned earlier. I use this hair appliance once in the morning for a few minutes on semi-damp, sometimes dry hair. I don&#x27;t believe this product has burned out from excessive use - just a poorly made product.  I&#x27;ve now found another brand that works as well, if not better. Plus, the motor is not as loud so I won&#x27;t have to chose between curled hair and future deafness. I thought it was just my bad luck, however, after checking all the reviews on line - I see this has been an ONGOING problem with this product.  The manufacturer obviously does not seem to care about customer satisfaction...</li>
            <li> Piece of junk! Used it 6 times on medium setting and it died.  Returned it to the manufacturer for a full refund!</li>
            <li> I really like this tool. It is easy to use and does a great job. My only complaint is that they do not last long. I have had about 5 of them burn out on me after 6 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> Not durabable at all.  Over heat easily.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been through 3 of these and constanly returning them for a replacement.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well, when it works.  Bought it in January, it burned out on me this week, less than 3 months and only ocassional use.  I will be trying to contact the manufacturer on this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair styler. I have shoulder length hair, I first dry my hair with a blower for just a min. and then use the Hot Air Brush to brush under or curl. Easy as can be! My hair dresser had given this to me to try. She really uses it alot. Start with a cool temp. and roll, change temp. to hot and hold, then cool down again before unwrapping, that will hold the curl much better. I don&#x27;t want to think about ever being w/o it - so I bought an extra one so I would NEVER be w/o one!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t style my hair with it - dried with no style.  It moght work with long hair. but mine is short.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this hot air brush and have been purchasing one every year for the past 10 years or so. It has a one-year life for me, and I baby it to make it last as long as possible.</li>
            <li> The bristles are short, almost too short to grasp hair - but it works well with my mid-length hair, and will work great for longer hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I loved it!  I have very thick, curly hair and this product straightened my hair better than any flat iron could.  The 2nd time I used it, it stopped working.  I unplugged it, waited for it to cool and that was it.  It never worked again.  I read other posts from people saying that the motor burned out quickly but I didn&#x27;t heed their warnings.  I am sorry that I purchased this product.  Don&#x27;t buy this, it won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I had this product only for 5 months and stopped working, I should have read the reviews before buying it.</li>
            <li> Makes taking the frizz out of my grey hair quick and easy. I&#x27;ve had one of these for 3 years and just recently replaced it. Use it every day. Amazing track record!</li>
            <li> I loooove this hair dryer. I have fine hair and for the first time in my life I have full looking, non static hair. People comment on how nice it looks and that has never happened to me before. I have even taken it to my stylist for her to try. I have given these to daughters and sisters and recommended them to friends. It is the best hair product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> great while it worked, then it overheated a few months after and now it&#x27;s dead. Top part came off while I was doing my hair all the time. Spend a bit more money and get a better one that will last.</li>
            <li> I have used this same brand of air brush for many years. I have ordered two of these in the past month that had to be returned because they were defective.  On the first one the on-off button didn&#x27;t work properly; I had to unplug it to get it to turn off.  On the second one the blower doesn&#x27;t come on at all; it makes a whiny sound but no air blows out.  I now have one that seems to be working OK but I am skeptical about being able to return it if it fails in the near future.  I feel I should be able to depend on the blower to last at least a few years.  I only use it a couple of times a week.  Perhaps I should start to look for a different brand of air brush.</li>
            <li> Great product, the first one lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have thin fine hair and it works great for styling it without to much heat that causes damage.</li>
            <li> Made very strange noises.  Not what I wanted.  Sent back.</li>
            <li> It over heated from start. I should have returned it because it burned out after using a very short time. I did like the brush on it it held your hair good. Might have been just a glitch when made.</li>
            <li> Love this Dryer/Curler.&lt;br /&gt;My hair usually does not stay curled for long with a curling iron, or conventional curlers.&lt;br /&gt;With this WOW, it stayed all day, even when I woke up the next morning my hair still had a curl in it!&lt;br /&gt;It is not hard to use or heavy, and has a long cord too.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. :)</li>
            <li> I had the same item and liked it so much that I wanted another one. I was glad that I could still get another one. It is get for traveling because it folds down making it great for packing. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.. when i first got it I was really impressed with it even though the brush falls off easily.. now I get frustrated because the brush falls off so easily. It&#x27;s loud but it&#x27;s the same as a loud blowdryer.  I have to hold the brush while i&#x27;m using it &amp; it burns my hand sometimes. I hate that i have to do extra work in the morning to use it. If I have time then it&#x27;s good, it smooths my hair down &amp; looks really good... but since I don&#x27;t have time to mess around with it in the morning before work it&#x27;s not that great. I thought it would be a good alternative to the instyler.. but it&#x27;s not.. it&#x27;s just ok..for weekend use only!</li>
            <li> Great for short-Ned length hair</li>
            <li> The product went wrong  in one month&lt;br /&gt;II expected to be able to use it at list for one year&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it to anybody</li>
            <li> I returned it because it overheated and burned out after only two weeks use.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It burned out in less than a month. Disgraceful. Used to be far better quality. Did not take the time to send back. Had to run and buy another brand. Threw in wastebasket!!!!</li>
            <li> I like how the tool worked, but after less than 6 weeks it burned out, and did not work.  I am also unable to return it for a refund because it is after the &amp;#34;return date&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product was just ok for me. I got it for the concentration nozel so that I can just blow out my roots (I have chemically relaxed hair)and stretch time out between my relaxers. I have seen women use it on you tube really well so maybe it how I am using it. I think it has potential to be a great product and depends on your skill. I found it easier to flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same dryer for years, it&#x27;s my favorite and I have tried quite a few different hot air brushes. It makes your hair really soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Great power, great heat, perfect barrel length, but the bristles are too short for thick hair. *sobs*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an older version of this brush for 10 years and it was awesome. It finally died and I replaced it with another. The heat, and power are exactly what I wanted, and I love the barrel length. Unfortunately, the bristles are much shorter than the older version and don&#x27;t come close to cutting through my super thick hair. I had to return it. I&#x27;m so bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair isn&#x27;t super thick, definitely buy it. Finishing out a rough blow-out or air-dry with this is awesome.</li>
            <li> The best ever. I used to have to use my hot iron and now this makes everything perfect every morning</li>
            <li> Loved this while it worked. It only worked for 2 weeks went up in smoke.  Sad thing is I have very fine hair so doesn&#x27;t take much to dry so really it shouldn&#x27;t have went out so soon.</li>
            <li> This is really nice and easy. I like that and love it. Have nice Great Day! No frizz! GOOD Job.</li>
            <li> My unit cracked at the place were you put the brush into the unit. I thought it should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> As with other reviewers, it seemed very nice at first but after about a dozen uses, the motor literally burned out. DO NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  When my last one broke I decided to order on Amazon.  It died in two weeks!  I ordered another one and it died in three days.  I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is but maybe the price here is too good to be true.  I ordered another one from my local beauty supply at mor than double the price.  But this new one looks like it has a new plug design.  So far so good.  You have to know how to use this brush as taught by a professional.  It is hot so you don&#x27;t want to hold it in one place to long.  Need to keep it moving.</li>
            <li> Like TeaKayPea, I found this brush to be great on my hair, but faulty overall. It handled my thick, wavy hair without a single snag. And I was thrilled -- for all of three minutes. Then it burnt out and despite my best efforts to revive it (letting it cool, reseting the plug, etc.) it never worked again. Don&#x27;t waste your money.      UPDATE: While waiting for a shipping label to return the brush, I tried it one more time. It had \\&quot;rested\\&quot; for a day, and this time when I plugged it in it worked! I&#x27;m holding on to the brush, but not my breath. We&#x27;ll see how it behaves going forward...</li>
            <li> Really works well with my thin, baby fine hair. My hairdresser recommended it to me and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these and both motors burned out in a fairly short period of time.  The first one lasted longer than the second one but neither made it through a year.  I like the concept so I found the same thing in a Revlon product that works just as well and doesn&#x27;t have the same issue with the motor.  If they would fix the problem with the motor overheating, it would be a great product.  But as of now, I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more Hot Tools products.</li>
            <li> I have had many of these curling brushes - the do a great job on your hair, in fact it does a great job......BUT.... it don&#x27;t last long.  My last order was 2 months ago and it started overheating just after one month when I could no longer return it.  Now it won&#x27;t turn off unless I unplug it and I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  It does everything I want it to do without having to use two hands!!</li>
            <li> This is about my fifth order for this same brush over the past 10 to 15 years. I absolutely love it for my naturally curly hair. I blow dry my hair with the Hot Tools Hair Dryer and then style it with this Brush and my hair is smooth and straight or I can have it slightly wavy too, if I want. Wonderful product I hope they never stop making! The stores here stopped selling them so I usually buy two at a time, just to be safe!</li>
            <li> The hot air brush works wonderfully, then it stops suddenly, often becoming very hot and smelly,after just a few months.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I had this hot brush for over a year now and I totally love it.  With this I just washed my hair and I let it air dry and then I use the hot brush.  My hair comes out full and bouncy.  However, I&#x27;m going to give it 3 stars because lately it&#x27;s been heating up and turning off.  Yesterday, morning it was smelling like it got burned.  The way that I&#x27;ve been able to keep it from not burning is that I&#x27;ll use the hot setting and then I have to switch to the cold setting if not it will heat up and turned off.  I know it&#x27;s been a year but I expected to last a bit longer.  I purchased this thru a hair supply store and I paid $40.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hot air brush for years, and recently purchased my third one.  In each case, the brush lasted several years (5-6)with near-daily use.  I think the concentrator tools are really a gimmick, but the brush itself works great and is easy to use.  As someone who really hates using curling irons because of burnt fingers, this brush is awesome in that you can touch the bristles without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and they liked it</li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush a few months ago and I love it!  I have very fine, thin hair and it&#x27;s hard for my hair to keep any sort of curl or wave.  But with this brush I can style my hair in the morning (curled under at the ends) and it stays put all day.  Easy to use, great product.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good... a little awkward at first, definitely takes some getting used to.  It&#x27;s worth the investment of time, though - nice hair styler!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product and I love it. Have tried others but keep going back to this one. Easy to handle and does a grat job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take practice and a tired arm, but this dryer brush is great! I love using it on my fringe since a flat iron makes it too flat for my liking. I&#x27;ve used this on clients as well and it&#x27;s really nice!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It gives me volume and a bit of curl and tames the flyaways.  Why not 5 stars?  This is my second - I felt the first one burned out too quickly.  Still, I like it enough that I ordered a second!!</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about purchasing this item but after reading the mixed reviews, I was hesitant.  Then I found it at my local SPCA thrift shop for $3.00 and figured I can&#x27;t go wrong.  I have fine hair, but a fair amount, cut in a short graduated bob (chin length).  I use this instead of my curling iron.  I had intended for it to replace my blow dryer also, but I found the best solution for me is to blow dry my hair 80% dry and then use the hot air brush to dry the rest of the way for volume and curl.  I get much more volume than I did with the hair dryer and round brush as it seemed like that method actually pulled the volume out of my hair instead of adding volume.  The curling iron adds too much curl and not enough volume. This product gives me the perfect amount of volume with some curl.  I don&#x27;t know how long this product will last, based on reviews I read, but I am taking care to keep the vents free from hair and the intake area clear of dust.  I have only had it a week and I love that I no longer need my curling iron and have taken 5-10 minutes off my morning routine with this.  An added plus is that when I travel I will not have to wait to pack my curling iron when it cools off.  But there is room for improvement--- the barrel comes off easily and needs a more secure connection.  Also, the design is such that it is very easy to cover the intake vents with your hand.  It could be made a wee bit longer with more of a tip at the end to hold with your other hand.  And who knows how long it will last...  My plan is to try the John Frieda product if this one conks out in less than a year.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT made well - this is the second one I purchased in three months - they keep burning up and after&lt;br /&gt;a month AMAZON will not take it back!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves loves loves this little device.  She gets her hair done by professional hairdressers when she goes on TV.  She asked how she could make her hair look like the way they make it, but at home.  They told her to get one of these.</li>
            <li> This looked like the perfect hot air brush; however, after just 3-4 uses it burned up and was no longer functional.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> A great tool to freshen up your style...it can be very hot to dry..or recurl your hair and then you have a Cold Shot to set the style...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for about two months and it&#x27;s dangerous. After the last use, it started to smell like something inside was burning. The handle got really hot so I unplugged it immediately. I&#x27;ve owned other Hot Tools products in the past, which only last about 6 months tops--But they just die, they&#x27;ve never smelled like a burning fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item should be recalled as it could potentially prove fatal.</li>
            <li> just as i expected, I&#x27;m able to get my hair dry and styled in one setting.</li>
            <li> It adds volume and makes a huge difference. I have naturally curly and difficult manage hair and this works like a charm to help smooth and style my hair.</li>
            <li> This air brush works better than most models, but be prepared to replace it.  This is my third Hot Tools air brush.  The last 2 stopped blowing hot air after the warranty was up.  This newer model is hard to grip since the handle is so large.</li>
            <li> I really love this hot air brush.  I had one years ago and it lasted for ages.  This one was dead after a week.  They are definitely made as good as they used to be.  Don&#x27;t order - more of a hassle to return.  Mine is still sitting in the box.  Amazon wouldn&#x27;t take it back because I wrote that it didn&#x27;t work anymore.  So I&#x27;m stuck with this brand new non-functioning air brush.</li>
            <li> I love the look of blowouts, but I don&#x27;t seem to be coordinated to hold a brush and dryer at the same time. This hot air brush makes it easy to recreate blowouts yourself. I have long hair (down to my middle back), and surprisingly haven&#x27;t had any issues with my hair getting tangled or burnt. Very happy with this product - easy to use and doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered in what appeared to be new packaging.  The item was delivered around 1 May (it is now 8 July).  The item was used approximately twice (2x) a week.  The item is now burned up; makes noises and smells like an electrical fire.</li>
            <li> I have seen reviews of this same product claiming that the motor burns out within a few months.  Mine burned out after about a dozen uses!  I had the previous model for years, but l left it at the gym and it was taken, so I replaced it with this newer model - terrible.  Thankfully Amazon worked with me to refund my money.</li>
            <li> I really love the product but i have already used 3 that eventually died on me. not worth buying. doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago and used it a couple times.  Worked great.  However I believe it was the 4th or 5th time using it, it was DEAD.  Thought I needed to reset the breaker, no such luck.  Since I throw out the box felt I couldn&#x27;t even try and return it.  I love the hot tools product line.  I own four curling irons and a BROKEN Hot Air Brush, trying to decided if I should take a chance and buy another one?</li>
            <li> This product broke after not even a full week of use. I was VERY disappointed and would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> My friend has one of these hot air brushes, and I loved it, so I got one just like it. It worked great for a few weeks. Then one day, it sputtered and got really hot and stopped working. What a shame. I am returning it. I wanted a replacement, but was informed by Amazon that I could only get a refund, not an exchange. So now I have to go through the ordering process again, too. Just inconvenient. I will order a replacement and hope I have better luck. My friend has had hers for years and it still works, so perhaps I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> Works great I wish this tool came with interchangeable brush sizes so you can change it for different lengths  of hair. It just comes with one brush that comes off and you can use just the blower part. I find I would need smaller brush barrel on top of my head and bigger brush barrel in the back.</li>
            <li> My daughter has this product and it has worked well for her.  I loved it until it died.  I read the other reviews and still bought it thinking the purchasers did something to cause the machine to fail.  I wish I knew what that was, because it happened to me too and now I must go through the aggravation of returning it.</li>
            <li> Used this hot air brush for four months and it died! That wasn&#x27;t even using it every day--maybe once a week. I&#x27;ve had others like this that have worked very well, but this particular product did not last!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that ever happened to me. I have really thick hair, damaged by repeatedly bleaching, coloring, and flat ironing it, so a typical blow dryer just makes my hair frizzy and caveman- like. I got this thing thinking that it would just be nice for curling my ends, but that I would still have to flat iron my hair as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG. This thing actually styles and dries my hair completely, giving it a nice curl at the ends with bounce, and minimizing frizz so much that I only have to flat iron a few strands on top, instead of spending 30 minutes ironing my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had airbrushes in the past but they didn&#x27;t get hot enough... so I chose this one, based on some reviewers saying that it burned them. I figured if it&#x27;s hot enough to burn you, it&#x27;s hot enough for my thick frizz ball hair. I was right - this thing is seriously powerful. But they were right too - it gets hot at the end so it&#x27;s hard to hold on to. But for me that is a pro, not a con, because if it were any less powerful, it wouldn&#x27;t do the killer job it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say definitely get this thing if you have thick hair like me, but avoid it if you have fine hair, or are sensitive to heat.</li>
            <li> it works well.  it is much easier to use than a round brush and hairdryer.  I have no other comments but amazon&#x27;s moronic system requires me to write more to leave their requested review.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Girlfriend and her daughter and we already had it replaced once 9 months ago and now we need to have it replaced again, they make sure no hair gets caught in the filter for the air dryer, and the brush just stopped working all of a sudden. I think there is a design flaw with this product. we are just gonna return it to amazon and purchase a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: had this replaced 3 times for the same reason, I know its not a power issue at my home, but another one stopped working after 1 month of use. I returned it to amazon and got my money back.</li>
            <li> I always buy a spare excellent hot air brush. love love love, my mom has one too. we use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have real fine hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be large but it curl my hair fast and soft I love it</li>
            <li> Soo bad, it burnt after two weeks of purchased.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for fine hair. Ionic technology helps prevent damage. I&#x27;ve used this product  for the past several years. When it gave out recently it was impossible to get the same healthy look with standard products.  This was a replacement.- highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now, purchasing one after the other has the poop-out, which unfortunately is happening more frequently.  The previous one I bought lasted less than 6 months but luckily I bought it through Amazon and they responded very quickly in giving me a refund.  This is why I appreciate companies like Amazon (and Costco) -- they are customer friendly and supportive, not like other companies who have told me I have to deal directly with the manufacturer if I have a problem.</li>
            <li> Brush barely grabs my hair and when I try to use my hand to wrap it around brush it burns my hand. This will be going back.</li>
            <li> Ordered my hot air bush in August and it burned out last night. Really bummed because it worked so well and seemed well made, bummer.</li>
            <li> Good idea.  Loved it when it worked but it died after 6 uses!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use on my hair when it was longer, however it really does not work well on shorter hair. The barrel is too big for shorter lengths, but I can still use it to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks and feels  My only complaint is the brush slips off the handle when I am using it  It is hot and burns my hands</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools HT1074 Anti-Static Ionic Hot Air Brush hot air brush dried my hair quickly (I have long, thick hair), shiny and straight, however it is very poorly made. I have bought five of them. Each new one heated up quickly and dried my long, thick hair in about 15 minutes, unfortunately in a few months the motor burned out. Before the motor burned out there was a burning burning odor (it&#x27;s probably an electrical hazard too), then it overheated a few times and stopped working. I would turn it off and it will start again, until it didn&#x27;t. It seems that the last two didn&#x27;t last as long as the first two I bought. I actually started buying two at a time so I would have a backup. So sadly, I had to switch brands. I don&#x27;t like the new brand as much, Frieda, because it doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly or dry my hair as fast or as well, but at least it is still working. No I didn&#x27;t return them (too much trouble), I just tossed them.</li>
            <li> I do not get the results I had hoped for with this product. It is a great idea and makes blow drying easy but it sometimes rips strands of hair out when they are unconsciously sucked into the barrel.</li>
            <li> This product was good, while it worked.  Unfortunately for me, its motor burned out in 3 weeks!  Probably a good thing, being that it is defective, that the motor burned out right away and I could get my purchase price refunded without any hassle.  I probably will not buy anything from this manufacturer again.  Thanks, amazon, for processing my refund right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this in early January and here it is March and it doesn&#x27;t  work anymore.  Great while it lasted but I won&#x27;t buy again!  So annoying.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after my hair dresser used it after a fresh perm. Loved the results,  However, when I used it on my own&lt;br /&gt;not sure what I did wrong?  But the tool dried my hair out terribly?</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are too short and weak to hold your hair and the dryer makes your hair frizzy.  Do not like the product and would not recommend purchasing this product</li>
            <li> The older one I had just like this one, I liked better (dropped on ceramic tile and broke it!) this one work fine, but seems to make my hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li> the design is convenient and gives good lift underneath the hair when drying.  the issue i&#x27;ve had is the power -- in several uses the motor would overheat and stop after only a few minutes, causing me to have to wait 5 min to resume drying my hair - very frustrating.  when i reported this to amazon, they credited me immediately.  later, a friend who owns one suggested that i turn off the ion button, and i&#x27;ve found that as long as i keep that off, it will keep running normally through the time i need to dry my hair.  of course this means i&#x27;ve lost use of the ion feature.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS BRUSH... However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these about four years ago and it was fantastic.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t live without it everyday.  The higher wattage allows you to dry and style your hair at the same time.  So many of these barely blow air but this one really blows.  After using my brush daily for four years, it started getting weak and I knew it was going to give out.  So, I got on Amazon and got very excited to see that I could still order the exact same brush, so I did.  I received my brush and it worked great for a few weeks.  Around the fourth week, I noticed that it started changing speeds.  Like it would be blowing really hard and then it would slow down and rev back up all on it&#x27;s own.  I never touched any of the buttons while using it, it just did this on it&#x27;s own.  I thought it was strange.  Well, a few days after that, it completely died, went up in a poof of smoke.  I got on Amazon to return it and was 2 days past the 30 day return period.  So, the current reviews are correct.  This thing has changed and is a complete piece of junk now.  It was a total waste of money and now I&#x27;m off to find another brush.  I&#x27;m going to try the 1200 watt Revlon Shine Enhancing brush and see how that compares.  I already own the 500 watt Revlon Hot Brush and it works, but it takes longer for me to style my hair because I have to use my blow dryer until my hair is almost dry before I can even use the styling brush.  It gets really hot but it doesn&#x27;t really blow enough to help dry.  It&#x27;s more of a styling product rather than a drying product and I&#x27;m looking for a 2-n-1 that does both at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have thin,fine and straight hair and the only thing that really works for me is a brush curling iron with curl release.  I had used another brand for over 15 years and then that company discontinued their product.  I ordered this product and I thought it had the curl release which it did not so I had to return it.  It was my mistake and not the companies and I wish you would make one with the curl release.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This works great to straighten my thin, curly/frizzy hair. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had the motor burn out on 2 units already. I&#x27;m about to purchase my 3rd one because it&#x27;s the best hot air styler I&#x27;ve found so far, but I definitely don&#x27;t enjoy replacing it yearly.</li>
            <li> JUST ANOTHER CURLING IRON GIVEN AS A GIFT; NO COMPLAINTS FROM THE RECIPIENT.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It was recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> The first time I turned it on, it started smoking and it burned up. I never got to use it. Total waste of money. I have had this brand before and they have been fine but not this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hold on to the brush barrel when it is turned to high--will burn u.  It is a good size.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and I use this hot air brush to straighten my hair, it does not make it pin straight but that is not what I am looking for.  I have been useing the hot tool for years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice while it worked - (ha-ha).  Had to replace it and purchased one by Revlon with 2 barrel sizes and a diffuser for a lot less from Walmart</li>
            <li> It works so well on my straight hair...giving my hair just the right curl and body to go through the day.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT HAS NO LONGEVITY.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I had one that lasted for 4 years and when it broke I decided to go with the same dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was eager to receive my hot air brush in the mail. However, I received the Hot Air Brush not in it&#x27;s original box. It was in a plastic sleeve instead. I pulled the brush out of the sleeve to find it had hair in the brush. This product had obviously been used. This is absolutely disgusting and I do not recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my daughter , I had looked for ,could not find. Thank you, for helping out. She was so happy to received what  Hot Tool.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.  I had hoped to get one like my hair dresser with the firm bristles, this one does not have the firm bristles like I expected;  the bristles are too soft so they don&#x27;t really hold the hair when you are styling, you have to wrap and hold yourself.  I was disappointed and would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have now had this product roughly a month, it does not shut off, have to click the yellow switch on the plug to cut it off and even in the off position when I press the red switch, it comes back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further update - Jan 31, 2013  Do not buy this item, I have thick hair so I would dry it almost completely with a hair dryer then use the brush to add body and curl under ends, did not use enough for the problem I have had.  I finally got it to turn off and it would come back on, worked fine for one or two uses then the burning smell started right after I turned it on yesterday and smoke was coming from.  I believe this model is more of a risk than anything else...</li>
            <li> Sadly, ten uses and it over heated. The plastic section of the handle became extremely hot and tripped the circuit. No reviving this thing. When it worked ...it was fabulous, but certainly not worth the danger.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in September, only to have it burn up in less than 4 months. I used the hot air brush only occasionally, perhaps 2 times a week. It did a nice job styling my hair, and I think the anti-static ionic feature made a difference. Unfortunately, the motor never ran an even speed. The second to last time I used it, I thought I smelled smoke. The last time I used it, I definitely saw smoke. That was enough for me to throw the item in the trash. As a result, I just can&#x27;t recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a period of over twenty years, I had 2 different hot air brushes from Conair. Unfortunately Conair no longer makes the model that I used. I took a chance on this Hot Tools item as a replacement, but this Hot Tools product was more expensive AND failed in 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time with a Hot Tools product. It also was my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a different Conair product. At least I know it will last.</li>
            <li> The motor on this item burned out within a short time of purchase.  Very unhappy with it. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I need to buy another one because I left mine in a hotel but it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I have owned this for a while now and use it everyday. I really appreciate it&#x27;s ease.  I rarely, rarely use the high setting as this is what burns these things out quickly;  however, I don&#x27;t need to as the low setting does just fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t manage drying my hair with holding a brush and a hair dryer.  So, this works to style and dry my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy to use and works well.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I liked the Hot Tool it is every thing I expected until yesterday ,I used it as usual it started&lt;br /&gt;smelling as if it were burning I turned it off allowing it to cool.I have short hair so I don&#x27;t use it for  long periods. When I turned it again it began to smoke and stopped.&lt;br /&gt; I regret having to return it. I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month.</li>
