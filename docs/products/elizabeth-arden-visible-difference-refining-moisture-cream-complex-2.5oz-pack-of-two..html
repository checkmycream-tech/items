            <li>This is the best price for Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference.</li>
            <li>When I look at my watch, it has been and continues to be as perfectly centered on the twelve o&#x27;clock mark as my eyes could ever detect</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great product, price &amp; shipping!</li>

            <li>A great product and I am very happy to have a supply again.</li>
            <li>Great product and good price!</li>
            <li>The price was great but the quality of the product is not creamy like I was buying here in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I&#x27;ve been using this since 1980 ...</li>
            <li>Great Product but Slowest shipping from this company ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with product, it was delivered before the date they guaranteed.  </li>
            <li>if that’s something you want to use, you better have very good eyesight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Visible Difference for over 10 years and loved how my skin looked and felt.  </li>
            <li>best product available</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer, very refreshing on my skin!</li>
            <li>sure why not; she  looke great for her age.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I’m very pleased with this watch</li>
            <li>Used it for years and love this product!</li>
            <li>Once, in the 1980s I did a little experiment with Visible Difference, Clinique&#x27;s best selling moisturizer and Estee Lauder&#x27;s best seller.</li>
            <li>I have access to many skincare products that are sold thru dermatologists and plastic surgeons and as a straight forward moisturizer this is the best.</li>
            <li>I have been used this product for many years, I love it, make my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOISTURIZER.</li>
            <li>Glad to have 2 because I will use them both.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product twice before now and was quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Mother has been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>my wife favorite  cream.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite watch since the day I received it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides functioning as well as anyone could reasonably expect, this watch looks great.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and after you wash your face - it leaves your skin supple, moist and lovely to touch.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>This is a very nice cream and makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Obviously, this is just my opinion, but I will not be buying this product again and will never understand why a company with a good product insists on changing it!</li>
            <li>It’s easy to see the time at a glance, day or night.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance and some of the ingredients have changed a little over the years, but it still feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li>It has always felt light and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great cream that totally cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li>This cream is smooth without being greasy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfectly light.</li>
            <li>Be sure to still use it full strength around eyes and mouth where wrinkles are more present.</li>
            <li>I should have gone to the department store as before, but looking for a break on the price I ordered through Lucky Girl on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on beauty products, but Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference is worth it.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and sometimes I have to apply Aveeno hand lotion more than six times per day even if I am consistently drinking water.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference on my dry skin and gets absorbed very quickly allowing the sunscreen to also penetrate the skin quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It blends easily into the skin and leaves it soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It does not have the same fragrance as the authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Visible Difference make my face feel soft and dewey fresh.</li>
            <li>and I really like it when I’m wearing it at formal affairs.  </li>
            <li>In the summer when my skin does not require as much moisture</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but this product that I received is not the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>I recently ordered it through Amazon from Lucky Girl.  </li>
            <li>The hands and the hour markers around the face sparkle with a highly polished surface that I could have lived without, nevertheless, it has sort of grown on me</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It normally runs for $52.00 for ONE bottle alone at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>When I opened the product, the protective seal under the lid that is normally there was not there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes when I&#x27;m still up at midnight, I hear my cell phone &#x27;hum&#x27; to mark the beginning of a new day.  </li>
            <li>price was great if the product had been real at about per jar, but for cold cream, the cost is horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>I  have been using this product for years under my makeup and is not greasy and keeps my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a better way to describe it.</li>
            <li>The part about it lessening the signs of aging is complete hokum.  </li>
            <li>I use another moisturizer with sunscreen over it, but it&#x27;s the Visible Difference that puts, and keeps the moisture in my 70 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>product was old stock, no longer creamy</li>
            <li>If things go as well as they have so far, I won&#x27;t need to make any adjustments until Daylight Savings Time ends on November 1, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tiny window where the day of the month is displayed is a feature I could live without as well.  </li>
            <li>Its texture is less creamy than the real stuff.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Its texture is less creamy than the real stuff.</li>
            <li> After trying others recently I find that this cream absorbs into my skin while others dry on the surface.</li>
            <li> I thought it was strange, but still used the product.  </li>
            <li> BUT, if you have dry skin, THIS is the stuff.  </li>
            <li> my face felt dry in the morning, but then it got too oily during the day.</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as the prior product, does not have the same texture or odor, and I seem to be allergic to this one -- not a problem in the past.</li>
            <li> Looking for a little something extra to keep the dryness away and this fits the need.</li>
            <li> The product delivered had a texture more like Ponds cold cream, and perhaps was even a little stiffer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never really use it and</li>
            <li> I simply lightly wet my face with water and then use the product</li>
            <li> I am guessing that the product is old and that is why it seems so thick and irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> Even on the days when my hands are feeling tight and dry, my face skin is not feeling tight and dry with the use of Visible Difference.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it every other day to no avail.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the second hand has been an issue with watches I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> Every other product that I have tried leaves me with some sort of skin reaction.  </li>
            <li> This product is thick in the jar and on my face - more like a cold cream.  </li>
            <li> If it wasn’t clicking&#x27; exactly on the second markers around the face of the watch, I’d feel disappointed in the watch</li>
            <li> Wasted money and will never order from them again.</li>
            <li> Have used it as a night cream for years and mix it 50-50 with Retin A cream, to avoid the harsh dryness caused by Retin A.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT authentic.</li>
            <li> I put a raisin, one each in three small containers.  </li>
            <li> Especially in this severe cold weather.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, just days after using it my face started breaking out really badly, which is not typical, and I don&#x27;t believe this to be a coincidence.  </li>
            <li> It has a different texture and scent, and smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy about the size of the jars I ordered and paid for..&lt;br</li>
            <li> But false advertising.  </li>
            <li> Now my face is all broken out and itchy and uncomfortable, and who knows what this crap is that I&#x27;ve put on my face.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fresher than what you can find at the store/mall.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOISTURIZER.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cream and makes your skin feel so soft. Especially in this severe cold weather. Looking for a little something extra to keep the dryness away and this fits the need. Glad to have 2 because I will use them both.</li>
            <li> I have used Visible Difference for over 10 years and loved how my skin looked and felt.  I recently ordered it through Amazon from Lucky Girl.  This product is thick in the jar and on my face - more like a cold cream.  It has always felt light and smooth.  My face reddens after using from this company and itches during the day.  I tried using it every other day to no avail.  I am guessing that the product is old and that is why it seems so thick and irritates my skin.  I should have gone to the department store as before, but looking for a break on the price I ordered through Lucky Girl on Amazon.  They will not take the product back. Wasted money and will never order from them again.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t changed, My wife loves the product.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price!</li>
            <li> A great product and I am very happy to have a supply again.</li>
            <li> I have been used this product for many years, I love it, make my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice before now and was quite satisfied. Can&#x27;t recall whether I reviewed the earlier product, but would have given them a five. This time, however, the formula seems to be different. Unlike prior orders, this one came from the UK. Perhaps that accounts for the obvious difference in formulation. It does not work as well as the prior product, does not have the same texture or odor, and I seem to be allergic to this one -- not a problem in the past. Obviously, this is just my opinion, but I will not be buying this product again and will never understand why a company with a good product insists on changing it!</li>
            <li> I was not happy about the size of the jars I ordered and paid for..&lt;br /&gt; They were only 2.5 oz.....I paid the SAME price for the 3.4 oz. on my last order.</li>
            <li> Excellent ¡!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent day and night time moisturizer for my face.  The part about it lessening the signs of aging is complete hokum.  Don&#x27;t believe a word of it. BUT, if you have dry skin, THIS is the stuff.  I live in a desert climate and sometimes I have to apply Aveeno hand lotion more than six times per day even if I am consistently drinking water.  Even on the days when my hands are feeling tight and dry, my face skin is not feeling tight and dry with the use of Visible Difference.  This product does lock in moisture from the time I put it on in the morning to the time I wash my face before bed at night. It is &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but I like that.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference for 25 years. This product is NOT authentic. How do I know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does not have the same fragrance as the authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Its texture is less creamy than the real stuff. The product delivered had a texture more like Ponds cold cream, and perhaps was even a little stiffer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product came in the box with the card board, etc., it was not sealed with the outer cellophane that the product purchased at retail establishments has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was great if the product had been real at about per jar, but for cold cream, the cost is horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years.  After trying others recently I find that this cream absorbs into my skin while others dry on the surface.</li>
            <li> Mother has been using this product for many years and she likes and sure why not; she  looke great for her age.&lt;br /&gt;probably I&#x27;ll keep buying this  product.</li>
            <li> my wife favorite  cream.  thanks</li>
            <li> Great cream that totally cleared up my skin! But it smells like death.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Visible Difference for about 40 years, so I am relieved to know I can get it from Amazon.com,  It&#x27;s just the perfect moisturizer -- for my skin anyway.</li>
            <li> Have used it as a night cream for years and mix it 50-50 with Retin A cream, to avoid the harsh dryness caused by Retin A.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since 1982!  I can&#x27;t even comprehend how my skin would feel without applying it every morning and night.  I use another moisturizer with sunscreen over it, but it&#x27;s the Visible Difference that puts, and keeps the moisture in my 70 year old skin.  Once, in the 1980s I did a little experiment with Visible Difference, Clinique&#x27;s best selling moisturizer and Estee Lauder&#x27;s best seller. I put a raisin, one each in three small containers.  I then put a dab of each moisturizer on a raisin and sealed it for a couple of days.  When I opened each container the raisins in Estee, and in Clinique containers were oily raisins.  The Elizabeth Arden raisin was plumped and moist without being oily.  That is one reason why I still use this product.  The fragrance and some of the ingredients have changed a little over the years, but it still feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li> The price was great but the quality of the product is not creamy like I was buying here in the U.S.</li>
            <li> This cream is smooth without being greasy. It blends easily into the skin and leaves it soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on beauty products, but Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference is worth it. Now that I&#x27;m 43-years-old my face felt dry in the morning, but then it got too oily during the day. Visible Difference make my face feel soft and dewey fresh. I use it morning and night and my face feels &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; throughout the day. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a better way to describe it. I&#x27;ve ordered this product four times, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it!</li>
            <li> product was old stock, no longer creamy</li>
            <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference for 30 years and this is the only creme that I use.  This is the best price for Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite watch since the day I received it.  I had reservations about owning a watch without a second hand, but the lack of one serves only to add to the solid feel of this watch.  I set it on the day it arrived and to this day, I&#x27;ve not needed to adjust the minute hand at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when I&#x27;m still up at midnight, I hear my cell phone &#x27;hum&#x27; to mark the beginning of a new day.  When I look at my watch, it has been and continues to be as perfectly centered on the twelve o&#x27;clock mark as my eyes could ever detect and I&#x27;m a tad fastidious (ocd) when it comes to things like that.  In fact, the second hand has been an issue with watches I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  If it wasn’t clicking&#x27; exactly on the second markers around the face of the watch, I’d feel disappointed in the watch’s quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I write this, coincidently, I need to adjust the watch for Daylight Savings Time.  (March 8. 2015)  I received the watch on November 13, 2014.  If things go as well as they have so far, I won&#x27;t need to make any adjustments until Daylight Savings Time ends on November 1, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides functioning as well as anyone could reasonably expect, this watch looks great.  It’s easy to see the time at a glance, day or night.  The hands and the hour markers around the face sparkle with a highly polished surface that I could have lived without, nevertheless, it has sort of grown on me and I really like it when I’m wearing it at formal affairs.  The tiny window where the day of the month is displayed is a feature I could live without as well.  I never really use it and if that’s something you want to use, you better have very good eyesight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I’m very pleased with this watch and I would recommend it to anyone without reservation.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. and the price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Been using Visible Difference for years.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I&#x27;ve been using this since 1980 ...</li>
            <li> Great product, price &amp; shipping!</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for years under my makeup and is not greasy and keeps my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I received it promptly!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Rose</li>
            <li> Very happy with the service and product.</li>
            <li> I have access to many skincare products that are sold thru dermatologists and plastic surgeons and as a straight forward moisturizer this is the best. It normally runs for $52.00 for ONE bottle alone at Macy&#x27;s. In the summer when my skin does not require as much moisture I simply lightly wet my face with water and then use the product and it&#x27;s perfectly light. Be sure to still use it full strength around eyes and mouth where wrinkles are more present.</li>
            <li> Used it for years and love this product!</li>
            <li> Visible Difference is the best cream in the world for my skin.  Every other product that I have tried leaves me with some sort of skin reaction.  I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> best product available</li>
            <li> turning back time....love it</li>
            <li> I am approaching my 80th year and I must admit that EA&#x27;s VISIBLE DIFFERENCE is one cream I cannot do without.  By applying it before and after you wash your face - it leaves your skin supple, moist and lovely to touch.  Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this cream.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really makes a difference on my dry skin and gets absorbed very quickly allowing the sunscreen to also penetrate the skin quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Great Product but Slowest shipping from this company ever.</li>
            <li> I like the cream.  But false advertising.  Just received one jar.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.  I&#x27;ve used Elizabeth Arden Visible difference for years- I know what it&#x27;s like and I love it-  but this product that I received is not the real stuff.  It has a different texture and scent, and smells bad.  Not to mention, just days after using it my face started breaking out really badly, which is not typical, and I don&#x27;t believe this to be a coincidence.  When I opened the product, the protective seal under the lid that is normally there was not there.  I thought it was strange, but still used the product.  Now my face is all broken out and itchy and uncomfortable, and who knows what this crap is that I&#x27;ve put on my face.  I will never order this product again and definitely do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great! Feels great!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with product, it was delivered before the date they guaranteed.  I love the moisturizer, very refreshing on my skin!</li>
