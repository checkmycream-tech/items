            <li>This little case is the perfect size for the  plates that I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Fit my Winstonia and Bundle Monster plates well</li>
            <li>Not too bulky but just right for holding as many as intended without being too smashed together.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>the plates stay in alright as best, it&#x27;s kinda hard to close</li>
            <li>all I have to do is full through one book to find what I want.</li>

            <li>Great little case to keep my plates in.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to much more expensive stamping plate holders.</li>

            <li>Thanks Again!</li>

            <li>I posted earlier and unfortunately reviewed PUeen plates, which are excellent.  </li>
            <li>u can put a little more then 25 plates in the case...</li>
            <li>These plates are a little bigger than the round ones but still fit quite nicely in this Pueen case.</li>
            <li>I love this whole concept from when I purchased my second set of Pueen plates, now I have a hot pink case for some of my other plates.</li>
            <li>I got the hot pink, and it is just as shown.</li>
            <li>So this little $5 case is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>They stay protected in the individual clear sleeves.</li>
            <li>The leather is soft and the plates don&#x27;t fall out if you drop the case (which I have done several times).  </li>
            <li>I really like this little leather case.</li>

            <li> Very nice.  Not too bulky but just right for holding as many as intended without being too smashed together.</li>
            <li> held plates as stated</li>
            <li> This little case is the perfect size for the  plates that I purchased.  I placed 30 plates and had some room left for some of my stickers.  The leather is soft and the plates don&#x27;t fall out if you drop the case (which I have done several times).  A great deal for 5 bucks.  Compact enough to carry around without adding bulk to my growing collection of nail art items. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this item I purchased would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Great little case to keep my plates in.</li>
            <li> This works great for holding all of my konads metal discs. keeps them very organized.</li>
            <li> Each \\&quot;page\\&quot; has dual pockets; one on the front and back. So you can put four plates into each \\&quot;page\\&quot; without fear of scratching them. Of course you won&#x27;t be able to view the two inside plates, but it will store them safely. Can hold 56 plates safely. 28 plates if you want to be able to view them all. Has two clasp positions for varied thickness. Nice little case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I recently purchased a hexagonal plate. These plates are a little bigger than the round ones but still fit quite nicely in this Pueen case. I have a large zippered case that holds 100 discs and it could not accomadate the hexagonal disc. So this little $5 case is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is very suitable for storing the metal nail image plates.  I am very satisfied.  It will serve my purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> Nail plates fit perfect .easy to flip and view designs. Smells a bit at first like plastic but no biggie. I recommend.</li>

            <li> I gave this plate case 5 stars its small...the color is nice...the plates fit perfectly..u can put a plate on each side..u can put a little more then 25 plates in the case...so I think its a great buy...worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Item as described and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Great quality - easy to get your plates into it, now I can find what I&#x27;m looking for.  You wouldn&#x27;t guess it was synthetic leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal - will be buying more I think!</li>

            <li> I saw these stamps kits on youtube and was very excited to get it in the mail. They suck. Bad. They dont work AT ALL. Dont buy it. The stamp doesnt absorb the polish and the plate cleaner isnt great either. Id return it for a refund if i could.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s an ok case, does the job. I&#x27;d give it 4 stars but i bought a nicer but similar one when i bought a set of stamping plates that came in a case. I thought it would be the same case and it wasn&#x27;t. This one is good too though.</li>
            <li> Perfect holder for extra nail stamp plates!</li>
            <li> I use this case for my Konad and MoYou plates, and they fit perfectly.  It&#x27;s nice to have a small case to keep the plates and scraper organized.</li>
            <li> Fit my Winstonia and Bundle Monster plates well</li>

            <li> I love them, they keep my stamping plates super organized and make it easy to look through when I&#x27;m choosing plates to use.</li>
            <li> This works well but I found buying a notebook binder and some baseball card plastic sheet he&#x27;s work so much better. I started out with just a few plates and ended up with a ton I had these little holders running out my ears now they are all in on binder and all I have to do is full through one book to find what I want.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to much more expensive stamping plate holders. This booklet held all of my stamping plates that I needed, and secures them well so they don&#x27;t fall out. The booklet itself is a small and very convenient size and perfect to store easily.</li>
            <li> I love this case. Even my SO pointed out it has TWO buttons to have the option of getting a bit thinker if you want to store on both sides of the sleeve. Which I DO! Such a cute color and logo on the front. Arrived very fast and in excellent shape.</li>
            <li> Rcvd 02/24/15 Lovely Seller, Wonderful Product, Superb Shipping! Thanks Again!</li>

            <li> I got the hot pink, and it is just as shown. It&#x27;s very small, and is great for holding all the nail stickers I have and the few small round plates that I have ... I really like this little leather case. it has 2 snaps, so as it gets fuller, it can be adjusted when closing it.</li>
            <li> I will order another case for more of the shape that you have on line thank u so much these are great to and easy to use and arived in great shape and well packed</li>
            <li> Does not work the art don&#x27;t come out at all</li>

            <li> This little case holds a lot of nail stamps.  I have had this for awhile now and it has held up nicely!  Great way to keep things organized.  I got the fuschia one and the color is exactly as it appears on screen.</li>
