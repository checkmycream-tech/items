            <li> It&#x27;s too early to give a negative or a positive report.</li>
            <li> My skin became dry, flaky, oily, and gross all at once.  </li>
            <li> Soft and supple from the previous nights moisturizing treatment.  </li>
            <li> Not moisturizing enough for someone with fairly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed that since I started using it, little tiny red blemishes are coming out especially around my mouth area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that dry itchy feeling that i use to get with my retine A cream</li>
            <li> Others who use different products with similar ingredients have told me that dead skin cells slough off every day.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have never had a negative reaction to any of the products.</li>
            <li> I am 53 and because of Vivite I only have a few wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> Did not have any reaction to other Vivite products, and would continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I now use Vivite Night Renewal every other evening .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strictly a night cream, and you need only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have used the night renewal 5 nights and the replenish hydrating cream the other 2 nights for 4 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I really only have experience with drug store products as opposed to any expensive or professional products.</li>
            <li> and I feel that my skin is smoother with less blemishes.  </li>
            <li> but then you put less amount on and you feel like nothing happens.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over 6 months</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested it when I was complaining of uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I could feel the layer of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using it again and within a week the small lines started going disappearing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this at least five years.</li>
            <li> I like this item, recommended by my dermatologist but less expensive here.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, so I tried something else after six months of using Vivite.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think this is about to be discontinued as well.</li>
            <li> I am in my forties and spend a lot of time doing outdoor activities, so I was getting desperate to find a moisturizer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I decided to go to the next level with the vivite..and I am really glad  I did.    This takes your old MD. forte to the next level. Worth the money but with all new regiments its a costly upstart...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product has been discontinued-it&#x27;s Fantastic!  What a shame.</li>
            <li> I have used Vivite products,but not the Night Renewal. I used it for 2 nights as directed and noticed a burning and redness .....stopped use...and returned.  Did not have any reaction to other Vivite products, and would continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I like this item, recommended by my dermatologist but less expensive here.  It arrived in record time.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Vivite night renewal facial cream is a wonderful product.  I used to purchase this cream from my doctor.  Now I purchase it from AMAZON.COM because you can purchase it much cheaper than from the dermatologist.  The product improves the texture and color of your skin.  You skin is silky smooth and it contains anti-oxidents to improve fine lines and wrinkles.  I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I began using this cream approx. 3 weeks ago and almost immedietly I could see more radience in my face . I apply in the evening after cleansing my face with my Clarisonic . The  first few days I could see some facial redness , but after about 1 week it stopped . I now use Vivite Night Renewal every other evening . I am 63 and I have been blessed with amazing skin my entire life because I have made it a priority to cleanse and moisture nightly NO MATTER WHAT and use sun screen daily . I will defenitely use ViVITE products again .</li>
            <li> This cream is a must for anyone over 50. It helps fade sun spots (really) and helps tone up the face. It&#x27;s strictly a night cream, and you need only a small amount. A jar should last almost 10 months unless you use it on your neck too. Do not use this on skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years since MD Forte is no longer available.  It works well for me and is almost as good as MD Forte.  Unfortunately I think this is about to be discontinued as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this night cream.  It is made by Allergan the people who make Botox.  It is an amazing exfoliant.  I love the fact that it contains only 4 all natural ingredients containing  20% glycolic acid, vitamin E, vitamin C &amp; Superoxide Dismutase (SOD, a very powerful antioxidant).  Try this cream and you&#x27;ll never use anythihng else for your night cream.  You&#x27;ll wake up in the morning with soft, exfoliated, radiant younger looking skin.  Thanks Allergan for making such a phenomenol night cream.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Vivite 2 years ago. I used it for a year and liked it but didn&#x27;t get more when it ran out.  The lines started showing up on my face.  I started using it again and within a week the small lines started going disappearing.  I will not stop using it again.  I am 53 and because of Vivite I only have a few wrinkle.  Also, my Lacome representative said that my skin looked so good that I don&#x27;t even need to use foundation.</li>
            <li> Product came packaged as Vivite night cream, but the cream inside was not Vivite and the inside seal for the jar was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact the seller and I did receive a full refund.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little over 6 months and it&#x27;s awesome I don&#x27;t get that dry itchy feeling that i use to get with my retine A cream.......My face is smooth and my fine lines seem to be not as noticable to me and to my friends !!  Try it you have nothing to lose but wrinkels !</li>
            <li> I used this product and it made my skin very itchy. It is definitely not for sensitive skin. I gave it a three stars for the price as at the dermatologists you get it for the double.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 7 months and I can see a big difference in my skin. I like the fact that when I go to wash my face in the am it stills feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CREAM.  My dermatologist suggested it when I was complaining of uneven skin tone.  She even stated, \\&quot;I&#x27;m selling you this at cost - I swear by it, not because I&#x27;m making a profit, but because I use it too\\&quot;.  It is a little expensive, so I tried something else after six months of using Vivite.  My skin became dry, flaky, oily, and gross all at once.  Some spots were blotchy, not just in color but texture too.  I could feel the layer of dead skin.  Nothing worked like Vivite, so I went back to using it and will never stop again.  I love the touch of my face - smooth, non-oily or dry.  I still have some brown spots, but for the most part they have diminished.  I imagine I will always have the darker spots, which are lighter now, but still there unless I opt for laser surgery.</li>
            <li> I have liked Vivite products and have used them for a year and a half. I have sensitive skin and have never had a negative reaction to any of the products. I use the night cream and the eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vivite products for over a year now, and I am very pleased with the results of the product line.  Vivite Night Renewal Facial Cream is a great moisturizer for dry and maturing skin. I love the way my skin feels the next morning after I cleanse it.  Soft and supple from the previous nights moisturizing treatment.  I highly recommend this product - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really only have experience with drug store products as opposed to any expensive or professional products. I have used the night renewal 5 nights and the replenish hydrating cream the other 2 nights for 4 weeks now. I also use the Vivite daily moisturizer with SPF. I love it all so far and cannot stop touching my face! It feels like I&#x27;ve gotten a facial. I have had to exfoliate every morning so far which I use a gentle gel-based one from Ice Elements. My skin is hydrated, not dry at all and it does seem more even toned although of course I still have some brown spots from the sun. I am 42 and will keep using the Vivite line and may try more like something for eye area and decolletage. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I just love this night cream; you will not find a better one out there for the price.  Try it; you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Wash your face with your fash wash, i used cerbe, make sure you apply vivite every night before bed. You&#x27;ll see the difference in two weeks!!</li>
            <li> Purchased on Amazon for much cheaper than spa prices.  A little of this product goes a long way.  It stings a little when you first put it on.  I use this with the daily moisturizer and I feel that my skin is smoother with less blemishes.  I am very happy with this product.  Non-scented and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this through my cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office but they switched to a different line.  I then went online to find the product through another source b/c I wanted to keep using it.  You feel the glycolic acid which is important to me.  I like the consistency of the cream and felt I got good results with consistent use.</li>
            <li> Love this even for sensitive skin-hope it&#x27;s not discontinued...</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist several years ago.  I use it faithfully and feel my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I just got this cream about three days ago. It&#x27;s too early to give a negative or a positive report. However, I&#x27;ve noticed that since I started using it, little tiny red blemishes are coming out especially around my mouth area. I will wait it out and see and come back to update this review.</li>
            <li> this cream is great!!!  leaves my face feeling smooth and no perfume order!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried about a million moisturizers from the $5 drugstore brands all the way up to the $300.00 LaMere. I am in my forties and spend a lot of time doing outdoor activities, so I was getting desperate to find a moisturizer. None could hydrate without causing significant breakouts.  I have used this line of products consistently, for over a month. I am thrilled to report that my this line works! My skin is soft and breakout-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the sunscreen under my makeup, daily. It leaves a beautiful, soft texture and I have yet to burn despite spring skiing, long afternoons of running, even hours on the beach.</li>
            <li> Turns my nose red. Used product for years was wonderful but this time harmful</li>
            <li> I only used for a week, did nothing for my face. If you put too much on it balls up (like when elmers glue dries on ur hand and you rub them together and balls up and falls off) but then you put less amount on and you feel like nothing happens. No i never got tingling, no redness, no peeling, no results...i quit will not buy again</li>
            <li> Great product-highly recommended by several friends and did not disappoint.  Skin very soft and supple and I am 54.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.  It is something my dermatologist sells but is much more cost effective with you&lt;br /&gt;I will order more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this at least five years. I try other products, too, but never stop using this potent night cream.</li>
            <li> I did not like this cream at all. Not moisturizing enough for someone with fairly dry skin.  l. I returned the product and got a full refund.</li>
            <li> You can tell a difference in your skin the first time you use it. A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using product for about a month, but I don&#x27;t see any positive results.  Others who use different products with similar ingredients have told me that dead skin cells slough off every day.  I never see this, but it is what I was hoping for.</li>
