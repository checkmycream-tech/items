            <li>the little kiosk in the mall shut down ,so I was very happy when I was shoppin on amamzon one day and came across it , just when I was almost out thanks a lot</li>

            <li>I paid way too much for the product.</li>
            <li>However, having ordered this twice with the same result, it has been an uplifting experience and far more convenient for me.  </li>
            <li>Still decent coverage</li>
            <li>Its so much cheaper than buying directly from Bella Terra!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was a little nervous ordering this product on line but, it was exactly what I had purchased in the store and I saved money through Amazon.  This product makes make up a breeze.  I do not wear a lot of make up and like a light look.  This product is perfect because I am able to easily apply the amount I want for different occasions.</li>
            <li> Works great! A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I sometimes hesitate to buy cosmetics online, wondering if I will get the &amp;#34;actual&amp;#34; brand I am looking for. I am very pleased with my purchase here. Exactly what I wanted, fast shipping. Will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Its so much cheaper than buying directly from Bella Terra! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and will use them again!</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands still prefer this one. Much easier to order than going through mall looking for kiosk.</li>
            <li> Love this. Goes on easily and feels so light. Since I started using this, I will never go back to liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> This is overall the best makeup that I have ever used due to my nature of liking a natural looking make up. I hardly ever break out using this make up on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This is great mineral make-up.  Covers and no heavy made up look. I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I was fairly pleased with the product, I thought it worked fine. However, I do not believe this product is authentic to Terra Bella Cosmetics. I tried the real thing in the mall &amp; I know for a fact it worked wonders. This mineral foundation will not change your life, in my opinion. I paid way too much for the product. I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> After you try this mineral foundation you will never go back to liquid.  Use the primer and then dust with this and you are good to go all day.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the same product I purchased at the mall under the same name.  The color seemed to be darker and more yellow than my skin tone even though it matched me perfectly at the mall.  Still decent coverage though with good blending.  Just make sure your get the right shade.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED FROM THIS COMPANY 3 TIMES!!! I HAVE OILY/ COMBINATION/ SENSITIVE SKIN. I AM WHITE. I CAN SLEEP IN THIS STUFF AND I WILL NOT BREAK OUT HEAVILY UNLIKE OTHER FOUNDATIONS AND LOOSE POWDER. IT IS LIGHT WITH AMAZING COVERAGE. IT GIVES YOUR SKIN A GLOW UNLIKE OTHER POWDERS THAT MAKE YOUR FACE LOOK CAKEY. I ORDERED THE LATTE AND IT IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN/  YELLOW  (NOT ORANGE) GLOW. IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL HEAVY OF THE &amp;#34;MAKEUP SMELL&amp;#34;.  IT IS AMAZING FOR THE PRICE AND LASTS ME 3 MONTHS WITH  USING IT EVERYDAY. IT DOES NOT CRACK AROUND YOUR SMILE. IT LETS YOUR SKIN BREATHE. THIS IS A BARGAIN PRICE!!!! YOU WILL GET HOOKED. I AM 19.&lt;br /&gt;P.S  ITS THE PERFECT COLOR FOR ALL LIP COLORS&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NOT TOO WHITE AND GHOSTLY BUT NOT TOO DARK WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN OUT IN THE SUN FOR DAYS</li>
            <li> I tried this at the mall, instead I bought it online here for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks smooth, never oily, and I don&#x27;t break out with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this forever!</li>
            <li> Love the product - better than Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> i found this product in the mall fell in love with it and had to buy on line now the little kiosk in the mall shut down ,so I was very happy when I was shoppin on amamzon one day and came across it , just when I was almost out thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Good coverage,go smooth over your skin, seamless,sun protection.I have melasma and this product make my skin looks healthy and beautiful ! I will recommend to my friends. The price online is better than in kiosk.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. Feels like nothing on my face. I can apply light to heavy depending on where I am going... I totally recommend Bella Terra Mineral Foundation...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love the way the foundation is so light that it hardly feels I have makeup on at all.  Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  I live far away from the kiosk in the mall and I did not know if I would get the same quality and result (as I was told).  However, having ordered this twice with the same result, it has been an uplifting experience and far more convenient for me.  The service is great and the turn-around time was less than anticipated,  What more can you ask for anyway?</li>
