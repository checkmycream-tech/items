            <li>But the product works, which is rare nowadays.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera is a good moisturizing treatment for extremely dry/damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to make my hair a little more silky, but it was okay.</li>
            <li>They respond right away which I appreciated very much!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>It leave my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily/, and I have not been able to find it recently in any of Las Vegas&#x27; beauty supply stores.  </li>
            <li>My hair is manageable and soft and the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten it at a deal of a price without having to drive to another state is fabulous.</li>
            <li>There are many different types.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this cholesterol, I used it straight from the container after shampooing and conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair and used a plastic cap and set her under a portable dryer for about 30 minutes and it detangled her hair better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It detangles my hair very well</li>
            <li>not as detangling as other conditioners I use, I&#x27;m used to more slip from HE Hello Hydration conditioner.  </li>
            <li>i will work with it adding more aloe gel and other oils.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny spent, I had severly dry damaged hair from chemical usage, This product has rescued my hair making it nice and shiny, and very soft.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this particular lustrasilk product for months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many deep conditioners, but this is the only one that made my hair feel like I got it done at the salon.</li>
            <li>I normally put this on with an oil (jojoba, avocado, wheat germ etc.)</li>
            <li>Lustrasilk Aloe Vera Cholesterol Super Detangling Formula Damaged hair for Extreme works fantastic on dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>, it make it a better treatment for extreme dry, brittle, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair probably 3c or 4a.</li>
            <li>my complete review, go here:</li>
            <li>my hair is finally beginning to feel like real hair not a barbie dolls hair.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m natural) shampoo, lustrasilk, then condition.</li>
            <li>hair came out soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with a few of my favorite oils and paced it in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for more than 15 years to detangled and moisturize my waist length thick tresses.</li>
            <li>I used this in the past and it was my favorite deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product is good, however, I had to return it because it came half inside the bottle and the other half all over the box.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended in the book on African American hair  [...].</li>
            <li>I get the same results from this treatment as if I had it done professionally at a hair salon.</li>
            <li>Usually I have a little bit more breakage when detangling</li>

            <li> For people with kinky, curly or excessively dry hair, you will want to include this product into your conditioning repertoire.</li>

            <li> I have a hard time finding this product nowadays, which I use on my thick, natural coarse, kinky-coily hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the messy side.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I was really looking forward to use this product.</li>
            <li> Prior to use my hair was terrible and after just 1 use of this product, I can&#x27;t tell my hair was damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was too large&lt;br /&gt;Packed very poorly.</li>
            <li> i got desperate</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent quality, great price, speedy shipping and works well.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful conditioner for dry hair; i love the quality and the way it leaves my hair; even add a little and comb through before fixing it. Great bargain</li>
            <li> I seen this product on a blog and decided to try it. It works wonders on my hair and is a great tool for detangling my natural hair. I even leave it in as a leave in product for my sons hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for more than 15 years to detangled and moisturize my waist length thick tresses. It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser told me to buy this stuff and use it before she hi-&lt;br /&gt;lites my hair. I love it. she told me to put it on dry hair and cover&lt;br /&gt;it with saran wrap and leave on for an hour. good stuff.</li>
            <li> It provide great slip for detangling hair. It leave my hair soft and smooth. The conditioner is sort of souply like,  and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before as a deep conditioner so I was really excited to see that it came in a VERY HUGE container.  This will last months if not over a year.  For people with kinky, curly or excessively dry hair, you will want to include this product into your conditioning repertoire.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing it does what it&#x27;s suppose too.  Also, it smells really good- I normally put this on with an oil (jojoba, avocado, wheat germ etc.) then I put shower cap on go under dryer and then leave it on over night.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny spent, I had severly dry damaged hair from chemical usage, This product has rescued my hair making it nice and shiny, and very soft. Prior to use my hair was terrible and after just 1 use of this product, I can&#x27;t tell my hair was damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definately going to buy this product again, it&#x27;s worth every penny paid to have beautiful hair again.</li>
            <li> This product is good, however, I had to return it because it came half inside the bottle and the other half all over the box. I guess they did not close the bottle properly and it spilled everywhere. Too bad because I was really looking forward to use this product. The price was great! Excellent customer service though. They respond right away which I appreciated very much! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair probably 3c or 4a. This had some really great reviews but did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> Ive tried several different types, but this one seems to work well compared to the others Ive tried!! Fist time in months, that I have been almost tangle free.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything and seemed to leave my hair dryer than it was .. This was after using about a 1/3 of the tub... I thought perhaps it needed more time or applications... nope.. nothing...</li>
            <li> The Lustrasilk cholesterol has a light, mild fragrance that is very pleasant. I always deep condition under a hooded dryer for 20-30 minutes with a processing cap. The first time I used this cholesterol, I used it straight from the container after shampooing and conditioning my hair. It isn&#x27;t as thick as other cholesterols I&#x27;ve used, yet it still managed to really moisturize my coils. It softened my multi-textured tresses and left it extremely detangled. My hair was tangle-free from root-to-tip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my complete review, go here: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/lustrasilk-aloe-vera-cholesterol-super-detangling-formula-for-extremely-damaged-hair/</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera is a good moisturizing treatment for extremely dry/damaged hair. I used this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair and used a plastic cap and set her under a portable dryer for about 30 minutes and it detangled her hair better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!!!! I would like to purchase more of this product!! when would be available again??</li>
            <li> i hesitated to buy bc it was cheap. n i read reviews that it was a good product but i wasnt sold.. i got desperate bc my hair wasnt getting any better after bleaching like 3 times n frying my hair. i bought this a couple of weeks ago used it twice. washed my hair left it in for 10 mins rinsed n did it again. after the first use my hair felt ok. the second wash a couple of days later my hair has life again! my hair is finally beginning to feel like real hair not a barbie dolls hair. must buy its a steal for this price its huge!! comes with so much conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily/, and I have not been able to find it recently in any of Las Vegas&#x27; beauty supply stores.  I was so disappointed, because I have been using this product for years.  Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on here in such a large size!</li>
            <li> I did not use the product because it was received opened and spilled out in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid was off the jar.&lt;br /&gt;The box was too large&lt;br /&gt;Packed very poorly.</li>
            <li> This was good! I wanted it to make my hair a little more silky, but it was okay. I could have used something better! Smell was good.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past and it was my favorite deep conditioner. Now when I use it I add oils to it and it works okay on my hair. It detangles my hair very well but it is not moisturizing enough. Unfortunately I will not repurchase again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the jar to be so huge. It&#x27;s enough to last 6 months to a year. I definitely can tell that my hair felt stronger after doing one treatment. Usually I have a little bit more breakage when detangling but it seems to make the strands more resilient. I like it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this particular lustrasilk product for months. I would buy the 20oz jar and life was great. Unfortunately the stores in where I live stopped carrying it ( not in enough demand, so I can&#x27;t blame them). But the product works, which is rare nowadays. I wash my hair (I&#x27;m natural) shampoo, lustrasilk, then condition. My hair is manageable and soft and the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten it at a deal of a price without having to drive to another state is fabulous. Definitely would recommend to everyone. However, I would also recommend that you follow the instructions. They&#x27;re there for a reason, ya know. The more you use it the happier your hair will be.</li>
            <li> I like it, not as great as I thought it was going to be, but works ok. It&#x27;s a little on the messy side.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this product nowadays, which I use on my thick, natural coarse, kinky-coily hair. It works beautifully. Highly recommended in the book on African American hair  [...]. Glad this merchant carries this product because it&#x27;s becoming scarce to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many deep conditioners, but this is the only one that made my hair feel like I got it done at the salon. Not to mention the value.</li>
            <li> Great value. I will order again. Every person has his or her hair type. You have to make the best choice for you.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ve only used it once. not as detangling as other conditioners I use, I&#x27;m used to more slip from HE Hello Hydration conditioner.  i will work with it adding more aloe gel and other oils.</li>
            <li> Lustrasilk Aloe Vera Cholesterol Super Detangling Formula Damaged hair for Extreme works fantastic on dry damaged hair. I tried Lustrasilk Cholesterol before. There are many different types. This one is my favorite so far. It does not have the thickness that I&#x27;m used to when I use Queen Helene, but it works. I mixed it with a few of my favorite oils and paced it in my hair. I use saran wrap to seal in the heat. I then placed a plastic cap on my head. Sit under the dryer for 30-45 min, or use a heating cap. The results are unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair came out soft and silky. It was totally  moisturized. If you have severe dry,damaged,breaking hair, this is the product for you. This product can also be used as an overnight treatment. just wrap your hair in saran wrap and a plastic cap use the dryer or heating cap for 30-45 min. Don&#x27;t take off the saran wrap or the cap. wrap your head up in a scoft. place a towel to cover your pillow. rinse out the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results will be so fantastic. I get the same results from this treatment as if I had it done professionally at a hair salon. I purchased the 5lb container because its the best value. Lustrasilk Aloe Vera Cholesterol works like magic on damaged hair. It works even better if you mix it with aloe vera oil and jojoba oil and use it as an overnight treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with the oils, not only does it stretch the cholesterol, it make it a better treatment for extreme dry, brittle, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I got just what I ordered. This product was discussed, but I found it on amazon! It was exactly what I wanted! The product came on time and everything.</li>
