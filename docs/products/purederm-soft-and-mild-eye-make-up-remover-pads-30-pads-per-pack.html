            <li>Great for traveling!</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful!</li>

            <li>I am VERY pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>

            <li>Will be ordering lots more of these!!</li>
            <li>This works perfect and removes most all traces.  </li>
            <li>All in all, the pads were easy to use and the perfect size for bringing with me when i&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to go out and buy more cotton pads!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay with it, but I wish it did!</li>
            <li>She doesnt wear a lot to begin with (which is nice in my opinion) but this helps get everything off.</li>
            <li>I liked this makeup remover since it&#x27;s oil-free and didn&#x27;t require me to wash my face after I used it like my oil based ones do.</li>
            <li>This is a 100% honest review and I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>But well enough and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>Most removers I&#x27;ve used burn even just being close to the eye area.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it comes with 30 wipes rather than just 10 or 15.</li>
            <li>I let the towelettes soak my makeup for about 5 seconds and most of the make up will come off with one wipe.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these, so great at taking off even my toughest mascara but gentle on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for travel though because it&#x27;s in such convenient packaging.</li>
            <li>I need a pretty good makeup remover to get it all off.  </li>
            <li>they clean but they are SO saturated!</li>
            <li>I was really impressed by how this effectively removes my everyday eye makeup (including waterproof makeup)!</li>
            <li>Easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I use waterproof eye makeup that doesn&#x27;t come off easily.  </li>
            <li>I love having them on hand at such a great price point.  </li>
            <li>Super convenient though!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell like pure chemicals which is nice.</li>
            <li>, I got a free sample pack.</li>
            <li>Then I repeat for a quick gentle wipe to make sure everything comes off.</li>
            <li>I am able to get more makeup out with this than my regular eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the pads are fully saturated with the product, but the pad is super flimsy.</li>
            <li>This removes everything super well except for my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Other than that flaw, the product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more!</li>
            <li>I do have extremely sensitive skin and most would not have this reaction</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good one, but maybe they&#x27;ll come out with a remover in the future that also removes waterproof makeup :)</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It clean my  maskara and the eyeshadow very well</li>
            <li>Plus it is super gentle on the eyes.</li>
            <li>These are very gentle.</li>
            <li>First off, they do not sting your eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only thing is, make sure you don&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different makeup removers (Pond&#x27;s, Neutrogena,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first to not sting my eye area.</li>
            <li>These eye makeup remover pads work very well.</li>
            <li>but whatever, the make up remover works really well.</li>
            <li>I wear eye liner, multiple coats of mascara, and fill in my brows, and these clean off my eyes fully.</li>
            <li>I usually use cotton pads dabbed in jojoba oil to remove eye makeup, but these are perfect for travel and for when I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find effective eye make up removing pads that don&#x27;t burn your eyes when you use them.</li>
            <li>They are really moist and the package stays closed better than some others I&#x27;ve had in similar packaging.  </li>
            <li>The product is a really great eye make up remover, however the pads that are used are very thin.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot so far!</li>
            <li>I was wiping the very edges of my eyes (not very carefully</li>
            <li>I would suggest making a larger square wipe for removing makeup from my whole</li>
            <li>Maybe just a little bit less effective than the liquid version.</li>
            <li>The pads are soft enough for me to rub pretty hard without feeling like I have a rug burn on my eyeballs after.</li>

            <li> Works well. Easy to carry. Maybe just a little bit less effective than the liquid version. But well enough and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> they clean but they are SO saturated! I have to wring it out before I can use it and it does sting my eyes!!</li>
            <li> work well but slightly irritating to eyes - I do have extremely sensitive skin and most would not have this reaction</li>
            <li> These eye makeup remover pads work very well. I was highly impressed. First off, they do not sting your eyes. Second, they get all the makeup out, including the heavy liquid eyeliner and the mascara. It works great. I am able to get more makeup out with this than my regular eye make up remover. These are great when you are traveling because you don&#x27;t have to pack any liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, make sure you don&#x27;t use it on your face. It will made me break out when i dabbed it on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I use waterproof eye makeup that doesn&#x27;t come off easily.  I need a pretty good makeup remover to get it all off.  This works perfect and removes most all traces.  I didn&#x27;t have any bad reactions or anything.  They are really moist and the package stays closed better than some others I&#x27;ve had in similar packaging.  I like it a lot so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find effective eye make up removing pads that don&#x27;t burn your eyes when you use them. But these are great! I was wiping the very edges of my eyes (not very carefully, I might add) and there was no sting. Most removers I&#x27;ve used burn even just being close to the eye area. It also doesn&#x27;t smell like pure chemicals which is nice. I also love the fact that it comes with 30 wipes rather than just 10 or 15. Definitely will buy more!</li>
            <li> It clean my  maskara and the eyeshadow very well</li>
            <li> I ran out of my oil based eye makeup remover and decided to give this a go. I was really impressed by how this effectively removes my everyday eye makeup (including waterproof makeup)! Plus it is super gentle on the eyes. I think I might switch over from oil based eye makeup remover to these because they don&#x27;t leave an oily residue and I don&#x27;t have to go out and buy more cotton pads!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have extermely sensivive eyes and I&#x27;m a 24/7 contact wearer. My doctor just got me new night and day contacts because my allergies and very bad dry eyes couldn&#x27;t handle anything else. Usually, I have to take my contacts out before I can take off my eye makeup or else my eyes swell and itch forever.. These are very gentle. If I scrub really hard, they sting just a tiny bit but not enough to make my eyes red or anything. Will be ordering lots more of these!! Also does a good job at getting rid of waterproof makeup!</li>
            <li> These work even on triple-coat waterproof mascara, without stinging. The pads are soft enough for me to rub pretty hard without feeling like I have a rug burn on my eyeballs after. I usually use cotton pads dabbed in jojoba oil to remove eye makeup, but these are perfect for travel and for when I&#x27;m lazy. No complaints, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I usually use eye make up removers that come in bottles, but decided to give this a try. It definitely does the job when it comes to removing all of the make up, but the MAC eyeliner I use is pretty hard to take off so a little bit of scrubbing was involved. All in all, the pads were easy to use and the perfect size for bringing with me when i&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> The product is a really great eye make up remover, however the pads that are used are very thin. I like the fact that the pads are fully saturated with the product, but the pad is super flimsy. I would have preferred the pads were thicker but whatever, the make up remover works really well.</li>
            <li> I use all waterproof eye makeup and these have no problems removing everything. I let the towelettes soak my makeup for about 5 seconds and most of the make up will come off with one wipe. Then I repeat for a quick gentle wipe to make sure everything comes off. Great for traveling!</li>
            <li> They work like a charm! Although wiping my eyeliner off, the stickiness is still left from the pads, I wash it off with water. Other than that flaw, the product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these, so great at taking off even my toughest mascara but gentle on my eyes.  They don&#x27;t sting like similar products I have tried.  I also wear a lot of those 24 hour lipsticks, and these wipes take it off effortlessly.  I love having them on hand at such a great price point.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Bought for the GF and she loves the makeup remover. She doesnt wear a lot to begin with (which is nice in my opinion) but this helps get everything off. She says she&#x27;ll def get it again</li>
            <li> Works pretty well,  but not great. Super convenient though!</li>
            <li> I liked this makeup remover since it&#x27;s oil-free and didn&#x27;t require me to wash my face after I used it like my oil based ones do. This removes everything super well except for my waterproof mascara. It doesn&#x27;t claim to wash off waterproof makeup so I&#x27;m okay with it, but I wish it did! It&#x27;s perfect for travel though because it&#x27;s in such convenient packaging. Overall it&#x27;s a good one, but maybe they&#x27;ll come out with a remover in the future that also removes waterproof makeup :)</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with this product! I have tried many different makeup removers (Pond&#x27;s, Neutrogena, Say Yes, Aveeno) and this is my favorite so far. It&#x27;s the first to not sting my eye area. I am a contact lens wearer and I don&#x27;t feel the slightest pain even with my contacts still in. Like another reviewer mentioned, the pads are a bit thin which makes it a little harder to grip and wipe with, but one pad does the job for both eyes. I wear eye liner, multiple coats of mascara, and fill in my brows, and these clean off my eyes fully. Absolutely wonderful! I would suggest making a larger square wipe for removing makeup from my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer, I got a free sample pack. This is a 100% honest review and I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
