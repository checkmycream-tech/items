            <li>The foaming cleanser dried out my skin, the milk cleanser made me break out everywhere, and the toner burned my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;The whole set was delivered in perfect condition by the seller, but my super sensitive skin cant handle the Vivo Per Lei skincare line.</li>

            <li>I have just started using this product but so far I am really liking it.  </li>
            <li>Used to pay a lot to use Orogold, which has a similar product, paid way too much for it</li>
            <li>It works really well without having that dry feeling after you wash your face.  </li>

            <li> excellent product. I love the foaming cleanser doesn&#x27;t over dry. The cleansing milk is great for removing eye makeup. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I bought Vivo peels and was very happy about it but when I received this set, I was Dissatisfied. The quality of bottles are horrible. Pumps are not working properly, the product itself does not make any difference than applying water...</li>
            <li> Very gentle cleanser and toner - I love that I can use the facial wash at night to remove makeup and the milk wash in the morning when I&#x27;m looking for a more gentle cleanser.  Used to pay a lot to use Orogold, which has a similar product, paid way too much for it and this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great price and it works!!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product but so far I am really liking it.  The packaging is a bit inconvenient.  It takes alot of pumps to get needed amount.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. The cleanser really didn&#x27;t foam. I liked the milk cleanser better.</li>
            <li> I love Vivo Per Lei and I keep reordering. The shipment came quickly and without incident.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash set. Only thing I have found since I started getting bad skin as a kid that will clean and clear up my face and body</li>
            <li> I tried all 3 of these because a friend told me how amazing they were, but it ruined my face. The foaming cleanser dried out my skin, the milk cleanser made me break out everywhere, and the toner burned my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;The whole set was delivered in perfect condition by the seller, but my super sensitive skin cant handle the Vivo Per Lei skincare line.</li>
            <li> an OK facial products for the price.</li>
            <li> It works really well without having that dry feeling after you wash your face.  I would certainly buy this again as it makes your skin feel clean, smooth and refreshed.  Great price compared to other products that do not even come close to the results.</li>
            <li> Very good product, and you cant beat the price.  At the local mall it cost me 80.00 for one bottle of cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am using the milk cleanser as it is winter time and I am pleased with the light fragrance, and cleansing.  I have tried the toner, but didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  I will use the foaming cleanser in the summer time.  Over all I like these products!</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptic about purchasing my favorite facial products on amazon because the prize was so low comaparing to what I pay for it at the mall but I was very pleased. Everything was packaged the way it should be and it was NOT  a knock off - it&#x27;s the real dealtake it from someone whose paid full prize.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. I personally didn&#x27;t see any difference in my face when using this product. I felt like it was more effort to clean my face with the same results  that Ive always had with other face washes.</li>
            <li> love love love this product</li>
