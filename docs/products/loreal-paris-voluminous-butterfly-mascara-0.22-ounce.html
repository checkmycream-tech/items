            <li>I absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use anything else since this came out!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Nice, sexy fluttery - lashes that don&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li>once its on its beyond amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to say it&#x27;s the mascara.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m loving this mascara.</li>
            <li>going on really gets in between the lashes, plumps and lengthens, aaannddd the best part</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s warm out.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is really nice, and closes</li>
            <li>The best thing about this mascara is you don&#x27;t have to use as much</li>
            <li>Loving the volume that I get when using this mascara...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Volumnious Butterfly Mascara comes with a nice plastic applicator.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice mascara that I&#x27;d use again.</li>
            <li>I am VERY picky about mascara and this one is PERFECT!</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>beautiful product and came quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for truly beautiful eyelashes!</li>
            <li>is the price RIGHT, or what?!?!?!</li>
            <li>i liked the million lashes one better</li>
            <li>The brush is so perfect for creating a natural looking eye-widening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly Mascara is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The larger comb-like side of it perfectly wings out the outer lashes, making my eyes look amazing.</li>
            <li>lashes look so full and beautiful, goes on smoothly and stays on until you take it off.</li>
            <li>Makes your whole look come together beautifully.</li>
            <li>The mascara looks great when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Perfect, fantastic, I finally found a good mascara.</li>
            <li>Terrific mascara, the applicator brush is excellent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras over my 65 years, and none have caused me to fall so dramatically in love with a product as this one did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, and they all flake, regardless of their &amp;#34;no flake&amp;#34; claims.</li>
            <li>(I think there is magic in this tube.)</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>It was such a great price!</li>
            <li>I feel like I have more control with this wand.</li>
            <li>The brush is okay</li>
            <li>worked in cosmetics retail for most of my life n</li>
            <li>most make up artist</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara for length and volume</li>
            <li>Love, love love</li>
            <li>I simply love this product.  </li>
            <li>Have told so many people already.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s available on Subscribe &amp; Save, too!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love the brush.</li>
            <li>The side with the longer bristles is perfect for lengthening and the shorter bristles get the tiny lashes without smearing mascara everywhere.</li>
            <li>I found it okay</li>
            <li>and I love this.</li>
            <li>that I love to do.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, and for this price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>The packaging of the product makes it look appealing to me.</li>
            <li>The results were okay, my lashes straightened out after a while and it kinda smudges on my lower lash line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just mentioning these two things because I almost didn&#x27;t buy it after reading those comments, but I am so glad that I went ahead and bought it</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mascara for many decades.</li>
            <li>However, with time I started to get a lot of flaking and it started to clump more.</li>
            <li>My shorter more sparse lashes looked tarantula like.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the mascara, you might consider saving the wand to use with a mascara you like better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve already stocked up on more of this.</li>
            <li>This one seems better than most.</li>
            <li>its cheap!</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s great to know I can get it from Amazon and not pay as much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies for awhile now and while it does work well, I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I found that one coat was sufficient for volume and length appropriate for work.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Lengths Mascara is now my all-time favorite.  </li>
            <li>By lunch time it&#x27;s mostly gone.</li>
            <li>This one is all I need. :)</li>
            <li>and i am just in love with it.</li>
            <li>But, I love L&#x27;Oreal mascaras.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But mostly ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and get tons of compliments.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic mascara!</li>
            <li>The brush is magic and the mascara is not cakey or goopy at all...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job for a senior.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a pretty darn good mascara, and much more affordable than Diorshow.</li>
            <li>It makes your eyelashes long and best part no clumping!</li>
            <li>The wand is a perfect shape for creating long looking lashes.</li>
            <li>Pretty good mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my lashes look, not clumpy at all and its easy to take it off at night.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive eyes and skin, and experienced no burning or stinging with this product.  </li>
            <li>deff separeates and very full lashes</li>
            <li>strength lies in its special wand, which is perfectly shaped to the human eye.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal shows why they&#x27;re a top beauty brand with this fabulous mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ask me if my lashes were real and how gorgeous they looked.</li>
            <li>When I saw the wand on this mascara, I thought it was unique and innovative.  </li>
            <li>The wand of this mascara is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t notice any changes in thickens and length of my lashes, can be cleaned easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to remove at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy removal.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes double in sizes :) I am happy.</li>
            <li>Didn know my natural eyelashes could look that good :)</li>
            <li>It has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>gives me super long eyelashes that are perfectly spaced out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as Maybelline New York XXL</li>
            <li>I could not find this product in my usual store, so I am very happy that I was able to order this online.</li>
            <li>The formula is wetter than I&#x27;d like but it does apply fine.</li>
            <li>the super shock from Avon does a better job</li>
            <li>The brush is perfect, and I can even put a little on my bottom lashes and it still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;oreal mascaras.</li>
            <li>My eyes were bright red and everyone kept asking if I was okay.  </li>
            <li>The wand is amazing because it really does make my lashes look fuller and it targets the hard-to-reach lashes in the corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Great for short sparse lashes.</li>
            <li>The wand is great, definitely fans out your lashes.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, does not clump, and seems true to it&#x27;s color.  </li>
            <li>I really really like this mascara, longer eyelashes, and very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&gt;Deep, rich color&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is now my favorite mascara possibly in large part because the wand is so unique - it has an asymmetrical shape sort of like a wing.</li>
            <li>so I love the fact that this mascara is super easy to apply in the very few seconds I have to apply it LOL.</li>
            <li>No clumps, no fragrance, cool brush.</li>
            <li>I find the formula very close to Lancome&#x27;s Hypnose Drama, but the wand on this mascara is way more preferable.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this mascara goes on and the way the brush works - it&#x27;s all quite lovely.</li>
            <li>It also lengthens my lashes substantially and separates them so they look full and lucious.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the Chanel mascara that I was buying &amp; so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It took a long time for me to find one I liked better than Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stiletto, but this is it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mascara - it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and looks great - for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it won&#x27;t dry out, unlike many popular mascaras that don&#x27;t close</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, and stays put.</li>
            <li>The tiny brush-like side is perfect for the tiny lower lashes, and there is no mascara ending up anywhere</li>
            <li>I disagree and won&#x27;t be buying this again, but glad I was able to try it out for a low price.</li>
            <li>Getting older, my eyelashes are thinner and more sparse.</li>
            <li>What I love the most about this mascara is that the wand allows me to get the outer corner lashes at the same time I get the rest.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>it really does make them look bigger and better, and keeps them separated nicely....</li>
            <li>It is fast becoming my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara in the world.</li>
            <li>, you might find that this is your new favorite.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this new Butterfly mascara, though, since it was reviewed in a recent issue of _Lucky_ magazine as a great drugstore mascara.  </li>
            <li>I do get is a great black mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved this product when I first starting wearing it.</li>
            <li>I used to always try different brands and couldn&#x27;t ever find a mascara that offered both a formula AND a wand that I liked, but I&#x27;ve been consistently using Voluminous Butterfly for over a year!  </li>
            <li>You start by catching the lashes on the tiny brush side and them rotate it up, wiggle and done.</li>
            <li>I would have to say this one has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but I rarely have that problem</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and figured it was worth a shot</li>
            <li>This mascara is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes look more natural.  </li>
            <li>it is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a traditional brush kind of gal.</li>
            <li>Pretty darn good mascara - Rich and dark, thickening, and super-lengthening.  </li>
            <li>The Butterfly Brush is completely different from any other mascara that I have tried, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all in my ever growing search to find that perfect</li>
            <li>The part that really grabbed my attention and drew my interest was the unique shape of the mascara wand.</li>
            <li>I am right handed and have no problem applying to my right eye.  </li>
            <li>so i stick with my right.</li>
            <li>I have been trying numerous new mascara products on the market, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers what it promised.</li>
            <li>Used to use the old Voluminous and liked it a lot but wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend even noticed there was a difference (and, let&#x27;s face it, guys don&#x27;t usually notice) and remarked on how great my lashes looked.</li>
            <li>This mascara is suitable for short-term use only.</li>
            <li>I really liked the brush, but it became very flaky after several hours.  </li>
            <li>I have tried expensive mascara, and inexpensive mascara, and have never truly been that happy with most of them.</li>
            <li>This brush works great for getting to the inner and outside corners of your lashes.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t generally mess with more than one good solid coat.</li>
            <li>My first purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>but I dont think it does any more than a regular one.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I used to use L&#x27;oreal exclusively but went to higher priced brands over the years</li>
            <li>I had tried the Miss Manga hoping for something wonderful but was not impressed.  </li>
            <li>It really makes them POP!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll do a YouTube video if anyone&#x27;s interested.</li>
            <li>I know most people think all mascaras are the same,  but!  </li>
            <li>, I really wanted to like it though!</li>
            <li>The corners especially looked more fanned out.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive.</li>
            <li>My sister recommended it to me; bought the first time from Ulta.  </li>
            <li>It not only holds my curl but also makes my lashes appear longer and more volumized.</li>
            <li>I buy a different kind of mascara every time I need a new one just so I can try all of them out.</li>
            <li>like Benifit&#x27;s Their Real and Too Faced Size Queen 1 of Dior&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m always on the look out for the next best thing usually</li>
            <li>teen daughter says its great for those corner lashes and goes on very well does not leave clumps,makes her lashes look really long</li>
            <li>And only a couple I really make it 2 the top of my list.  </li>
            <li>and this pretty much gets the job done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first mascara that I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my contact lenses, I can get in to the outer edge of my eyelashes and really bring them out without a lot of clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I really wanted to dislike it.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara except that it does not take long for it to start clumping.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it says it will, plus it&#x27;s a carbon-black, so the color really makes your eyes standout.</li>
            <li>I wear glasses and have long lashes, most mascaras flake when I blink, this one does not.</li>
            <li>I love how long my eyelashes are once I apply this mascara!</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>This is certainly my all time favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>But the formula actually does a great job of building up lush, long lashes.  </li>
            <li>Really glad that I decided to give this new mascara a try after seeing the commercial on TV.</li>
            <li>Easy to get those bottom lashes because that side of the brush is small and fine.  </li>
            <li>Shame really.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much time for make up</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much since this is a drugstore brand</li>
            <li>From the commercials I expected better results.</li>
            <li>It really makes my lashes pop and stand out.</li>
            <li>It thickens very well</li>
            <li>I really hoped I would like it</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real Mascara.</li>
            <li>So, didn&#x27;t even try it; going straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I really does flair out your lashes and also gives lots of length, it doesn&#x27;t lump at all.</li>
            <li>The formula is a wetter formula, which I prefer and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that your lashes don&#x27;t get that crunchy, brittle feeling after the mascara dries.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>, it has the butterfly brush and the butterfly brush separates really well and applies the mascara evenly without clumping</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this mascara.</li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>Color really sticks without globbing.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and makes my eyelashes look way fuller with no clumps.</li>
            <li>Really makes my eyelashes thicker &amp; longer.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily apply mascara to all my lashes without any smudging and sometimes that&#x27;s a bit hard to do especially if I&#x27;ve had more than one cup of coffee prior to applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually purchase(and love!)</li>
            <li>I am a fan of plastic mascara brushes and this one takes it a step further with the unique shape.</li>
            <li>One side for your top lashes and the other side for the bottom.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a pretty strong chemical smell when you use it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last on your actual lashes.  </li>
            <li>Within two hours, the top of my cheeks are covered with black dots.</li>
            <li>With this mascara the volume is not quite as thick, but the curl created by the brush is amazing, and really makes my lashes stand</li>
            <li>I use several different mascaras, and thought Cover Girl&#x27;s Clump Crusher was on top until I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Mascara this week.  </li>
            <li>Would HIGHLY recommend this product in a heart beat.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend every woman to try it.</li>
            <li>The brush takes a little getting used to, but I love it and it is far more affordable than other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Formula is very wet, which is nice for me since I have short, sparse lashes and it adds volume without being clumpy.</li>
            <li>Unlike the normal L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Butterfly mascara</li>
            <li>The brush is a nice shape to coat the outside lashes but the bristles are pretty small.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for others to experiment with lately, but honestly none compare.</li>
            <li>Maybe with a few more coats</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; and more like a soft comb.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the market for a new mascara now.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to mascara.</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use, and it does create a slight fanning effect on my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mine up &#x27;til the bitter end and will most definitely be purchasing another.</li>
            <li>So dramatic and gorgeous</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and airy, but very clumpy and flaky and not easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Not many mascaras can get my 5 star approval, but this one sure does.</li>
            <li>while the brush is interesting and works well I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li>left handed but pretty ambidextrous</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed something was different the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I keep experimenting with other mascaras instead of sticking with my tried and true Benefits</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mother of 3 young kids (6yr, 2yr and 9 months)</li>
            <li>My biggest thing is that I want my lashes to look natural.</li>
            <li>really like this, and will definitely be re-purchasing it!</li>
            <li>While it does give a lush look to lashes</li>
            <li>Was old.</li>
            <li>Every lash curls into its natural shape</li>
            <li>If you like a thick mascara you will love this one.  </li>
            <li>By using it as a base, and learning to keep curling/rotating the wand all the way through the lash to the tips, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>I have been asked if I have fake lashes on because it looks so good.</li>
            <li>But, because of the way the brush is shaped, I have to apply it to my left eye either by rotating my right wrist completely, or using my left hand.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter than expected and it clumped right out of the tube.</li>
            <li>The only con is that it seems to dry out rather quickly.</li>
            <li>was Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft, which I still do like, but this Butterfly mascara gives a little bit prettier of an effect, and my husband has even noticed it.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and you won&#x27;t find a higher-quality mascara, or experience better results, with the expensive department-store brands.  </li>
            <li>Very thin formula and super easy to disperse evenly</li>
            <li>Brush is a little gimmicky but it does a wonderful job getting those hard to reach outer lashes as well as my skimpy lower ones.  </li>
            <li>The unual shape of the wand does take a little bit of getting used to, and for the first few times my right eye always looked bigger and better than the left, but then I finally got the hang of how to use it on the left side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the look of my lashes with the regular L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous, but I find it incredibly hard to remove.  </li>
            <li>Too bad the wand won&#x27;t fit in my favorite Boots mascara tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a person with short eyelashes, so of course I was on the hunt for a mascara that would give me long pretty eyelashes</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the chemical smell is very strong, definitely something I could do without.</li>
            <li>I had thick lashes, all right, but they were straight as a pin.</li>
            <li>24Hr Bold Mascara in Very Black.</li>
            <li>I use either a bb cream or bare minerals powder, lip balm, and mascara.</li>
            <li>I have thin straight short lashes that don&#x27;t hold a curl long with most mascaras.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something I mind too much because it doesn&#x27;t last  very long, but some people might be put off.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that is comes off so easily if I cry or get sweaty.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this mascara because I heard good things about it, but when I tried it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get a more dramatic effect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very very mascara smell, chemical and heavy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was almost watery for the first few weeks until the air started drying it out&lt;br /&gt;Deal</li>
            <li>This mascara makes them lush, long and thick looking, without the clumping and smudging like so many other mascaras do.</li>
            <li>you have realistic expectations and dont expect your lashes to look exactly like the models they use in the ads since they are always wearing false eyelashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little wet when you first use it, like really wet and plentiful, so be careful applying it the first 5 times</li>

            <li> I love this mascara!</li>

            <li> once its on its beyond amazing</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m loving this mascara.</li>
            <li> going on really gets in between the lashes, plumps and lengthens, aaannddd the best part</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s warm out.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is really nice, and closes</li>
            <li> The best thing about this mascara is you don&#x27;t have to use as much</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product for truly beautiful eyelashes!</li>
            <li> is the price RIGHT, or what?!?!?!</li>
            <li> i liked the million lashes one better</li>
            <li> The brush is so perfect for creating a natural looking eye-widening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly Mascara is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The larger comb-like side of it perfectly wings out the outer lashes, making my eyes look amazing.</li>
            <li> lashes look so full and beautiful, goes on smoothly and stays on until you take it off.</li>
            <li> Makes your whole look come together beautifully.</li>
            <li> The mascara looks great when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Perfect, fantastic, I finally found a good mascara.</li>
            <li> Terrific mascara, the applicator brush is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras over my 65 years, and none have caused me to fall so dramatically in love with a product as this one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, and they all flake, regardless of their &amp;#34;no flake&amp;#34; claims.</li>
            <li> (I think there is magic in this tube.)</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> It was such a great price!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have more control with this wand.</li>
            <li> The brush is okay</li>
            <li> worked in cosmetics retail for most of my life n</li>
            <li> most make up artist</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara for length and volume</li>
            <li> Love, love love</li>
            <li> I simply love this product.  </li>
            <li> Have told so many people already.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s available on Subscribe &amp; Save, too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love the brush.</li>
            <li> The side with the longer bristles is perfect for lengthening and the shorter bristles get the tiny lashes without smearing mascara everywhere.</li>
            <li> I found it okay</li>
            <li> and I love this.</li>
            <li> that I love to do.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, and for this price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the product makes it look appealing to me.</li>
            <li> The results were okay, my lashes straightened out after a while and it kinda smudges on my lower lash line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just mentioning these two things because I almost didn&#x27;t buy it after reading those comments, but I am so glad that I went ahead and bought it</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mascara for many decades.</li>
            <li> However, with time I started to get a lot of flaking and it started to clump more.</li>
            <li> My shorter more sparse lashes looked tarantula like.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the mascara, you might consider saving the wand to use with a mascara you like better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already stocked up on more of this.</li>
            <li> This one seems better than most.</li>
            <li> its cheap!</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s great to know I can get it from Amazon and not pay as much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies for awhile now and while it does work well, I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I found that one coat was sufficient for volume and length appropriate for work.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Lengths Mascara is now my all-time favorite.  </li>
            <li> By lunch time it&#x27;s mostly gone.</li>
            <li> This one is all I need. :)</li>
            <li> and i am just in love with it.</li>
            <li> But, I love L&#x27;Oreal mascaras.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But mostly ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and get tons of compliments.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara!</li>
            <li> The brush is magic and the mascara is not cakey or goopy at all...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job for a senior.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a pretty darn good mascara, and much more affordable than Diorshow.</li>
            <li> It makes your eyelashes long and best part no clumping!</li>
            <li> The wand is a perfect shape for creating long looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Pretty good mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my lashes look, not clumpy at all and its easy to take it off at night.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive eyes and skin, and experienced no burning or stinging with this product.  </li>
            <li> deff separeates and very full lashes</li>
            <li> strength lies in its special wand, which is perfectly shaped to the human eye.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal shows why they&#x27;re a top beauty brand with this fabulous mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ask me if my lashes were real and how gorgeous they looked.</li>
            <li> When I saw the wand on this mascara, I thought it was unique and innovative.  </li>
            <li> The wand of this mascara is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t notice any changes in thickens and length of my lashes, can be cleaned easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to remove at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy removal.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes double in sizes :) I am happy.</li>
            <li> Didn know my natural eyelashes could look that good :)</li>
            <li> It has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> gives me super long eyelashes that are perfectly spaced out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as Maybelline New York XXL</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in my usual store, so I am very happy that I was able to order this online.</li>
            <li> The formula is wetter than I&#x27;d like but it does apply fine.</li>
            <li> the super shock from Avon does a better job</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect, and I can even put a little on my bottom lashes and it still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;oreal mascaras.</li>
            <li> My eyes were bright red and everyone kept asking if I was okay.  </li>
            <li> The wand is amazing because it really does make my lashes look fuller and it targets the hard-to-reach lashes in the corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Great for short sparse lashes.</li>
            <li> The wand is great, definitely fans out your lashes.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, does not clump, and seems true to it&#x27;s color.  </li>
            <li> I really really like this mascara, longer eyelashes, and very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&gt;Deep, rich color&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is now my favorite mascara possibly in large part because the wand is so unique - it has an asymmetrical shape sort of like a wing.</li>
            <li> so I love the fact that this mascara is super easy to apply in the very few seconds I have to apply it LOL.</li>
            <li> No clumps, no fragrance, cool brush.</li>
            <li> I find the formula very close to Lancome&#x27;s Hypnose Drama, but the wand on this mascara is way more preferable.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this mascara goes on and the way the brush works - it&#x27;s all quite lovely.</li>
            <li> It also lengthens my lashes substantially and separates them so they look full and lucious.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the Chanel mascara that I was buying &amp; so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It took a long time for me to find one I liked better than Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stiletto, but this is it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mascara - it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily and looks great - for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it won&#x27;t dry out, unlike many popular mascaras that don&#x27;t close</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, and stays put.</li>
            <li> The tiny brush-like side is perfect for the tiny lower lashes, and there is no mascara ending up anywhere</li>
            <li> I disagree and won&#x27;t be buying this again, but glad I was able to try it out for a low price.</li>
            <li> Getting older, my eyelashes are thinner and more sparse.</li>
            <li> What I love the most about this mascara is that the wand allows me to get the outer corner lashes at the same time I get the rest.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> it really does make them look bigger and better, and keeps them separated nicely....</li>
            <li> It is fast becoming my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara in the world.</li>
            <li> , you might find that this is your new favorite.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this new Butterfly mascara, though, since it was reviewed in a recent issue of _Lucky_ magazine as a great drugstore mascara.  </li>
            <li> I do get is a great black mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first starting wearing it.</li>
            <li> I used to always try different brands and couldn&#x27;t ever find a mascara that offered both a formula AND a wand that I liked, but I&#x27;ve been consistently using Voluminous Butterfly for over a year!  </li>
            <li> You start by catching the lashes on the tiny brush side and them rotate it up, wiggle and done.</li>
            <li> I would have to say this one has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but I rarely have that problem</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and figured it was worth a shot</li>
            <li> This mascara is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes look more natural.  </li>
            <li> it is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a traditional brush kind of gal.</li>
            <li> Pretty darn good mascara - Rich and dark, thickening, and super-lengthening.  </li>
            <li> The Butterfly Brush is completely different from any other mascara that I have tried, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all in my ever growing search to find that perfect</li>
            <li> The part that really grabbed my attention and drew my interest was the unique shape of the mascara wand.</li>
            <li> I am right handed and have no problem applying to my right eye.  </li>
            <li> so i stick with my right.</li>
            <li> I have been trying numerous new mascara products on the market, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers what it promised.</li>
            <li> Used to use the old Voluminous and liked it a lot but wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend even noticed there was a difference (and, let&#x27;s face it, guys don&#x27;t usually notice) and remarked on how great my lashes looked.</li>
            <li> This mascara is suitable for short-term use only.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brush, but it became very flaky after several hours.  </li>
            <li> I have tried expensive mascara, and inexpensive mascara, and have never truly been that happy with most of them.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for getting to the inner and outside corners of your lashes.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t generally mess with more than one good solid coat.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> but I dont think it does any more than a regular one.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I used to use L&#x27;oreal exclusively but went to higher priced brands over the years</li>
            <li> I had tried the Miss Manga hoping for something wonderful but was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> It really makes them POP!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll do a YouTube video if anyone&#x27;s interested.</li>
            <li> I know most people think all mascaras are the same,  but!  </li>
            <li> , I really wanted to like it though!</li>
            <li> The corners especially looked more fanned out.</li>
            <li> It is not expensive.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended it to me; bought the first time from Ulta.  </li>
            <li> It not only holds my curl but also makes my lashes appear longer and more volumized.</li>
            <li> I buy a different kind of mascara every time I need a new one just so I can try all of them out.</li>
            <li> like Benifit&#x27;s Their Real and Too Faced Size Queen 1 of Dior&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m always on the look out for the next best thing usually</li>
            <li> teen daughter says its great for those corner lashes and goes on very well does not leave clumps,makes her lashes look really long</li>
            <li> And only a couple I really make it 2 the top of my list.  </li>
            <li> and this pretty much gets the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first mascara that I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my contact lenses, I can get in to the outer edge of my eyelashes and really bring them out without a lot of clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I really wanted to dislike it.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara except that it does not take long for it to start clumping.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it says it will, plus it&#x27;s a carbon-black, so the color really makes your eyes standout.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses and have long lashes, most mascaras flake when I blink, this one does not.</li>
            <li> I love how long my eyelashes are once I apply this mascara!</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> This is certainly my all time favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> But the formula actually does a great job of building up lush, long lashes.  </li>
            <li> Really glad that I decided to give this new mascara a try after seeing the commercial on TV.</li>
            <li> Easy to get those bottom lashes because that side of the brush is small and fine.  </li>
            <li> Shame really.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time for make up</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much since this is a drugstore brand</li>
            <li> From the commercials I expected better results.</li>
            <li> It really makes my lashes pop and stand out.</li>
            <li> It thickens very well</li>
            <li> I really hoped I would like it</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real Mascara.</li>
            <li> So, didn&#x27;t even try it; going straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I really does flair out your lashes and also gives lots of length, it doesn&#x27;t lump at all.</li>
            <li> The formula is a wetter formula, which I prefer and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that your lashes don&#x27;t get that crunchy, brittle feeling after the mascara dries.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara</li>
            <li> , it has the butterfly brush and the butterfly brush separates really well and applies the mascara evenly without clumping</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I really like</li>
            <li> Color really sticks without globbing.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and makes my eyelashes look way fuller with no clumps.</li>
            <li> Really makes my eyelashes thicker &amp; longer.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily apply mascara to all my lashes without any smudging and sometimes that&#x27;s a bit hard to do especially if I&#x27;ve had more than one cup of coffee prior to applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually purchase(and love!)</li>
            <li> I am a fan of plastic mascara brushes and this one takes it a step further with the unique shape.</li>
            <li> One side for your top lashes and the other side for the bottom.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a pretty strong chemical smell when you use it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last on your actual lashes.  </li>
            <li> Within two hours, the top of my cheeks are covered with black dots.</li>
            <li> With this mascara the volume is not quite as thick, but the curl created by the brush is amazing, and really makes my lashes stand</li>
            <li> I use several different mascaras, and thought Cover Girl&#x27;s Clump Crusher was on top until I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Mascara this week.  </li>
            <li> Would HIGHLY recommend this product in a heart beat.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend every woman to try it.</li>
            <li> The brush takes a little getting used to, but I love it and it is far more affordable than other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Formula is very wet, which is nice for me since I have short, sparse lashes and it adds volume without being clumpy.</li>
            <li> Unlike the normal L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Butterfly mascara</li>
            <li> The brush is a nice shape to coat the outside lashes but the bristles are pretty small.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for others to experiment with lately, but honestly none compare.</li>
            <li> Maybe with a few more coats</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; and more like a soft comb.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the market for a new mascara now.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use, and it does create a slight fanning effect on my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine up &#x27;til the bitter end and will most definitely be purchasing another.</li>
            <li> So dramatic and gorgeous</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and airy, but very clumpy and flaky and not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Not many mascaras can get my 5 star approval, but this one sure does.</li>
            <li> while the brush is interesting and works well I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> left handed but pretty ambidextrous</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed something was different the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep experimenting with other mascaras instead of sticking with my tried and true Benefits</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mother of 3 young kids (6yr, 2yr and 9 months)</li>
            <li> My biggest thing is that I want my lashes to look natural.</li>
            <li> really like this, and will definitely be re-purchasing it!</li>
            <li> While it does give a lush look to lashes</li>
            <li> Was old.</li>
            <li> Every lash curls into its natural shape</li>
            <li> If you like a thick mascara you will love this one.  </li>
            <li> By using it as a base, and learning to keep curling/rotating the wand all the way through the lash to the tips, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have been asked if I have fake lashes on because it looks so good.</li>
            <li> But, because of the way the brush is shaped, I have to apply it to my left eye either by rotating my right wrist completely, or using my left hand.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter than expected and it clumped right out of the tube.</li>
            <li> The only con is that it seems to dry out rather quickly.</li>
            <li> was Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft, which I still do like, but this Butterfly mascara gives a little bit prettier of an effect, and my husband has even noticed it.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and you won&#x27;t find a higher-quality mascara, or experience better results, with the expensive department-store brands.  </li>
            <li> Very thin formula and super easy to disperse evenly</li>
            <li> Brush is a little gimmicky but it does a wonderful job getting those hard to reach outer lashes as well as my skimpy lower ones.  </li>
            <li> The unual shape of the wand does take a little bit of getting used to, and for the first few times my right eye always looked bigger and better than the left, but then I finally got the hang of how to use it on the left side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the look of my lashes with the regular L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous, but I find it incredibly hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the wand won&#x27;t fit in my favorite Boots mascara tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person with short eyelashes, so of course I was on the hunt for a mascara that would give me long pretty eyelashes</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the chemical smell is very strong, definitely something I could do without.</li>
            <li> I had thick lashes, all right, but they were straight as a pin.</li>
            <li> 24Hr Bold Mascara in Very Black.</li>
            <li> I use either a bb cream or bare minerals powder, lip balm, and mascara.</li>
            <li> I have thin straight short lashes that don&#x27;t hold a curl long with most mascaras.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something I mind too much because it doesn&#x27;t last  very long, but some people might be put off.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is comes off so easily if I cry or get sweaty.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this mascara because I heard good things about it, but when I tried it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a more dramatic effect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very very mascara smell, chemical and heavy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was almost watery for the first few weeks until the air started drying it out&lt;br /&gt;Deal</li>
            <li> This mascara makes them lush, long and thick looking, without the clumping and smudging like so many other mascaras do.</li>
            <li> you have realistic expectations and dont expect your lashes to look exactly like the models they use in the ads since they are always wearing false eyelashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little wet when you first use it, like really wet and plentiful, so be careful applying it the first 5 times</li>
            <li> It does not leave any dry clumps or runy racoon eyes by the end of the day, does not take forever to come off when ur washing ur face,  its creamy but not 2 wet</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only found two other brands and I&#x27;ve tried a ton.</li>
            <li> not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra price - don&#x27;t notice anything very different than my typical mascara, though.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear much makeup usually,</li>
            <li> I actually have to stop applying it because my lashes get TOO long.</li>
            <li> Anyway , it&#x27;s long lasting, adds volume and makes them fan out.</li>
            <li> - only darkened to its maximum so that you appear to have incredibly long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> While I was completely prepared to be let down with my purchase, I found that once I got the hang of it, it did help me to get a winged out look as advertised.</li>
            <li> I buy 1 usually every couple wks from high brand to low.</li>
            <li> The brush is angled at one end to &amp;#34;flare out&amp;#34; the lashes, but it only works that way on one eye (the right eye for right handed users) and requires holding the wand at an awkward angle to do the other eye.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have trouble with the mascara being so wet.</li>
            <li> All day long.</li>
            <li> When I was in my twenties, my lashes were so long that the tips touched the bottom of my brows.</li>
            <li> Does the job day after day - a quality product that lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It adds some volume without being thick and cakey and really seems to separate the lashes well.</li>
            <li> TOO LONG!?</li>
            <li> I have short, stubby and patchy eyelashes due to trichtolomania.</li>
            <li> Make my lashes very long and voluminous.  </li>
            <li> The mascara makes your lashes very long and defined.  </li>
            <li> Make your eye lashes very long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get dry and flaky during the day</li>
            <li> The formula is too dry for me and looks clumpy and flakey on my lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really wild about having to apply false lashes (the ones I buy are pretty conservative</li>
            <li> No better or different than any other mascara I have used, except that it is more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> My only slight complaint is I don&#x27;t particularly care for the brush on the wand.  </li>
            <li> After I applied this mascara for the first time, my eyes looked almost like they do when I use false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> In the past I always wore my mascara on the outer two thirds of my upper lashes only.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the brush and the super thin mascara that make this stuff rock!</li>
            <li> The actual mascara flakes off leaving a mess under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the mess it makes after only two hours!</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t start out too dry but after only a few uses I have noticed it drying and flaking.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always trying to get my regular mascara to match the style which can be difficult with certain brush types</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a mascara that will work for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely being returned.&lt;br /&gt;Having shared that, although the brush is a bit gimmicky, I did find that it coated each lash well, including the tiniest corner lashes.</li>
            <li> I have strayed a few times and tried out physicians formula, Lancôme, Avon, Pacifica, Elizabeth Arden, Rimmel, Maybelline...but have always come back.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with adding extra coats.</li>
            <li> Especially long wear, it smudges quite a lot</li>
            <li> Mascara was a little dryer than usual, making me think it might be a touch old.</li>
            <li> As for the negative reviews...trust me as long as you have basic knowledge on how to apply mascara</li>
            <li> Just a dry mess</li>
            <li> There is a &amp;#34;dip&amp;#34; on one side of the wand and not on the other side.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice a chemical smell like other reviewers.</li>
            <li> noticed some other reviewers mentioned flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to throw away all my other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, the problem is the stick together with previous mascaras!</li>
            <li> Awkward to apply (I&#x27;m left handed) and very flaky.  </li>
            <li> Also, I find it can smudge throughout that day if I am active</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really cold in New York, so an unfair test of how long this mascara could wear under normal circumstances, so I&#x27;ve held back a star.</li>
            <li> Love the wand but hate the mascara cream it is so clumpy.</li>
            <li> While it is a very wet mascara when applied, I did have to be very careful not to move or blink my eyes until it had dried completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past are really dry.</li>
            <li> I bought the brown/black color, and will be adding the Blackest Black to my cosmetic</li>
            <li> For work, when I&#x27;m crunched for time and meticulousness, I slap this stuff onto the outer half of my lashes, concentrating on the outer corners.</li>
            <li> mascara&#x27;s secret weapon is a brush unlike no other.</li>
            <li> It also stays on all day without flaking off unless I mess with them (when my eyes get itchy from South Louisiana allergies).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used wet formulas in the past that did virtually nothing when applied, but this is not the case this time.</li>
            <li> im not good at applying with my left hand</li>
            <li> I have long and somewhat thick lashes and this mascara helped enhance that.</li>
            <li> But a very minor complaint.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is a little tricky to apply because of the shape of the brush</li>
            <li> have read in some reviews about flaking off during the day, but I have had no problems with that, perhaps because I use so little.</li>
            <li> and I save a little time.</li>
            <li> I only used this a few times and just don&#x27;t like the applicator, as some other reviews wrote it is very difficult to use to apply to your opposite handed eye.  </li>
            <li> It is not fabulous and it doesn&#x27;t create the effect in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy about it because I actually like this mascara but</li>
            <li> just give yourself a few days to get used to the wand.</li>
            <li> I try a few swipes to coat evenly</li>
            <li> but after a few, I noticed clumping and sticking even though this is a &amp;#34;defined&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but certainly not the worst out there.</li>
            <li> to hold tube&lt;br /&gt;Can be reapplied later for a dramatic night look</li>
            <li> I agree that it smells pretty bad, also.</li>
            <li> I usually have to put in a few drops of contact solution before it runs out just to loosen it up a bit.</li>
            <li> It did lengthen my lashes but made them look less thick and kinda sticker</li>
            <li> go-to mascara in the past</li>
            <li> brush is really small and asymmetrical when held horizontally which I didn&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the butterfly in the title, but it does seem to cover the smallest lashes.</li>
            <li> no more hiding/invisible lashes...</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with an asymmetrical lash line shape, which does have a small learning curve.</li>
            <li> Fav everyday mascara!</li>
            <li> I am a righty and hate applying this to my left eye with my left hand (because you HAVE to do it like that</li>
            <li> Maybe applying a base first would help???  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s now.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit awkward to use on the left eye, but thats</li>
            <li> One complaint...</li>
            <li> I mean it just runs off.  </li>
            <li> People actually ask if my eyelashes are fake!!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than the others!</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> My eyelahses look false.  </li>
            <li> - it looked like I had false ones on.</li>
            <li> length and volume - look like false lashes</li>
            <li> Looks like I have false lashes when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I also have not noticed any bad smell at all as other reviewers commented.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a base coat!</li>
            <li> Definitely not an ideal mascara.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m ambidextrous when applying eye make-up, so I didn&#x27;t find it difficult to use this wand.)</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to paying 30.00 for the expensive brand I used to use.  </li>
            <li> The brush is difficult to use on the eye/hand side that is not your dominant hand.</li>
            <li> and I doubt anyone can tell they are fake)</li>
            <li> I only used this stuff twice and am disgusted with myself for even buying it.</li>
            <li> I went to a big event and I looked horrible within 10 minutes of putting this on.  </li>
            <li> but after that it fails in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It does make lashes look very dramatic while it lasts, though.</li>
            <li> Some reviews say it is awkward</li>
            <li> After a few hours it begins flaking horribly.</li>
            <li> The brush is awkward to use, the product smells and the mascara flakes off during the day.  </li>
            <li> But I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> it stinks until it dries!</li>
            <li> I get disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be throwing it away. :-(</li>
            <li> I hate it :(  </li>
            <li> start at the base of your eyelashes and work your way up.</li>
            <li> You have to start at the base of your lashes and sweep upward, rotating the wand just a bit</li>
            <li> However, this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The fibers are horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as good as advertised- i liked the million lashes one better</li>
            <li> Terrific mascara, the applicator brush is excellent.</li>
            <li> I have lashes that are so blond they are almost invisible. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras over my 65 years, and none have caused me to fall so dramatically in love with a product as this one did. I don&#x27;t notice the chemical smell that others seem to note. I really don&#x27;t have trouble with the mascara being so wet. I actually think that its wetness is an asset. It dries quickly, and stays put. I have the waterproof Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was regularly using Calvin Klein volumizing mascara. I had thick lashes, all right, but they were straight as a pin. With this mascara the volume is not quite as thick, but the curl created by the brush is amazing, and really makes my lashes stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara&#x27;s secret weapon is a brush unlike no other. I&#x27;d describe it as a brush/comb hybrid. The larger comb-like side of it perfectly wings out the outer lashes, making my eyes look amazing. The tiny brush-like side is perfect for the tiny lower lashes, and there is no mascara ending up anywhere but on those pesky tiny ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a gamble and put this mascara on my Amazon Subscribe and Save delivery. I never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, and they all flake, regardless of their &amp;#34;no flake&amp;#34; claims. However, this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used. Within two hours, the top of my cheeks are covered with black dots. I agree that it smells pretty bad, also. This one is definitely being returned.&lt;br /&gt;Having shared that, although the brush is a bit gimmicky, I did find that it coated each lash well, including the tiniest corner lashes. I used the short side for applying the mascara, then switched to the longer, curved side for defining and separating. (I&#x27;m ambidextrous when applying eye make-up, so I didn&#x27;t find it difficult to use this wand.) Too bad the wand won&#x27;t fit in my favorite Boots mascara tube.</li>
            <li> deff separeates and very full lashes</li>
            <li> Love the brush on this!</li>
            <li> Best. Mascara. Ever. I actually have to stop applying it because my lashes get TOO long. TOO LONG!? No clumps, no fragrance, cool brush. (I think there is magic in this tube.)</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this product. This is now my favorite mascara. Lengthens and separates lashes.</li>
            <li> Unlike the normal L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Butterfly mascara I usually purchase(and love!), this product gave no length or volume whatsoever. Shame really. It was such a great price!</li>
            <li> Best mascara EVER!!!! I tried out that 3D fiber lash that everyone is obsessing about....blah! The fibers are horrible. This mascara looks and feels so much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes your eyelashes long and best part no clumping! As for the negative reviews...trust me as long as you have basic knowledge on how to apply mascara this mascara will drastically improve the look of your lashes! I&#x27;m a mother of 3 young kids (6yr, 2yr and 9 months) I don&#x27;t have much time for make up so I love the fact that this mascara is super easy to apply in the very few seconds I have to apply it LOL. The wand of this mascara is extremely easy to use. Some reviews say it is awkward it actually isn&#x27;t. I feel like I have more control with this wand. There is a &amp;#34;dip&amp;#34; on one side of the wand and not on the other side. The &amp;#34;dip&amp;#34; side goes towards your eye...start at the base of your eyelashes and work your way up. It&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Make my lashes very long and voluminous.  Didn know my natural eyelashes could look that good :)&lt;br /&gt;Would recomend and buy it again</li>
            <li> Great formula.  The brush is okay but I dont think it does any more than a regular one.</li>
            <li> I did read the reviews n purchased it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Flakes off. All day long. I had to keep removing the flakes all day.&lt;br /&gt;Also didn&#x27;t do anything different for the look of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I worked in cosmetics retail for most of my life n most make up artist I worked with used maybelline for their personal choice.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it to a friend n she say it flaked on her too!</li>
            <li> This enhances without clumping or looking unreal.  Great product.  It&#x27;s been really cold in New York, so an unfair test of how long this mascara could wear under normal circumstances, so I&#x27;ve held back a star.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara for length and volume</li>
            <li> Best drug store mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned! Looks like I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
            <li> Love the wand but hate the mascara cream it is so clumpy.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brush, but it became very flaky after several hours.  Maybe applying a base first would help???  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just as described! Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much since this is a drugstore brand but I have to say this is great mascara!  I used to use L&#x27;oreal exclusively but went to higher priced brands over the years - I am now on a tighter budget.  I had tried the Miss Manga hoping for something wonderful but was not impressed.  Used to use the old Voluminous and liked it a lot but wanted to try something new.  Brush is a little gimmicky but it does a wonderful job getting those hard to reach outer lashes as well as my skimpy lower ones.  Formula is very wet, which is nice for me since I have short, sparse lashes and it adds volume without being clumpy. 2 coats and I have supermodel lashes!  Love, love love</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to paying 30.00 for the expensive brand I used to use.  This stuff is AWESOME!!!!  If you like a thick mascara you will love this one.  My eyelahses look false.  Everyone asks me where I go to have my eyelashes done.  It&#x27;s nice to say it&#x27;s the mascara.  I simply love this product.  I hope they never discontinue it.  Seems that every product that works they discontinue.  Would HIGHLY recommend this product in a heart beat.  Have told so many people already.  Good Job L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> From the commercials I expected better results. It did lengthen my lashes but made them look less thick and kinda sticker together.&lt;br /&gt;to me the super shock from Avon does a better job</li>
            <li> Pretty darn good mascara - Rich and dark, thickening, and super-lengthening.  Got my hair cut today and my stylist asked if I was wearing falsies!  I think that&#x27;s a pretty darn good mascara, and much more affordable than Diorshow.</li>
            <li> I like the color and i love the wand! I constantly get compliments about the effect this mascara has on my eyelashes. It really makes them POP!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to inexpensive mascara. The wand is a perfect shape for creating long looking lashes. Love that it&#x27;s available on Subscribe &amp; Save, too!</li>
            <li> I like it. I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;oreal mascaras. I have strayed a few times and tried out physicians formula, Lancôme, Avon, Pacifica, Elizabeth Arden, Rimmel, Maybelline...but have always come back. This mascara is a little tricky to apply because of the shape of the brush but I have perfected the method. You start by catching the lashes on the tiny brush side and them rotate it up, wiggle and done. Maybe I&#x27;ll do a YouTube video if anyone&#x27;s interested. Anyway , it&#x27;s long lasting, adds volume and makes them fan out. No clumping either.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara. It took a long time for me to find one I liked better than Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stiletto, but this is it. My eyelashes were fine and incredibly flared - it looked like I had false ones on. My boyfriend even noticed there was a difference (and, let&#x27;s face it, guys don&#x27;t usually notice) and remarked on how great my lashes looked. The brush takes a little getting used to, but I love it and it is far more affordable than other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Washes off easily&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Amazing length and volume - look like false lashes&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Deep, rich color&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Even added some curl to my lashes&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&gt;No clumping&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Didn&#x27;t bother my eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No downsides to this one!</li>
            <li> Love it! It doesn&#x27;t smear even when I put in my contact lense drops!</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junkie but never have found one that meets all my criteria. This one does! I love the brush. I am a fan of plastic mascara brushes and this one takes it a step further with the unique shape. The side with the longer bristles is perfect for lengthening and the shorter bristles get the tiny lashes without smearing mascara everywhere. It adds some volume without being thick and cakey and really seems to separate the lashes well. I always have trouble with adding extra coats. It always seem to make my lashes clump together. This one doesn&#x27;t do that. It also stays on all day without flaking off unless I mess with them (when my eyes get itchy from South Louisiana allergies). It comes off easily (I use coconut oil and water). This is my fave mascara ever! Buying a tube for my mom too.</li>
            <li> I buy a different kind of mascara every time I need a new one just so I can try all of them out. I would have to say this one has been my favorite so far. It really makes my lashes pop and stand out. I work in a retail store and one day while wearing this mascara I had a customer ask me if my lashes were real and how gorgeous they looked. I definitely credit this mascara for that reaction.</li>
            <li> I know most people think all mascaras are the same,  but!  This one does give you beautiful results. Nice, sexy fluttery - lashes that don&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li> This mascara is suitable for short-term use only. After a few hours it begins flaking horribly. It does make lashes look very dramatic while it lasts, though.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, the problem is the stick together with previous mascaras! but not this one! the wand gets the lashes in the corner and the brush lengthens and seperates my lashes! People actually ask if my eyelashes are fake!!</li>
            <li> I really really like this mascara, longer eyelashes, and very easy to remove. This mascara is the&lt;br /&gt;bomb.com. Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I found it okay but didn&#x27;t notice any changes in thickens and length of my lashes, can be cleaned easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mascara addict and I love this. Not many mascaras can get my 5 star approval, but this one sure does. It thickens very well and you definitely can create that corner flare that it claims and that I love to do. I will repurchase this one.</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara after reading a review online...while the brush is interesting and works well I just can&#x27;t get past the smell. I hate it! My eyes are itchy by the end of the day until I remove the mascara. If they would remove the smell I would change my review but until then I have to give it one star.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, and for this price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this since I saw it a while ago on TV. The packaging of the product makes it look appealing to me. I curled my eyelashes and applied a couple coats. The results were okay, my lashes straightened out after a while and it kinda smudges on my lower lash line. I like the angle of the brush. It&#x27;s not as good as Maybelline New York XXL 24Hr Bold Mascara in Very Black. I&#x27;m just gonna use it until it runs out.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara in the world. The brush is so perfect for creating a natural looking eye-widening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read in some reviews about flaking off during the day, but I have had no problems with that, perhaps because I use so little. I also have not noticed any bad smell at all as other reviewers commented. I&#x27;m just mentioning these two things because I almost didn&#x27;t buy it after reading those comments, but I am so glad that I went ahead and bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear much makeup usually, if any at all. I use either a bb cream or bare minerals powder, lip balm, and mascara. My biggest thing is that I want my lashes to look natural. In the past I always wore my mascara on the outer two thirds of my upper lashes only. This mascara takes out the need to do that. The brush is perfect, and I can even put a little on my bottom lashes and it still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go-to mascara in the past was Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft, which I still do like, but this Butterfly mascara gives a little bit prettier of an effect, and my husband has even noticed it.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyelashes fuller and longer. love it.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I read somewhere that it was comparable to Lancome&#x27;s Hypnose Drama mascara.  I disagree and won&#x27;t be buying this again, but glad I was able to try it out for a low price.</li>
            <li> It is lighter than expected and it clumped right out of the tube. I added a tiny tiny drop off water on the wand in an attempt to break up the clumps. It helped some but I wont purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The brush is difficult to use on the eye/hand side that is not your dominant hand. The actual mascara flakes off leaving a mess under your eyes. I used it for a week; never had a successful application or day without flakes.</li>
            <li> I hate it :(  I really hoped I would like it but I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know why I keep experimenting with other mascaras instead of sticking with my tried and true Benefits They&#x27;re Real Mascara. Oh wait, yes I do! Because the Benefit mascara is $23 and this was $9! It did make my lashes appear a bit thicker but it didn&#x27;t seem to grab and stretch them out like my fave does! Wish I could get a refund!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice a chemical smell like other reviewers. I actually didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold tube&lt;br /&gt;Can be reapplied later for a dramatic night look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It was almost watery for the first few weeks until the air started drying it out&lt;br /&gt;Deal breaker: everytime I went to the bathroom I found clumps of mascara on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is really small and asymmetrical when held horizontally which I didn&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a mascara that will work for my sensitive eyes. So far I&#x27;ve only found two other brands and I&#x27;ve tried a ton. But this is one type that works for me. And it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than the others!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mascara for many decades. Some good, some not so good. But L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly Mascara is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Getting older, my eyelashes are thinner and more sparse. This mascara makes them lush, long and thick looking, without the clumping and smudging like so many other mascaras do. I highly recommend this product for truly beautiful eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this mascara because I heard good things about it, but when I tried it I was disappointed. It&#x27;s light and airy, but very clumpy and flaky and not easy to apply. Definitely not an ideal mascara. I tossed it after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> gives me super long eyelashes that are perfectly spaced out. even better than my expensive &amp;#34;theyre real&amp;#34; mascara from benefit, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first starting wearing it. However, with time I started to get a lot of flaking and it started to clump more. I&#x27;m in the market for a new mascara now.</li>
            <li> I only used this a few times and just don&#x27;t like the applicator, as some other reviews wrote it is very difficult to use to apply to your opposite handed eye.  I am a righty and hate applying this to my left eye with my left hand (because you HAVE to do it like that BECAUSE OF HOW THE BRUSH IS).  I will keep this as a back up but will not purchase again, I really wanted to like it though!</li>
            <li> I have blond eyelashes so mascara is a part of my daily routine and th is mascara worked well for both my upper and lower lashes.</li>
            <li> it stinks until it dries! otherwise its great</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara!!! The Brush has a great shape and the application is a breeze.. the way the brush is designed, it gives great accent to my lashes! It&#x27;s not clumpy and the brush accents almost every lash equally.</li>
            <li> What I love the most about this mascara is that the wand allows me to get the outer corner lashes at the same time I get the rest. So they look even and I save a little time. Makes my lashes look amazing too!</li>
            <li> My favorite! Goes in quickly and looks great!</li>
            <li> The smell is enough to not want to put this on your face, let alone your eyelashes.  So, didn&#x27;t even try it; going straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my lashes look, not clumpy at all and its easy to take it off at night. Doesn&#x27;t get dry and flaky during the day</li>
            <li> Not at all what I&#x27;d hoped for.  Awkward to apply (I&#x27;m left handed) and very flaky.  Looked up best mascaras for 2013 on the internet; hope I like my purchase from today!</li>
            <li> I have long and somewhat thick lashes and this mascara helped enhance that. The corners especially looked more fanned out. However if you don&#x27;t have the lashes already, it enhances that as well. My shorter more sparse lashes looked tarantula like. I&#x27;ve always been a L&#x27;Oreal mascara fan but this isn&#x27;t great for everyone.</li>
            <li> I am right handed and have no problem applying to my right eye.  But, because of the way the brush is shaped, I have to apply it to my left eye either by rotating my right wrist completely, or using my left hand.  Either way, the results are unspectacular.  No better or different than any other mascara I have used, except that it is more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> After I applied this mascara for the first time, my eyes looked almost like they do when I use false eyelashes. My eyelashes are noticeably longer and thicker without clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some other reviewers mentioned flaking. That hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me but I rarely have that problem and I think it might be because my skin is oily. I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s now. When I was in my twenties, my lashes were so long that the tips touched the bottom of my brows. Now they don&#x27;t and are a bit sparser as well so I&#x27;m loving this mascara. I&#x27;m not really wild about having to apply false lashes (the ones I buy are pretty conservative and I doubt anyone can tell they are fake) and this mascara makes it so I don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m left handed but pretty ambidextrous so had no problem applying this. You have to start at the base of your lashes and sweep upward, rotating the wand just a bit and I did it several times to get the look I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my favorite mascara possibly in large part because the wand is so unique - it has an asymmetrical shape sort of like a wing. If you don&#x27;t like the mascara, you might consider saving the wand to use with a mascara you like better. I was able to easily apply mascara to all my lashes without any smudging and sometimes that&#x27;s a bit hard to do especially if I&#x27;ve had more than one cup of coffee prior to applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already stocked up on more of this. Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying numerous new mascara products on the market, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers what it promised.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara seeker! I have tried expensive mascara, and inexpensive mascara, and have never truly been that happy with most of them. This one seems better than most. It does not clump, and it does not smudge. It is not expensive. Not sure about the butterfly in the title, but it does seem to cover the smallest lashes.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! I&#x27;m a junkie when it comes to mascara. I buy 1 usually every couple wks from high brand to low. And only a couple I really make it 2 the top of my list.  like Benifit&#x27;s Their Real and Too Faced Size Queen 1 of Dior&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m always on the look out for the next best thing usually I get disappointed. But not with this 1. It does not leave any dry clumps or runy racoon eyes by the end of the day, does not take forever to come off when ur washing ur face,  its creamy but not 2 wet going on really gets in between the lashes, plumps and lengthens, aaannddd the best part its cheap! 5 stars all the way a must buy!</li>
            <li> Pretty good mascara.  My only complaint is that is comes off so easily if I cry or get sweaty.  I mean it just runs off.  Also, I find it can smudge throughout that day if I am active or it&#x27;s warm out.  It goes on easily, does not clump, and seems true to it&#x27;s color.  Not my favorite, but certainly not the worst out there.</li>
            <li> Would be fine if it didn&#x27;t have the strong aroma of liquor that lingers around my face all day!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m a big fan of winged eyeliner and I&#x27;m always trying to get my regular mascara to match the style which can be difficult with certain brush types but then this came out! I read the reviews and figured it was worth a shot and it totally is. I really does flair out your lashes and also gives lots of length, it doesn&#x27;t lump at all. This is my new go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> When I saw the wand on this mascara, I thought it was unique and innovative.  It has a flare/wing shape on the bottom, so that your outer lashes appear longer.  The formula is a wetter formula, which I prefer and it works really well.  The mascara makes your lashes very long and defined.  It adds a bit of volume and a LOT of length.  It actually does wing out the ends of your lashes, giving a &amp;#34;false lash&amp;#34; effect.  I really like the fact that your lashes don&#x27;t get that crunchy, brittle feeling after the mascara dries.  The packaging is really nice, and closes/snaps shut every time.  I feel like it won&#x27;t dry out, unlike many popular mascaras that don&#x27;t close completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the smell.  It&#x27;s a very very mascara smell, chemical and heavy.  It&#x27;s not something I mind too much because it doesn&#x27;t last  very long, but some people might be put off.  I find the formula very close to Lancome&#x27;s Hypnose Drama, but the wand on this mascara is way more preferable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mascara - it&#x27;s not bad.  It is not fabulous and it doesn&#x27;t create the effect in the pictures.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for the mascara of my dreams that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I love the look of my lashes with the regular L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous, but I find it incredibly hard to remove.  I decided to try this new Butterfly mascara, though, since it was reviewed in a recent issue of _Lucky_ magazine as a great drugstore mascara.  I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a pretty strong chemical smell when you use it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last on your actual lashes.  The brush is easy to use, and it does create a slight fanning effect on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush also is made of a plastic, comb-like structure, so it helps keeps your mascara from clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to remove at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this, and will definitely be re-purchasing it!</li>
            <li> This has become my very favorite mascara!  I used to always try different brands and couldn&#x27;t ever find a mascara that offered both a formula AND a wand that I liked, but I&#x27;ve been consistently using Voluminous Butterfly for over a year!  The wand is amazing because it really does make my lashes look fuller and it targets the hard-to-reach lashes in the corners of my eyes.  The product itself doesn&#x27;t have any odor like some mascaras do and it&#x27;s non-clumping.  I&#x27;ve definitely found my go-to mascara!</li>
            <li> I only used this stuff twice and am disgusted with myself for even buying it. While it does give a lush look to lashes I can&#x27;t stand the mess it makes after only two hours!</li>
            <li> This mascara works for me.  I love L&#x27;Oreal.  I could not find this product in my usual store, so I am very happy that I was able to order this online.</li>
            <li> This mascara is worth the money. Adds length and volume! Watch my video on YouTube where I review and do a demo! http://youtu.be/aSbzAko2uLI</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I get horribly red eyes.  I like the mascara so I was hoping it was something else but it is this mascara.  I eliminated everything else.  I am not happy about it because I actually like this mascara but last night was the last straw for me. I went to a big event and I looked horrible within 10 minutes of putting this on.  My eyes were bright red and everyone kept asking if I was okay.  I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to mascara before this mascara.</li>
            <li> Boy, do I love this mascara!!  My sister recommended it to me; bought the first time from Ulta.  Now it&#x27;s great to know I can get it from Amazon and not pay as much.  The brush is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  One side for your top lashes and the other side for the bottom.  Easy to get those bottom lashes because that side of the brush is small and fine.  The best thing about this mascara is you don&#x27;t have to use as much and it doesn&#x27;t clump up.  Makes your lashes look more natural.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was old. Just a dry mess</li>
            <li> Loving the volume that I get when using this mascara...no more hiding/invisible lashes...this is just the product to make them come to life...loving it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, bar none.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies for awhile now and while it does work well, I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied with it. Especially long wear, it smudges quite a lot and it does clump if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;This Loreal Butterfly mascara was actually a whim purchase (that for once paid off). The formula is wetter than I&#x27;d like but it does apply fine. I&#x27;ve used wet formulas in the past that did virtually nothing when applied, but this is not the case this time. It applied perfectly with no clumps. The brush is a nice shape to coat the outside lashes but the bristles are pretty small. It didn&#x27;t matter, it still applied perfectly. I found that one coat was sufficient for volume and length appropriate for work. Even after an 8 hr shift, there was no smudging or migration of the mascara to my lower lash line. My only complaint is that the chemical smell is very strong, definitely something I could do without. But not enough so to dock a star. It is fast becoming my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> BEST Mascara EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great buy-however, I did not get a chance to wear because my granddaughter took it while we were on vacation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of good things about this mascara. I&#x27;m a person with short eyelashes, so of course I was on the hunt for a mascara that would give me long pretty eyelashes and this pretty much gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this mascara goes on and the way the brush works - it&#x27;s all quite lovely. But halfway through the day it&#x27;s starting to crumble and flake into my contacts making my eyes water. I&#x27;ll be throwing it away. :-(</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, it has the butterfly brush and the butterfly brush separates really well and applies the mascara evenly without clumping</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  The unual shape of the wand does take a little bit of getting used to, and for the first few times my right eye always looked bigger and better than the left, but then I finally got the hang of how to use it on the left side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first mascara that I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my contact lenses, I can get in to the outer edge of my eyelashes and really bring them out without a lot of clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have realistic expectations and dont expect your lashes to look exactly like the models they use in the ads since they are always wearing false eyelashes, you might find that this is your new favorite.  it really does make them look bigger and better, and keeps them separated nicely....just give yourself a few days to get used to the wand.</li>
            <li> Great for short sparse lashes. Easy removal. No flaking or smearing. Made my lashes exist. Lol</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Lengths Mascara is now my all-time favorite.  I use several different mascaras, and thought Cover Girl&#x27;s Clump Crusher was on top until I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Butterfly Mascara this week.  It lengthens and highlights your eyelashes so well that several people asked me if I&#x27;d gotten extensions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butterfly&#x27;s strength lies in its special wand, which is perfectly shaped to the human eye.  Every lash curls into its natural shape - only darkened to its maximum so that you appear to have incredibly long eyelashes.  I bought the brown/black color, and will be adding the Blackest Black to my cosmetic collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive eyes and skin, and experienced no burning or stinging with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t flake off or smear.  The price is very reasonable and you won&#x27;t find a higher-quality mascara, or experience better results, with the expensive department-store brands.  L&#x27;Oreal shows why they&#x27;re a top beauty brand with this fabulous mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars.</li>
            <li> Really glad that I decided to give this new mascara a try after seeing the commercial on TV. The part that really grabbed my attention and drew my interest was the unique shape of the mascara wand. The Butterfly Brush is completely different from any other mascara that I have tried, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all in my ever growing search to find that perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with an asymmetrical lash line shape, which does have a small learning curve. While I was completely prepared to be let down with my purchase, I found that once I got the hang of it, it did help me to get a winged out look as advertised. The best part about it? NO CLUMPS! While it is a very wet mascara when applied, I did have to be very careful not to move or blink my eyes until it had dried completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used two coats and found that it gave me a nice amount of added length and thickness to my lashes and had some great staying power. This is definitely going to be in regular rotation in my makeup arsenal!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! it is by far my favorite. makes my eyelashes thicker and darker and voluminous at the same time. I don&#x27;t know how L&#x27;Oreal did it but they did! they found the perfect formula!</li>
            <li> best mascara i ever used</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and looks great - for a few hours.  It flakes - A LOT.  By lunch time it&#x27;s mostly gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every mascara on the market. I have thin straight short lashes that don&#x27;t hold a curl long with most mascaras. I am so happy I tried loreal voluminous butterfly mascara!! It not only holds my curl but also makes my lashes appear longer and more volumized. I highly recommend every woman to try it. I&#x27;m going to throw away all my other mascaras. This one is all I need. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this mascara. I have been searching for others to experiment with lately, but honestly none compare. This is certainly my all time favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Makes lashes look so full and beautiful, goes on smoothly and stays on until you take it off. The brush is a bit awkward to use on the left eye, but thats only cause im not good at applying with my left hand so i stick with my right. Even with that, once its on its beyond amazing and i am just in love with it. Makes your whole look come together beautifully.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT DO WHAT IT STATES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a month now and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volumnious Butterfly Mascara comes with a nice plastic applicator.  It&#x27;s less &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; and more like a soft comb.  I find that it evenly applies the mascara to my lashes, but with the shape of the brush, I must flip the wand around to apply mascara to my left eye.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal because it&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve always applied mascara--even with the old-style of brush.  This one is obviously contoured to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t get from this is the &amp;#34;butterfly-effect&amp;#34; .  Although, now that I&#x27;m taking a closer look at my eyes, I think this mascara is giving me what I already had...longer lashes in the outer corners of my eyes.  Maybe with a few more coats I&#x27;d get a more dramatic effect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do get is a great black mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice mascara that I&#x27;d use again.</li>
            <li> Appreciate the extended brush area for the outside of the lashes. Color really sticks without globbing. Good brush for the money.</li>
            <li> This mascara ruuules. I&#x27;ve used mine up &#x27;til the bitter end and will most definitely be purchasing another. For work, when I&#x27;m crunched for time and meticulousness, I slap this stuff onto the outer half of my lashes, concentrating on the outer corners. Comes off like a dream. SEXXXXXYYYYY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And is the price RIGHT, or what?!?!?!</li>
            <li> Always order this. Great.</li>
            <li> beautiful product and came quickly.  not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra price - don&#x27;t notice anything very different than my typical mascara, though.</li>
            <li> The only reason I do not like it because it has banding brush.</li>
            <li> My lashes look awesome with this stuff!  But, I love L&#x27;Oreal mascaras.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far. It makes my lashes stand out but not in a way that makes my lashes look like spider legs. One complaint... It has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I really wanted to dislike it.  The brush is angled at one end to &amp;#34;flare out&amp;#34; the lashes, but it only works that way on one eye (the right eye for right handed users) and requires holding the wand at an awkward angle to do the other eye.  But the formula actually does a great job of building up lush, long lashes.  I am undecided on whether or not I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the brush for this mascara. I&#x27;m a traditional brush kind of gal. But I was wrong! This brush works great for getting to the inner and outside corners of your lashes. I twirl the brush from the base of my lashes to the tips and the brush does a great job of coating and separating my lashes. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a L&#x27;Oreal Paris mascara that I like. All the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past are really dry. This one didn&#x27;t start out too dry but after only a few uses I have noticed it drying and flaking. It also clumps a lot on me. I have thin eyelashes but I don&#x27;t generally mess with more than one good solid coat. I try a few swipes to coat evenly but after a few, I noticed clumping and sticking even though this is a &amp;#34;defined&amp;#34; brush wand. I have had great experiences with Rimmel mascaras and never had them flake on me. This one flaked enough that it would get in my eyes and make them irritated and red.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara except that it does not take long for it to start clumping. I have used</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I have short, stubby and patchy eyelashes due to trichtolomania. This stuff really works and makes my eyelashes look way fuller with no clumps. It also lengthens my lashes substantially and separates them so they look full and lucious.</li>
            <li> I use this under the Million Lashes mascara by L&#x27;Oreal. By using it as a base, and learning to keep curling/rotating the wand all the way through the lash to the tips, it&#x27;s awesome! I have been asked if I have fake lashes on because it looks so good. I highly recommend this as a base coat!</li>
            <li> Perfect, fantastic, I finally found a good mascara. Sticking with this 1 for now. Makes my lashes double in sizes :) I am happy.</li>
            <li> teen daughter says its great for those corner lashes and goes on very well does not leave clumps,makes her lashes look really long</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! I am VERY picky about mascara and this one is PERFECT! The brush is great for separating lashes... Especially those bottom ones! I haven&#x27;t been able to use anything else since this came out! L&#x27;oreal did a great job with this mascara!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it says it will, plus it&#x27;s a carbon-black, so the color really makes your eyes standout.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in sample beauty box from Target.  The mascara looks great when you first put it on but after that it fails in my opinion.  The brush is awkward to use, the product smells and the mascara flakes off during the day.  Then I went to removed my makeup at the end of the day there wasn&#x27;t any mascara left on my eye lashes, it was in flakes under my eyes.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> I love it. Make your eye lashes very long.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Mascara was a little dryer than usual, making me think it might be a touch old. But mostly ok.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Fav everyday mascara!</li>
            <li> I love it.  My only slight complaint is I don&#x27;t particularly care for the brush on the wand.  But a very minor complaint.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I wear glasses and have long lashes, most mascaras flake when I blink, this one does not. The only con is that it seems to dry out rather quickly. I usually have to put in a few drops of contact solution before it runs out just to loosen it up a bit. I love the brush. Coats every lash, no clumping.</li>
            <li> Gives me a ton of length with out any clumping.  I love this mascara and get tons of compliments.  Even my husband noticed something was different the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara! Looks like I have false lashes when I wear this. So dramatic and gorgeous</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little wet when you first use it, like really wet and plentiful, so be careful applying it the first 5 times</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the brush and the super thin mascara that make this stuff rock! The brush is magic and the mascara is not cakey or goopy at all... Very thin formula and super easy to disperse evenly</li>
            <li> Love it. My new favorite mascara. Really makes my eyelashes thicker &amp; longer. This is so much better than the Chanel mascara that I was buying &amp; so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on well.  It does an okay job for a senior.  I did not expect sweeping lashes at this age.</li>
            <li> Does the job day after day - a quality product that lasts a long time</li>
            <li> The wand is great, definitely fans out your lashes. The formula is too dry for me and looks clumpy and flakey on my lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome! I love how long my eyelashes are once I apply this mascara!</li>
    </ol>
