            <li> Although it&#x27;s getting more difficult to find in most big department stores such as Macy&#x27;s, Lord &amp; Taylor.</li>
            <li> Not expensive, not strong</li>
            <li> Made a complaint, but they didnt seem interested to try to help..</li>
            <li> It ends with notes of mellow, man-made wood and dark amber but again, with an artificiality that really takes away what could be a \\&quot;nice\\&quot;, if rather pedestrian but adequate scent that doesn&#x27;t stand out or set itself apart from the rest of the green aromatic genre except for it&#x27;s distinct scent of a fake and man-made chemical mess.</li>
            <li> When I told them they gave me a strange look because they never heard of it.</li>
            <li> My little secret, never fails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to throw my money away to try again though.</li>
            <li> Opening notes of this green aromatic fragrance are a combination of somewhat \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; like lavender mixed with an herbal, green leaf type of component.</li>
            <li> almost as if it were watered down.</li>
            <li> I found it for less money at T J Maxx after christmas....</li>
            <li> At $12 and some change, plus a few bucks for shipping, the price can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not strong but two sprays does the trick.</li>
            <li> what ruins it is an artificial, almost chemical influence to the mid and bottom notes.</li>
            <li> Amazon wants longer reviews, and that is annoying.</li>
            <li> Their customer service was not good at all</li>
            <li> At least there haven&#x27;t been any complaints!</li>
            <li> Maybe i got a bad batch or bottle.</li>
            <li> This was very inconvenient and they did not seem to care at all.</li>
            <li> He was shocked that I found it &amp; got it for him!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Product arrived promptly and items were in great condition! Thanks for a great price and fast shipping! Will definately be back for more in the future. Two thumbs way up!</li>
            <li> The product was ok.  I ordered it for my boyfriend for his birthday. When I placed the order, I ordered it ahead of tine it was supposed to be delivered by his birthday but did not receive it. I received it the next day only after I contacted the company Daily Deal Perfume.  This was very inconvenient and they did not seem to care at all. Their customer service was not good at all and I will not be ordering from them again or from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> Sexiest scent ever for a man. Love it so much. Every man should own and use it. A Must-Have item for all men :)</li>
            <li> I smell so pretty. Thank you!</li>
            <li> We were very discouraged thinking that this Claiborne Sport was not available anymore.  My husband has worn it for years!  I was delighted to find it on Amazon!  I have an automatic birthday gift for my hubby for years to come!  It&#x27;s a gift for me too as I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for years trying to fing this specific cologne for my husband (his all time favorite) with no luck. I started looking online for this &amp; was so happy to finally be able to get it for him at such a great price! He was shocked that I found it &amp; got it for him! It was a great Valentines Day gift for him! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very clean fresh scent! This is the only cologne my husband wears.  The scent is not strong but two sprays does the trick.</li>
            <li> I found it for less money at T J Maxx after christmas.... oh well you win some you lose some.....</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son it is the  only type of Cologne Spray he uses and was very happy to get it. I have not been able to find it in stores for some time. Yes I would recommend it. The only problem I had was the e-mail said it would be deliveried on a certain date by 8 pm and another e-mail said it would be delivered between the 6th and 11th of December it came on the 11th.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, it is a secret scent from the 90&#x27;s that still smells youthful and great. The ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I smell better when I use it.  Not expensive, not strong and I am told very pleasant. Amazon wants longer reviews, and that is annoying.</li>
            <li> Great Cologne, nice soft smell that is not too over powering.  Of course each cologne smells different on each person.  He was using Paris Hilton, but it was too over powering on him, however smells great on my son, But this Claiborne Sport is perfect on my husband,  He smells fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> I recieve this for my birthday and I looked it.  It has a great smell and lasted all day and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and have used dozens of brands of men&#x27;s cologne.  Claiborne Sport is without a doubt the sorriest I have ever tried.  It has essentially no scent while I put it on let alone any staying power.  It is the color of water and that&#x27;s what it smells like.  I would have sent it back but I decided to give it some time in case I just needed to adjust to it.  After more than a week of using it, nothing has changed.  The only reason I gave it a 2 star rating is because the packaging and shipping were as advertised.  I definitely would not recommend this product to a friend.  The purchase price is cheap and so is the quality.</li>
            <li> My little secret, never fails</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite cologne of all time. I&#x27;ve had so many past girl friends who absolutely loved the way It smells. Several even claimed that it put them in the mood. It&#x27;s the perfect combination of subtle yet powerful. The kind of Cologne that you have to get a girl in a little close before they notice it but once they do they can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I LOVE this and we haven&#x27;t been able to find it in store for years. So glad it&#x27;s back!!</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and well packaged. It smells so good. Highly recommendable. I will surely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> love the price the size and great smell very sporty .. im very happy for this purches my husband approved it!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  And everyone else around me seems to like it also.  At least there haven&#x27;t been any complaints!</li>
            <li> When I wear this, most people ask me what it is and complement me. What more can I say? its great</li>
            <li> I love this calogne, been using it since I was 16.  Women always ask me what am I wearing and complement me on the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing bf loves the scent alot great product highly reccomend...made my bf smell sexy haha:))))))))))))&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend as a gift</li>
            <li> A great cologne but its not sold in stores I love it will have a bottle always to keep in my house</li>
            <li> Thought I would never see this cologne again.  Ive been wearing it for year and people have always complimented it.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This was discontinued and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. It is just as I remember, smells great. I always get compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this fragrance. Very sweet and light. Been great for summer. And it was a great price and got here quick.</li>
            <li> The product was as described and arrived in a timely manner. My husband was very pleased with his Christmas present seeing as how I accidentally broke the last one lol. Nice product good price.</li>
            <li> It came just as it was described.  My husband loved it and so did I.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.  My husband has been wearing this for years.  It&#x27;s a light buy masculine fragrance.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Opening notes of this green aromatic fragrance are a combination of somewhat \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; like lavender mixed with an herbal, green leaf type of component. Then it starts going downhill with mid-notes of a woody/ginger type but to me what ruins it is an artificial, almost chemical influence to the mid and bottom notes. It ends with notes of mellow, man-made wood and dark amber but again, with an artificiality that really takes away what could be a \\&quot;nice\\&quot;, if rather pedestrian but adequate scent that doesn&#x27;t stand out or set itself apart from the rest of the green aromatic genre except for it&#x27;s distinct scent of a fake and man-made chemical mess.</li>
            <li> The Claiborne Sport by Liz Claiborne was an excellent purchase.  I love the scent and so do the girls at work.  :-)</li>
            <li> it never too strong and i get plenty of compliments. im sticking with this one. ive ordered a second bottle!</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance and non-allergenic.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on my skin or clothes. ... almost as if it were watered down. It does smell great bit it simply doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m used to. Maybe i got a bad batch or bottle. I&#x27;m not willing to throw my money away to try again though.</li>
            <li> Have yet to receive this package fromm this vendor. Made a complaint, but they didnt seem interested to try to help..</li>
            <li> It is a really good perfume, and it stays in your skin no matter if you get wind of rain.</li>
            <li> PACKAGE WAS LEGIT AND PROPERLY SHIPPED!!!this is the best anytime cologne ever and leaves a lasting scent all day. Great buy and good price..</li>
            <li> Alright Clairborne Sport is among one of my favorite colognes. Although it&#x27;s getting more difficult to find in most big department stores such as Macy&#x27;s, Lord &amp; Taylor. It is definitely a head turner from my experience. I&#x27;ve had professors, and students in my classes ask me the name of the brand of cologne I was wearing. When I told them they gave me a strange look because they never heard of it. They were only familiar with big names in cologne market such as Armani, Cool Water, 212, Curve, Polo !!</li>
            <li> The cologne was diluted with water.  I would say 3/4s of the bottle was water and only 1/4 was cologne.  Seems like its a good way to rip people off.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite cologne ever.  It&#x27;s powerful yet soft, and lasts all day!  At $12 and some change, plus a few bucks for shipping, the price can&#x27;t be beat.  Shipping was quite quick and I&#x27;m very pleased with the entire experience.</li>
            <li> At last he found his favorite perfume&lt;br /&gt;Good service</li>
