            <li>got it for my sister and friends who work in retail and they love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered another recently cause my coworker loved it too!</li>
            <li>Although the quality is great it would be better if the proportions were different.</li>
            <li>It holds coloring books and crayons easily.  </li>
            <li>This bag has worked out just fine.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for so many reasons!</li>
            <li>But, this bag makes my life so much easier!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful for going thru scanners</li>
            <li>It is very durable and the straps are very strong.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a clear bag for work and liked the design of this one.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, clear bag for those of us who need these for work.  </li>
            <li>so i had it too full and one of the straps ripped out from the bag.</li>
            <li>Even if I didn&#x27;t need it for work I still might want to carry it as it is super resistant and fully waterproof.</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>I need to organize my equipment and have quick access to them.</li>
            <li>The material is good and is not made of some cheap plastic like other ones.</li>
            <li>Strong, large, lots of space and compartments to organize.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good sized tote (bigger than I needed)</li>
            <li>its great for lightweight stuff but don&#x27;t put heavy stuff in it.  </li>
            <li>It was worth it for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very big, you can fit a lot of things in it which I love</li>
            <li>Well worth my money.</li>
            <li>Yes I love the bag, but was one of the power cords was suppose to be for a Iphone 5 and both were for a Iphone 4S other than that everything was ok</li>
            <li>Now that we have to go to sporting events with clear bags only, this is a good bag for the price.</li>
            <li>I use this bag daily for work, it is a durable and convenient lunch bag that I love.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for work... fits all my stuff...</li>
            <li>I love the outside pocket.  </li>
            <li>I work in a prison and we have to open our bags for inspection to make sure we don&#x27;t bring in any contraband.</li>
            <li>The plastic material was great, as one day I was in the grandstand in a sudden downpour rainstorm and nothing inside the bag got wet even though it was out in the rain, unprotected.  </li>
            <li>A correctional nurse has a lot to carry ant this bag even has an outside pocket to easily access my pens.</li>
            <li>I like the two different sized handles for easy carrying.</li>
            <li>Very rugged piece.</li>
            <li>FAST THANKS</li>
            <li>It is very well made...</li>
            <li>deaf better then expected .</li>
            <li>I really like the shoulder strap.</li>
            <li>The zipper is very durable.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t Buy&lt;br /&gt;Bag should have been checked before leaving the factory.&lt;br /&gt;I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>We have had it a year, and it has been very durable.  </li>
            <li>, it is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>i really work out a bag</li>
            <li>I love the zippered top, small zippered bag accessed from the front, and the multiple straps.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended for someone who works at high security companies!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bag for anyone who carries a tote bag that needs to be checked for contents.</li>
            <li>This bag has done the job so far very well.</li>
            <li>I work in the airport and our company wants us to use clear bags to pass security with no hassle and managers and supervisors can see thru our bags without even searching what&#x27;s inside.</li>
            <li>It is a softer version of the cheaper clear bags, and it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because it smells pretty strong even after a few weeks using it,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a clear bag for work.</li>
            <li>Got this bag for my daughter to satisfy the clear book bag requirement.  </li>
            <li>We needed this bag to enter a facility that required clear see through bags.</li>
            <li>I bought this bag because at my job they want us to have a clear</li>
            <li>So far has held up ( x 1 month).  </li>
            <li>I like that it has extra straps and soo much room.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li>Th e only con about this bag, is the small pocket, it could have been bigger, or there could have been more of them.</li>
            <li>good size (not too big, not too small), heavy plastic.</li>
            <li>I work at correctional facility and I can only carry clear bags</li>
            <li>While other people were standing in line in for bag inspection in 90+ degree heat, I breezed through without having my bag opened by any inspectors, since they could see from the outside exactly what it contained.  </li>
            <li>We use it about every other month for three days straight.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bigger than I imagined , but I got right through the bag check at met life stadium.</li>

            <li> Yes I love the bag, but was one of the power cords was suppose to be for a Iphone 5 and both were for a Iphone 4S other than that everything was ok</li>
            <li> I wonderful bag to take to work and placed it on top of my desk with all my goodies to eat and drink.  No temptation with it from passer-by&#x27;s who would want to steal it.</li>
            <li> good size (not too big, not too small), heavy plastic. I like the two different sized handles for easy carrying.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel or anything you want. Used this on a trip and didn&#x27;t have to pull everything out to find what I wanted. Super product.</li>
            <li> I teach within a prison unit and all of my material must be in a see thru tote.  This works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bag for anyone who carries a tote bag that needs to be checked for contents. This year I attended the 150th Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg with thousands of other people - all bags needed to be inspected - and so I bought this clear tote bag for the event.  While other people were standing in line in for bag inspection in 90+ degree heat, I breezed through without having my bag opened by any inspectors, since they could see from the outside exactly what it contained.  The shoulder-length as well as short handles were welcomed features. The plastic material was great, as one day I was in the grandstand in a sudden downpour rainstorm and nothing inside the bag got wet even though it was out in the rain, unprotected.  Since I carried many things for each full day on the battleground, the large size of this bag was perfect.  Highly recommended for so many reasons!</li>
            <li> This bag will be used for work. I needed a clear bag for work. I recommended the bag to my co-workers.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a clear bag for work and liked the design of this one.  It is a pretty good sized tote (bigger than I needed) but I love the options on the straps.  I also like the zipper pocket on the outside of the bag, it fits my phone perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great bag, well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This bag has worked out just fine.  I need it for work and I am able to put lots of stuff including my lunch in the bag and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Buy&lt;br /&gt;Bag should have been checked before leaving the factory.&lt;br /&gt;I was very dissapointed. Too small. I will be returning!!!</li>
            <li> It was worth it for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this bag to carry to work at a correctional facility.  It fits perfectly across my body and holds my belongings well.  Would recommend for those who don&#x27;t want to carry everything in your hand or in your arm,  although there are shorter straps for that option.</li>
            <li> Got this bag for my daughter to satisfy the clear book bag requirement.  So far has held up ( x 1 month).  She likes the addition of the shoulder strap that most others did not have.</li>
            <li> We needed this bag to enter a facility that required clear see through bags. We have had it a year, and it has been very durable.  Although, we don&#x27;t use it everyday.  We use it about every other month for three days straight.  I like the pockets this bag provides.  It holds coloring books and crayons easily.  I liked that it had a zipper on it.  And all the different straps.</li>
            <li> Good material. Well made. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great tote. Strong, large, lots of space and compartments to organize. I use it for work. I need to organize my equipment and have quick access to them. This is great. Great quality!</li>
            <li> I have a prison ministry and use this bag to carry my bible, note book and pens into the prison.  It keeps things from falling into the scanner and the guards can see everything without having to open it up; which saves them time and me too!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. ;Good design and thicker plastic than I thought.</li>
            <li> My wife got this and didn&#x27;t like it once she got it.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure why.  Nothing against the product so I can&#x27;t trash it.  We returned it for another one and she&#x27;s thrilled with it.  This vendor is really great and accommodating.  They will help with returns, replacements, etc.  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> I bought this bag because at my job they want us to have a clear bag.&lt;br /&gt;It is very big, you can fit a lot of things in it which I love, it is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because it smells pretty strong even after a few weeks using it,&lt;br /&gt;hopefully it will fade soon</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than I imagined , but I got right through the bag check at met life stadium.</li>
            <li> I use it for work. It&#x27;s durable and easy to clean. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This bag is larger than I thought. Not the best size for me &amp; what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I love this bag!I work 12-18hrs shifts at least 3× a week.Therefore I pack my bag with EVERYTHING, from make-up, waters, clothes, etc It is very durable and the straps are very strong.Well worth my money. Plus it has a side pouch for makeup or whatever you don&#x27;t want to have to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; for.I give it 5stars all day😍😍😍😍</li>
            <li> I really love this bag.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, clear bag for those of us who need these for work.  I love the outside pocket.  It is a softer version of the cheaper clear bags, and it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my bag. I like that it has extra straps and soo much room. I will be a returned customer. :-)</li>
            <li> This bag has done the job so far very well.</li>
            <li> its great for lightweight stuff but don&#x27;t put heavy stuff in it.  i really work out a bag so i had it too full and one of the straps ripped out from the bag.</li>
            <li> I work in a prison and we have to open our bags for inspection to make sure we don&#x27;t bring in any contraband. All I do is pick up the bag and show the officer as I walk by them. They love it too. So far it&#x27;s holding up well. I live in up-state NY and we have some very cold days in winter. This bag stays in the car except when I bring it in to work. So it endures extreme temperatures.</li>
            <li> I work in the airport and our company wants us to use clear bags to pass security with no hassle and managers and supervisors can see thru our bags without even searching what&#x27;s inside. I ordered one before and it was great! The bag was big enough to accomodate all my belongings including my wool peacoats. The material is good and is not made of some cheap plastic like other ones. I ordered another recently cause my coworker loved it too! Highly recomended for someone who works at high security companies!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT...Need it to carry all my allergy products...need to be able to see them when an emergency arises.I LOVE IT...justy got it about an hour ago.AND I LOVE AMAZON!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am not allowed to take a briefcase to work but needed a way to keep folders with me, travelling from site to site. This sturdy bag is great!  I love the zippered top, small zippered bag accessed from the front, and the multiple straps.</li>
            <li> Very useful for going thru scanners</li>
            <li> This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> got it for my sister and friends who work in retail and they love it.</li>
