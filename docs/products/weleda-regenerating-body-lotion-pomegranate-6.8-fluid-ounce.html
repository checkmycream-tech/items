            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I love this body/hand lotion</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love Weleda&#x27;s body lotion.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s light, but effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this lotion 4 stars because I don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the way</li>
            <li>I purchased the pomegranate \\&quot;oil\\&quot; with the lotion and the oil smells OK.</li>
            <li>I love Weleda Pomegranate line.</li>
            <li>I have the body oil and the shower gel, and when I saw the lotion came out, I was very excited.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice rich feel to it, without being greasy.</li>
            <li>This one kind of smells like sweet Pez candy.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and feels great on dry skin.</li>
            <li>A true pleasure!</li>
            <li>To be honest, the three Weleda body lotion scents I&#x27;ve tried are unusual.</li>
            <li>IT is great, lasts long.</li>
            <li>This lotion really wins the prize!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of similar to the citrus scent, but I like the citrus one better.</li>
            <li>great as expected from weleda</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fragrance and short shelf life, but it works fairly well and like the idea that it&#x27;s ingredients are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The texture is semi-thick, it moisturizes really well, and I just love the packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even OK with the unusual pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good lotion -- the perfect thickness, easy to spread, moisturizing, and non-irritating (even to my sensitive skin, even after cutting myself while shaving my legs).  </li>
            <li>This lotion is not only great as a body moisturizer, it works great for dry, rough hands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>thighs actually appeared more taut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of most of the Weleda products I&#x27;ve tried to date, especially their pomegranate products and this lotion</li>
            <li>This is my first Weleda product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, and I&#x27;ll certainly finish the bottle, but I will probably choose a different fragrance if I purchase this again.</li>
            <li>Does a pomegranate really smell like this?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for as much</li>
            <li>I surprised my wife with this lotion, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>(For what it&#x27;s worth, the ingredients list on the product page is cut off -- the last word there should be &amp;#34;coumarin,&amp;#34; and this also contains</li>
            <li>Perfect lotion for cold days!</li>
            <li>My skin stays soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night before going to bed leaves your skin soft</li>
            <li>This is a fine moisturizer but not sure I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I am 53, over-weight &amp; my skin has really started  showning the negative effects of all those MANY years spent sun bathing &amp; using tanning beds.</li>
            <li>is definitely one of my new favs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all what I expected -- it really smells like something with a synthetic polymer in it, even though there aren&#x27;t any ingredients like that on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s strange, because this product only contains natural ingredients, but it smells like glue or paste or paint to me.  </li>

            <li> I am 53, over-weight &amp; my skin has really started  showning the negative effects of all those MANY years spent sun bathing &amp; using tanning beds. Okay. Got a visual on all that?&lt;br /&gt;My friend gave me a bottle of Weleda&#x27;s Regenerating Pomegranate lotion for Christmas. I don&#x27;t think I have EVER IN MY LIFE used a product that I TRULY saw the benefits of until using this product. Honestly- within a week or so the skin on my upper/front (?) thighs actually appeared more taut. The skin problems I have ALWAYS had there- went away. It was like magic!! I told my friend that I finally felt like I had &amp;#34;real girl&amp;#34; skin! This stuff actually WORKS!!! It does for my skin anyway.</li>
            <li> great as expected from weleda</li>
            <li> I love this body/hand lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion is not only great as a body moisturizer, it works great for dry, rough hands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice rich feel to it, without being greasy.

            <li> IT is great, lasts long. Practical presentation which lets you use 100% of the product without waste. I love it</li>
            <li> I love Weleda&#x27;s body lotion. I think the formula works well -- it&#x27;s light, but effective. I&#x27;m giving this lotion 4 stars because I don&#x27;t love the scent. It&#x27;s kind of similar to the citrus scent, but I like the citrus one better. This one kind of smells like sweet Pez candy. To be honest, the three Weleda body lotion scents I&#x27;ve tried are unusual. My favorite one is the rose, but others find it very strong.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! It thoroughly moisturizes my skin without a greasy feeling afterward.  And the scent is beautiful without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is a fine moisturizer but not sure I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of my top favorites! It smells amazing and feels great on dry skin. I love Weleda products because they are made with good quality ingredients &amp; always work well for the skin &amp; soul! Enjoy-You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. My skin stays soft and hydrated all day. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion really wins the prize! The smell is tantalizing and the product really really transforms your roughest parts into smooth, supple skin no matter how cold and dry it is outside. The best thing is that it&#x27;s not greasy - it&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture without being thick or hard to rub in. A true pleasure!</li>
            <li> I love the way Weleda&#x27;s products work and I really wanted to love this lotion, but the smell is quite awful.  Does a pomegranate really smell like this?  I purchased the pomegranate \\&quot;oil\\&quot; with the lotion and the oil smells OK.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because of it&#x27;s fragrance and short shelf life, but it works fairly well and like the idea that it&#x27;s ingredients are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. It should be used up in a month or two. Texture got sticky after a few months.</li>
            <li> I Loved it will buy again, see a difference in my skin more toned. I put it on at night before going to bed leaves your skin soft it absorbs quickly.</li>

            <li> This product is great. I find that almost all Weleda&#x27;s products are five star.</li>
