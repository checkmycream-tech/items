            <li> I love this toner. This one has a very light rose scent and makes my skin feel nice. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and will probably save the rest until my other toner runs out. I used this several times after washing my face and this made my skin feel extremely soft. I definitely like that this comes with a spray applicator and makes it easier to apply evenly to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> You put a little on and it smelled sooooo good.  Then you doused yourself in it because if a little smells good, then a lot should smell even better.  But a lot smelled bad.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this rose water.  You can mist yourself all over and it just smells like roses.  Real natural roses.  Not chemicals blended to smell like roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the cosmetic or medicinal claims.  I just love using it as a mister.  It has a quality pump that gives you an even, fine mist without splatters.  There is no oil or alcohol.  Just refreshing rose water.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I adore the smell of this toner. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth but really the smell it&#x27;s what I love the most about it</li>
            <li> I love Rose Water as a toner and was so pleased to receive Amaki&#x27;s rose water. The spray bottle truly spritzes so that the mist is fine, which makes it perfect for toner and skin refresher. I got a facial the other day and a fine, rose water mist, is exactly what they used as a toner in-between products. I have combination skin and the rose water works perfectly as a toner for pores and residue removal, oil balance and skin refresher. As a toner, I spritz it on my face and follow with a clean, cotton pad. As a mid-day or after work makeup and face refresher, I hold the bottle a bit further away and lightly mist my skin to achieve a refreshed, dewy skin look without smudging makeup. The clean, natural rose sent is excellent as a body spray, especially for those allergic to heavy perfumes and with sensitive skin. I like to spray the beautiful scent on my sheets and pillows, especially before company uses the guest room. The absence of artificial or chemical ingredients means the water smells of fresh roses, not cloying or fake. Love this stuff! *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
            <li> Works quite well. I have dry hands due to my job &amp; I saw a great improvement while using the rose water.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely smell and it is very hydrating. However, I think this product is best used by someone with dry skin. I have combination skin and so using the product made my skin feel more oily and I broke out a little. I just don&#x27;t think my skin needs the amazing hydration this product provides. I do like the smell and that it can be used as a mist. If you have very dry skin in need of frequent hydration, you will like this product!</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle and it is quite refreshing, especially on hot days.</li>
            <li> I love rose water toner. It works with my face really well.</li>
            <li> Great toner!  It smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling fresh and Dewey.</li>
            <li> This rose water smells soooooooo good, it&#x27;s light and not too strong. I have combination skin. When my skin feels dry, I use this rose water and my skin feels hydrated and refresh immediately. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this tones is simply amazing. I use it in the morning right after applying my moisturizer. it feel great and smells just like roses i have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all. abosolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I love the smell of rosewater and I have used toners that have this scent but this one smells almost spoiled. I will not be using this again. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Leaves my skin feeling and looking great!</li>
            <li> Smells great and my skin had never looked better. Definitely recommend using this as a toner in the morning and before bed!</li>
            <li> I had never used Rose Water before and got this at a huge discount.  So I figured I&#x27;d try it out...Well I&#x27;ll be buying this again!!  I have super sensitive skin and after the shower I spray this on - no irritation on my legs or bikini area.  I also am not a fan of perfume or of the smell of roses.  But this spray has a very light fragrant smell and was very pleasing to me. I&#x27;d recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product! I love this brand, worth the money! Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> IN TOTAL LOVE WITH THIS . Keeps make up in place and makes u feel so refreshed not to mention its smells so amazing</li>
            <li> Received just as described- would certainly reorder if needed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it amazing,  but it&#x27;s not terrible either.</li>
            <li> I love this toner, it is refreshing and smells wonderful. If you like the smell of roses, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This rose water has a wonderful aroma.  Very light when you use it on your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel at all.  Helps with toning too.</li>
            <li> I love to use rose water as part of my makeup routine. The first thing I apply to my face following a shower is rose water. I like the mist feature, it&#x27;s so much easier to spritz my face than it is to put it on a cotton ball and rub all over. I love the light rose scent and the way it makes my skin glow. I also am impressed with the generous size of this bottle. This will last me for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I have heard lots of good things about rose water before but had never taken the time to actually try it. Living in Texas, the summers are hot, and this year, very humid. I am very pleased with this product - I use it on a cotton ball for my face and neck and it is cool and refreshing, kind of like a toner, but what really surprises me is how my skin feels and looks at the end of the day - still fresh and not &#x27;greasy&#x27; (I have oily skin in the t-zone area during the summer months) so - WOW! - awesome product. It does not smell as much like a rose when you first put it on but then there is a light fragrance that dissipates pretty quickly. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like that but I actually do wish that the rose smell held on a little longer. :o)</li>
            <li> SMELLS SO GOOD I USE THIS ON MY LINENS AND EVERY WHERE ON MY BODY AFTER BATHING</li>
            <li> Easy to spray, smells wonderful, refreshing...What is to not like? You can also spray it in your hair to contain moisture.</li>
            <li> Easy spray bottle for convenience  - rose water is super natural and ultra hydrating!!</li>
            <li> Feels fresh and refreshing!</li>
