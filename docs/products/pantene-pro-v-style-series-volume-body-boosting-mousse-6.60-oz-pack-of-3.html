            <li>A great product for super fine hair!</li>
            <li>I have tried 15+ products, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>it was some sort of name brand like paul mitchelle and honestly this mousse is better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so I was looking for a product that would give my hair some body without making it crusty or oily.  </li>

            <li>Great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many salon products and paid much more than what this product cost</li>
            <li>I love all the Pantene products, they are inexpensive and they work.</li>
            <li>At the store I smelled it, and was pleased.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a brush able hold.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I sure wish I knew what the ingredient is</li>
            <li>I would recommend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I find that my hair becomes more oily faster when I use mousse with oil it it.</li>
            <li>This mousse does not make my hair more oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I love pantene, but this product was not for me.</li>
            <li>so I bought more.  </li>
            <li>most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve gotten as many compliments on how my hair smells with this as I have on my cologne.</li>
            <li>I would rub my hands over it to make it look more life-like.</li>
            <li>It worked, but it did not look good for the first hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not aure about air-drying hair, or using this mousse on dry hair, but it worked great the way I described!</li>
            <li>Its healthy for your hair and holds your hair just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works a lot better for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I surprised the smell was great.</li>
            <li>So i have curly hair and have looked my whole life for products that would make my curls look good.  </li>
            <li>Some bottles flow easily and some are stuck and product is had to dispense.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...</li>
            <li>Even better, my hair stays soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>They all work fine.</li>
            <li>I did not realize until after I received it that it was for \\&quot;fine hair\\&quot; which I do not have.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>The mouse works fine if you can get it out of the container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for quite awhile - my hair is fine and this seems to help.  </li>
            <li>Outside of being a great styling mousse, the product also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>i have light hair and it helps make my hair look thicker</li>
            <li>Best of all it isn&#x27;t crusty and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>I was only moderately happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did, I can see why it had such good</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free which I love first of all.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair, a curse</li>
            <li>LOL I have never really found anything that helps.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>Pantene never lets me down and it&#x27;s great at taming my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure their next incarnation of this styler will be fine, as well.</li>
            <li>Definately well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but this one is not really that good.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because of the price (that old maxim \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Good product, Attracts mosquitos due to fragrance.</li>
            <li>This mousse holds my super fine hair in place all day and into the next.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed how my hairstyle actually kept its shape and body throughout the entire day in dry or damp weather (though it flattens out if it gets rained on), and even when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Volume with no hard texture!!</li>
            <li>Usually it takes a gallon of hairspray or whatever product I&#x27;m using to get a good hold that won&#x27;t topple in the slightest breeze.</li>
            <li>have tried this mousse and was interested in it because it does not contain any form of oil like many other mousse products do.</li>
            <li>I goes into the strands of hair very well when some of them sit there and have to be combed in.  </li>
            <li>Best of all there is no flaking from the product and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel or look dirty after applying it.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li>Reasonably price, so I would buy again.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the fragrance</li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much because of the price.</li>
            <li>it doesnt make my hair crunchy, hold my curls for the whole day and doesnt flake.  </li>
            <li>really helps give my hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam out very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many from low to high price and so far this one is working for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair more volume and a little bit of hold.</li>
            <li>I have fine color treated hair, and NOT partial to putting anything on my hair especially a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>At first I think I might have been using too much because my hair was looking oily by mid day.</li>
            <li>It worked better but still felt heavy.</li>
            <li>Even a brand new can</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair and was amazed that not only did it give me more volume, but it held its shape for several days .</li>
            <li>I put the plastic nozzle under running hot water for several seconds and then tried the nozzle again and Viola!</li>
            <li>This does what it claims but I need  a volumizer that provides volume without stickiness and maintains my natural looking hair.</li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair above the shoulder and this thing helps to get the exact volume that I wanted; which is not easy because I have super straight hair, but this product does wonders.</li>
            <li>Holds as well as other more expensive brands that I have used and smells better.  </li>
            <li>it also looks decent the second day.  </li>
            <li>A little sticky but not bad</li>
            <li>I have thin, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a mousse hair product, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands.</li>
            <li>I have fine, blonde, highlighted hair and hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>I have tamed the curls so that look much softer and not super frizzy.</li>

            <li> Need to blow dry after use or hair stays flat</li>
            <li> The next day I tried it cautiously with really no expectations at all..</li>
            <li> I think that despite efforts to put the mousse only on hair strands, it is difficult for one person to accomplish this so some of it will wind up on the scalp, which is skin (the largest human organ) and may be absorbed through the skin into the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like others with curly hair, i have spent a ton of money trying different products.  </li>
            <li> It just works for my very thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I actually dont need to put any other products in my hair, just this mousse and use a defuser</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product without curlers, but I&#x27;m guessing even if you just blow dry your hair, it&#x27;ll still give you a boost.</li>
            <li> recently i went into a beauty store and paid $16 for mousse half the size of 1 of these cans...</li>
            <li> It does the job, but left flaky residue that looked like dandruff about half of the time when I used it.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair while still wet, then blow dry upside down for a bit.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the dispenser is not consistent.</li>
            <li> It contains propane and formic acid among other chemicals.</li>
            <li> When I read the labels of other hair products I also see some of these chemicals but my other mousse products do not contain either propane or formic acid.</li>
            <li> Then blow dry with a round brush to get the style I want.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, because any mousse that I&#x27;ve previously used always made my hair feel hard and left it looking like it had product in it.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff but stiff enough.  </li>
            <li> but I cannot review it properly because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Other mousses tended to plaster my hair down, after it dried a bit</li>
            <li> , if you have fine hair I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> , i can add a little water and re-style before going out in the evening again.</li>
            <li> In a few years I will have to give up and shave it all off, but this will buy me a little time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> firm hold ...</li>
            <li> I do have to brush it off once it is dried so the hair does not feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I like this mousse because it helps give my hair body, but it is not so stiff that I can&#x27;t get a comb through it after it dries.</li>
            <li> It adds shine, is never sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> However, I used this product when my hair was damp, then dried it using a hair dryer, then set my hair in curlers, and after I took the curlers off, voila!</li>
            <li> It usually depends on the weather</li>
            <li> I usually buy one at a time - always looking for a sale.  </li>
            <li> I have really thin, limp hair, so the volume stayed for a few hours.</li>
            <li> and I was not looking to repeat a stiff, crunchy look again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it unless he is around to dispense, and it is even hard for him.  </li>
            <li> Like the product, just too hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that has a mind of</li>
            <li> (what little I have of it, as a slowly balding guy in his 40&#x27;s) would go crazy.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to dispense.  </li>
            <li> The valve is very hard to push...</li>
            <li> This mousse made my scalp itch so bad that I actually had lumps at the base of my skull from scratching so hard.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want it to smell bad, I wanted it to help hold my style through out the day, without flaking, looking stiff, and causing product buildup.</li>
            <li> Sorry Pantene</li>
            <li> bad</li>

            <li> I have very flat, short hair that is all one length and it has no body on it&#x27;s own.  I&#x27;ve used many salon products and paid much more than what this product cost but none have done the job as well as this one.  It is fragrance free which I love first of all.  I goes into the strands of hair very well when some of them sit there and have to be combed in.  It makes drying my hair and styling a breeze and does give the volume it says it will.  Best of all there is no flaking from the product and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel or look dirty after applying it.  I love all the Pantene products, they are inexpensive and they work.</li>
            <li> This is my go to mousse for daily go to work stuff, very nice and medium weight.  I do have to brush it off once it is dried so the hair does not feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I have fine color treated hair, and NOT partial to putting anything on my hair especially a drugstore brand. The last time I used mousse it was the 80&#x27;s Sebastian stuff and I was not looking to repeat a stiff, crunchy look again! My biggest worries were I didn&#x27;t want it to smell bad, I wanted it to help hold my style through out the day, without flaking, looking stiff, and causing product buildup. At the store I smelled it, and was pleased. The next day I tried it cautiously with really no expectations at all.. boy was I surprised the smell was great. Now its been a month and I use it everyday. I don&#x27;t use as much hairspray because this holds my style effortlessly without a sticky, lint attracting, stiff look. I would describe it as a brush able hold.</li>
            <li> I like this mousse because it helps give my hair body, but it is not so stiff that I can&#x27;t get a comb through it after it dries.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Good price.</li>
            <li> A very good product. Its healthy for your hair and holds your hair just fine.</li>
            <li> Very nice mousse for the price.  Holds as well as other more expensive brands that I have used and smells better.  Definately well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair and was amazed that not only did it give me more volume, but it held its shape for several days . and did not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the dispenser is not consistent. Some bottles flow easily and some are stuck and product is had to dispense.</li>
            <li> This is my second time around with this mousse.  I have very fine hair, and it does quite good on it.</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy with they way her hair felt and held together</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li> This mousse made my scalp itch so bad that I actually had lumps at the base of my skull from scratching so hard.  After a while I tried to rub my itch instead of scratching but that made no difference.  It was torture.&lt;br /&gt;It took a good 5 days after washing the product out of my hair for the itchiness to abate.  I shampooed my hair daily and it still itched like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I bought the 3 pack.  What a waste of money.  I must be allergic to an ingredient.  This has never happened to me before.  I sure wish I knew what the ingredient is so I can avoid it in the future.</li>
            <li> For the money this works just as well as the $20 stuff I have used.  I have very fine straight hair, a curse LOL I have never really found anything that helps.  Reasonably price, so I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Maximum hold???? I think NOT. This mousse didn&#x27;t hold anything but it&#x27;s content. Sorry Pantene I really liked your products but this one is not really that good.</li>
            <li> It just works for my very thin fine hair. I&#x27;ve tried many from low to high price and so far this one is working for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that has a mind of it&#x27;s own, lol. This mouse has bee awesome! I have tamed the curls so that look much softer and not super frizzy. I&#x27;ll keep this mousse in stock!</li>
            <li> Holds good.  Don&#x27;t really like the fragrance much but it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, because any mousse that I&#x27;ve previously used always made my hair feel hard and left it looking like it had product in it. However, I used this product when my hair was damp, then dried it using a hair dryer, then set my hair in curlers, and after I took the curlers off, voila! Volume with no hard texture!! I have really thin, limp hair, so the volume stayed for a few hours. I haven&#x27;t used this product without curlers, but I&#x27;m guessing even if you just blow dry your hair, it&#x27;ll still give you a boost. I&#x27;m not aure about air-drying hair, or using this mousse on dry hair, but it worked great the way I described! I would recommend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I donated my hair in March, and my shorter style needed some volume. I have tried 15+ products, and this is by far the best. Great price, great volume, and great manageability. I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> i use hair oil sometimes but this time i bought mousse and i like it .....i have light hair and it helps make my hair look thicker</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much because of the price. I love it. I recently cut my hair above the shoulder and this thing helps to get the exact volume that I wanted; which is not easy because I have super straight hair, but this product does wonders. It is awesome! I am going to buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> Pantene keeps changing the formula on their maximum hold mousse. They all work fine. It is my preferred product. Easy to use...firm hold ...great product. I&#x27;m sure their next incarnation of this styler will be fine, as well.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so I was looking for a product that would give my hair some body without making it crusty or oily.  It was suggested that I find a mousse, so I found this one at the store. I put this in my hair while still wet, then blow dry upside down for a bit. Then blow dry with a round brush to get the style I want. I was really impressed how my hairstyle actually kept its shape and body throughout the entire day in dry or damp weather (though it flattens out if it gets rained on), and even when I wake up in the morning. Best of all it isn&#x27;t crusty and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy or oily. This is my first experience with a mousse hair product, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands. But I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Good product, Attracts mosquitos due to fragrance.</li>
            <li> Keeps my curly hair in place without being sticky.  Does the job for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, and I did not find anything promised in the write up to be a miss-representation.</li>
            <li> This stuff was surprisingly good. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because of the price (that old maxim \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;...\\&quot; but I love it. I have thin, very fine hair. Usually it takes a gallon of hairspray or whatever product I&#x27;m using to get a good hold that won&#x27;t topple in the slightest breeze. Not so with this stuff. I use one brief squirt and it holds (if I don&#x27;t shower) for two days! Even better, my hair stays soft and smells good. Seriously, this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t check the ingredients in this mousse before I purchased it - I read the reviews &amp; thought I need to try this product. It contains propane and formic acid among other chemicals. When I read the labels of other hair products I also see some of these chemicals but my other mousse products do not contain either propane or formic acid. I think that despite efforts to put the mousse only on hair strands, it is difficult for one person to accomplish this so some of it will wind up on the scalp, which is skin (the largest human organ) and may be absorbed through the skin into the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received three cans of the mousse and tried to use it but nothing came out of the nozzle. I put the plastic nozzle under running hot water for several seconds and then tried the nozzle again and Viola! It works well now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this mousse and was interested in it because it does not contain any form of oil like many other mousse products do. I find that my hair becomes more oily faster when I use mousse with oil it it. This mousse does not make my hair more oily.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Good Spray. A little sticky but not bad</li>
            <li> So i have curly hair and have looked my whole life for products that would make my curls look good.  like others with curly hair, i have spent a ton of money trying different products.  recently i went into a beauty store and paid $16 for mousse half the size of 1 of these cans...it was some sort of name brand like paul mitchelle and honestly this mousse is better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mousse is great!  it doesnt make my hair crunchy, hold my curls for the whole day and doesnt flake.  it also looks decent the second day.  I actually dont need to put any other products in my hair, just this mousse and use a defuser and I am good to go.  It also smells beyond good.  i have received a ton of compliments on my hair since i started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this product, PLUS its an amazing price!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was only moderately happy with this product.  It does the job, but left flaky residue that looked like dandruff about half of the time when I used it.</li>
            <li> This does what it claims but I need  a volumizer that provides volume without stickiness and maintains my natural looking hair.</li>
            <li> I had used gel for years, since i Let my hair grow out a bit  i need a new product to leave my hair to crunchy and dried out.  I purchased this 3 pack.  I like the quality of the product on my hair.  Does not feel crunchy, holds it in place, i can add a little water and re-style before going out in the evening again. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this mousse! It gives my hair more volume and a little bit of hold. This will be the only mousse I use from now on!</li>
            <li> This is a great value.  It gives my hair the extra body it needs. No more flat hair, it really holds the style.</li>
            <li> NEEDED SOMETHING FOR MY GRAY HAIR AND I READ THE  REVIEWS, ORDERED AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH RESULTS. NOT STICKY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. At first I think I might have been using too much because my hair was looking oily by mid day. I then started just using it on my ends. It worked better but still felt heavy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I needed until I started using mousse at my mother in laws house. really helps give my hair the extra &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; i need. Smells alright too!</li>
            <li> Great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love pantene, but this product was not for me. I did not realize until after I received it that it was for \\&quot;fine hair\\&quot; which I do not have. It works fine but I cannot review it properly because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and saw the great price so I bought more.  I have fine, blonde, highlighted hair and hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Works most of the time.  It usually depends on the weather</li>
            <li> It is very hard to dispense.  The valve is very hard to push...I don&#x27;t use it unless he is around to dispense, and it is even hard for him.  Like the product, just too hard to use.</li>
            <li> This works great. I like a lot of the Pantene products.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff but stiff enough.  You have no problem coming your hair after using the proper amount.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The mouse works fine if you can get it out of the container. It doesn&#x27;t foam out very well.  Even a brand new can</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time..........it is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Outside of being a great styling mousse, the product also smells fantastic. Unlike a lot of other hair products that makes your hair smell like it&#x27;s had month old egg rubbed into it, this mousse has a fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. I think I&#x27;ve gotten as many compliments on how my hair smells with this as I have on my cologne.</li>
            <li> Pantene never lets me down and it&#x27;s great at taming my hair--I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine.  I&#x27;m probably going to stick with this mousse for a while.</li>
            <li> Needed some mousse, so I looked at the reviews and picked this. I am glad I did, I can see why it had such good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works a lot better for my fine hair. I had to use mousse or my hair (what little I have of it, as a slowly balding guy in his 40&#x27;s) would go crazy. Other mousses tended to plaster my hair down, after it dried a bit I would rub my hands over it to make it look more life-like. It worked, but it did not look good for the first hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff looks good from the start, but holds my fine hair all day. Also, my hair feels softer and thicker. In a few years I will have to give up and shave it all off, but this will buy me a little time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best mousse I have tried, if you have fine hair I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for quite awhile - my hair is fine and this seems to help.  I usually buy one at a time - always looking for a sale.  This was a good buy and nice to stock up.</li>
            <li> Need to blow dry after use or hair stays flat</li>
            <li> This mousse holds my super fine hair in place all day and into the next. It adds shine, is never sticky or stiff. A great product for super fine hair!</li>
