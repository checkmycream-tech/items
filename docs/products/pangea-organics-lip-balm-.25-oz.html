            <li>This is an awesome product and it is organic.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lip balm I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Best chapstick ever!  </li>
            <li>Pangea makes the best lip balm ever.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this stuff and have ordered extras for gifts.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>Smells great but is rather oily.  </li>
            <li>Those 2 are both great choices</li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite lip balms!!</li>
            <li>Just do not even try the rose one if you are a guy!</li>
            <li>Just do not even try the rose one if you are a guy!</li>
            <li>The   price was really good and it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>Good stuff and a good value for you dollar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good smelling, tasting, and feels amazing to apply on my lips.</li>
            <li>It is a nice balance of lip balm and flavors.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of this one is nice, not overpowering</li>
            <li>My girlfriend also thinks the rose is a bit overpowering</li>
            <li>It has nice balance</li>
            <li>My girlfriend also thinks the rose is a bit overpowering</li>
            <li>It has nice balance</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful normally, but, it arrived unusable!</li>
            <li>Flavors are delicious, lips are so soft.</li>
            <li>It smells so good (sweet orange).</li>
            <li>I have tried many lip balm&#x27;s...I always try to find organic.  </li>
            <li>Most tubes keep advancing the balm till it falls out the end.  </li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>And okay,</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is better than any lip balm I can ever remember trying.</li>
            <li>, so I love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>and I have settled on being the overall best for sharing...</li>
            <li>but I still keep the fennel/grapefruit for myself!great choices and I love them.</li>
            <li>and I have settled on being the overall best for sharing...</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this lip balm after the great reviews.</li>
            <li>The fennel taste/smell is fairly strong so I don&#x27;t use it around meal times.</li>
            <li>It is really smooth going on and stays on for a while.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and makes your lips feel like silk.</li>
            <li>I like a smooth, light balm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels perfect going on and absorbs very quickly with the scent being rather subtle after applying.</li>
            <li>In addition, it is nothing special as lip balms go.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice natural flavor as well.</li>
            <li>but I notice that the product works quickly - absorbs well - and I am hopeful that my search for the right lip treatment is over.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to try this one and also Lip Calm by John Masters Organics.  </li>
            <li>, feels great on my lips, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy caked on feel and doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you need to use it all the time like some chapsticks do.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t have as many reviews as others, but I went out on a limb because the ingredients are largely natural.</li>
            <li>For some reason they put the twist part on the top and it is directly connected to the cap you put on.</li>
            <li>I live in the gulf coast with high humidity and this lip gloss is especially useful when I travel to the drier climates in the mountains.</li>
            <li>Not this one; it stops advancing a half inch before the end of the plastic tube, so there&#x27;s no way you can easily use the rest of it unless you want to dig it out and smear it on with your finger (kind of yucky, and still doesn&#x27;t let you use it all).  </li>
            <li>Lasted a long time and the twist advanced being located at the stop is a much better idea.</li>
            <li>You get a very large tube unlike the others that are gone in a week.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this</li>
            <li>The only pro is organic, which i love.... but still.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting colder at the time I&#x27;m writing this review so out of necessity, or maybe boredom, I mass bought many different lip balm brands.</li>
            <li>I work outside most of the day and in an unheated warehouse the rest of my work day</li>
            <li>and it is probably the only of the 3 that I would say is bordering the line of too strong of a smell.</li>

            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>As for the manliest, the Fennel and Grapefruit is my pick with the lavender being light enough</li>
            <li>She loves the cardamom/lavender lip balm and thinks the other flavors are okay.</li>

            <li>Nice product, but no better than my EOS egg.</li>
            <li>It is very heavy on the rose</li>
            <li>It is very heavy on the rose</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Lip Calm is a traditional sized stick and the balm itself would melt in my pocket</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this lip gloss, especially after using Carmex for years, which seemed to seal my lips rather than actually moisturize them.</li>
            <li>This is by far the winner!</li>
            <li>Most other brands tend to last me about 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is a little bigger of a stick and for some reason feels like it moisturizes better than Lip Calm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have chapped lips that are sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not great, despite a price way in excess of what other (better) lip balms cost.</li>
            <li>I apply several times a day because its hot and dry here where I live</li>
            <li>(but she usually doesn&#x27;t enjoy flowery smells).</li>
            <li>(but she usually doesn&#x27;t enjoy flowery smells).</li>
            <li>the past I&#x27;ve tried making my own lip balms with raw cocoa butter, shea butter and even olive oil, or coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Oz said to use natural products like coconut oil that won&#x27;t dry out the lip even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> That means you&#x27;re paying a high price for something where the last 20% is wasted.  </li>
            <li> So what I can&#x27;t say is how long this lasts me between reapplying because I can&#x27;t stop putting it on over and over.</li>
            <li> Although I love Pangea products, I&#x27;m very unhappy about their lip balm mainly because you cannot get the last half inch of the lip balm out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had dry skin and my lips get so dry they itch and burn before peeling and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I can to a point relate to that, except my lips always felt almost painful to not have some moisture on them, so I&#x27;d add more layers of lip balm until it went away &amp; constantly did that.</li>
            <li> , cause mine, after applying, dry again in two hours.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last or moisturize any longer than average.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if I prefer one over the other and its longevity if I can withhold the euphoric feeling of applying this stuff to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that after a few weeks of using this product that my lips don&#x27;t feel dry or irritated anymore.</li>
            <li> Probably not worth the $$$ for me again.</li>
            <li> The all natural products of this one seemed like it would work but between this and my small jar of plain shea butter, well the shea butter works as well if not better</li>
            <li> You get a hint of the fennel flavor and a little of the citrus.</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend this product unless you like the heavy feel of wax on your lips.</li>
            <li> while back on Dr. Oz he commented on a show where people who use lip balms become addicted to them and feel as though they always need something on their lips.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my lips and all over the counter products seems to irritate my lips rather than sooth them.  </li>
            <li> Annoying enough I waited about 1 entire minute before I immediately bought the other 2 flavors of Pangea Organics lip balms.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel slick or sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes, I only bought organic brands at the pushing of my girlfriend wanting me to use products with less \\&quot;bad stuff\\&quot; in them.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is weird, not that its unacceptable thought, its just not really decent.</li>
            <li> How much do I find this annoying?</li>
            <li> So every time I open the cap, I turn the tube a bit which is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Not really good for moisturize your lips either</li>
            <li> Maybe they where stored badly or where old, stale, they smell rancid...</li>
            <li> Clumpy and thick and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says it lasts her day doesn&#x27;t involve much cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would say, in the cold below 20 degrees, this stuff lasts me about 4 hours before I feel like my lips are getting that chapped feeling.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this lip balm. It is really smooth going on and stays on for a while. You get a hint of the fennel flavor and a little of the citrus. No   flavors to overpowering. It is a nice balance of lip balm and flavors. The   price was really good and it lasts quite a while. I have been using it daily  and still have quite a bit left. Good stuff and a good value for you dollar.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lip balm after the great reviews. However, I found it to be very waxy and heavy on my lips. Also, after about twenty minutes my lips felt crusty and I had to remove the lip balm. The scent is nice but I would not recommend this product unless you like the heavy feel of wax on your lips.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but no better than my EOS egg. The fennel taste/smell is fairly strong so I don&#x27;t use it around meal times. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last or moisturize any longer than average. I still apply 2-3 times a day. Probably not worth the $$$ for me again.</li>
            <li> Maybe they where stored badly or where old, stale, they smell rancid...This product is wonderful normally, but, it arrived unusable!</li>
            <li> Scent is eh compared to lavender and cardamom and the texture and duration is the same. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> When I first saw this I was thinking what&#x27;s the difference between this and carmex?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had dry skin and my lips get so dry they itch and burn before peeling and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve tried making my own lip balms with raw cocoa butter, shea butter and even olive oil, or coconut oil.  Then I decided to try this one and also Lip Calm by John Masters Organics.  Lip Calm is a traditional sized stick and the balm itself would melt in my pocket so I leave that one at home and carry this one around with me. This one is a little bigger of a stick and for some reason feels like it moisturizes better than Lip Calm.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this one is nice, not overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t feel slick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that after a few weeks of using this product that my lips don&#x27;t feel dry or irritated anymore. I use it night and day, even under lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A while back on Dr. Oz he commented on a show where people who use lip balms become addicted to them and feel as though they always need something on their lips. I can to a point relate to that, except my lips always felt almost painful to not have some moisture on them, so I&#x27;d add more layers of lip balm until it went away &amp; constantly did that. Dr. Oz said to use natural products like coconut oil that won&#x27;t dry out the lip even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to my review I wanted to add that this stuff lasts a while.  I apply several times a day because its hot and dry here where I live and sometimes I will rub some on my cuticles or as a hand moisturizer when I&#x27;m out and can&#x27;t get to lotion and it&#x27;s lasting over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this stuff and have ordered extras for gifts.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lip balm&#x27;s...I always try to find organic.  This is an awesome product and it is organic.  You get a very large tube unlike the others that are gone in a week. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used!  I have tried lots of different kinds and this one always makes my lips the smoothest.  It has a nice natural flavor as well.</li>
            <li> Although I love Pangea products, I&#x27;m very unhappy about their lip balm mainly because you cannot get the last half inch of the lip balm out of the tube.  Most tubes keep advancing the balm till it falls out the end.  Not this one; it stops advancing a half inch before the end of the plastic tube, so there&#x27;s no way you can easily use the rest of it unless you want to dig it out and smear it on with your finger (kind of yucky, and still doesn&#x27;t let you use it all).  That means you&#x27;re paying a high price for something where the last 20% is wasted.  In addition, it is nothing special as lip balms go.  It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not great, despite a price way in excess of what other (better) lip balms cost.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite lip balms!! It smells so good (sweet orange). It goes on so smooth and makes your lips feel like silk. Love love love</li>
            <li> Best chapstick ever!  Smells great, feels great on my lips, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy caked on feel and doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you need to use it all the time like some chapsticks do.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my lips and all over the counter products seems to irritate my lips rather than sooth them.  The all natural products of this one seemed like it would work but between this and my small jar of plain shea butter, well the shea butter works as well if not better</li>
            <li> Smells great but is rather oily.  Lasted a long time and the twist advanced being located at the stop is a much better idea.</li>
            <li> I did not like the feel of this lip balm at all. Clumpy and thick and uncomfortable. I like a smooth, light balm. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all.  Pangea makes the best lip balm ever.  I will use it til they stop making it.  Flavors are delicious, lips are so soft.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is weird, not that its unacceptable thought, its just not really decent. Not really good for moisturize your lips either, cause mine, after applying, dry again in two hours. The only pro is organic, which i love.... but still.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this lip gloss, especially after using Carmex for years, which seemed to seal my lips rather than actually moisturize them. I live in the gulf coast with high humidity and this lip gloss is especially useful when I travel to the drier climates in the mountains.</li>
            <li> Я очень рада что получила этот продукт . Мне понравился , мягко ложится на губы , Спасибо !!! С уважением Татьяна</li>
            <li> I have chapped lips that are sensitive. This product didn&#x27;t have as many reviews as others, but I went out on a limb because the ingredients are largely natural. It arrived today and I just started using it, but I notice that the product works quickly - absorbs well - and I am hopeful that my search for the right lip treatment is over. I will update later if anything changes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting colder at the time I&#x27;m writing this review so out of necessity, or maybe boredom, I mass bought many different lip balm brands. This is by far the winner! And okay, yes, I only bought organic brands at the pushing of my girlfriend wanting me to use products with less \\&quot;bad stuff\\&quot; in them. Nevertheless, this is better than any lip balm I can ever remember trying. It smells a bit funky in the tube with the underlying fennel being my guess as the culprit. I work outside most of the day and in an unheated warehouse the rest of my work day so my lips were getting quite chapped already. So what I can&#x27;t say is how long this lasts me between reapplying because I can&#x27;t stop putting it on over and over. It&#x27;s so good smelling, tasting, and feels amazing to apply on my lips. My girlfriend says it lasts her day doesn&#x27;t involve much cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels perfect going on and absorbs very quickly with the scent being rather subtle after applying. I do have a pet-peeve mind you. For some reason they put the twist part on the top and it is directly connected to the cap you put on. So every time I open the cap, I turn the tube a bit which is a little annoying. How much do I find this annoying? Annoying enough I waited about 1 entire minute before I immediately bought the other 2 flavors of Pangea Organics lip balms. I&#x27;ll update if I prefer one over the other and its longevity if I can withhold the euphoric feeling of applying this stuff to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Longevity*****&lt;br /&gt;I would say, in the cold below 20 degrees, this stuff lasts me about 4 hours before I feel like my lips are getting that chapped feeling. Most other brands tend to last me about 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** So which do you pick? *****&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I love this stuff and I have now gotten all three flavors. As for the manliest, the Fennel and Grapefruit is my pick with the lavender being light enough a guy also shouldn&#x27;t have any problems going with that one either. Those 2 are both great choices and I love them. Just do not even try the rose one if you are a guy! It is very heavy on the rose and it is probably the only of the 3 that I would say is bordering the line of too strong of a smell. My girlfriend also thinks the rose is a bit overpowering (but she usually doesn&#x27;t enjoy flowery smells). She loves the cardamom/lavender lip balm and thinks the other flavors are okay. If I had to recommend one flavor to somebody on the fence between the 3, without a doubt I would say the lavender/cardamom. It has nice balance and it&#x27;s the one my girlfriend and I have settled on being the overall best for sharing... but I still keep the fennel/grapefruit for myself!great choices and I love them.
