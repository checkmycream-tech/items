    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for a festival or so.</li>
            <li>Bought this for Coachella this year and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>These are awesome!!</li>
            <li>I put my awesome tat on Sunday night and Tuesday morning</li>
            <li>Great company and great products!</li>
            <li>brought this to my preschool class and they loved them!</li>
            <li>everyone loved them!</li>
            <li>Attractive packaging with personalized address sticker.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice finding temp tattoos that aren&#x27;t disney characters</li>
            <li>It peels up very easily.</li>
            <li>I do love these tattoos though.</li>
            <li>but they are still cute</li>
            <li>Cute cute</li>
            <li>And fun!!</li>
            <li>Tattify also has fantastic shipping and the tattoos are never damaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest trimming them very close to the design for a more authentic look.</li>
            <li>These were super cute- used them for some bachelorette party fun...</li>
            <li>These were totally worth the 5 bucks!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using them and look totally real!</li>
            <li>these were so much fun!  </li>
            <li>great style for jr. high and high school students.</li>
            <li>Super cool.  </li>
            <li>So, for example, I would cut an arrow out and put it on my forearm, but you could distinctly see the rectangle that I cut because it was also tattooed onto my skin.</li>
            <li>These were fun to try out different tattoo locations but didnt go on very easy and wore off quickly.</li>
            <li>I literally put these on and alcohol swabbed them right off.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so adorable, so I guess I&#x27;m willing to make the extra effort since I already bought them.</li>
            <li>It lasted through a massage, a hot tub, a shower and me forgetting it was there and scratching at it</li>
            <li>Went on easy and stayed on through several showers.</li>
            <li>Very visible.  </li>
            <li>The tattoo looks really real once you aply it on your body parts, It lasts for a long tim and the shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>These are awesome!!very realistic looking.</li>
            <li>The clear part is shiny.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your $5.</li>
            <li>The clear rectangle you cut that is supposed to be clear on your skin is NOT clear at all and is very shiny and visible, completely defeating the point of temporary tattoos.</li>
            <li>These left the clear plastic film around the entire tattoo.</li>

            <li> You can use single arrows at different times, and it looks legit.</li>
            <li> I actually cut them into single arrows !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not real really?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing flash tats for a while now, not from this company, so I&#x27;m not new to them.</li>
            <li> Longer than I expected</li>
            <li> Not worth trying</li>
            <li> ;  They had to get real close to see it was fake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 of these so far, but for the next one, I&#x27;m going to have to trace and cut around each edge of the tattoo, which is extremely inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I literally never write reviews, but these are such a disappointment I have to.</li>
            <li> but I faint at the sight of needles and do not want that to happen to me in a tattoo parlor.  </li>
            <li> Crap they looked horrible and came right off.</li>
            <li> And it got dirty and linty because everything stuck to it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

            <li> brought this to my preschool class and they loved them! it&#x27;s nice finding temp tattoos that aren&#x27;t disney characters</li>
            <li> I like the designs a lot, but the tattoo looks like a sticker sitting on your skin. The clear part is shiny. It peels up very easily. Yes I applied it correctly. I&#x27;d suggest trimming them very close to the design for a more authentic look.</li>
            <li> These were fun to try out different tattoo locations but didnt go on very easy and wore off quickly. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get them again</li>
            <li> These were totally worth the 5 bucks! I really enjoyed using them and look totally real! I recommend them for all ages!</li>
            <li> These were super cute- used them for some bachelorette party fun... everyone loved them!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a festival or so. Bought this for Coachella this year and it was perfect! Lasted all my showers, the heat, sweating and even sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I loveeee the idea of these tattoos, but I&#x27;m so saddened by the fact that the entire paper backing is the tattoo material. So, for example, I would cut an arrow out and put it on my forearm, but you could distinctly see the rectangle that I cut because it was also tattooed onto my skin. I&#x27;ve used 2 of these so far, but for the next one, I&#x27;m going to have to trace and cut around each edge of the tattoo, which is extremely inconvenient. I do love these tattoos though. They&#x27;re so adorable, so I guess I&#x27;m willing to make the extra effort since I already bought them.</li>
            <li> Tattify also has fantastic shipping and the tattoos are never damaged. They usually last 3-5 days with proper care. Great company and great products!</li>
            <li> The tattoo looks really real once you aply it on your body parts, It lasts for a long tim and the shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> Arrived within estimated delivery time. Attractive packaging with personalized address sticker.</li>
            <li> great style for jr. high and high school students.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!!very realistic looking. And fun!!(:</li>
            <li> Super cool.  Went on easy and stayed on through several showers.</li>
            <li> Longer than I expected but they are still cute</li>
            <li> Crap they looked horrible and came right off. Not worth trying</li>
            <li> t doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture! its like 1in big in person. its a wast of money. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Of all the one&#x27;s I bought, this one&#x27;s my favourite. You can use single arrows at different times, and it looks legit.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!! I actually cut them into single arrows ! Cute cute and I received lots of compliments! Stayed on for like 5 days!</li>
            <li> these were so much fun!  I wore them during my birthday celebration in Vegas because---nobody knows you in Vegas!  I got &amp;#34;why an arrow?&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cool tattoo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;omg it&#x27;s not real really? omg you&#x27;re right!&amp;#34;  They had to get real close to see it was fake.  I even had friends online, when I posted pictures from trip, &amp;#34;did you get a tattoo? I thought you were scared of needles&amp;#34; If I were ever to get a tattoo it would be an arrow and then the Deathly Hallows with &amp;#34;Always&amp;#34; written underneath--which these guys should make next  *wink wink nudge nudge* but I faint at the sight of needles and do not want that to happen to me in a tattoo parlor.  I put my awesome tat on Sunday night and Tuesday morning it was starting to fade and crumble so I took it off and applied another one.  It lasted through a massage, a hot tub, a shower and me forgetting it was there and scratching at it (it was NOT itchy I just scratch when nervous)  So, anyway--cool tattoo---I cut the sheet to where I could wear one at a time instead of all five at once</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail. I literally never write reviews, but these are such a disappointment I have to. I&#x27;ve been wearing flash tats for a while now, not from this company, so I&#x27;m not new to them. I literally put these on and alcohol swabbed them right off. The clear rectangle you cut that is supposed to be clear on your skin is NOT clear at all and is very shiny and visible, completely defeating the point of temporary tattoos. Do not waste your $5. Trust me.</li>
            <li> These left the clear plastic film around the entire tattoo. Very visible.  And it got dirty and linty because everything stuck to it.</li>
