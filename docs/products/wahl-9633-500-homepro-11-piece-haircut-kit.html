            <li>cut my own hair</li>
            <li>the product is nice, but it does not work in China because the design is not working under 220V power outlet.</li>

            <li>This trimmer is very lovely and easy to use</li>
            <li>The accessories are very cheap, forget about them.</li>
            <li>Do what I wound up doing and spend $10 more for the Wahl chrome PRO.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased with their performance.  </li>
            <li>I waited a couple of months before reviewing it to make sure it maintained its quality and it has.</li>
            <li>Cause I think it just looks better than just shaving them cause it itches if I to shave them.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid I am satisfied on the length of time it has lasted.</li>
            <li>Is it SAFE to use?  </li>
            <li>I love my haircut now.</li>
            <li>cause he doesn&#x27;t have to go get his hair cut at the barbers any more.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and son and was not even able to give one hair cut.  </li>
            <li>It has more than payed for it self.</li>
            <li>and I had hoped for more.</li>
            <li>nothing more</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it on clean hair though!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the pricepoint of this product, as well I was even more impressed with its performace while hair cutting.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily trim her non-tangled fur, too.  </li>
            <li>Wow! a great cutter and brand.</li>
            <li>the most part, everything works just fine.</li>
            <li>It still works for light jobs but I wont be relying on this one any more.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been as happy with it as a person can get.</li>
            <li>1/4.&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair and when you have a clip on the clippers its as easy as moving the clippers all across your hair, well</li>
            <li>This product works fine for me.</li>
            <li>This clipper works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I had to suffer through the tremendous amount of noise coming from this device, so that I would not have to leave the house with half-cut hair!</li>
            <li>I tried to fix it, cheap Plastic</li>
            <li>All of the accessory parts are flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been drawn to using wahls products, so I felt even though it was cheap</li>
            <li>It does a good trimming, but its really, really loud.</li>
            <li>I bought this to cut mats out of my long haired cat&#x27;s fur and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I had to reedit my review after months of having the product I now feel confident in writing a review, First off, I put a clip on the clippers</li>
            <li>Again, keep it oiled and clean and you shouldnt have problems.    </li>
            <li>Does not cut hair cleanly.  </li>
            <li>i oil and clean after every use.    </li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available to buy new ! )</li>
            <li>The price is good and I only use it once a month</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the solid feel and excellent cutting ability of the product.  </li>
            <li>They work very well and the Mr is well pleased.</li>
            <li>These have worked just fine so far, probably not the most durable out there</li>
            <li>Im not a barber, so this is adequate for my purposes.</li>
            <li>This electric, the Braun 3612 Series, I have have for YEARS (at least 8), and it still works great, even without replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>However it is quite useful and good enough for that price.</li>
            <li>This is not a professional clipper but for its price is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning and oiling the thing is pretty easy and straightforward, and since you&#x27;ll be spending plenty of time taking it apart and putting it back together just to get it to work in the first place, you&#x27;ll have a pretty good working knowledge of its anatomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This will pay for itself with the first cut!</li>
            <li>I have had this product for a few months now, used four or five times, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid for it, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning, but from now on I stick with Conair, which is the brand I had before that lasted for 3+ years.  </li>
            <li>This is worth the money and cuts hair like a champ.</li>
            <li>This machine works good however, it is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>The product is well worth the money and is recommended for a starter set for anyone trying to save money at the barber shop or beauty salon.</li>
            <li>Is it worth its asking price (or any price)?  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth its competitive price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I thought for Wahl brand would be very good warm and disappointment could not be higher ....</li>
            <li>I want to cut my hair right in between two numbers.</li>
            <li>You buy the product, use it for first time and then you will not use it for another month.</li>
            <li>Guess I got what I paid for with this one, which wasn&#x27;t much!</li>
            <li>This also happened to me when using them for the first time.</li>
            <li>first reviewed</li>
            <li>The device does need to be oiled and cleaned regularly, so make sure to use the included supplies for that.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on a disable friend and it was my first time as a barber.  </li>
            <li>wish I could give it more than one star, but I don&#x27;t see how I possibly can.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems that no matter how many electric razors/trimmers I try, I always seem to go back to Braun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find out more as i start using it regularly.</li>
            <li>Returned to Amazon after first attempted use.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to use and the motor is powerful to cut short hair</li>
            <li>This new Wahl 9633-500 HomePro 11-Piece Haircut Kit is light, easy to use and maintain, it is quiet, and ...</li>
            <li>The attachable pieces seem not to fit perfectly straight on the handle, as some of the \\&quot;fins\\&quot; of the clip pieces wont be exactly parallel with the others, although this doesnt seem to pose a problem.     </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut too fast</li>
            <li>but the sound of the motor was different and the thing just wouldn&#x27;t cut any hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li>I trim my gotee &amp; my whole body.</li>
            <li>It is OK for me, but my girlfriend said it felt heavier than she expected.  </li>
            <li>The accesories going with it are of much usefulness.</li>
            <li>Thanks Wahl</li>
            <li>Thanks Wahl</li>
            <li>Thanks Wahl</li>
            <li>Thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li>For the most part, it does the job well enough, although dont expect a professional level haircut with this.</li>
            <li>Its not annoying loud, its deafening loud.</li>
            <li>The motor on the new one quit halfway through the first haircut.</li>
            <li>I wanted a cheap haircutting kit to give myself a decent standard haircut, and that&#x27;s what I got.  </li>
            <li>I recommend other guys to confidently buy it.</li>
            <li>believe this product will be fine as long as you keep it well maintained.</li>
            <li>Excelent dollar/quality ratio, helps to save about $100 a year, easy to operate, solid professional design</li>
            <li>Not a bad product overall.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not cut well, but it takes 4-5 passes to cut the hair, which means that a simple haircut takes me 20 mins now, but it also took alot of fiddling to get the clipper to actually be able to make a pass.</li>
            <li>Our older model just broke and we purchased this one in it&#x27;s place.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY DEBATABLE.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Wahl 9633-500 HomePro 11-Piece Haircut Kit to anyone who want to buy one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done absolutely no maintenance to the clippers and it still cuts just fine.</li>
            <li>It comes well packed as described, it runs very well like the professional ones.</li>
            <li>Cuts through hair like a hot knife through two in the bush, and shipping was so fast, I received it the next day-</li>
            <li>I forgot what I paid way back then, but it was totally worth</li>
            <li>It will get pretty hot if you run it too long, but what clipper doesnt.</li>
            <li>I thought this clipper was just fine after the first haircut I gave with it, although my husband commented that the guide combs had narrower edges that were less comfortable on his scalp than the ones that had come with our previous clipper.  </li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to my son at Christmas who needed a new hair clipper.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer in october 2007 and it is working like new...</li>
            <li>After first trial, i had to abandon it and only use the comb and scissors.</li>
            <li>I cant believe how loud this thing is.</li>
            <li>The Clipper vibrates a lot and makes loud noise.  </li>
            <li>Since I couldn&#x27;t finish, I had to use our old clippers to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>I read one review that said it was loud????  </li>
            <li>To date, I&#x27;ve used it for one haircut, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the home pro, HEED all of the warnings or you&#x27;ll be left holding an item that couldn&#x27;t cut right the first time and cannot be returned for a refund.  </li>
            <li>bother you, then I would suggest a higher quality, more expensive clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting an excellent home hair cutting system on a budget!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any major issues with it.</li>
            <li>The blade cannot be adjusted on the machine and this is a major flaw in the design.</li>
            <li>This thing pulls on your hair and takes many passes while my other electric hair cutter (Hair Salon brand, though I have misplaced it since moving) required 1-2 passes, maximum.</li>
            <li>I usually turn it off and push the teeth back and forth with my fingers, and it works fine after.</li>
            <li>Generally we go for haircut once in a month.</li>
            <li>Everything works well and is complete enough.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too loose, it turns the blades into a scary, clacking chasm of death to which you would not be wise to expose your skin to.  </li>
            <li>Also, you must re-tighten them EXACTLY, otherwise, if they&#x27;re TOO tight, it&#x27;ll jam the blades.  </li>
            <li>I hope it will last for at least two years or three, which is far better than some other brands that I used earlier.</li>
            <li>This is the same model number as my wonderful old Wahl HomePro, purchased about 8 years ago, but now the quality of the manufacturing is pathetic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend checking it out and Braun&#x27;s other products.  </li>

            <li> This also happened to me when using them for the first time.</li>
            <li> first reviewed</li>
            <li> The device does need to be oiled and cleaned regularly, so make sure to use the included supplies for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a disable friend and it was my first time as a barber.  </li>
            <li> wish I could give it more than one star, but I don&#x27;t see how I possibly can.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that no matter how many electric razors/trimmers I try, I always seem to go back to Braun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find out more as i start using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Returned to Amazon after first attempted use.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to use and the motor is powerful to cut short hair</li>
            <li> This new Wahl 9633-500 HomePro 11-Piece Haircut Kit is light, easy to use and maintain, it is quiet, and ...</li>
            <li> The attachable pieces seem not to fit perfectly straight on the handle, as some of the \\&quot;fins\\&quot; of the clip pieces wont be exactly parallel with the others, although this doesnt seem to pose a problem.     </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut too fast</li>
            <li> but the sound of the motor was different and the thing just wouldn&#x27;t cut any hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li> I trim my gotee &amp; my whole body.</li>
            <li> It is OK for me, but my girlfriend said it felt heavier than she expected.  </li>
            <li> The accesories going with it are of much usefulness.</li>
            <li> Thanks Wahl</li>
            <li> Thanks Wahl</li>
            <li> Thanks Wahl</li>
            <li> Thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li> For the most part, it does the job well enough, although dont expect a professional level haircut with this.</li>
            <li> Its not annoying loud, its deafening loud.</li>
            <li> The motor on the new one quit halfway through the first haircut.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cheap haircutting kit to give myself a decent standard haircut, and that&#x27;s what I got.  </li>
            <li> I recommend other guys to confidently buy it.</li>
            <li> believe this product will be fine as long as you keep it well maintained.</li>
            <li> Excelent dollar/quality ratio, helps to save about $100 a year, easy to operate, solid professional design</li>
            <li> Not a bad product overall.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not cut well, but it takes 4-5 passes to cut the hair, which means that a simple haircut takes me 20 mins now, but it also took alot of fiddling to get the clipper to actually be able to make a pass.</li>
            <li> Our older model just broke and we purchased this one in it&#x27;s place.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY DEBATABLE.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Wahl 9633-500 HomePro 11-Piece Haircut Kit to anyone who want to buy one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done absolutely no maintenance to the clippers and it still cuts just fine.</li>
            <li> It comes well packed as described, it runs very well like the professional ones.</li>
            <li> Cuts through hair like a hot knife through two in the bush, and shipping was so fast, I received it the next day-</li>
            <li> I forgot what I paid way back then, but it was totally worth</li>
            <li> It will get pretty hot if you run it too long, but what clipper doesnt.</li>
            <li> I thought this clipper was just fine after the first haircut I gave with it, although my husband commented that the guide combs had narrower edges that were less comfortable on his scalp than the ones that had come with our previous clipper.  </li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my son at Christmas who needed a new hair clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in october 2007 and it is working like new...</li>
            <li> After first trial, i had to abandon it and only use the comb and scissors.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how loud this thing is.</li>
            <li> The Clipper vibrates a lot and makes loud noise.  </li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t finish, I had to use our old clippers to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I read one review that said it was loud????  </li>
            <li> To date, I&#x27;ve used it for one haircut, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the home pro, HEED all of the warnings or you&#x27;ll be left holding an item that couldn&#x27;t cut right the first time and cannot be returned for a refund.  </li>
            <li> bother you, then I would suggest a higher quality, more expensive clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting an excellent home hair cutting system on a budget!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any major issues with it.</li>
            <li> The blade cannot be adjusted on the machine and this is a major flaw in the design.</li>
            <li> This thing pulls on your hair and takes many passes while my other electric hair cutter (Hair Salon brand, though I have misplaced it since moving) required 1-2 passes, maximum.</li>
            <li> I usually turn it off and push the teeth back and forth with my fingers, and it works fine after.</li>
            <li> Generally we go for haircut once in a month.</li>
            <li> Everything works well and is complete enough.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too loose, it turns the blades into a scary, clacking chasm of death to which you would not be wise to expose your skin to.  </li>
            <li> Also, you must re-tighten them EXACTLY, otherwise, if they&#x27;re TOO tight, it&#x27;ll jam the blades.  </li>
            <li> I hope it will last for at least two years or three, which is far better than some other brands that I used earlier.</li>
            <li> This is the same model number as my wonderful old Wahl HomePro, purchased about 8 years ago, but now the quality of the manufacturing is pathetic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend checking it out and Braun&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li> and they work fine, except they&#x27;ve developed a strange buzzing noise when cutting at certain angles, or just for no particular reason.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with the old one was that the blades had chipped, so I put the blades from the new unit on the old device and threw the new one away.</li>
            <li> The blades just slid right through his hair and didn&#x27;t make a darned bit of difference, and my son also complained that the guide comb was \\&quot;scratching\\&quot; his head.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blades are pretty dull.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it took way too long to ship.</li>
            <li> For one, the construction of the unit allows for no buffering to deal with the vibration, so the two screws that hold the front plate on are constantly coming loose, which makes you stop to re-tighten them multiple times</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t make the same mistake, the lousy reviews are all accurate.  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for the last 5 years with an ANCIENT Wahl clipper that was able to get a hair cut done in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews are overall pretty negative, so I am here to offer a different POV.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with cheap electric clippers in the past, but for the price of one barbershop haircut, you can get at least one service out it, so I bought it anyways.</li>
            <li> If the minor hassles of overheating, blades sticking, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just waiting to see how it holds up in the long haul.</li>
            <li> Apart from being a little bit heavy, this hair-cutter works very well.</li>
            <li> Well, then I went to give a second haircut with it a few days later and got halfway through my son&#x27;s haircut when the clipper just quit clipping.  </li>
            <li> It should last quite a while if you&#x27;re only using it once every few weeks for about 10 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> For the price of a single haircut I&#x27;m relieved of the cost and hassle of going to the barber forever (nothing against barbers).</li>
            <li> Starting with the largest comb and working down to the smallest was the route I chose.  </li>
            <li> The clipper is heavy and the styling comb, four guide combs and scissors are not very solid because of thinness.</li>
            <li> For 3 years w/ all the use &amp; no real barber&#x27;s care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> I mean its really, really loud.</li>
            <li> Compared with a couple other Wahl home hair clippers I&#x27;ve owned this one is heavier.  </li>
            <li> Also, the vibration is slightly stronger than some other products.    </li>
            <li> and you will be truly satisfied, compare the reviews and save yourself the $15 you almost shelled out for this worthless piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not scared of nicking her skin, but I&#x27;m able to get the mats out at the base.  </li>
            <li> and i had to cut it down to a zero</li>
            <li> I bought this not long ago, and after one cutting the clipper grew so loud</li>
            <li> If it does break down in the future, though, I won&#x27;t really feel too bad about it.</li>
            <li> Sorry to bring down any high hopes</li>
            <li> /nothing less.</li>
            <li> I learned quite a bit about cutting hair on this first occasion.  </li>
            <li> It did not function without a little adjustment.</li>
            <li> I had adjusted that little turn-screw and cleaned and oiled the blades.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your $$.</li>
            <li> I saw that in a few of the reviews, the clippers just stopped working.</li>
            <li> However, I just clicked it on and off a few times, and it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have mine after sporadic use for a few years.</li>
            <li> Waste of electricity, time, money, and space.</li>
            <li> , I had lines in my head and the cut was so uneven</li>
            <li> It is one of the less expensive clippers out there, so essentially, you pay for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it was due to his hair not being washed before cutting, but I had to stop several times and make adjustments, cleanings and re-oiling of the cutter.  </li>
            <li> Like a lot of you, I was looking to save a few bucks with this one and ignored all of the negative reviews about this item.  </li>
            <li> Adjusting that small button did not seem to help.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re patient enough to deal with that, then there&#x27;s the attachments, which get stuck in the damned blades, also jamming them, so they&#x27;re fairly useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly what is wrong but it has a hard time cutting through thick hair.</li>
            <li> I do not do negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Over the last two years, we have saved lots of money cutting my husband&#x27;s hair at home.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor for personal use and the truth was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well, maybe, but not without a ridiculous amount of extraneous effort and tooling on your part.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying, but so far this has not affected performance.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s broken now.</li>
            <li> Not a great one either.</li>
            <li> I had that had broken.  </li>
            <li> had never owned a hair cutting set thaty wasn&#x27;t used and missing parts.&lt;br /&gt;thanks to Wahl for another hit!</li>
            <li> Not if this version or model of Wahl is the worst of all, the truth I did not expect such poor quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 days past a return unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> It would just stop cutting, I tried adjusting it, and it would make lots of noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been kept in all kinds of situations (humid bathroom, cold garage), banged up, moved around...</li>
            <li> This was so disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> A very bad clipper that can hardly cut a follicle of hair.</li>
            <li> Bad part it is you can&#x27;t return it when you will find the issues.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are annoying and the plastic guides are flimsy.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The item stop working after 1st use. I tried to fix it, cheap Plastic and it&#x27;s broken now. It&#x27;s plastic and Motor combination doesn&#x27;t work. Bad part it is you can&#x27;t return it when you will find the issues.Generally we go for haircut once in a month.You buy the product, use it for first time and then you will not use it for another month. By that time your return policy timeframe will be over.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of you, I was looking to save a few bucks with this one and ignored all of the negative reviews about this item.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that I oiled the blades before using, it only shaved 25% of my head before going kaput leaving me looking like some sort of circus freak!  PLEASE don&#x27;t make the same mistake, the lousy reviews are all accurate.  Do what I wound up doing and spend $10 more for the Wahl chrome PRO.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the home pro, HEED all of the warnings or you&#x27;ll be left holding an item that couldn&#x27;t cut right the first time and cannot be returned for a refund.  Nothing against Wahl, but their home pro is mispelled..it should read home \\&quot;po\\&quot;.lol  Get the CHROME pro and you will be truly satisfied, compare the reviews and save yourself the $15 you almost shelled out for this worthless piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> Wow! a great cutter and brand. Cuts through hair like a hot knife through two in the bush, and shipping was so fast, I received it the next day- how&#x27;s that for service?</li>
            <li> Very very appropriate for home or business use. And shaves hair smoothly.......5 stars product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Compared with a couple other Wahl home hair clippers I&#x27;ve owned this one is heavier.  The price is good and I only use it once a month so weight is not a big issue.  It did not function without a little adjustment.</li>
            <li> This is the same model number as my wonderful old Wahl HomePro, purchased about 8 years ago, but now the quality of the manufacturing is pathetic. All of the accessory parts are flimsy and cheap. The motor on the new one quit halfway through the first haircut. The only thing wrong with the old one was that the blades had chipped, so I put the blades from the new unit on the old device and threw the new one away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for about 6 months and I am pleased with their performance.  They are quiet and cut my hair with ease. With the price of a haircut around $10, these clippers have saved me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cut mats out of my long haired cat&#x27;s fur and it works great.  It doesn&#x27;t cut too fast so I&#x27;m not scared of nicking her skin, but I&#x27;m able to get the mats out at the base.  I was able to easily trim her non-tangled fur, too.  I waited a couple of months before reviewing it to make sure it maintained its quality and it has.</li>
            <li> I do not do negative reviews. I felt compelled to write this one however. This is junk! Dont waste your $$. I gave this as a gift to my son at Christmas who needed a new hair clipper. On his 2nd use, it broke, will not work just buzzes and does not move at all. Very poor quality. I&#x27;m 16 days past a return unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> Thank you. Now I can use the size one hair to trim my pubes. Cause I think it just looks better than just shaving them cause it itches if I to shave them.</li>
            <li> I thought this clipper was just fine after the first haircut I gave with it, although my husband commented that the guide combs had narrower edges that were less comfortable on his scalp than the ones that had come with our previous clipper.  Well, then I went to give a second haircut with it a few days later and got halfway through my son&#x27;s haircut when the clipper just quit clipping.  Oh, the blades were still moving but the sound of the motor was different and the thing just wouldn&#x27;t cut any hair.  The blades just slid right through his hair and didn&#x27;t make a darned bit of difference, and my son also complained that the guide comb was \\&quot;scratching\\&quot; his head.  I had adjusted that little turn-screw and cleaned and oiled the blades.  It just flat-out quit working!  For the price I paid for it, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning, but from now on I stick with Conair, which is the brand I had before that lasted for 3+ years.  Guess I got what I paid for with this one, which wasn&#x27;t much!</li>
            <li> A very bad clipper that can hardly cut a follicle of hair. After first trial, i had to abandon it and only use the comb and scissors. Not recommending it as it&#x27;s not value for money</li>
            <li> It does the job well, but way too noisy. Would not have bought it if I heard it at work prior to the buying decision.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the pricepoint of this product, as well I was even more impressed with its performace while hair cutting. Then, by the fouth usage it decided to go all wacko. It would just stop cutting, I tried adjusting it, and it would make lots of noise. Anyway, I had to suffer through the tremendous amount of noise coming from this device, so that I would not have to leave the house with half-cut hair!</li>
            <li> Not a bad product overall. Not a great one either. It is one of the less expensive clippers out there, so essentially, you pay for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, everything works just fine. I saw that in a few of the reviews, the clippers just stopped working. This also happened to me when using them for the first time. The clippers will overheat a bit if you use them for longer than 5 minutes. I think that is what causes the blades to stick a bit, and therefore, no longer cut. However, I just clicked it on and off a few times, and it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product will be fine as long as you keep it well maintained. It should last quite a while if you&#x27;re only using it once every few weeks for about 10 minutes at a time. If the minor hassles of overheating, blades sticking, etc. bother you, then I would suggest a higher quality, more expensive clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATED DEC. 2012***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first reviewed this is 2009, and gave it 3 stars. It now gets 4 stars because it has lasted over 3 years and still works quite well. I&#x27;ve never had any major issues with it. I forgot what I paid way back then, but it was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATED OCT. 2015***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. Still going. No lie. I&#x27;ve done absolutely no maintenance to the clippers and it still cuts just fine. It&#x27;s been kept in all kinds of situations (humid bathroom, cold garage), banged up, moved around... still going.  Upgraded to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money and cuts hair like a champ.Ican&#x27;t guarantee you will give great haircuts but this product works well.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for the last 5 years with an ANCIENT Wahl clipper that was able to get a hair cut done in 5 minutes. They died and I got this clipper as a replacement. Not only does it not cut well, but it takes 4-5 passes to cut the hair, which means that a simple haircut takes me 20 mins now, but it also took alot of fiddling to get the clipper to actually be able to make a pass. Pass on this haircutter. I am ordering an Andis- because that is what I use and trust on my dogs and horse.</li>
            <li> I still have mine after sporadic use for a few years. For the most part, it does the job well enough, although dont expect a professional level haircut with this. The device does need to be oiled and cleaned regularly, so make sure to use the included supplies for that. Occasionally, the teeth seem to go out of alignment or freeze up somehow. I usually turn it off and push the teeth back and forth with my fingers, and it works fine after. It will get pretty hot if you run it too long, but what clipper doesnt. Again, keep it oiled and clean and you shouldnt have problems.    The attachable pieces seem not to fit perfectly straight on the handle, as some of the \\&quot;fins\\&quot; of the clip pieces wont be exactly parallel with the others, although this doesnt seem to pose a problem.     Im not a barber, so this is adequate for my purposes. You get what you pay for...    Update 7/8/10    After occassional use for several years, it seems this device is finally giving out. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what is wrong but it has a hard time cutting through thick hair. It still works for light jobs but I wont be relying on this one any more. For the price I paid I am satisfied on the length of time it has lasted.</li>
            <li> Does not cut hair cleanly.  Ends up pulling at hair and requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li> Excelent dollar/quality ratio, helps to save about $100 a year, easy to operate, solid professional design</li>
            <li> Hi all...    I bought this trimmer in october 2007 and it is working like new... i oil and clean after every use.    I think is great for the money you pay...        REVIEW : December 2009 WORKING!!</li>
            <li> This machine works good however, it is not what I expected. The item is misleading. It does not indicate anywhere in the text that this machine is non-adjustable. The blade cannot be adjusted on the machine and this is a major flaw in the design. I would not recommend this machine for anyone who is looking for a machine that can be adjusted.</li>
            <li> This product works fine for me. My only gripe is the number of lengths included. I want to cut my hair right in between two numbers.</li>
            <li> I bought this not long ago, and after one cutting the clipper grew so loud I can not stand to use it.  It cut the back of my son&#x27;s neck when used with out attachments.  Adjusting that small button did not seem to help.  Next stop, the garbage.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a disable friend and it was my first time as a barber.  His hair had not been cut in months nor his beard trimmed.  I learned quite a bit about cutting hair on this first occasion.  Starting with the largest comb and working down to the smallest was the route I chose.  The instructions were helpful and the cutter worked as advertised.  I don&#x27;t know whether it was due to his hair not being washed before cutting, but I had to stop several times and make adjustments, cleanings and re-oiling of the cutter.  Anyway, he got his hair cut and beard trimmed and I now have a hair cutter set that can be used elsewhere.      The product is well worth the money and is recommended for a starter set for anyone trying to save money at the barber shop or beauty salon.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the solid feel and excellent cutting ability of the product.  It even used my existing guards from another Wahl I had that had broken.  Excellent value!  Be sure to use it on clean hair though!  Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting an excellent home hair cutting system on a budget! This will pay for itself with the first cut!</li>
            <li> I cant believe how loud this thing is. Its not annoying loud, its deafening loud. I mean its really, really loud. It does a good trimming, but its really, really loud.</li>
            <li> Just like the title says, I bought this clipper for $[...] and had problems almost immediately.  For one, the construction of the unit allows for no buffering to deal with the vibration, so the two screws that hold the front plate on are constantly coming loose, which makes you stop to re-tighten them multiple times (we&#x27;re talking like 10+ times here, people), which makes what should be a 5 minute session turn into a 30 minute session.  Also, you must re-tighten them EXACTLY, otherwise, if they&#x27;re TOO tight, it&#x27;ll jam the blades.  If it&#x27;s too loose, it turns the blades into a scary, clacking chasm of death to which you would not be wise to expose your skin to.  I have a scar on my body to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re patient enough to deal with that, then there&#x27;s the attachments, which get stuck in the damned blades, also jamming them, so they&#x27;re fairly useless.  In theory, you&#x27;re given a number of different sizes to perform a number of different personal grooming tasks with, but rest assured, you won&#x27;t have to be bothered with such intricate problems and decisions, because none of them will ever work, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning and oiling the thing is pretty easy and straightforward, and since you&#x27;ll be spending plenty of time taking it apart and putting it back together just to get it to work in the first place, you&#x27;ll have a pretty good working knowledge of its anatomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give it more than one star, but I don&#x27;t see how I possibly can.  Does it do what it&#x27;s designed to do?  Well, maybe, but not without a ridiculous amount of extraneous effort and tooling on your part.  Is it SAFE to use?  HIGHLY DEBATABLE.  Is it worth its asking price (or any price)?  In my opinion, no.  Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that no matter how many electric razors/trimmers I try, I always seem to go back to Braun.  This electric, the Braun 3612 Series, I have have for YEARS (at least 8), and it still works great, even without replacement blades.  I highly recommend checking it out and Braun&#x27;s other products.  You may want to pass on Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> These have worked just fine so far, probably not the most durable out there but for the price they do the job. Good free attachments as well.</li>
            <li> I once thought all hair cutters were the same. Boy was I wrong. This thing pulls on your hair and takes many passes while my other electric hair cutter (Hair Salon brand, though I have misplaced it since moving) required 1-2 passes, maximum. Waste of electricity, time, money, and space.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product. The price is competitive. I tried it only once till now and it did it&#x27;s job very well. I&#x27;ll find out more as i start using it regularly.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews are overall pretty negative, so I am here to offer a different POV. I have had this product for a few months now, used four or five times, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it. I have always had problems with cheap electric clippers in the past, but for the price of one barbershop haircut, you can get at least one service out it, so I bought it anyways. So far, I have been as happy with it as a person can get. If it does break down in the future, though, I won&#x27;t really feel too bad about it. Do note that it is a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time , no defects observed, all pieces accounted for , I cut my uncle hair already , no problems at all great service</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t have the adjustable trim lever like I&#x27;m used to, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than excellent, on top of that its cheap. I hope it will last for at least two years or three, which is far better than some other brands that I used earlier. I recommend other guys to confidently buy it. go ahead.</li>
            <li> This new Wahl 9633-500 HomePro 11-Piece Haircut Kit is light, easy to use and maintain, it is quiet, and ...in three weeks...already paid for itself on my haircuts alone!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Wahl 9633-500 HomePro 11-Piece Haircut Kit to anyone who want to buy one. It comes well packed as described, it runs very well like the professional ones. In my opinion, I think it&#x27;s a good buy for the price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Over the last two years, we have saved lots of money cutting my husband&#x27;s hair at home.  Our older model just broke and we purchased this one in it&#x27;s place.  Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> I had to reedit my review after months of having the product I now feel confident in writing a review, First off, I put a clip on the clippers&lt;br /&gt;size 1/4.&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair and when you have a clip on the clippers its as easy as moving the clippers all across your hair, well for some reason it did not help it ruined my hair and i had to cut it down to a zero, I had lines in my head and the cut was so uneven, I would not do this ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also dont recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set because of the brand. I&#x27;ve always been drawn to using wahls products, so I felt even though it was cheap it would be great...... Definately not! I so wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to purchase it. Sorry to bring down any high hopes</li>
            <li> Awesome!! 100% recommended great quality!</li>
            <li> The clipper is heavy and the styling comb, four guide combs and scissors are not very solid because of thinness. But it&#x27;s worth its competitive price. And it&#x27;s easy to use and the motor is powerful to cut short hair (I only use it for my husband).</li>
            <li> This kit is made in china.   The Clipper vibrates a lot and makes loud noise.  Numbs hands and the head on which it is used alike.  Returned to Amazon after first attempted use.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit over 3 yrs ago. ( I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available to buy new ! )&lt;br /&gt;I cut my own hair w/ #3 &amp; detail #2, #1 &amp; use it w/ no guide. I trim my gotee &amp; my whole body. After 3 yrs i chipped the blade by dropping it. Also, the blades are pretty dull. For 3 years w/ all the use &amp; no real barber&#x27;s care. Awesome Machine !!! The quality to price is rediculous. Dirt Cheap Price &amp; Great Results ... Everytime !</li>
            <li> This clipper works just fine for me.  I&#x27;ve recently taken to keeping my hair,  or what&#x27;s left of it, really short. I just  snap on the #3 attachment and trim it myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He had never owned a hair cutting set thaty wasn&#x27;t used and missing parts.&lt;br /&gt;thanks to Wahl for another hit!</li>
            <li> It is OK for me, but my girlfriend said it felt heavier than she expected.  Also, the vibration is slightly stronger than some other products.    However it is quite useful and good enough for that price. So I still gave a 5 star score.</li>
            <li> just got here in th US and I cant believe the price of haircut here! And I saw my friend&#x27;s haircut here and I did not like it.So I decided to buy these, and made my wife cut my hair. she had never cut hair before but she had no difficulty using it. I love my haircut now.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just too noisy for me.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my son,  he said he likes. He doesn&#x27;t make a big deal out of things. so i am guessing it great cause he doesn&#x27;t have to go get his hair cut at the barbers any more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and son and was not even able to give one hair cut.  It pulled the hair, and didn&#x27;t cut well.  My husband kept complaining that it hurt and was pulling.  Since I couldn&#x27;t finish, I had to use our old clippers to get the job done.  This was so disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This razor worked perfectly, cut my hair in 5 minutes!!!  I read one review that said it was loud????  This razor is just as quiet as any electric razor, and the Wahl name means quality.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I have used these clippers two to three times a month for the last 2 years. Great investment. It has more than payed for it self.</li>
            <li> This is not a professional clipper but for its price is good. The accessories are very cheap, forget about them.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cheap haircutting kit to give myself a decent standard haircut, and that&#x27;s what I got.  The vibrations are annoying and the plastic guides are flimsy.  To date, I&#x27;ve used it for one haircut, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these over a year now and they work fine, except they&#x27;ve developed a strange buzzing noise when cutting at certain angles, or just for no particular reason. It&#x27;s annoying, but so far this has not affected performance.</li>
            <li> Giving this 2 stars because it just died. Worked well for about 4 years of occasional use (once/month) and I had hoped for more.</li>
            <li> Apart from being a little bit heavy, this hair-cutter works very well. The accesories going with it are of much usefulness. In sum, this is a good product with acceptable price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very lovely and easy to use, I use it trim the hair by my own,the turnout is excellent!</li>
            <li> For the price of a single haircut I&#x27;m relieved of the cost and hassle of going to the barber forever (nothing against barbers).</li>
            <li> muy bueno. llego al tiempo que estaba previsto. absolutamente nuevo y cumplio mis necesidades tal y como lo habia requerido</li>
            <li> Good buy. Great brand. They work very well and the Mr is well pleased. The only thing is it took way too long to ship.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected. Thanks Wahl It&#x27;s what I expected. Thanks Wahl It&#x27;s what I expected. Thanks Wahl It&#x27;s what I expected. Thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li> the product is nice, but it does not work in China because the design is not working under 220V power outlet.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for personal use and the truth was disappointing. I thought for Wahl brand would be very good warm and disappointment could not be higher .... too basic, the leaflets do not cut, do not have enough power. Not if this version or model of Wahl is the worst of all, the truth I did not expect such poor quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expect for the price....nothing more/nothing less. I&#x27;m just waiting to see how it holds up in the long haul.</li>
            <li> Excellent piece for haircuts.  Good buy.  Everything works well and is complete enough.  Well worth the price. I recommend it.</li>
