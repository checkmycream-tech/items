            <li>and I love the body and volume I get from Click n Curl!</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use and a great buy.  </li>
            <li>This kind of negates the easy release claim.</li>
            <li>I think I will really love this when I get better at using it.</li>
            <li>Wife recommends they provide more curlers.</li>
            <li>This is a great new, innovative product.</li>
            <li>is a great new innovative product that takes the stress out of doing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my new Click n curl</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased that I ordered the extra rollers as I was able to have a full head of beautiful curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so convenient and easy use</li>
            <li>Hairstyling made easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So easy to use and works</li>
            <li>Gives fullness to fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I do my make-up while the brushes set and then remove for smooth waves.  </li>
            <li>This product gave me a great look with soft, large curls.  </li>
            <li>and this is a great product that I can leave in my hair while it&#x27;s damp and then blow dry to create the volume I need!  </li>
            <li>Wife tried it.....used special email instructions provided by supplier, &amp; still could not get to work as advertised.</li>
            <li>I most often straight iron.  </li>
            <li>I love my new Click N Curl.  </li>
            <li>The few that I did get to stay up did give me great volume, but the effort is hardly worth the payoff.  </li>
            <li>would recommend it to anyone who wants a hassle free hair style.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect for someone with thin medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>Make the bristles protrude from the brush head about 1/4&amp;#34; more and make the brush handle feel more substantial rather than just a hollow piece of metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave the product as a Christmas gift and the reviews have been very positive and fun.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how easy the click system worked.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My first experience with Click N Curl was at my Hair Salon.  </li>
            <li>A bit tricky at first until you get used to curling your hair around the brushes but after that, it&#x27;s a breeze to use.  </li>
            <li>I had to put the blow dryer down each time to try and get the brush to roll correctly and then the thing just came unrolled on its own.</li>
            <li>Practical and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I do wish there were some smaller size brushes available to purchase.</li>
            <li>you will definitely need to fork over the extra money and get one to two more add-on curlers...</li>
            <li>You could spend the money to get a much more expensive version of this product which would probably work better, but I can afford it so I will keep this product because like I said....</li>
            <li>Even when I do not want all over waves I use the brush to pull my bangs straight - I prefer the lightness and heat of this brush over my old one.  </li>
            <li>I have used multiple hair brushes to accomplish the same thing inelegantly for years and was super excited to see someone finally make this product.  </li>
            <li>Click n Curl makes my busy mornings easier!</li>
            <li>so my stylist asked if she could try it on my hair to see how well it would loosen my natural curls for a new style I was looking to get.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads do not have enough bristles and adequate length even for short hair, like my bangs.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this set stays in and styles my hair with great loose curls.</li>
            <li>If I want extra volume I straighten then use a large barrel curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It is so much easier now to style my hair when I want to wear it straighter versus using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My stylist is surprised by the low price point given the cost of salon blowouts and the professional tools used for blowouts.  </li>
            <li>The handle part of product is not as easy to unclick as you would thick..</li>
            <li>the owner was very helpful and cooperative in the return process and would recommend for other purchases.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not long enough to grab thick/long hair - unless you had twice or three times the number of brush heads and did lots of sections.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does not work.It does not hold the hair.It is put together very poorly.I do not recommend purchasing it!</li>
            <li> The brush heads do not have enough bristles and adequate length even for short hair, like my bangs. The clicker that connects the brush handle with the roller was of poor quality, cheap plastic, and broke after 3 uses. Now i have 5 big rollers, that are too heavy to be used as rollers. This product is innovative, but has great room for improvement. I will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> While I was skeptical to order and imagine how this device might work at all or without tangling hair I gave it a try.  I found my hesitation was verified and couldn&#x27;t get this to curl anything, but....the owner was very helpful and cooperative in the return process and would recommend for other purchases.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and received this as a Christmas gift.  I love it!  It saves time and smooths frizz.  I do my make-up while the brushes set and then remove for smooth waves.  Even when I do not want all over waves I use the brush to pull my bangs straight - I prefer the lightness and heat of this brush over my old one.  My stylist is surprised by the low price point given the cost of salon blowouts and the professional tools used for blowouts.  I would recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and this is a great product that I can leave in my hair while it&#x27;s damp and then blow dry to create the volume I need!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length curly thick hair.  I received the click n curl as a gift from a friend.  Since curly hair went out in the 80&#x27;s I most often straight iron.  If I want extra volume I straighten then use a large barrel curling iron.  I no longer need the 2 steps as the click and curl achieved this look in less time.  I was surprised how easy the click system worked.  A great gift and buy!</li>
            <li> This is a great new, innovative product. Someone should have thought of this long ago. Practical and reasonably priced. Great gift idea.</li>
            <li> Click n Curl makes my busy mornings easier! It is so convenient and easy use and I love the body and volume I get from Click n Curl!</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and this is a great idea. This takes a few tries to get used to. My clients with thicker hair I have to use some curler clips to help the rollers to stay. This solves the problem of using several round brushes hanging in the hair. I think I will really love this when I get better at using it. Would be great with a varietyof size brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have lots of thick curly hair.  I am always straightening it with a round brush or flat iron.  This product gave me a great look with soft, large curls.  The product was easy to use and a great buy.  I gave the product as a Christmas gift and the reviews have been very positive and fun.</li>
            <li> Wife tried it.....used special email instructions provided by supplier, &amp; still could not get to work as advertised. Wife recommends they provide more curlers. Return of product was handled in a timely manner. It did cost us to return this product.</li>
            <li> Finally something that takes only one step to style your hair. I have thin hair and this set stays in and styles my hair with great loose curls. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The Click &#x27;n Curl is very easy to use and gives great body to your hair! Worked well on my medium to short hair as well as my daughters long hair. Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> I love my new Click N Curl.  My first experience with Click N Curl was at my Hair Salon.  I have naturally curly hair so my stylist asked if she could try it on my hair to see how well it would loosen my natural curls for a new style I was looking to get.  It worked great and gave me lots of body.  I was sold.  It is so much easier now to style my hair when I want to wear it straighter versus using a flat iron.  Great idea.  Hairstyling made easy.  Gets my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li> I had this idea and wanted to patent it.  Turns out someone else had gotten the patent 6 months earlier. . .  I have used multiple hair brushes to accomplish the same thing inelegantly for years and was super excited to see someone finally make this product.  It would be perfect for someone with thin medium length hair.  The bristles are not long enough to grab thick/long hair - unless you had twice or three times the number of brush heads and did lots of sections.  Make the bristles protrude from the brush head about 1/4&amp;#34; more and make the brush handle feel more substantial rather than just a hollow piece of metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep them because I can use a hair stick to hold the brush head in place.  I&#x27;d buy another set if they were improved as suggested above.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she LOVES it! It&#x27;s just the hair tool she&#x27;s been looking for. I&#x27;m planning on getting one for myself as well!</li>
            <li> You have to be either an octopus or Houdini with the blow dryer to get this to work like it does in the tutorial video. I had to put the blow dryer down each time to try and get the brush to roll correctly and then the thing just came unrolled on its own. The few that I did get to stay up did give me great volume, but the effort is hardly worth the payoff.  I gave this 3 tries just to be sure before I gave it a poor review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new Click n curl set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased that I ordered the extra rollers as I was able to have a full head of beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great new innovative product that takes the stress out of doing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use and works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who wants a hassle free hair style.</li>
            <li> This is a great time saving product! Gives fullness to fine hair.  A bit tricky at first until you get used to curling your hair around the brushes but after that, it&#x27;s a breeze to use.  I haven&#x27;t used my electric rollers or curling iron since I purchased this product.  I do wish there were some smaller size brushes available to purchase.</li>
            <li> I could not wait to get this product because I had heard of similar products. I will say that it does the job, but not without issues. If you have thick hair, it is hard to get all of the hair in the bristles because they are shorter than regular brushes in stores. The handle part of product is not as easy to unclick as you would thick..sometimes takes two hands ....one to hold curler part and one to click handle part. This kind of negates the easy release claim. If you have medium to long hair...you will definitely need to fork over the extra money and get one to two more add-on curlers...five will not do the job.  Product should come with some sort of draw string bag or the like to store product pieces in. You could spend the money to get a much more expensive version of this product which would probably work better, but I can afford it so I will keep this product because like I said....it does do the job great, but not with out some issues!</li>
