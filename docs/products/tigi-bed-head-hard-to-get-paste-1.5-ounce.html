            <li>Excellent product but tendency to use a bit too much causing &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; hair instead of &amp;#34;defined&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>Best stuff that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, works good in shaping hair and hold.</li>
            <li>Overall, a perfect 5 stars and I&#x27;ve been using this product for over four years.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and using this product makes it look awesome!</li>
            <li>Buy it you will love it.</li>
            <li>I would have given it one more star except</li>
            <li>hence why I cut most of it off.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of hair pastes and this works the best for my short hair.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I have been using this hair paste for years now and have tried many products in between.</li>
            <li>This is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>always seems to look better.</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>This product works better than any styling paste out there in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a wax but requires about the size of a pea is all.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 15+ years and have always been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>the Axe did an okay job</li>
            <li>but I needed to use more</li>
            <li>If you have short hair and you need texture, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love this product after I figure out how to use it.  </li>
            <li>Great product for the value, works great with thick hair, washes out very easily, smells great, nothing more to say really</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is great for the right style and the right type of hair.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for the dry look!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for a product that is no longer available, so I can&#x27;t say this isn&#x27;t good, it just isn&#x27;t what I really need.  </li>
            <li>Strong hold but still pliable.</li>
            <li>and it is fine.</li>
            <li>Just as expected and a very good price</li>
            <li>Great product for short hair and can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been really happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li>My husband and I actually share it and it works great on all hair styles and lengths.</li>
            <li>I wish the hold was a bit stronger but the smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the same product bought at Great Clips.  </li>
            <li>is it animal testing/cruelty free?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a quest to find the right formula to do what I need to do with this fine hair without making it sticky or greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>I was used to this product being really think this was more foamy for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>A lot of his favorite types are really pricey ($20+ for 1-2 ounces.)</li>
            <li>It hold quiet well and smells good.</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>The true T&amp;G product gives my hair lift and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>so this works perfect because it is very light and does not weigh down my short hair.</li>
            <li>I add this to other hair gel just so my hair smells great.</li>
            <li>I will likely buy this again as it&#x27;s given me the best overall experience with pastes/waxes.</li>
            <li>It may work well, but I couldn&#x27;t leave it in after application - that odor quickly discouraged the thought.</li>
            <li>and i thought it was bright white and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>Works great to seperate my hair - give it a textured look, and still shines, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind of hair stuff</li>
            <li>and it holds right</li>
            <li>The stuff is just right.  </li>
            <li>I feel it could have a little more power, but I am happy with it overall.</li>
            <li>the first time have tried this stuff 5 years passed</li>
            <li>I reviewed this a couple of months ago and found this product mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I love this product and could not find it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li>Head Paste plumps up my hair with volume that amazed me the first time I used it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first put some in immediately after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It also left my hair feeling more greasy than the Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>whichever happens first.</li>
            <li>When you put the amount of product desired into your hair, rub it around and make sure there is not any clumps/lumps left on your hairs as they will transfer to your hair.</li>
            <li>This product provides me with good hold without being too stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>so if its windy or something I can easily get it back to how it should be.  </li>
            <li>The only product I&#x27;ve found in years that takes my flat, fine and straight hair from dull to a great hairdo that lasts for a couple of days!  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended i pick up this product  for styling my hair, and at first i found it didn&#x27;t seem to accomplish much with my hair, but I have sense found its really in the technique when applying the hair.</li>
            <li>Really funky smell</li>
            <li>however, when I looked for it on Amazon and found it at a much lower cost a bought a couple and have started using it again.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while since you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It looks very tacky.</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many other distributors out there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a white paste-like concoction (like most of what&#x27;s out there), with little to no odor, easy to apply (pry out with a fingernail and swirl until blended on fingers; run through hair).</li>
            <li>I have longer hair (messy and tousled is the look I go for) and this is just strong enough to make my stubborn locks shape able.</li>
            <li>I bought one years ago, and I was ready for a new one.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it can be challenging to get it to shape right.</li>
            <li>The hair product solidified a little on the top.</li>
            <li>so it makes sense why I need a little more paste than some others.</li>
            <li>It is worth paying a little extra to go with a product that works so much better.</li>
            <li>with free prime, no shipping cost, and next day arrival this product is worth the price at local stores which you can only get in hair salons</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the hair hard and instead gives it a nice soft feeling.</li>
            <li>It adds texture without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Using more then a dime size amount will leave your hair dull and sticky.  </li>
            <li>Whatever paste due to cost, but very quickly switched back...</li>
            <li>I got this based on several glowing reviews, and while I can&#x27;t say for sure this is the legit or counterfeit (guessing real), the Hard To Get isn&#x27;t all that.</li>
            <li>I have fairly thin hair, and the paste does a great job of adding some volume and texture without looking wet.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this product really helps keep height and body.</li>
            <li>It goes far.</li>
            <li>Soft hold</li>
            <li>When I opened up my most recent purchase, it was all dried out.  </li>
            <li>After using other products this one gives the best hold while still leaving the hair looking as natural as possible; blends in well, and doesn&#x27;t leave this horrible residue on the hands (one I can easily rinse off otherwise).</li>
            <li>This is actually pretty affordable despite being smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li>What is blue on the T&amp;G product is white on this new one and vice versa.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I will need a second dab during the day since I am a busy mom and the second hair styling</li>
            <li>and it appears to be old and a little dried out, almost granular instead of silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I stopped for awhile due to the high cost.</li>
            <li>I get a really dry natural look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.....it even came earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, thin, lifeless hair -</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy but a little bit does go a long way, start with a small amount (pea size or smaller) and add more if you need it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this new product to see what the hype was and come to find out, it smells funny and its no different from other pastes that I have used in the past.</li>

            <li> This product provides me with good hold without being too stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> so if its windy or something I can easily get it back to how it should be.  </li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found in years that takes my flat, fine and straight hair from dull to a great hairdo that lasts for a couple of days!  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended i pick up this product  for styling my hair, and at first i found it didn&#x27;t seem to accomplish much with my hair, but I have sense found its really in the technique when applying the hair.</li>
            <li> Really funky smell</li>
            <li> however, when I looked for it on Amazon and found it at a much lower cost a bought a couple and have started using it again.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while since you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It looks very tacky.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many other distributors out there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white paste-like concoction (like most of what&#x27;s out there), with little to no odor, easy to apply (pry out with a fingernail and swirl until blended on fingers; run through hair).</li>
            <li> I have longer hair (messy and tousled is the look I go for) and this is just strong enough to make my stubborn locks shape able.</li>
            <li> I bought one years ago, and I was ready for a new one.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it can be challenging to get it to shape right.</li>
            <li> The hair product solidified a little on the top.</li>
            <li> so it makes sense why I need a little more paste than some others.</li>
            <li> It is worth paying a little extra to go with a product that works so much better.</li>
            <li> with free prime, no shipping cost, and next day arrival this product is worth the price at local stores which you can only get in hair salons</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the hair hard and instead gives it a nice soft feeling.</li>
            <li> It adds texture without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Using more then a dime size amount will leave your hair dull and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Whatever paste due to cost, but very quickly switched back...</li>
            <li> I got this based on several glowing reviews, and while I can&#x27;t say for sure this is the legit or counterfeit (guessing real), the Hard To Get isn&#x27;t all that.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin hair, and the paste does a great job of adding some volume and texture without looking wet.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this product really helps keep height and body.</li>
            <li> It goes far.</li>
            <li> Soft hold</li>
            <li> When I opened up my most recent purchase, it was all dried out.  </li>
            <li> After using other products this one gives the best hold while still leaving the hair looking as natural as possible; blends in well, and doesn&#x27;t leave this horrible residue on the hands (one I can easily rinse off otherwise).</li>
            <li> This is actually pretty affordable despite being smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> What is blue on the T&amp;G product is white on this new one and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I will need a second dab during the day since I am a busy mom and the second hair styling</li>
            <li> and it appears to be old and a little dried out, almost granular instead of silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I stopped for awhile due to the high cost.</li>
            <li> I get a really dry natural look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.....it even came earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, thin, lifeless hair -</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy but a little bit does go a long way, start with a small amount (pea size or smaller) and add more if you need it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this new product to see what the hype was and come to find out, it smells funny and its no different from other pastes that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This one, was more pale yellow and hard.</li>
            <li> Hard to Get isn&#x27;t anything special when I compare it to the various other &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve used at or below the same price-point.</li>
            <li> It is not thick and hard, but malleable and soft.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my long hair into a pixie cut and did a lot of online browsing to find what products I should use and ended up getting this.  </li>
            <li> **&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten more used to my short quaff and now this hard head finally gets the hype behind this product.</li>
            <li> I had found a v 05 product that I made due with, but hard to get is my first choice.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, especially for short hair.</li>
            <li> Once my hair is dry</li>
            <li> Hair needs to be dry.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected for some reason, a little smaller than a tennis ball.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I felt it necessary to update my previous review.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever, since you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> When I opened the container, the &#x27;paste&#x27; was yellow and hard and totally unusable.</li>
            <li> It lasts, you can re fluff</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> had never used hair product before and spent a lot of time reading reviews, trying to figure out how to get the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The actual paste is a different consistency, much less sticky and it weighs down my hair and makes it limp.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on wet hair for volume and dry hair for a choppy, piecey look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but I can see why this is what they use at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other pastes, this stuff doesn&#x27;t clump up or leave streaks through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have short thin hair and it gives it such a lift.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I&#x27;m not in love with it either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong though, but that&#x27;s just how I like.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t have all day longevity and weighs down the locks a little (used sparingly).</li>
            <li> Meh...I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to say about this product, other than I don&#x27;t get what all the hype is.</li>
            <li> My mane requires a little maintenance to mold and shape.</li>
            <li> I have a pixie cut (and at times little longer).</li>
            <li> Little pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> Basically, a little messy without looking gelled.  </li>
            <li> When it is dried out and grainy, the product doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I do wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> The blue outer cap was broken.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to be stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I suggested he melt some product between his hands which was not successful, it resulted in white crumbs in his hair - not a good look.</li>
            <li> The person packing the order had to know it, because it was put in a small plastic bag and taped shut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I like the product.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this product; however, this particular one had a bad consistency.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get it in my hair</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended Hard to Get paste</li>
            <li> I found out about &#x27;Hard to Get&#x27; about 5 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> I think they chose the correct name for the product because it is hard to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and am finding it increasingly difficult to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;It may seem expensive, but you only need a very small amount to add body and texture, so one jar lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and Tigi Bed</li>
            <li> i have vry thin hair</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Worst wax or whatever this is , makes my hair feel like crap</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> worst product wish I can get a refund.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Overall, a perfect 5 stars and I&#x27;ve been using this product for over four years.</li>
            <li> This product does not provide a matte finish, but rather leaves your hair looking glossy/shiny. I would recommend axe spiking gel if you are looking to flip the front of your hair without forming a greasy look.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this new product to see what the hype was and come to find out, it smells funny and its no different from other pastes that I have used in the past. It&#x27;s also way over-priced for the quantity that they offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this product any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it&#x27;s similar to the &amp;#34;yeast&amp;#34; that&#x27;s used for making bread. Really funky smell and it stays on you too through out the day.</li>
            <li> I was used to this product being really think this was more foamy for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but I can see why this is what they use at the salon.  Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  I stopped for awhile due to the high cost. however, when I looked for it on Amazon and found it at a much lower cost a bought a couple and have started using it again. I had found a v 05 product that I made due with, but hard to get is my first choice. It lasts, you can re fluff and now my hair has grown quite a bit so it is,referred to as medium rather than short. I can get different looks with the amount I use and whether or not I curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.....it even came earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li> This is my perfect wax I have tried it since summer 2010 in London uk the first time have tried this stuff 5 years passed and I didn&#x27;t try it till that time I&#x27;m happy to bought it again</li>
            <li> Great product for short hair and can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this paste! I have short hair and using this product makes it look awesome! Will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> The hair product solidified a little on the top.</li>
            <li> I got this product and use it almost 4 times a week and works great. Buy it you will love it.</li>
            <li> This product works well to hold hair in place the way you want it. I would have given it one more star except sometimes I have bought this and it appears to be old and a little dried out, almost granular instead of silky smooth.  When it is dried out and grainy, the product doesn&#x27;t work as well. When the product is fresh, it is excellent!</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Don&#x27;t buy from them.  When I opened up my most recent purchase, it was all dried out.  Many other distributors out there.  For the price, go somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Best stuff that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, works good in shaping hair and hold.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected for some reason, a little smaller than a tennis ball.  I opened my package yesterday and all I could think is &amp;#34;omg they are so cute!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my boyfriend.  He needed hair texturizer and knew what he wanted. This is actually pretty affordable despite being smaller than I expected.  A lot of his favorite types are really pricey ($20+ for 1-2 ounces.)</li>
            <li> Worst wax or whatever this is , makes my hair feel like crap and it&#x27;s hard to get it in my hair worst product wish I can get a refund.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I recommend it to anyone who has a lot of texturizing in their hair as I do with a razor cut..</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this product really helps keep height and body. I just wish I could find it locally.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended Hard to Get paste and I&#x27;ve been really happy with the product overall. I have fairly thin hair, and the paste does a great job of adding some volume and texture without looking wet. I get a really dry natural look that lasts all day. Unlike other pastes, this stuff doesn&#x27;t clump up or leave streaks through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with this brand from now on. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this.  It is worth paying a little extra to go with a product that works so much better.</li>
            <li> Meh...I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to say about this product, other than I don&#x27;t get what all the hype is. I got this based on several glowing reviews, and while I can&#x27;t say for sure this is the legit or counterfeit (guessing real), the Hard To Get isn&#x27;t all that. It&#x27;s a white paste-like concoction (like most of what&#x27;s out there), with little to no odor, easy to apply (pry out with a fingernail and swirl until blended on fingers; run through hair). But it doesn&#x27;t have all day longevity and weighs down the locks a little (used sparingly). I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various waxes and pastes because I recently had my locks chopped very short. My mane requires a little maintenance to mold and shape. It&#x27;s fine, thin, lifeless hair - hence why I cut most of it off. Hard to Get isn&#x27;t anything special when I compare it to the various other &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve used at or below the same price-point. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I&#x27;m not in love with it either. I&#x27;ll likely not repurchase seeing as I can get something with a wow-factor for about the same price or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** Update *****&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten more used to my short quaff and now this hard head finally gets the hype behind this product.I reviewed this a couple of months ago and found this product mediocre at best. Now though, I get it. After using other products this one gives the best hold while still leaving the hair looking as natural as possible; blends in well, and doesn&#x27;t leave this horrible residue on the hands (one I can easily rinse off otherwise). It doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to be stiff or sticky. It molds it into the desired shape and keeps it there while still allowing for some movement. Thus, I felt it necessary to update my previous review. I will likely buy this again as it&#x27;s given me the best overall experience with pastes/waxes.</li>
            <li> Great product for the value, works great with thick hair, washes out very easily, smells great, nothing more to say really</li>
            <li> It hold quiet well and smells good. It doesn&#x27;t make the hair hard and instead gives it a nice soft feeling.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my long hair into a pixie cut and did a lot of online browsing to find what products I should use and ended up getting this.  I really like it, it works well to get that piecey look.  It keeps my hair in place but also makes it &#x27;moldable&#x27; so if its windy or something I can easily get it back to how it should be.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy but a little bit does go a long way, start with a small amount (pea size or smaller) and add more if you need it.</li>
            <li> Made my hair bit greasy and left a lot of residue, had to return it and instead got the american crew fiber one instead.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of hair stuff my hubby gets and his hair looks great with it and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> The product is very good and does what it is suppoed to do.</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found in years that takes my flat, fine and straight hair from dull to a great hairdo that lasts for a couple of days!  Use just as bit. It goes far.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hair pastes and this works the best for my short hair.  Another great TIGI product!  Works great to seperate my hair - give it a textured look, and still shines, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> with free prime, no shipping cost, and next day arrival this product is worth the price at local stores which you can only get in hair salons the price is almost double than here on amazon!!! i love it and i know everyone else will its a really good product too if you are having frizz static ends that stick to your face just put it on the ends of your hair and it wont be greasy.... LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a pixie cut (and at times little longer). I have been using this hair paste for years now and have tried many products in between. This is still my favorite. It lasts quite a while since you don&#x27;t need much. I have VERY thick hair and it is fine. I throw this in after I shower and spray it good. Sometimes I will need a second dab during the day since I am a busy mom and the second hair styling always seems to look better. I do wash my hair everyday so it makes sense why I need a little more paste than some others. Also, the product has a very pleasant smell which I think is feminine but my husband doesn&#x27;t mind it and will use it too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! My husband and I actually share it and it works great on all hair styles and lengths.</li>
            <li> Bed Head is great! You can style in the morning and not worry about it till you go to bed. Has a very nice scent and leaves not residue when you easy wash it out.</li>
            <li> I... am not a gel person.&lt;br /&gt;But while this last hair cut grows out...&lt;br /&gt;I have no choice but to do... something.&lt;br /&gt;This... helps.... I don&#x27;t know if its &#x27;good&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for helping.  and the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;It was on the shelf at the scene of the&lt;br /&gt;hair cut crime. Of course, Amazon was&lt;br /&gt;$ cheaper!  The gelled up twisty bits though&lt;br /&gt;are not my thing. And the scent in neutral&lt;br /&gt;enough --- after a while.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST. My son uses it all the time and loves it!</li>
            <li> I love it . it is exactually what I was looking for and wanted! thanks so much  great job! thanks</li>
            <li> I found out about &#x27;Hard to Get&#x27; about 5 yrs ago. I don&#x27;t remember what I did without it!!</li>
            <li> This product works better than any styling paste out there in my opinion.  It is more of a wax but requires about the size of a pea is all.</li>
            <li> This product provides me with good hold without being too stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Best price around for this product!  Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Best hair wax out there. Order it in bulk. You&#x27;ll never go back to another after using this one.</li>
            <li> It may work well, but I couldn&#x27;t leave it in after application - that odor quickly discouraged the thought. It smells like sweat, try to fix that.</li>
            <li> Little pricey for what it is. Smells great though.</li>
            <li> I wish the hold was a bit stronger but the smell is fantastic.  I add this to other hair gel just so my hair smells great.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this product; however, this particular one had a bad consistency. Its supposed to have a creamy texture and an off white color. This one, was more pale yellow and hard. I suggested he melt some product between his hands which was not successful, it resulted in white crumbs in his hair - not a good look. We suspect that it is a defect in how the product is stored - either it melted and reformed to a lesser product or froze into a lesser product. Nevertheless, we&#x27;ll take the gamble and re-order.</li>
            <li> I have longer hair (messy and tousled is the look I go for) and this is just strong enough to make my stubborn locks shape able.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the same product bought at Great Clips.  Consistency was different as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I bought one years ago, and I was ready for a new one.</li>
            <li> I love this product and could not find it locally anymore.  It adds texture without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 15+ years and have always been satisfied with it. However, the last one I ordered was not acceptable. When I opened the container, the &#x27;paste&#x27; was yellow and hard and totally unusable.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and a very good price</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and Tigi Bed Head Paste plumps up my hair with volume that amazed me the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;About a dime size amount is all you need.  Using more then a dime size amount will leave your hair dull and sticky.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> used to get this at the salon, it was over $20 there, and nobody seems to carry it anymore. i have vry thin hair so this works perfect because it is very light and does not weigh down my short hair.</li>
            <li> I set out to put product in my hair without people noticing that I put product in my hair.  Basically, a little messy without looking gelled.  This stuff works beautifully, but it&#x27;s a two-step process.  I first put some in immediately after getting out of the shower.  This causes my hair to have that glued look, like you&#x27;ve got gel in.  Once my hair is dry I tussle it again and it holds right where I want it to without looking glued.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like there&#x27;s product.  It&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used hair product before and spent a lot of time reading reviews, trying to figure out how to get the look I wanted.  This totally nailed it, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years now.  I briefly switched to the Axe Whatever paste due to cost, but very quickly switched back... the Axe did an okay job but I needed to use more and it didn&#x27;t wash out as well.  It also left my hair feeling more greasy than the Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this until they stop making it or my hair falls out... whichever happens first.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it can be challenging to get it to shape right. This stuff smells great and forms well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2001 and nothing else will work as well for my hair. Strong hold but still pliable.</li>
            <li> The blue outer cap was broken. The person packing the order had to know it, because it was put in a small plastic bag and taped shut. It looks very tacky. I&#x27;m not sure that I like the product. I will keep trying it.</li>
            <li> Best paste I&#x27;ve ever used..and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for a product that is no longer available, so I can&#x27;t say this isn&#x27;t good, it just isn&#x27;t what I really need.  I&#x27;m on a quest to find the right formula to do what I need to do with this fine hair without making it sticky or greasy looking.  I&#x27;m sure this product is great for the right style and the right type of hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product but tendency to use a bit too much causing &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; hair instead of &amp;#34;defined&amp;#34; hair. Also be cautious when temperatures are over 100 degrees as product will melt.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly really well. I&#x27;ve tried many products for pesky fly away hairs. Really great</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and am finding it increasingly difficult to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;It may seem expensive, but you only need a very small amount to add body and texture, so one jar lasts for months.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair and you need texture, this is a great product! It is not thick and hard, but malleable and soft. It makes all the difference! A little goes a long way, especially for short hair. You can use it on wet hair for volume and dry hair for a choppy, piecey look.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting piecey beach wave curls. I feel it could have a little more power, but I am happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended i pick up this product  for styling my hair, and at first i found it didn&#x27;t seem to accomplish much with my hair, but I have sense found its really in the technique when applying the hair. When you put the amount of product desired into your hair, rub it around and make sure there is not any clumps/lumps left on your hairs as they will transfer to your hair. From there avoid the root area and you should be good to go with this product.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at the hair saloon, but they didn&#x27;t carry it anymore. I found it on amazon and bought it. Love it so much. I have short thin hair and it gives it such a lift. It lasts forever, since you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have used every molding paste out there and this is the best!</li>
            <li> The best styling paste on the market, at an outstanding price thru amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lin, Redding, CA</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the dry look!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my thinning hair plastered to my noggin and looking neat and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One question....is it animal testing/cruelty free?  The description said it was, but I cannot find the &amp;#34;animal testing free&amp;#34; logo on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love this product after I figure out how to use it.  My hairdresser recomended it and I trust her.  I think they chose the correct name for the product because it is hard to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> Just as I wanted.  Soft hold</li>
            <li> great product for texturizing and making your hair spiky!</li>
            <li> Very good paste. Hair looks good with it. It&#x27;s not very strong though, but that&#x27;s just how I like. You can remodel your hair after some time. Hair needs to be dry. Smells very good and hair doesn&#x27;t get too sticky.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and i thought it was bright white and fresh smelling.  This was neither; I must not be remembering it correctly.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy.  Not too matte.  The stuff is just right.  Lots of texture and definition but still touchable.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all. I have the remnants of some product purchased at Toni &amp; Guy salon.  I truly believe what I received now is a knockoff.  The packaging is very similar but there are differences in the words on the ball, opposite colors. What is blue on the T&amp;G product is white on this new one and vice versa.  The actual paste is a different consistency, much less sticky and it weighs down my hair and makes it limp.  The true T&amp;G product gives my hair lift and stays all day.  I guess you truly get what you pay for!!!</li>
