            <li>I will be purchasing more of these in the near future.</li>
            <li>Will buy again, as this is a nice size for small gifts.</li>
            <li>I loved these little jars for sugar scrub with essential oils...</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these for travel.</li>
            <li>, so I like to take smaller cups&#x27; worth with me.  </li>
            <li>These cups are well made, sturdy and don&#x27;t have the sharp edges cheap cups can have.  </li>
            <li>I love these little jars!</li>
            <li>they are pure white.</li>
            <li>I have use these so far for butter, hair cream, pomade, and herbs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I looked for Avery printable labels for the top of the lid, but their standard sizes were either too big or much too small for the 1.5 inches of diameter.</li>
            <li>ok ..... hard to get sealed properly</li>
            <li>They close securely and they are small enough to be conveniently portable and big enough to hold something for everyday use without needing too many of them.</li>
            <li>While it is hard to love a white plastic jar, these met my expectation and had an inner plastic lid.</li>
            <li>Each jar was wrapped with a small plastic bag which I reused when I put them into a small box which was cubic, 2 inches a side and fit just right.</li>
            <li>Google: Alien Country to see my excellent, all natural products like mens moustache wax, diaper balm, chest rub, mosquito repellent, and first aid ointment.</li>
            <li>I really like these little containers.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my home made lotions works well and is easy to clean price was reasonable couldn&#x27;t go wrong with tees buys !!!</li>

            <li> This is a nice little jar.  4 stars because it isn&#x27;t exact as how much lotion/cream the jar will hold.  Did some experimenting with it and came up with this:  jar weighs 1.1 oz. and holds 2.4 oz of cream.  Sometimes it is nice to know what we buy.  So, a heads up:  not all jar manufacturers are the same, (I&#x27;ve bought two different 1 oz jars of from different manufacturers, and they were completely different in weight and size.</li>
            <li> I make my body rubs and muscle rubs for these and they are perfect. .Great purchase and worth the price.. Thanks</li>

            <li> These are insulated jars, and they are of very fine quality. I will be purchasing more of these in the near future.</li>
            <li> I bought these to put my supplements in when I travel.  The bottles the supplements came in are often too large for me to take on the road, and I may not need a full bottle anyway, so I like to take smaller cups&#x27; worth with me.  I use white, removable artist&#x27;s tape to label the tops of the containers, so I can re-label as necessary.  These cups are well made, sturdy and don&#x27;t have the sharp edges cheap cups can have.  I recommend them...and ordered two dozen more.</li>
            <li> A couple of the jars were coming apart.&lt;br /&gt;They still work but not to give away as gift.&lt;br /&gt;Still am happy about them.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely. Work great for my homemade coconut oil/herb salve. No leaks even when melted.</li>

            <li> These were Exactly what I needed to package my homemade healing salve for gift giving.  It was not clear from my reading of the product description, but they pots come with an inner lid &amp;#34;liner&amp;#34; made of the same rigid plastic.  It has a tiny tab so you can take it off easily.  You certainly would not have to use it, but it does make it look very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for Avery printable labels for the top of the lid, but their standard sizes were either too big or much too small for the 1.5 inches of diameter. I am sure someone makes them, but I didn&#x27;t find them in time.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I used a 1 x 2 5/8 transparent mailing label on the side of the jar.  Note that there is not *quite* 1 inch of height available before the jar curves: I kept my printing away from the sides, and cut an eighth of an inch or so off the bottom of each label before removing it from the sheet.  No big deal if you&#x27;re only doing a dozen or two, but I would hate to do a real production batch that way!</li>
            <li> Great for my home made creams</li>
            <li> Perfect size and screw on top very secure. These will be used for whipped body butter. Can be washed, dried and reused.</li>
            <li> I really like these little containers. I contemplated for quite a while what size I needed, and these are perfect. I make my own toothpaste from 2 Tablespoons of coconut oil and 2 Tablespoons of soda. Then I add some peppermint oil and maybe lavendar or whatever else may be my favorite at the time. I have started using the same mixture as a scrub with the facial soap I use. It is working wonders with my skin.</li>

            <li> I used these containers to pack and transport spices when I was living abroad. The lids work well. Plus I used a few containers to take cosmetics for a weekend trip. Perfect size! I wish they had the same ones in 1 Oz containers.</li>
            <li> I use this when I make up my essential oil blend face creams. The size is perfect for making gifts of my moisturizing cream.</li>

            <li> I ordered these to use for my whipped body butter that I will use in gift baskets. These were perfect size and it was easy to attach my own personal labels to.</li>

            <li> I use these containers for lotions and creams. They&#x27;re sturdy and easy to open and close...the threading doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Happy with the product. It came on time and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion and bought these...they are the perfect size and make awesome gifts for something homemade. I have them at work and people always open it to see what good is inside. I use the P-touch labels on top or on the sides to label now. I will for sure order more and more of these!</li>
            <li> Work great. Nice snug fit. Doesn&#x27;t leak my whipped Shea Butter. hold up will. labels adhered just fine.</li>
            <li> good product and price</li>
            <li> I for whatever reason had it in my mind that these would be larger. The description says 2 oz, but I must not have been paying attention. However, I still and getting use for these little jars. I like to put product in them, that is almost used to save space. For example, leave in conditioner, lotion etc. I was looking for something for my diy lotion, but these proved to be to small for what I needed. I do however, keep on with some of my diy lotion in the living room since that does not get used as often so that the product will get used before it turns. Quality is excellent, so I would purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> This item was just exactly what we wanted for our homemade lotion/creams.  Perfect size and the cost was very affordable.</li>
            <li> Work for the needs I had</li>

            <li> Great size, sturdy little jars! I used them to make my own deodorant and give them as gifts to friends and family members. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Very nice, well made, my favorite jars for my homemade health products. Google: Alien Country to see my excellent, all natural products like mens moustache wax, diaper balm, chest rub, mosquito repellent, and first aid ointment.</li>
            <li> I ordered several orders of these, because I was crafting lots of bath salts and body butters for holiday gifts. There worked out great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
            <li> I used these for facial powder and other homemade beauty products! So far they have worked wonderfully. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> ok ..... hard to get sealed properly</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. I used them for handmade lotion. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Work great with homemade salves that I made.  I would purchase again.  Nice product for any items or crafts. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good product for my homemade creams.</li>
            <li> Straightforward. They&#x27;re jars. They hold stuff. They have lids. They&#x27;re plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them for supplement powders and they work very well for this. I got them cause they&#x27;re easier and more durable than bags, and they work. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re leakproof or leak resistant as I haven&#x27;t tried liquids in them. I venture they probably are though because they seal well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy them again, especially at the price. But I&#x27;ve got a bunch so I won&#x27;t need to :P</li>
