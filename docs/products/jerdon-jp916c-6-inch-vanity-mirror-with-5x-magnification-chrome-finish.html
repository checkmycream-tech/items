            <li>it looks good in the spot i wanted it for.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Mirror is exactly as pictured, just what I wanted, perfect size/height.</li>
            <li>I own the 10X and recommend both of them.</li>
            <li>Handsome finish.</li>
            <li>Excellent for plucking facial hairs.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Easy to adjust mirror angle and retighten screws.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and the packaging was just great as usual with an Amazon order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made in China so the material is probably as cheap as they could get.</li>
            <li>While I need to make sure the room lighting is sufficient, the lighted ones get hot.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive which was good since she is only 5.</li>
            <li>I would say I am happy with spending less and not buying one with an included light.</li>
            <li>Nice simple style.  </li>
            <li>This looked exactly like it did on the site and exactly as it was described.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it to swivel at all at first.</li>
            <li>A good heavy and sturdy mirror.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>front is a normal mirror.</li>
            <li>So, after turning the mirror ONCE, it is too tight to move without pliers or a strong husband.</li>
            <li>It turns just fine, and it uses little screws on the ends to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>10x is too much and 3x is not enough, but 5x is still clear</li>
            <li>the only think I wish it was a little shorter other than that it good.</li>
            <li>I tried loosening the screws so much that the mirror would barely stay in position, but they still tightened to immobility the next time I tried to swivel it.</li>
            <li>But, these screws apparently tighten themselves as you rotate.</li>
            <li>It seems to be pretty sturdy, but not quite as heavily weighted as I thought it should be on the bottom to insure it doesn&#x27;t flip over.</li>

            <li> My husband put some muscle on it and finally loosened screw &amp; mirror moved, but as soon as you rotated it once, it tightened up on itself again so tight</li>
            <li> nice quality with heavy enough base to be stable.  </li>
            <li> There are screws on the side that theoretically one might tighten if they loosened up over time, and I&#x27;ve had other swivel mirrors where that was the case--every few weeks, tighten the screws just a bit to hold position.</li>

            <li> One screw tightens if you rotate one way, the other tightens if you rotate the other.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavily weighted base.</li>
            <li> Good solid base, felt covered base to prevent surface scratches.</li>
            <li> It fits into a small space and give me all of the magnification that I need.  </li>
            <li> We kept it on the sink counter in our bathroom and now the base has large rust spots.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is very well made with a sturdy base.</li>

            <li> Very solid construction.  Nice, heavily weighted base. Handsome finish. Easy to adjust mirror angle and retighten screws.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very well made with a sturdy base. The magnification is great. I can see alot with this magnification. Excellent for plucking facial hairs.</li>
            <li> This looked exactly like it did on the site and exactly as it was described.  I am very satisfied and the packaging was just great as usual with an Amazon order.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for the price.  Perfect size to sit on top of the counter and not take up a lot of room.  Nice simple style.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Christmas for my daughter. It was inexpensive which was good since she is only 5. It seems to be pretty sturdy, but not quite as heavily weighted as I thought it should be on the bottom to insure it doesn&#x27;t flip over. It seems to swivel satifactorily. I wished there were other finish options because the chrome cheapens the look. Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> A good heavy and sturdy mirror.  The chrome is bright and shiny.  Very nice quality.  Perfect for the bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li> good height, very good clarity. nice quality with heavy enough base to be stable.  I am very pleased with this purchase. The 5x magnification is perfect. 10x is too much and 3x is not enough, but 5x is still clear but you see the details of everything.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought.  Gave as a gift to my daughter.  She has had no complaints.  Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been two years since we bought one of these.  We kept it on the sink counter in our bathroom and now the base has large rust spots.  It&#x27;s made in China so the material is probably as cheap as they could get.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is growing up and that includes using make-up. She had requested a mirror for her birthday and loves this gift.</li>
            <li> great mirror, daughter loves it, seems to be good quality optics</li>
            <li> I like this mirror, serves its purpose. I would say I am happy with spending less and not buying one with an included light. While I need to make sure the room lighting is sufficient, the lighted ones get hot. Good price and quality. No complaints</li>
            <li> I like my Vanity Mirror the only think I wish it was a little shorter other than that it good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smaller than i thought it would be (i should have measured) but it works.  it looks good in the spot i wanted it for.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Smooth 360-degree swivel rotation&amp;#34; was anything but. I couldn&#x27;t get it to swivel at all at first. Just wouldn&#x27;t move. Tried adjusting screws, but one would not turn at all. My husband put some muscle on it and finally loosened screw &amp; mirror moved, but as soon as you rotated it once, it tightened up on itself again so tight I couldn&#x27;t budge it. There are screws on the side that theoretically one might tighten if they loosened up over time, and I&#x27;ve had other swivel mirrors where that was the case--every few weeks, tighten the screws just a bit to hold position. But, these screws apparently tighten themselves as you rotate. One screw tightens if you rotate one way, the other tightens if you rotate the other. So, after turning the mirror ONCE, it is too tight to move without pliers or a strong husband. I tried loosening the screws so much that the mirror would barely stay in position, but they still tightened to immobility the next time I tried to swivel it. I don&#x27;t know if it is a flaw in the design, or a defect in this one unit, but it was so obviously unusable that I returned it within hours of purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  It fits into a small space and give me all of the magnification that I need.  It sits on the vanity in my bathroom and I use it with the larger mirror to see the back of my head.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Everything as described. It&#x27;s sturdy enough and works as expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front is a normal mirror. The back is 5x (and should work well for makeup). It turns just fine, and it uses little screws on the ends to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mirror!  Countertop necessity.</li>
            <li> Mirror is exactly as pictured, just what I wanted, perfect size/height. Good solid base, felt covered base to prevent surface scratches.</li>
            <li> Ordered this mirror because I wanted the 5X magnification.  Mirror is very sturdy and well made.  I own the 10X and recommend both of them.</li>
