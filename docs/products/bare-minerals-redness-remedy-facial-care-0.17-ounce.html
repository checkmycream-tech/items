            <li>Really great product!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I got to try the product, and was impressed that it does cover redness.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product!</li>
            <li>best thing that she has found for areas of redness on her face.</li>
            <li>It covers the redness on my cheeks beautifully.</li>
            <li>and the brush is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product and  use it</li>
            <li>She was so happy when it arrived</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good job makeup people.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I thought.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This is everything the description describes and more!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>However, it covers rosacea amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>the brush is nice.</li>
            <li>Very fine</li>
            <li>I should have known it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I love the brush</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I figure its better than nothing</li>
            <li>I love bareMinerals, it&#x27;s all I use.  </li>
            <li>The best two loose mineral powders are Clinique Redness Relief#1, and</li>
            <li>Bought this hoping it would be something light and easy to use to even out my rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li>So smooth and calms the irritation.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is so worth a try!</li>
            <li>I am 35, have red hair, and fair skin.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried to find something that would help calm my skin&#x27;s over reactiveness.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and it makes my skin look natural.</li>
            <li>This one was worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I have bought most of the redness reducing products available at my local drug stores, but nothing has made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I will buy another one when the one i have is empty, for sure!</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out very easily, is oily in the t-zone and I have minor rosacea.</li>
            <li>Covers the red when used on top of your make up.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses this and we&#x27;re still married.</li>
            <li>It just laid on top of my skin, never blended in properly, highlighted the dryness so much that I immediately washed my face and tossed the product in the trash.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps cover up my rosie cheeks from too much sun when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and used this for about 2 weeks straight and saw no difference.</li>
            <li>Not so much to fix but to conceal.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really cover my pinkness</li>
            <li>It took about two weeks to really begin seeing a difference, but the redness on my cheeks has diminished and continues to do so.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover my redness as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>, she likes this product so much, she doesn&#x27;t want to run out .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clinique is expensive, but covers beautifully.  </li>
            <li>and if it doesn&#x27;t conceal the red it definitely does something I like, because I bought more.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use the green stick to cover &amp; then top with mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that each purchase comes with a new brush, so that bacteria doesn&#x27;t build up on the brush over time.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals Redness Remedy really works.  </li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is SO soft!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use anything below or on top of it.</li>
            <li>Again, for someone with less dry skin, this is probably a nice product, but if you have dryness at all, I would say &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy it!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I purchased this basically out of curiosity and am quite surprised.  </li>
            <li>This product does reduce redness-but does not remove it completely.  </li>
            <li>BareMinerals just barely covers the red on my nose, no matter how much I use!  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent spent!</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;oreal Paris Magic Skin Beautifier Bb Cream works better and it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals Redness Remedy helps but doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li>It may work for people with oily or very hydrated skin, but for those of us with dry skin (which rosacea sufferers tend to have!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suppose to calm rosacea, and you look a little nicer going to sleep...</li>
            <li>I never leave home without my bare minerals on my face to protect it</li>
            <li>I got this product because it is bare essentuals, and it says it will help reduce redness.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of Bare Minerals Redness Remedy before and came upon it while browsing through Amazon&#x27;s Bare Mineral products one day.</li>
            <li>I opened the jar and was surprised that the powder was yellow.  </li>
            <li>I use Bare Escentuals makeup.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night after washing and moisturizing my face (with Bare Escentuals cleanser and moisturizer).</li>
            <li>The Yellow bare minerals does NOT cover redness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Bare Escentuals makeup for two years now and finally decided to try their skin care products.</li>

            <li> it is so soft where other bare mineral brushes seem rough.  </li>
            <li> not what i expected from bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I do not have an extremely red face, however, my cheeks get really pink, even with make-up.  </li>
            <li> I use this powder everyday as a general redness minimizer and to reduce oil.</li>
            <li> not much help for redness; find something else</li>
            <li> and I use this and see absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but worth it!  </li>
            <li> So i bought this product due to redness in my skin and this product made it almost go away.</li>
            <li> I like bare minerals foundation, but this was a real waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The texture feels sticky and it&#x27;s too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help fade some of the redness I have from old acne scars and broken blood vessels.</li>
            <li> It helps to tone down the redness caused from rosacea.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, should not have purchased this product, it does nothing to tone down redness.</li>
            <li> After using a few weeks, it tones down your skin&#x27;s redness, even without makeup.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes along way .  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this out, but was disappointed when I found that the product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Put it on in the morning or evening on cleansed skin and the result will change dramatically after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color is way too yellow and doesn&#x27;t blend well under any of the other shades.  </li>
            <li> This is a VERY subtle powder to even out skin tone and cover up recent breakouts.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only bare minerals product in which i&#x27;ve been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after reading many positve reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was reading past reviews.  </li>
            <li> GloMinerals is less expensive, so I use it at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would help with broken capillaries around nose.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but do have some broken veins and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have a lot of redness on my face.  </li>
            <li> It looks really bad.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in thus product.</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed in the product.  </li>

            <li> The Yellow bare minerals does NOT cover redness.  Am very disappointed in the product.  Will continue to use the green stick to cover &amp; then top with mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> does not take care of redness. not what i expected from bare minerals.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about a year now and it really helps cover up my rosie cheeks from too much sun when I was a kid. I never leave home without my bare minerals on my face to protect it and I get lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;glowing complexion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So smooth and calms the irritation. You can still use it when it gets clumpy-just run your brush over it!</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals Redness Remedy really works.  It&#x27;s soothing and cuts the redness on my cheeks, nose and forehead.  The brush that comes with it is SO soft! Really great product!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well!  Very fine and the brush is great.</li>
            <li> Covers the red when used on top of your make up.  Just a little goes along way .  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Does not work as described for Rosacea.  The best two loose mineral powders are Clinique Redness Relief#1, and GloMinerals #2.  Clinique is expensive, but covers beautifully.  Worth the price.  GloMinerals is less expensive, so I use it at night. BareMinerals just barely covers the red on my nose, no matter how much I use!  A lot of hype!</li>
            <li> The texture feels sticky and it&#x27;s too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I got this product because it is bare essentuals, and it says it will help reduce redness. Well, I have rosacea, so my face gets a bit red. This stuff did not help at all get rid of the redness. It made my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Bare Minerals Redness Remedy before and came upon it while browsing through Amazon&#x27;s Bare Mineral products one day. I ordered it and absolutely love it! It covers the redness on my cheeks beautifully.</li>
            <li> I purchased this basically out of curiosity and am quite surprised.  I love the brush it is so soft where other bare mineral brushes seem rough.  The redness remedy itself is yellow in color and if it doesn&#x27;t conceal the red it definitely does something I like, because I bought more.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this out, but was disappointed when I found that the product did not work for me. My skin was still red and patchy in some places. I followed the instructions and used this for about 2 weeks straight and saw no difference.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Good product</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping it would be something light and easy to use to even out my rosacea skin.  It may work for people with oily or very hydrated skin, but for those of us with dry skin (which rosacea sufferers tend to have!), this product is a no-go.  It just laid on top of my skin, never blended in properly, highlighted the dryness so much that I immediately washed my face and tossed the product in the trash.  Again, for someone with less dry skin, this is probably a nice product, but if you have dryness at all, I would say &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy it!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am 35, have red hair, and fair skin. My skin breaks out very easily, is oily in the t-zone and I have minor rosacea. I use this powder everyday as a general redness minimizer and to reduce oil. I don&#x27;t usually use anything below or on top of it. I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and it makes my skin look natural. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I like the fact that each purchase comes with a new brush, so that bacteria doesn&#x27;t build up on the brush over time. I have been using this product for over a year. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help fade some of the redness I have from old acne scars and broken blood vessels. I used it as directed for several weeks, and it didn&#x27;t make a difference.  I regret the purchase.  I like bare minerals foundation, but this was a real waste of money.  I should have known it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Does NOT work as they say it should.  It doesn&#x27;t even cover the redness.  Would not purchase again nor would I recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would help with broken capillaries around nose.  Not so much to fix but to conceal.  Didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and we&#x27;re still married. Good job makeup people.</li>
            <li> I opened the jar and was surprised that the powder was yellow.  However, it covers rosacea amazingly well.  I&#x27;m happy with this product and  use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had a compact of it to carry around in my purse.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  Works so well for the redness on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> this works like described.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cover my pinkness</li>
            <li> not much help for redness; find something else</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have a lot of redness on my face.  Bare Minerals Redness Remedy helps but doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of it. I figure its better than nothing</li>
            <li> I use this before and after I apply my foundation.  It helps to tone down the redness caused from rosacea.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after reading many positve reviews.  I have rosacea (and not a severe case either) and I use this and see absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> This is everything the description describes and more!  Love it! A little expensive, but worth it!  I would recommend this to anyone that has rosacea.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
            <li> I use Bare Escentuals makeup.  This product was recommended when I stopped instore to pick up some foundation.  I got to try the product, and was impressed that it does cover redness.  I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but do have some broken veins and just \\&quot;red\\&quot; around the nose and chin.  This covers. I do use the makeup primer by Bare Escentuals, but even without it, this will last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> This product does reduce redness-but does not remove it completely.  You still need to use a lot of foundation over it.  Don&#x27;t expect it to correct everything.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been diagnosed with rosacea, but my cheeks are incredibly red and bumply and I&#x27;ve tried to find something that would help calm my skin&#x27;s over reactiveness. I have bought most of the redness reducing products available at my local drug stores, but nothing has made much of a difference. This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried yet. I&#x27;ve been wearing Bare Escentuals makeup for two years now and finally decided to try their skin care products. This one was worth the cost. I use it at night after washing and moisturizing my face (with Bare Escentuals cleanser and moisturizer). It took about two weeks to really begin seeing a difference, but the redness on my cheeks has diminished and continues to do so. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I do not have an extremely red face, however, my cheeks get really pink, even with make-up.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  It doesn&#x27;t even seem to help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while. It is fantastic. After using a few weeks, it tones down your skin&#x27;s redness, even without makeup. A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea This does nothing to help!! I use it twice a day like it says. Nope never again!!!</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals, it&#x27;s all I use.  Unfortunately, the color is way too yellow and doesn&#x27;t blend well under any of the other shades.  It looks really bad.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY subtle powder to even out skin tone and cover up recent breakouts. It doesn&#x27;t cover my redness as much as I&#x27;d like. As to the claims that it will improve skin color and pore size I&#x27;ll have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend.  She was so happy when it arrived, she likes this product so much, she doesn&#x27;t want to run out .&lt;br /&gt;The best thing that she has found for areas of redness on her face.</li>
            <li> I was reading past reviews.  I think the people who didn&#x27;t like it didn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a nighttime treatment, not a daytime cosmetic.  It is meant to be put on after you wash and moisturize your face at night.  It&#x27;s suppose to calm rosacea, and you look a little nicer going to sleep...lol.  Some people have tried to use it during the day, but it is not cosmetically pleasing as a cover up, or under make up power.</li>
            <li> So i bought this product due to redness in my skin and this product made it almost go away. Put it on in the morning or evening on cleansed skin and the result will change dramatically after a few uses. I have been asking every where for something like this and I finally found it! I will buy another one when the one i have is empty, for sure! It is so worth a try!</li>
            <li> Purchases this for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Followed the directions works like a charm&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to my sisters. And to my friends</li>
            <li> this product does not help with redness at all. the brush is nice. it&#x27;s the only bare minerals product in which i&#x27;ve been disappointed. wish i could return it.</li>
            <li> gets ride of my redness on my face where there is rosacea, but it makes my pores on my nose look larger...</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought. And it do not like the smell.</li>
