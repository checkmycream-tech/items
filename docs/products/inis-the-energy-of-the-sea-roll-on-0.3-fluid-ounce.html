            <li>I received this product quickly and I love it!</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent- reminds me of visit to Ireland.</li>
            <li>I do not like perfumes because they smell so strong.</li>
            <li>Soft and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It is not too flowery, sweet, musky, etc...just clean air!</li>
            <li>This is the most fresh, sea air fragrance in the world.</li>
            <li>Came across this fabulous sent while on vacation.</li>
            <li>Inis is a perfect solution for me, but after an hour or so, the scent is imperceptible.</li>
            <li>Great scent, but a bit mysterious.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still lightly there.  </li>
            <li>This is a light scent, but there is a note/notes that give me a headache.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and light scent.  </li>
            <li>so light and clean.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful fresh and clean acent, the roller ball applicator makes it easy to use, and the small size easy to carry in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>unique fragrance that doesn&#x27;t cause myself or others to gag</li>
            <li>The scent is like a fresh breeze passing by you!  </li>
            <li>Not over-powering but a breath of fresh air!</li>
            <li>Love the rollon, allows control and the smell is wonderful for male or female.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, fresh and crisp!</li>
            <li>I love the perfume Inis and it was great to find it in a small roll on.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and the purse size is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>The scent is gender neutral, very fresh and clean, and last most of the day!</li>
            <li>So fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>And the little roll on bottle makes it a great travel companion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that  I can now buy Inis here in the US, and not have to wait till my next trip to Ireland to re-stock up.</li>
            <li>Simple clean appealing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Initially, the sillage is very strong.  </li>
            <li>The item itself is wonderful, but right after I purchased this I found it for a bit less at a local gift shop.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very, very close.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent but it does not even last an hour on me.</li>
            <li>I found this perfume on my first visit to Ireland....</li>
            <li>So after some more usage, the longevity is actually 1-2 hours if trying to spread the scent via sillage.  </li>
            <li>Love the frag ace but bottle came opened and half filled</li>
            <li>Small package, so good for travel.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, seems watered down</li>
            <li>The roll on bottle is easy to use, and compact enough for travel.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s up with the large stickers applied to the packaging.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate this.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s comfortable smelling constantly.  </li>
            <li>So all in all, this really is a unisex scent.  </li>
            <li>, it stays on for about 6 hours, but you&#x27;ll have to really put the skin to thenose to smell it.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth water, you&#x27;ll definitely get some action wearing this :)</li>
            <li>Simple and clean.</li>
            <li>Not very manly, but real fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate for me, because they smell great.</li>
            <li>This scent brings me back to this time and the ocean we had so much fun watching sunrise/</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, but it does not last long at all once applied.</li>
            <li>It is okay for it to be shipped to me but not okay to return?</li>
            <li>Subsequently it was so strong due to evaporation that I could not where it.</li>
            <li>(as is the old  4711) and it truly is.  </li>
            <li>People frequently stop me (both men and women) and ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>Since I generally have dry skin, it&#x27;s likely that the oil was absorbed so the scent doesn&#x27;t really diffuse as well.  </li>
            <li>My friend said it that the moment I moved, the smell was exactly where I was as if an outline of me was created in the space I was previously standing.  </li>

            <li> My friend said it that the moment I moved, the smell was exactly where I was as if an outline of me was created in the space I was previously standing.  </li>
            <li> So in terms of spreading into the air for people to pick the scent and wonder where it&#x27;s coming from, it doesn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> It was about 1/2 empty and given its a tiny bottle thats alot.  </li>
            <li> Sorta like Grey Flannel without the lavender.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly the same, it&#x27;s missing something</li>
            <li> In other words, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to keep in the pocket unless you&#x27;re wearing skinny jeans/pants [3.25 inches tall, 0.75 inch diameter].  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> So little perfume comes out of the roller ball.</li>
            <li> Reminds me heavily of Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Aqua Di Gio.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my daytime everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> To keep the scent lingering longer, I would apply very small amounts every hour or two.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I asked a coworker her opinion on the scent (blind testing).  </li>
            <li> but very disappointed it had leaked a little in the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Unhappy camper.</li>
            <li> Very Cheesy for a gift.</li>
            <li> so I am disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love this scent but it does not even last an hour on me. I went to return it and it is not a returnable item because it is considered hazardous material! Wth! It is okay for it to be shipped to me but not okay to return? Unhappy camper.</li>
            <li> I found this perfume on my first visit to Ireland....absolutely love it and it is unisex!</li>
            <li> Soft and pleasant scent. My all time favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the perfume Inis and it was great to find it in a small roll on. It will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate this. So little perfume comes out of the roller ball. I heard so many great things about this scent so I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Light and refreshing! I love the roll on. Y mom loved it too. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is the most fresh, sea air fragrance in the world. It is not too flowery, sweet, musky, etc...just clean air!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and people around me like it too.</li>
            <li> The item itself is wonderful, but right after I purchased this I found it for a bit less at a local gift shop.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, fresh and crisp!</li>
            <li> Great service. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Came across this fabulous sent while on vacation. It&#x27;s fresh clean and crisp. It&#x27;s name describes it perfectly. I need to get a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and the purse size is very convenient.Very fresh and light scent.  Lingers but does not overpower.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, but it does not last long at all once applied. I do not like perfumes because they smell so strong. Inis is a perfect solution for me, but after an hour or so, the scent is imperceptible. Perhaps the spray would last longer?&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Great scent, but a bit mysterious.  Bought it for my wife, but she thought it smelled better on me!  It&#x27;s advertised as a unisex fragrance (as is the old  4711) and it truly is.  Sorta like Grey Flannel without the lavender.  Really nice summer scent.  Wife prefers more flower essence; body chemistry is EVERYTHING with perfume/cologne.</li>
            <li> Good product good service.</li>
            <li> Love Innis! Simple clean appealing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase and seller and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  Reminds me heavily of Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Aqua Di Gio.  Not exactly the same, it&#x27;s missing something but it&#x27;s very, very close.  I asked a friend what she thought and her reply was that while it smells nice, it&#x27;s not something she&#x27;s comfortable smelling constantly.  In other words, a little goes a long way.  Initially, the sillage is very strong.  My friend said it that the moment I moved, the smell was exactly where I was as if an outline of me was created in the space I was previously standing.  As of writing this, it&#x27;s been about 2 hours since I applied it.  Maybe my sense of smell has adapted and so I can&#x27;t pick it up anymore, but it&#x27;s still lightly there.  Since I generally have dry skin, it&#x27;s likely that the oil was absorbed so the scent doesn&#x27;t really diffuse as well.  Edit:  So in terms of spreading into the air for people to pick the scent and wonder where it&#x27;s coming from, it doesn&#x27;t last that long.  Somewhere about 2-4 hours.  However, those who hug you will still pick it up 6 hours after application.  Additionally, I asked a coworker her opinion on the scent (blind testing).  She liked it and said it smelled really good.  Not very manly, but real fresh.  I asked her if it reminds her of something she&#x27;s smelled before and she said yes.  I then mentioned Aqua Di Gio and she agreed that it was just like it.  To keep the scent lingering longer, I would apply very small amounts every hour or two.  It&#x27;s small enough to keep in the pocket unless you&#x27;re wearing skinny jeans/pants [3.25 inches tall, 0.75 inch diameter].  So all in all, this really is a unisex scent.  For the guys, if you&#x27;re looking for a possible Aqua Di Gio alternative, try this one out.  I purchased this one from Great Household (fulfilled by Amazon) and the product is legitimate.  Edit 2:   So after some more usage, the longevity is actually 1-2 hours if trying to spread the scent via sillage.  Other than that, it stays on for about 6 hours, but you&#x27;ll have to really put the skin to thenose to smell it.</li>
            <li> Thank U...my favorite,! Very pleased</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent- reminds me of visit to Ireland.</li>
            <li> People frequently stop me (both men and women) and ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing. It is clean and wonderful!  The only scent I wear.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Simple and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells ok but I think it more for a man</li>
            <li> Have used Inis for years and just love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love love this fragrance. So fresh and clean. I feel like I&#x27;m walking the streets of Dublin when I wear it. It&#x27;s my daytime everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> Saw this fragrance in an Asheville, NC store. Wanted to try it, but did not want to commit to an entire bottle. Love the rollon, allows control and the smell is wonderful for male or female.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and the person really liked it.</li>
            <li> awesome stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I love this Inis roll on spray. I am thrilled that  I can now buy Inis here in the US, and not have to wait till my next trip to Ireland to re-stock up. Wonderful fragrance. so light and clean.</li>
            <li> 2 stars because....Love the scent....but very disappointed it had leaked a little in the packaging.  Returning and getting another one.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s loved this product.</li>
            <li> This is a light scent, but there is a note/notes that give me a headache. I&#x27;ve tried putting on my skin, clothes, and just smelling the rollerball, to no avail.  I have a similar response to Rain, by Terranova. It&#x27;s unfortunate for me, because they smell great.</li>
