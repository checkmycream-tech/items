            <li>but I love it because it just makes my skin look and feel smooth.</li>
            <li>just wanted skin to be more smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>Your skin is more plump and smooth.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic without overwhelming your perfume and obsorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lotion, my skin feels good and not dry</li>
            <li>It seemed that no matter how many squats or lunges I did, the cellulite was here to stay, so I was excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the pump on the top - it dispenses just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>Skin feels real smooth and silky and noticed a difference in my cellulite after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>I PROMISE EVERYONE THAT STICKS WITH GO BARE will achieve great results</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth but not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>works great so far and has a mild minty scent that isn&#x27;t offensive.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a nice large pump bottle so you can just get what you need</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about two weeks now and already noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for an extensive amount of time and really cannot speak to the effectiveness of this lotion, but even if it never takes care of any flaws in my skin, it works great as a moisturizer and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I did get this item free of charge to review it</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like this cream as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Because this product glides on smooth</li>
            <li>this lotion isn&#x27;t liie the others it actually has spa techs that give you great help and see that</li>
            <li>now I look n mirror and see such great results on myself</li>
            <li>now im going to be cellulite free and a lot healthier and</li>
            <li>, it went on smooth and was not oily or had a lot of residue.  </li>
            <li>Not to say I am 100% dimple free</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest relying on this cream alone for cellulite though because I still believe that good eating habits and exercise are the key to a healthier body. :)</li>
            <li>It had tips for how to get the best possible results from the product as well as some additional very helpful information.  </li>
            <li>It does smell good and it is non grease and absorbs very effectively, but I do not really have that much cellulite ..</li>
            <li>The first thing I love about the ingredients is that the first ingredient is not water!!</li>
            <li>The cream is nice and soft and it melts into my skin so easily .</li>
            <li>Great product, but don&#x27;t know the long term effects.  </li>
            <li>This is a vegan friendly product all plant and herb based.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this cellulite cream.  </li>
            <li>Not so excited to need it, but</li>
            <li>I am so excited about it,</li>
            <li>I rub it on my body after I clean the area</li>
            <li>It has a clean scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>for that I use the Fat Fader along with the Sweet Sweat and wear the Delfin anti cellulite pants along with waist sweat band.</li>
            <li>So far looks like a nice cream.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>It has a cool feeling</li>
            <li>I do the full wrap once a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, there are no miracle products out there, but if anything comes close, it&#x27;s this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product really will reduce the cottage cheese effect of cellulite and make your skin smoother and more supple, i was given this product to review</li>
            <li>Loving it so far and can already see a difference.</li>
            <li>The product tingles when I put it on and feels cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like a fruity scent and leaves your skin feeling so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs rather quickly</li>
            <li>another plus this lotion is such a powerful combination of what us gals need to make that cellitlite go away for good</li>
            <li>Received product quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of soon to see the difference in the cellulite and stretch marks, but my wife says to tell you that she feels that her skin is not dry</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it works well on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing!!</li>
            <li>I have tried the typical rub on method and it feels great without an over powerful or lingering scent.</li>
            <li>I like the the light airy feel of the cream but just did not do much for my cellulite.</li>

            <li>so I know that the ingredients used for this product is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There are so many natural products that can help your body help itself.  </li>

            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Honestly it came the next day no waiting whatsoever</li>
            <li>it doesn’t get all over my gym bag because I am taking it with me to the gym and applying it right after coming out of the sauna at the gym.</li>
            <li>I can tell my skin is receiving the product because my skin positively glows!  </li>
            <li>I took a while to write this because I wanted to be true to you as I struggled with cellulite for years tried soooo many products over the years and finally figured out that no one, two or three product worked for me.  </li>

            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I basically bought it because it was the most ounces for the price among the different creams and when comparing 2 and 4 ounces to 12 ounces for me</li>

            <li>Will order the second one for sure</li>
            <li>This really works with consistency!</li>
            <li>This is the first cellulite product.  </li>
            <li>I massage it gently until the cream has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my skin felt silky and now a week</li>
            <li>My first application was</li>
            <li>I am almost finished with my first bottle and have used it every day.</li>
            <li>Accomplished!</li>
            <li>and this is something I wasn&#x27;t aware of</li>
            <li>And you have nothing to lose because it comes with a money back guarantee :)  </li>
            <li>Alone with a cellulite massager, I think it is actually working:)</li>
            <li>Omg this product really works well!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product!    </li>
            <li>My pores seem smaller and are more smoothed over.  </li>
            <li>It makes a difference fast!</li>
            <li>wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Of course it won&#x27;t make magic and will work only with regular use, healthy food and reasonable exercising.</li>
            <li>I do round 2 at night before bed minus the shower but still felt like it was a good rub!!</li>
            <li>(Fun because I love Zumba but tough because I also love cupcakes).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually more like a small indented crater; this product has helped smooth over the edges</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference in appearance or should I say lack of appearance of cellulite on my thighs, my problem cellulite</li>
            <li>I even used it in conjuction with the &amp;#34;Simonida Pure - Cellulite Massager Brush&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But I certainly was hoping for a product that minimized it&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li>I am more concerned about firming my skin and hydration because my skin is very dry.  </li>
            <li>Its fine, didn&#x27;t really do a lot, but I don&#x27;t think my sister used it as religiously as she could have.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at little to no cost in exchange for an HONEST, UNBIASED, &amp; UNPAID review.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a while now and have not seen much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Really like the product and the info that is</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I tried it as soon as I got it because I really don&#x27;t like cellulite</li>
            <li>, i use a hand held massager and really massage in circular motion.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or sticky and blends in really well.</li>
            <li>If you use it correctly now you&#x27;ll definitely be ready for the summer.  </li>
            <li>I really like it a lot....</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much either.</li>
            <li>You really get a lot for your money on this bottle.</li>
            <li>already read to use just remove the plastic and your ready to go.</li>
            <li>I have prime so product came fast.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can turn the pump on and off, so</li>
            <li>Doing squats alone didn&#x27;t really make my cellulite go away.</li>
            <li>it really works</li>
            <li>Very soothing.  </li>
            <li>I used a bottle of lotion held longways to massage the cream into my thighs (think like using a rolling pin) and it really seemed to help.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like is that it absorbs fast into the skin.</li>
            <li>I must say that I was very hesitant to buy this as I don&#x27;t think any of these things work.</li>
            <li>Who wants cellulite?  </li>
            <li>Unless you are absolutely perfection personified you have some cellulite on your body.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This cooling feeling almost tingles; I want to say this is the point at which my pores are opening and absorbing the product.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really dislike when I see reviews 2 or 3 days after use.</li>
            <li>Seems to really work.</li>
            <li>This did not have a very overpowering smell which some do</li>
            <li>and I am kind of bottom heavy.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell like a citrus mint, but subtle.</li>
            <li>It really did better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that I&#x27;ve gotten better results from.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for four weeks and have already seen a significant difference in the areas of cellulite on my thighs and legs.  </li>
            <li>but after using it a few times, I have noticed a big improvement â€“ most specially on my thighs!</li>
            <li>It is super good！My skin became smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>This one has a very strong smell but it does go away after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that if you use it before working out (high cardio) don&#x27;t put on too much.</li>
            <li>I have used creams pretty religiously for most of my adult life and have success with other creams, but  I&#x27;m hooked on this one because it works</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t buy that commercial, although there was always a little doubt and &amp;#34;what ifs&amp;#34; in my head, because I firmly believe that exercise and good eating habits is the way to a healthier and better body.</li>
            <li>but I never thought u would find it until I found this miracle worker I am in love with the cellulite cream after using it for two and a half days</li>
            <li>I feel less self-conscious about my scar and find that I am smiling more.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, does not make your skin chalky and with regular use</li>
            <li>After trying close to a dozen anti-cellulite creams/products in the past year, this is THE ONLY ONE I can honestly say WORKS!</li>
            <li>the pump makes it even easier and mess free to use!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend SpalonTech to anyone reading here.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what this product can do for me over the next month when it has already done so much in the last week!    </li>
            <li>The picture shows left leg had the wrap vs the right leg without the wrap.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 months religiously now and haven&#x27;t received any positive results!  </li>
            <li>I use it in the morning right after a shower, pores are clean and wide open</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, yet it did not cause any break outs.  </li>
            <li>No magic :-)</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I were heavier perhaps the improvements would be more noticeable.</li>
            <li>on the inner thighs its pretty tender</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I heard about cellulite cream was from a commercial on the TV.</li>
            <li>Cellulite is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I detest writing reviews, but this product is too fantastic not to SHOUT OUT to other women (and THANK the company for making a product that actually works and THANKS to Amazon for carrying it).</li>
            <li>I would suggest giving yourself an at home spa day and do this with some other masks or treatments to accomplish a full body treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff - has certainly smoothed my skin and has helped with my cellulite and faded my spider veins so far.</li>
            <li>You can observe clear improvements within a week.</li>
            <li>Even at the age of 28yrs old.</li>
            <li>Leaved skin feeling soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product in conjunction with working out because the results I have gotten so far is</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I also have been using a hand held tool with soft cone-like material to massage my arms before I use this product.</li>
            <li>No difference so far.</li>
            <li>like the pump on the bottle .. and also like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and have noticeable cellulite on the backs of my thighs and lower abdomen.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly,  not a heavy gunk cream.  </li>
            <li>I have given enough time to work, but it hasn&#x27;t done much on me at all.</li>
            <li>I really feel this seller went above and beyond with their product</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s too early to see results</li>
            <li>I picked one with caffeine because that has been long proven to help with the fatty beast, but this one also had a list of natural healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not many!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and not overwhelming another plus.</li>
            <li>Caffeine and Seaweed seems like a strange combination, but in reality both products are VERY helpful to firming and toning your skin.  </li>
            <li>While my skin feels noticeably tighter after just one week, I have not experienced the kind of visual results that I have on my face.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get down to the ingredients and how to right away on this.</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>There truly is no other word to describe this cream.</li>
            <li>this past Friday, it is now Monday and the difference is SIGNIFICANT.</li>
            <li>As long as I use it everyday I notice a huge difference in the appearance on my orange peel and cellulite.</li>
            <li>Bare mornings and evenings along with a anti cellulite oil  found on amazon.</li>
            <li>(only had it three days thus far)...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love that this (unlike other creams ive tried in the past) does not leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>It has a very faint pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my pregnant wife who is dealing with dry skin, stretch marks and a little cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I generally use these creams from April to Sept as part of my &#x27;back in the bathing suit&#x27; ritual.</li>
            <li>This is now my second bottle and I will continue to purchase it as long as i continue to get the results i got so far!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but right away noticed the 100% money back guarantee</li>

            <li> Surprisingly</li>
            <li> so much good comes out of just sticking with this potion lotion..</li>
            <li> This is why I waited a month before leaving a review, in order to give a fair review on my part.</li>
            <li> When you try it, it tingles and feels what I could best describe as a cool, menthol feel.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> but I do feel that this cream has made a difference, and I am very pleased with my two week results</li>

            <li> And most importantly SpalonTech Cellulite Cream with Caffeine and Seaweed Extract works.</li>
            <li> but I love it because it just makes my skin look and feel smooth.</li>
            <li> just wanted skin to be more smooth and even.  </li>
            <li> Your skin is more plump and smooth.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic without overwhelming your perfume and obsorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion, my skin feels good and not dry</li>
            <li> It seemed that no matter how many squats or lunges I did, the cellulite was here to stay, so I was excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the pump on the top - it dispenses just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> Skin feels real smooth and silky and noticed a difference in my cellulite after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> I PROMISE EVERYONE THAT STICKS WITH GO BARE will achieve great results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth but not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> works great so far and has a mild minty scent that isn&#x27;t offensive.  </li>
            <li> Comes in a nice large pump bottle so you can just get what you need</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about two weeks now and already noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for an extensive amount of time and really cannot speak to the effectiveness of this lotion, but even if it never takes care of any flaws in my skin, it works great as a moisturizer and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I did get this item free of charge to review it</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like this cream as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Because this product glides on smooth</li>
            <li> this lotion isn&#x27;t liie the others it actually has spa techs that give you great help and see that</li>
            <li> now I look n mirror and see such great results on myself</li>
            <li> now im going to be cellulite free and a lot healthier and</li>
            <li> , it went on smooth and was not oily or had a lot of residue.  </li>
            <li> Not to say I am 100% dimple free</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest relying on this cream alone for cellulite though because I still believe that good eating habits and exercise are the key to a healthier body. :)</li>
            <li> It had tips for how to get the best possible results from the product as well as some additional very helpful information.  </li>
            <li> It does smell good and it is non grease and absorbs very effectively, but I do not really have that much cellulite ..</li>
            <li> The first thing I love about the ingredients is that the first ingredient is not water!!</li>
            <li> The cream is nice and soft and it melts into my skin so easily .</li>
            <li> Great product, but don&#x27;t know the long term effects.  </li>
            <li> This is a vegan friendly product all plant and herb based.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this cellulite cream.  </li>
            <li> Not so excited to need it, but</li>
            <li> I am so excited about it,</li>
            <li> I rub it on my body after I clean the area</li>
            <li> It has a clean scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> for that I use the Fat Fader along with the Sweet Sweat and wear the Delfin anti cellulite pants along with waist sweat band.</li>
            <li> So far looks like a nice cream.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> It has a cool feeling</li>
            <li> I do the full wrap once a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, there are no miracle products out there, but if anything comes close, it&#x27;s this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product really will reduce the cottage cheese effect of cellulite and make your skin smoother and more supple, i was given this product to review</li>
            <li> Loving it so far and can already see a difference.</li>
            <li> The product tingles when I put it on and feels cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like a fruity scent and leaves your skin feeling so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs rather quickly</li>
            <li> another plus this lotion is such a powerful combination of what us gals need to make that cellitlite go away for good</li>
            <li> Received product quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of soon to see the difference in the cellulite and stretch marks, but my wife says to tell you that she feels that her skin is not dry</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it works well on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing!!</li>
            <li> I have tried the typical rub on method and it feels great without an over powerful or lingering scent.</li>
            <li> I like the the light airy feel of the cream but just did not do much for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the detailed instructions and recommendations on how to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that products like this exist that can actually help with a problem like this.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the smooth tighter feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a few days now and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it makes my skin feel alive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from the seller for my unbiased reivew</li>
            <li> It smells so minty and it leaves your skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> so I know that the ingredients used for this product is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There are so many natural products that can help your body help itself.  </li>
            <li> Had my 3rd baby  and need to lose 30 pounds to fit into all my cute clothes again.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Honestly it came the next day no waiting whatsoever</li>
            <li> it doesn’t get all over my gym bag because I am taking it with me to the gym and applying it right after coming out of the sauna at the gym.</li>
            <li> I can tell my skin is receiving the product because my skin positively glows!  </li>
            <li> I took a while to write this because I wanted to be true to you as I struggled with cellulite for years tried soooo many products over the years and finally figured out that no one, two or three product worked for me.  </li>
            <li> The larger you are the more quickly</li>
            <li> I am in love with my GO BARE cream.</li>
            <li> So far so good, there is visible difference in the smoothness of my thighs, enough for my husband to notice.</li>
            <li> I very much did so</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what my cellulite free body looks like when I complete this bottle.  </li>
            <li> As for Go Bare I will purchase again as my body seems to love it and responds very well to it.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I basically bought it because it was the most ounces for the price among the different creams and when comparing 2 and 4 ounces to 12 ounces for me</li>
            <li> Very smoothing &amp; tightening!</li>
            <li> Will order the second one for sure</li>
            <li> This really works with consistency!</li>
            <li> This is the first cellulite product.  </li>
            <li> I massage it gently until the cream has been absorbed.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my skin felt silky and now a week</li>
            <li> My first application was</li>
            <li> I am almost finished with my first bottle and have used it every day.</li>
            <li> Accomplished!</li>
            <li> and this is something I wasn&#x27;t aware of</li>
            <li> And you have nothing to lose because it comes with a money back guarantee :)  </li>
            <li> Alone with a cellulite massager, I think it is actually working:)</li>
            <li> Omg this product really works well!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product!    </li>
            <li> My pores seem smaller and are more smoothed over.  </li>
            <li> It makes a difference fast!</li>
            <li> wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Of course it won&#x27;t make magic and will work only with regular use, healthy food and reasonable exercising.</li>
            <li> I do round 2 at night before bed minus the shower but still felt like it was a good rub!!</li>
            <li> (Fun because I love Zumba but tough because I also love cupcakes).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually more like a small indented crater; this product has helped smooth over the edges</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference in appearance or should I say lack of appearance of cellulite on my thighs, my problem cellulite</li>
            <li> I even used it in conjuction with the &amp;#34;Simonida Pure - Cellulite Massager Brush&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But I certainly was hoping for a product that minimized it&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li> I am more concerned about firming my skin and hydration because my skin is very dry.  </li>
            <li> Its fine, didn&#x27;t really do a lot, but I don&#x27;t think my sister used it as religiously as she could have.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at little to no cost in exchange for an HONEST, UNBIASED, &amp; UNPAID review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now and have not seen much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Really like the product and the info that is</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I tried it as soon as I got it because I really don&#x27;t like cellulite</li>
            <li> , i use a hand held massager and really massage in circular motion.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or sticky and blends in really well.</li>
            <li> If you use it correctly now you&#x27;ll definitely be ready for the summer.  </li>
            <li> I really like it a lot....</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much either.</li>
            <li> You really get a lot for your money on this bottle.</li>
            <li> already read to use just remove the plastic and your ready to go.</li>
            <li> I have prime so product came fast.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can turn the pump on and off, so</li>
            <li> Doing squats alone didn&#x27;t really make my cellulite go away.</li>
            <li> it really works</li>
            <li> Very soothing.  </li>
            <li> I used a bottle of lotion held longways to massage the cream into my thighs (think like using a rolling pin) and it really seemed to help.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like is that it absorbs fast into the skin.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was very hesitant to buy this as I don&#x27;t think any of these things work.</li>
            <li> Who wants cellulite?  </li>
            <li> Unless you are absolutely perfection personified you have some cellulite on your body.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This cooling feeling almost tingles; I want to say this is the point at which my pores are opening and absorbing the product.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really dislike when I see reviews 2 or 3 days after use.</li>
            <li> Seems to really work.</li>
            <li> This did not have a very overpowering smell which some do</li>
            <li> and I am kind of bottom heavy.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell like a citrus mint, but subtle.</li>
            <li> It really did better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that I&#x27;ve gotten better results from.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for four weeks and have already seen a significant difference in the areas of cellulite on my thighs and legs.  </li>
            <li> but after using it a few times, I have noticed a big improvement â€“ most specially on my thighs!</li>
            <li> It is super good！My skin became smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> This one has a very strong smell but it does go away after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that if you use it before working out (high cardio) don&#x27;t put on too much.</li>
            <li> I have used creams pretty religiously for most of my adult life and have success with other creams, but  I&#x27;m hooked on this one because it works</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t buy that commercial, although there was always a little doubt and &amp;#34;what ifs&amp;#34; in my head, because I firmly believe that exercise and good eating habits is the way to a healthier and better body.</li>
            <li> but I never thought u would find it until I found this miracle worker I am in love with the cellulite cream after using it for two and a half days</li>
            <li> I feel less self-conscious about my scar and find that I am smiling more.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, does not make your skin chalky and with regular use</li>
            <li> After trying close to a dozen anti-cellulite creams/products in the past year, this is THE ONLY ONE I can honestly say WORKS!</li>
            <li> the pump makes it even easier and mess free to use!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend SpalonTech to anyone reading here.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what this product can do for me over the next month when it has already done so much in the last week!    </li>
            <li> The picture shows left leg had the wrap vs the right leg without the wrap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months religiously now and haven&#x27;t received any positive results!  </li>
            <li> I use it in the morning right after a shower, pores are clean and wide open</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, yet it did not cause any break outs.  </li>
            <li> No magic :-)</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I were heavier perhaps the improvements would be more noticeable.</li>
            <li> on the inner thighs its pretty tender</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I heard about cellulite cream was from a commercial on the TV.</li>
            <li> Cellulite is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I detest writing reviews, but this product is too fantastic not to SHOUT OUT to other women (and THANK the company for making a product that actually works and THANKS to Amazon for carrying it).</li>
            <li> I would suggest giving yourself an at home spa day and do this with some other masks or treatments to accomplish a full body treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff - has certainly smoothed my skin and has helped with my cellulite and faded my spider veins so far.</li>
            <li> You can observe clear improvements within a week.</li>
            <li> Even at the age of 28yrs old.</li>
            <li> Leaved skin feeling soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product in conjunction with working out because the results I have gotten so far is</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I also have been using a hand held tool with soft cone-like material to massage my arms before I use this product.</li>
            <li> No difference so far.</li>
            <li> like the pump on the bottle .. and also like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and have noticeable cellulite on the backs of my thighs and lower abdomen.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly,  not a heavy gunk cream.  </li>
            <li> I have given enough time to work, but it hasn&#x27;t done much on me at all.</li>
            <li> I really feel this seller went above and beyond with their product</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too early to see results</li>
            <li> I picked one with caffeine because that has been long proven to help with the fatty beast, but this one also had a list of natural healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not many!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and not overwhelming another plus.</li>
            <li> Caffeine and Seaweed seems like a strange combination, but in reality both products are VERY helpful to firming and toning your skin.  </li>
            <li> While my skin feels noticeably tighter after just one week, I have not experienced the kind of visual results that I have on my face.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get down to the ingredients and how to right away on this.</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> There truly is no other word to describe this cream.</li>
            <li> this past Friday, it is now Monday and the difference is SIGNIFICANT.</li>
            <li> As long as I use it everyday I notice a huge difference in the appearance on my orange peel and cellulite.</li>
            <li> Bare mornings and evenings along with a anti cellulite oil  found on amazon.</li>
            <li> (only had it three days thus far)...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love that this (unlike other creams ive tried in the past) does not leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my pregnant wife who is dealing with dry skin, stretch marks and a little cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I generally use these creams from April to Sept as part of my &#x27;back in the bathing suit&#x27; ritual.</li>
            <li> This is now my second bottle and I will continue to purchase it as long as i continue to get the results i got so far!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but right away noticed the 100% money back guarantee</li>
            <li> I have cellulite on my thighs, Buttocks, and a little on my stomach, Ive used the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Not only is the dimples less noticeable , my skin is amazingly soft !</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, it did not seem like anything was happening, it tingled for a sec and that was it, after a few days I could see changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this long enough to start seeing results and</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Front of thighs are smooth and hardly any &#x27;lumps&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this is going to last me a very, very long time.    </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and a half thus far ...</li>
            <li> After a week of using this cellulite reduction cream, I noticed a slight reduction of cellulite in my thighs but not to the extent of them completely going away.</li>
            <li> Other days I mix the Fat Fader  and Simonida Pure Body Contouring Cellulite Lotion along with a few drops of the cellulite oil.  </li>
            <li> I am going through a fun and tough weight-loss journey</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes to sink in but leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> I think I can use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> After I use up this bottle, I will go back to one of my two other favorites.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with dry skin since I began using this on my legs.</li>
            <li> I stopped itching from the dry skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this almost everyday for over a week now, so far i have seen no changes, but i will continue to use until bottle is empty</li>
            <li> I used it on my upper thighs and definitely noticed alittle difference, not a whole lot because I just started using but something that you can see a visible difference within a few weeks is always a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves the way her skin feels and plans on using it once baby arrives to tighten up any loose skin.  </li>
            <li> A half pump is enough for me to cover one leg.</li>
            <li> There is a slight cooling sensation that you feel after the cream has settled in and especially after you remove the wraps from your body (in my case thighs and abdomen).</li>
            <li> It is NOT greasy and leaves my skin feeling silky and also helps my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> not so bad, but my DIY mixes work better...</li>
            <li> The lotion has even managed to firm the troublesome inner thigh area.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days.</li>
            <li> but I have seen absolutely no reduction in my cellutlite at all.</li>
            <li> I kind of feel like an idiot for not doing anything</li>
            <li> This cream rubs on like a lotion:  it feels a little thick at first but glides on thin and near liquid-like.  </li>
            <li> I have cellulite in the front and back of my legs, I have bin applying this for a few weeks and can see my skin slightly clearing up.</li>
            <li> Every other day I use the Go</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I thought maybe half of the reviews could be bogus, but after trying this for two weeks I am convinced.</li>
            <li> It does work wonders if you use it consistently everyday or other day for a month while wrapping with plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li> Seems like I&#x27;m seeing slight improvements.</li>
            <li> I have also been using this product on my thighs but the effects seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> She feels like it did help a little bit, but it is no miracle.</li>
            <li> and I see a little difference I have to use it longer</li>
            <li> My cellulite was horrible and the improvement with the help of go bare has made me look in the mirror and smile!</li>
            <li> Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky or irritating in any way which is definitely a plus to me.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money or hopes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I forget to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have just a few pounds to lose.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday... and the smell does not bother me like all the rest of the creams and gels they have out there.</li>
            <li> I am fairly thin and workout regularly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now (to determine it&#x27;s usefulness and whether or not it works.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used this in a few ways.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time or money looking for miracle products.  </li>
            <li> But still had an uneven, kinda bumpy skin on my thighs - every woman&#x27;s nightmare: cellulite...ugg.</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my cheek left behind from chickenpox as a child</li>
            <li> After using this product a few weeks I started noticing change.</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully twice a day for 5 weeks now, along with wrapping, exercise, and drinking a lot of water and green tea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not HUGE,</li>
            <li> Not true!</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle worker, but this cellulite cream can help reduce a lot of those nasty little bubbly areas :)  </li>
            <li> I am not sure that I see an improvement in my legs.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it once a day after I shower and have use scrub over my body.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy these sort of products</li>
            <li> Ehh not sure how I feel I</li>
            <li> I use my thumb and press really hard.  </li>
            <li> but this product is NOT effective.  </li>
            <li> at least 3-4 x per week and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get rashes, negative reactions or flare ups from it -</li>
            <li> I see no real difference and this location was rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> I avoid and dislike greasy beauty products because they feel icky and sticky</li>
            <li> The truth is that it is extremely difficult to eradicate cellulite and one size does NOT fit all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell badly, like some other creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past...</li>
            <li> Currently taking up space in my bathroom :(</li>
            <li> My cellulite vanished within a week, and my skin is firm and supple!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m game to try anything if it will help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do a combination of things so it is difficult to say any one thing.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this cream because all the websites and doctors say it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> just another gimmick probably with fake reviews.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately the lumpy look doesn&#x27;t just disappear.</li>
            <li> (sadly of which I have a lot)</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy</li>
            <li> It is painful and that is because of the toxins ( I just breath and bear it).  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a horrible smell like some lotions have.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 3 for now because it smells awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now and have not seen much of a difference in my skin. I am medium brown skin tone. I like the the light airy feel of the cream but just did not do much for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> All I can say is amazing!</li>
            <li> Really like the product and the info that is&lt;br /&gt;sent thanks</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it makes my skin feel alive.  I&#x27;ve read that the caffeine stimulates blood flow and honestly I can feel my blood flowing in the area where my cellulite is a problem (stomach, buttocks, thighs).  I&#x27;ve been using this long enough to start seeing results and I can&#x27;t wait to see what my cellulite free body looks like when I complete this bottle.  My daughters have both asked for some from Santy and I happen to know their wish will be granted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product that truly combats cellulite, you will be pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  Absorbs quickly, does not make your skin chalky and with regular use ( I recommend visiting their website for instructions and tips ) it works.  I am 43 and have battled cellulite all my life. I have used creams pretty religiously for most of my adult life and have success with other creams, but  I&#x27;m hooked on this one because it works AND it&#x27;s a great value.  The smell is pleasant and it seems to dissipate fairly quickly, which is nice.  As with any cream, I&#x27;ve found that you must drink your water, daily! If not, you will see results, but may not be as pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see that this cream is paraben-free! It doesn&#x27;t smell badly, like some other creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past... also it is creamy and feels great on the skin. I love the pump on the top - it dispenses just the right amount of product. I&#x27;m very happy that SpalonTech sent this to me for review - my problem areas are starting to get better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about two weeks now and already noticed a huge difference. I have very deep cellulite all over my thighs and buttocks and since using the lotion it&#x27;s become noticeably improved. I do want to mention that I exercise regularly and eat well. But I&#x27;ve used similar products at twice the cost and not had any difference. The lotion has even managed to firm the troublesome inner thigh area. It&#x27;s worth every penny and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I love that this (unlike other creams ive tried in the past) does not leave a sticky residue. I get kind of a tightness feeling within minutes after applying which lets me know its working. Plys i love the packaging. the pump makes it even easier and mess free to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff - has certainly smoothed my skin and has helped with my cellulite and faded my spider veins so far. I should be working out more but even so I like the ingredients and will probably use through the summer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I received this complimentary from the seller for my unbiased reivew</li>
            <li> Even at the age of 28yrs old. I have to worry about cellulite especially after having my daughter. Things still have not gone back to where their supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Spalon Tech asked me to review their Cellulite Reduction Cream, I jumped on it. I&#x27;m game to try anything if it will help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps tighten and ton my skin and help reduce the appearance of cellulite. I used it on my upper thighs and definitely noticed alittle difference, not a whole lot because I just started using but something that you can see a visible difference within a few weeks is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that is has aloe and coconut oil is a great mixture for your skin. It&#x27;s not greasy, I love wearing. There isn&#x27;t a horrible smell like some lotions have. It&#x27;s especially great because I ahve extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it and continue to use mine!</li>
            <li> Wonderful. ..&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s not greasy.  Leaved skin feeling soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product ! I am on my second order and I cannot be happier! Not only is the dimples less noticeable , my skin is amazingly soft !</li>
            <li> Went through 2 bottles. With exercise and propee eatinf its a great addition</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of its 5-star reviews only to dissapoint myself!  I have been using this product for 2 months religiously now and haven&#x27;t received any positive results!  I still see dimpling and cellulite!  I even used it in conjuction with the &amp;#34;Simonida Pure - Cellulite Massager Brush&amp;#34; thinking it would help massage out the cellulite fat but nothing!  I am 5&#x27;3 and 138 lbs. so i am not fat, I just have cellulite that I want to get rid of but this product is NOT effective.  Only great thing about it is that is smells good.  I do not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love everything about SpalonTech Cellulite Cream with Caffeine and Seaweed Extract . First the size is great 12 ounces of a spa quality product. The Abundance of anti-oxidants that fight inflammation and algae extract that has over 64 vitamins and minerals, including A, C, E, B12 and B6 to give you healthy skin and so much more. I tried it as soon as I got it because I really don&#x27;t like cellulite and I needed something that would lessen the appearance of it on my thighs. To me the smell is amazing!!! The cream is nice and soft and it melts into my skin so easily . It is not sticky or irritating in any way which is definitely a plus to me. And most importantly SpalonTech Cellulite Cream with Caffeine and Seaweed Extract works. My thighs look much better after over 30 days of use. I will continue with using this product to see what continued use will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received for free in exchange of my honest opinion.*</li>
            <li> I Like the cream, I apply it to my thighs, butt and arms only. It seems instantly tighter and smoother. I don&#x27;t know if that is hopeful thinking or not, but I will keep using it and hope!</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell! I haven&#x27;t used it for an extensive amount of time and really cannot speak to the effectiveness of this lotion, but even if it never takes care of any flaws in my skin, it works great as a moisturizer and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time and it works well, must use all the time to have the effect.</li>
            <li> Its fine, didn&#x27;t really do a lot, but I don&#x27;t think my sister used it as religiously as she could have. She feels like it did help a little bit, but it is no miracle. Don&#x27;t expect a lot out of these products, tho there is some benefit to using caffeine and seaweed extracts. She likes the pump style bottle too, it came on time and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cellulite and wrinkle cream. It smells so minty and it leaves your skin feeling fresh. I got it will it was on promotion but I love it because it just makes my skin look and feel smooth. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, speedy shipping, thanks.A+++</li>
            <li> not so bad, but my DIY mixes work better...wasn&#x27;t a good choice of mine</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a week on the back of my thighs.  I am 5&#x27;4 250 lbs. and wear a size 17/18 in jeans and I am kind of bottom heavy. I use a wooden stimulater that I bought with it and I am already seeing a difference. Not HUGE, but I see myself having very smooth thighs again by the end of summer. :)</li>
            <li> Feels great. Smells great. Doesnt work as promised. Dont waste your money or hopes. I didn&#x27;t see the results that were &amp;#34;100% money back guaranteed&amp;#34;. After sending an email regarding my dissatisfaction, I was told that &amp;#34;sometimes people won&#x27;t see results until the 2nd bottle&amp;#34;. No money back guarantee offered at all.</li>
            <li> I promised these good people I would write a review and I asked them to give a month to try it.  It is now almost two months since I purchased this product.  Here it goes!  The truth is that it is extremely difficult to eradicate cellulite and one size does NOT fit all. I do a combination of things so it is difficult to say any one thing. I go to the gym at least 3-4 x per week and for that I use the Fat Fader along with the Sweet Sweat and wear the Delfin anti cellulite pants along with waist sweat band. Man talk about sweat. When I take off my clothes there is literally a fountain of water that splashes to the ground.  Every other day I use the Go Bare mornings and evenings along with a anti cellulite oil  found on amazon. Other days I mix the Fat Fader  and Simonida Pure Body Contouring Cellulite Lotion along with a few drops of the cellulite oil.  When I&#x27;m rubbing these products on my skin I use my thumb and press really hard.  It is painful and that is because of the toxins ( I just breath and bear it).  It gets more tolerable as the toxins begin to disperse. Please you must make water your best friend as the toxins must be eliminated. I drink a glass of water before during and after treatment and throughout the day. I also do a coffee wrap once per week and I detox with bentonite clay twice per week.  My legs are gorgeous and cellulite FREE.  I took a while to write this because I wanted to be true to you as I struggled with cellulite for years tried soooo many products over the years and finally figured out that no one, two or three product worked for me.  I also do oil pulling every morning.  Read up on it...  For a while I have been using Fat Fader and it works wonders it really melts away the fat but discovered that the combo works best for me. As for Go Bare I will purchase again as my body seems to love it and responds very well to it. I guess the key is to find your best fit.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough. So far looks like a nice cream. No magic :-)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Sometimes I forget to use it everyday. I did notice that if you use it before working out (high cardio) don&#x27;t put on too much. You can feel the effects of the caffeine.  I know it sounds crazy</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using this on my thighs and abdomen to prevent celluliute formation and get rid of what cellulite I have there. It doesnâ€™t work overnight, but after using it a few times, I have noticed a big improvement â€“ most specially on my thighs! I also love the fact that it works well on my sensitive skin! I don&#x27;t get rashes, negative reactions or flare ups from it - so I know that the ingredients used for this product is safe for sensitive skin. I will keep using this product in conjunction with working out because the results I have gotten so far is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. Iâ€™m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end userâ€™s standpoint.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels good to the touch.  It is not greasy.  It has a pleasant smell.  I have been using it for about two weeks now.  I am not sure that I see an improvement in my legs.  I have to say that I am not heavy.  I have just a few pounds to lose.  I am not sure if I were heavier perhaps the improvements would be more noticeable.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product 4x in 2 days. I use it in the morning right after a shower, pores are clean and wide open so i use 3pumps per thigh/buttocks, i use a hand held massager and really massage in circular motion. on the inner thighs its pretty tender but i feel its busting apart the fat cell/cellulite! 5 mins on each leg and then get dressed. I do round 2 at night before bed minus the shower but still felt like it was a good rub!! I am bond and determined to rid my body of cellulite so i will use &amp; reorder till its gone!! Front of thighs are smooth and hardly any &#x27;lumps&#x27;!! Love this product &amp; it smell lovely!!</li>
            <li> works great so far and has a mild minty scent that isn&#x27;t offensive.  Not greasy or sticky and blends in really well.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, and the results are remarkable. I usually apply it once a day after I shower and have use scrub over my body. My thighs are the only place where I can see some cellulite, and after using this product, they feel softer and without those bumps that appear when you put some pressure on your muscles. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought this product  would help me,  but it did not do anything. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and can not see any change.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing!!</li>
            <li> Well i can&#x27;t rate a good right now. I used it a week. I drink lots of water anyway. Still cellulite. So I am going to buy saranwrap. And try it again. I be back to give my review then</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say as to how well this works as a cellulite cream (only had it three days thus far)...I basically bought it because it was the most ounces for the price among the different creams and when comparing 2 and 4 ounces to 12 ounces for me it&#x27;s a no brainer...What I can say is that it has the most wonderful fragrance of any cream I&#x27;ve ever bought and personally I like it.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!! It&#x27;s working!!!!!!! Twice a day for two weeks and 40% improvement!!!!</li>
            <li> It does work wonders if you use it consistently everyday or other day for a month while wrapping with plastic wrap.  If you use it correctly now you&#x27;ll definitely be ready for the summer.  Great product, but don&#x27;t know the long term effects.  I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see if it&#x27;s temporary or permanent.</li>
            <li> Still trying this product .</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Did nothing. Smells terrible. Currently taking up space in my bathroom :(</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.... I use it almost everyday... and the smell does not bother me like all the rest of the creams and gels they have out there. I&amp;#34;ve only been using it for a month but, I think I see results. I took pictures of before and I will take more in another month... It feels good and like I said it smells good.  So lets wait and see... and know I can&#x27;t wait!!!!!  I will be glad to share the news!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product regularly now every morning and night with some deep massaging of it.  I&#x27;ve used various products to help with that dimply look.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite. I am fairly thin and workout regularly but I have some dimpling.  I&#x27;ve used other products that I&#x27;ve gotten better results from.  This one has a very strong smell but it does go away after a few minutes.  After I use up this bottle, I will go back to one of my two other favorites.  As with any of these types of creams, once you stop using them you won&#x27;t see the results.  I generally use these creams from April to Sept as part of my &#x27;back in the bathing suit&#x27; ritual.</li>
            <li> I have been using this almost everyday for over a week now, so far i have seen no changes, but i will continue to use until bottle is empty an keep everyone updated.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the smell of this item, it has a nice minty smell thats not too strong, it also leaves the skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li> my wife has been using it for about a week and it work pretty good</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great! Very smoothing &amp; tightening! Will buy again:)</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days. I also have been using a hand held tool with soft cone-like material to massage my arms before I use this product. I massage in a circular motion until my arms feel warm, and in the area where they are showing signs of sagging with a lumpy kind of look. So far so good. Seems like I&#x27;m seeing slight improvements. Plus I&#x27;m going to ad some arm toning exercises.  I&#x27;ll keep doing this daily and ad to my review.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great tips</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and a half thus far ... I see no real difference and this location was rather expensive.  It does smell good and it is non grease and absorbs very effectively, but I do not really have that much cellulite .. just wanted skin to be more smooth and even.  No difference so far.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now (to determine it&#x27;s usefulness and whether or not it works. I can say it does help decrease the appearance or cellulite. I have included two photos of my  leg. One before starting use and one after the two weeks I have been using it. I have decided to begin using it as an all over lotion to see what it can do for the rest of my body.  You don&#x27;t need much either. A half pump is enough for me to cover one leg. It&#x27;s a very nice creamy smooth lotion with hints of citrus. It absorbs rather quickly (I put it on immediately after showering). This also helps my skin retain moisture. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with dry skin since I began using this on my legs. I feel more confident to show off my legs now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at little to no cost in exchange for an HONEST, UNBIASED, &amp; UNPAID review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lotion like this for years I knew it was out there but I never thought u would find it until I found this miracle worker I am in love with the cellulite cream after using it for two and a half days and I I&#x27;m so delightful that I came across it all you have to do is follow the directions and drink water and you will feel a tingling and the area you put it in thank God I found this miracle lotion so loving it. I noticed I&#x27;ve been using the restroom when I put it on so it does helps removes toxic out of your body I ordered a sauna suit months ago from Amazon and that&#x27;s how I use this amazing lotion I rub it on my body after I clean the area and I put my sauna suit for 1hour and you can feel the sensation &amp; tingling of it working.  And it smells great I will be placing another order soon.  I WOULD GIVE THIS 10 STARS IF I COULD</li>
            <li> Hi everyone, This cream is exceptionally good, and it&#x27;s came in huge jar, it&#x27;s make it the skin smothers and thight, I will recommend to everyone&#x27;s who&#x27;s  need it.Regards Adriana!</li>
            <li> It works!!  Used this product on some cellulite on the back of my legs.  With two weeks I noticed they were more faint.  I wish I had taken a before and after.  I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, but would buy at full price!</li>
            <li> Really good cream for toning. Of course it won&#x27;t make magic and will work only with regular use, healthy food and reasonable exercising. Will order the second one for sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle do not expect it to just shrink inches off your body! It is a very nice lotion that easily rubs in and it is not greasy feeling. Let&#x27;s get down to the ingredients and how to right away on this. The first thing I love about the ingredients is that the first ingredient is not water!! How many bottles of any lotion can boast that? Not many!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and not overwhelming another plus. This is a vegan friendly product all plant and herb based. The price compared to others out there is awesome! The bottle is huge! You really get a lot for your money on this bottle. It is really a really good lotion. Now for it to work best your going to need to follow the directions. The product is made in the USA. It has over 64 vitamins and minerals wow!!!! Now that is packed full of some pretty impressive stuff there!  The pump works great comes already read to use just remove the plastic and your ready to go. The product works by stimulating blood flow. If your looking for a product to help your skin become more healthier this is it. I did get this item free of charge to review it however does not effect my opinion on the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Not sticky at all, my skin feels smooth!</li>
            <li> Love it, you have to do your part as well though!! Exercise, diet and wrap up in plastic wrap!</li>
            <li> This really works with consistency!</li>
            <li> I have seen improvement and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> Love this. nice refreshing scent..works great</li>
            <li> Awesome product and price! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the first cellulite product.  Didn’t think I would need it at the age of 30, but I do! I have prime so product came fast. Product smells good, kind of a minty citrus. I really like that I can turn the pump on and off, so it doesn’t get all over my gym bag because I am taking it with me to the gym and applying it right after coming out of the sauna at the gym. Skin feels real smooth and silky and noticed a difference in my cellulite after the first week of using it. The ebook that came with the order gives great tips.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to reduce the appearance of cellulite and came across SpalonTech. I was skeptical at first, but right away noticed the 100% money back guarantee so I had nothing to lose. I used it for about six weeks now and have to say that i&#x27;m more than happy with the very noticeable results. I highly recommend SpalonTech to anyone reading here.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this cream because all the websites and doctors say it won&#x27;t work. Not true! My legs look so much better. Bought two more bottles.</li>
            <li> OMG!  I have tried all kinds of lotions and potions, but this lotion was like a miracle!  My cellulite vanished within a week, and my skin is firm and supple!!! Worth every dime!!!!</li>
            <li> I have cellulite around my upper thighs and under my buttocks. What do I do? Squats. BUT! Doing squats alone didn&#x27;t really make my cellulite go away. In fact, my legs have shrunk a bit after losing 10+ lbs but the cellulite doesn&#x27;t seem to go away. I still have dimply thighs and that&#x27;s where the cellulite cream by SpalonTech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I heard about cellulite cream was from a commercial on the TV. I saw these skinny models twirling and showing of their cellulite-free legs which is because of the cellulite cream they were advertising. I really didn&#x27;t buy that commercial, although there was always a little doubt and &amp;#34;what ifs&amp;#34; in my head, because I firmly believe that exercise and good eating habits is the way to a healthier and better body. To satisfy my what ifs and doubts, I tried SpalonTech&#x27;s Cellulite Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cellulite reduction cream by SpalonTech has a white and creamy consistency. It has an initial minty/citrus-y scent and later on, the minty scent goes away. It absorbs very quickly and is non-greasy. I avoid and dislike greasy beauty products because they feel icky and sticky so I&#x27;m glad this is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this to my thighs and under my buttocks twice a day. I massage it gently until the cream has been absorbed. It has a cool feeling and I like that it moisturizes my skin too. After a week of using this cellulite reduction cream, I noticed a slight reduction of cellulite in my thighs but not to the extent of them completely going away. The dimples aren&#x27;t as noticeable as before but they&#x27;re still there. I do think this cream helped because by doing squats alone, my cellulite and dimples were still there. With this cream, I noticed an improvement on my thighs. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest relying on this cream alone for cellulite though because I still believe that good eating habits and exercise are the key to a healthier body. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free product to test and try however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> Cellulite is exactly the same.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used this in a few ways. I have tried the typical rub on method and it feels great without an over powerful or lingering scent. The best way to use it is the recommended use on the packaging and wrapping your body up after application. This comes out the best results and you can see it right away. Your skin is more plump and smooth. This method is the best, but can be time consuming. I do the full wrap once a week or when I have somewhere to go and need that extra confidence. I would suggest giving yourself an at home spa day and do this with some other masks or treatments to accomplish a full body treatment. (Multitask it) It makes my abs smoother and all of my skin looks younger. I love the bottle design with the pump. It makes application that much more easier. There is a slight cooling sensation that you feel after the cream has settled in and especially after you remove the wraps from your body (in my case thighs and abdomen). The picture shows left leg had the wrap vs the right leg without the wrap. I really appreciate the detailed instructions and recommendations on how to use. I received this for review, however it does not effect my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> love this cream...it really works</li>
            <li> I use on my clients for their Lypossage treatment.. . smells nice... like the pump on the bottle .. and also like that it has natural ingredients. .. I would order again.</li>
            <li> just another gimmick probably with fake reviews.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time or money looking for miracle products.  This doesn&#x27;t work. I usually don&#x27;t buy these sort of products but I had a moment.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this cellulite cream.  Not so excited to need it, but what the heck.  I got it today and it is a fantastic product!  It is so silk and creamy.  The caffeine and seaweed extract act to reduce inflammation to prevent and reduce cellulite.  It&#x27;s great and it feels so good going on.  Very soothing.  It&#x27;s amazing that products like this exist that can actually help with a problem like this.  I kind of feel like an idiot for not doing anything but I had not heard of this combination until about a week ago.  There are so many natural products that can help your body help itself.  Very happy I found this.</li>
            <li> I have cellulite on my thighs, Buttocks, and a little on my stomach, Ive used the whole bottle and I havent seen any difference. I weigh 130 lbs so I thought that this cream would be helpful.</li>
            <li> Using about 2 weeks, I do see some difference, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am loving this cream! Great scent, not greasy and I&#x27;m starting to see results.</li>
            <li> I can see some difference already. It feels great going on and you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the skin. Takes a few minutes to sink in but leaves the skin soft. It has a peppermint type smell, it was something I had to get used to but now I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is working or not. I&#x27;m giving it a 3 for now because it smells awful. I don&#x27;t want to leave the house after I&#x27;ve put it on.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in 2 days. My sister in law recommended this product because she is feeling the difference in her skin using it.  I am more concerned about firming my skin and hydration because my skin is very dry.  After the first use, my skin felt silky and now a week I stopped itching from the dry skin and I really like the smooth tighter feeling.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my pregnant wife who is dealing with dry skin, stretch marks and a little cellulite.  The product came quickly and customer service has been great when she called to ask a question.  She loves the way her skin feels and plans on using it once baby arrives to tighten up any loose skin.  It is kind of soon to see the difference in the cellulite and stretch marks, but my wife says to tell you that she feels that her skin is not dry and she doesn’t feel the pulling sensation from the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. There truly is no other word to describe this cream. I am 31 years old and have noticeable cellulite on the backs of my thighs and lower abdomen. I have recently lost 35+ lbs and unfortunately the lumpy look doesn&#x27;t just disappear. I rolled the dice on this cream, having never used a cellulite cream before. I am so glad i did. My first application was this past Friday, it is now Monday and the difference is SIGNIFICANT. I used a bottle of lotion held longways to massage the cream into my thighs (think like using a rolling pin) and it really seemed to help. I have used it twice daily the last 4 days and i am just amazed at the difference. It has given me so much more confidence already. The only thing i am unsure of (and tried looking for info online about the product) is once you have obtained your desired result, how often do you have to keep up with the cream or do you NEED to? Will the results last or is this a temporary fix? Hopefully someone can help me out with that. It&#x27;s true, there are no miracle products out there, but if anything comes close, it&#x27;s this stuff. 110% recommend.</li>
            <li> Works better than Bliss Fat Girl Slim Cream</li>
            <li> Ehh not sure how I feel I this</li>
            <li> I use this in a body wrap ,and sit in my sauna suite ,for a hour and it works amazing for me I do wish you can get this in a bigger size to last longer ,I will order again seller is great and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like this cream as much as I do. The first thing I noticed and loved was the pump nozzle, each pump dispenses the perfect amount. Another thing I like is that it absorbs fast into the skin. I don&#x27;t like to have to wait to get dressed after applying any creams. It does have a &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; scent to it but once you massage it into the skin it&#x27;s barely noticeable. I wear scented lotions and it doesn&#x27;t overpower the scents of my lotions. I no there&#x27;s no cure for cellulite, but this cream has definitely shown results in diminishing the appearance of cellulite on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it actually works. I&#x27;m 43 and have cellulite on my thighs, buttocks, and stomach. I am almost finished with my first bottle and have used it every day. I would say about 40% of my cellulite has been reduced. I&#x27;m going to continue with hopes of reducing even more. I truly am amazed.</li>
            <li> Had my 3rd baby  and need to lose 30 pounds to fit into all my cute clothes again. Accomplished! But still had an uneven, kinda bumpy skin on my thighs - every woman&#x27;s nightmare: cellulite...ugg. I thought or sure working out would fix, but it didn&#x27;t. Ordered this cream and it has been great. I picked one with caffeine because that has been long proven to help with the fatty beast, but this one also had a list of natural healthy ingredients. So far so good, there is visible difference in the smoothness of my thighs, enough for my husband to notice. Leaves my skin hydrated which has been a challenge with breastfeeding. Pleasant smell like a citrus mint, but subtle.</li>
            <li> Seeing some results will probably reorder.</li>
            <li> Cellulite? where? This product really will reduce the cottage cheese effect of cellulite and make your skin smoother and more supple, i was given this product to review and I love it.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was very hesitant to buy this as I don&#x27;t think any of these things work. after two weeks of using it AM and PM I def say some changes. They were not drastic but some... also i workout 5 days a week so maybe it was a combination of the two.</li>
            <li> Cellulite?  Who wants cellulite?  Who has cellulite?  Can anyone ACTUALLY say no to that question?  I doubt it.  Unless you are absolutely perfection personified you have some cellulite on your body.  But you CAN do something about it.  It is not a miracle worker, but this cellulite cream can help reduce a lot of those nasty little bubbly areas :)  Comes in a nice large pump bottle so you can just get what you need and you can use it anywhere.  Caffeine and Seaweed seems like a strange combination, but in reality both products are VERY helpful to firming and toning your skin.  Thighs, upper arms, chin ... wherever you need it just apply and give it a week or so and you will see some results.  The larger you are the more quickly you will notice results, but it does help everyone.  This product is also paraben-free and it smells so nice, it&#x27;s like a fruity scent and leaves your skin feeling so fresh and clean.  Surprisingly and this is something I wasn&#x27;t aware of is that the ingredients in this cream can also help reduce inflammation - so if you suffer from any kind of disease that causes inflammation this can reduce it!  And you have nothing to lose because it comes with a money back guarantee :)  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this stuff! Alone with a cellulite massager, I think it is actually working:)</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing. I detest writing reviews, but this product is too fantastic not to SHOUT OUT to other women (and THANK the company for making a product that actually works and THANKS to Amazon for carrying it). After trying close to a dozen anti-cellulite creams/products in the past year, this is THE ONLY ONE I can honestly say WORKS! YAY!!! My skin looks and feels incredible: much smoother, softer, healthier looking with cellulite AND INCHES visibly disappearing. I can tell I&#x27;m losing inches as I look slimmer and my clothes are fitting better. This is better than a successful diet as you lose inches AND your skin gets firmer. You will not regret this purchase. A+ Product!</li>
            <li> I am very, very  happy with the results. This is now my second bottle and I will continue to purchase it as long as i continue to get the results i got so far! The seller contacted me for feedback and provided some great tips to go alone with the lotion... drink a lots of water and incorporate some exercise for much faster and better results:-)</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother though I haven&#x27;t seen any result with the cellulite yet</li>
            <li> Omg this product really works well!</li>
            <li> Love it awesome product</li>
            <li> So far so good - I do see a reduction in cellulite so far...and I&#x27;m very happy about it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works well.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far and can already see a difference. Can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s to come</li>
            <li> big size. I think I can use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Just started using but so far I&#x27;m happy. It smells fantastic without overwhelming your perfume and obsorbs very quickly. To soon for results but I&#x27;m pleased so far. Update: I&#x27;ve now purchased it again since I&#x27;m so pleased with the product. As long as I use it everyday I notice a huge difference in the appearance on my orange peel and cellulite. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product!    This cream rubs on like a lotion:  it feels a little thick at first but glides on thin and near liquid-like.  The lotion smells like a mixture of aloe, eucalyptus, seaweed, and peppermint.  The product tingles when I put it on and feels cool to the touch.  This cooling feeling almost tingles; I want to say this is the point at which my pores are opening and absorbing the product.    I can tell my skin is receiving the product because my skin positively glows!  My pores seem smaller and are more smoothed over.  I have a scar on my cheek left behind from chickenpox as a child and it&#x27;s actually more like a small indented crater; this product has helped smooth over the edges and it&#x27;s gone from being a noticeable crater to more of a divot.  I feel less self-conscious about my scar and find that I am smiling more.  My friends and family have noticed it too, and my husband is ecstatic.  I am excited to see what this product can do for me over the next month when it has already done so much in the last week!    Because this product glides on smooth I have only been using one pump to cover my entire face.  Since this is a 12oz bottle (as a point of reference soda cans are 8oz) I have no doubt that this is going to last me a very, very long time.    I have also been using this product on my thighs but the effects seem less noticeable.  I would say I have arguably what one might consider cellulite-ridden \\&quot;cottage cheese\\&quot; thighs.  I have always been embarrassed to show them in public and I never wear shorts unless I can avoid it.  While my skin feels noticeably tighter after just one week, I have not experienced the kind of visual results that I have on my face.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my GO BARE cream. I started noticing results after 3 applications. I make sure I drink the water they recommend. I am so excited about it, that now I wait for evening to come so I can apply it again. I catch myself looking in the mirror more than once a day! Well, I have not tried wrapping myself up yet, but  this is on my list. I will come back and update the review with the results. I also love the smell!</li>
            <li> Honestly it came the next day no waiting whatsoever another plus this lotion is such a powerful combination of what us gals need to make that cellitlite go away for good but like a lot of stuff out there you gotta want it and dang it stick by it don&#x27;t just use it 2or3 times and cry to mommy cause ya put a ton on ur legs then put clothes and let it absorb into ur clothes that&#x27;s not helping at all. I PROMISE EVERYONE THAT STICKS WITH GO BARE will achieve great results this lotion isn&#x27;t liie the others it actually has spa techs that give you great help and see that you thru ur journey and me myself wow im so greatful for gobare cuz now I look n mirror and see such great results on myself but ya just have to stuck with this product they help you understand stuff and im so happy now im going to be cellulite free and a lot healthier and gals so much good comes out of just sticking with this potion lotion.. cause they actually know what their talking bout. so get this lotion if your wanting to get rid of your cellulite like I very much did so what are you waitin for get this lotion gals everyone needs this lotion</li>
            <li> I have cellulite in the front and back of my legs, I have bin applying this for a few weeks and can see my skin slightly clearing up. I use it in the morning and at night.  When I first applied it, it did not seem like anything was happening, it tingled for a sec and that was it, after a few days I could see changes to my skin. The company emailed me tips on maximizing my results I thought that was nice. I will continue buying this product because it  seems to work well for me.</li>
            <li> It is super good！My skin became smooth and tight. I run 30min a day and drink a lot of water. You can observe clear improvements within a week.</li>
            <li> Wow! This product is amazing! It makes a difference fast! My clients LOVE it. I already bought 3 to give away. I got the product delivered in 1 day! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I  noticed a firmness on the skin of my thighs about three weeks in.  It goes on smoothly,  not a heavy gunk cream.  Smells nice. I definitely would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Have not seen results as described in ad. Not very pleased. I have given enough time to work, but it hasn&#x27;t done much on me at all.</li>
            <li> I really dislike when I see reviews 2 or 3 days after use. This is why I waited a month before leaving a review, in order to give a fair review on my part. After using this product a few weeks I started noticing change. After week 2 I also added collagen pills. I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use. I&#x27;m not were I was but still have a ways to go. My cellulite was horrible and the improvement with the help of go bare has made me look in the mirror and smile!</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully twice a day for 5 weeks now, along with wrapping, exercise, and drinking a lot of water and green tea. It&#x27;s a nice lotion, my skin feels good and not dry but I have seen absolutely no reduction in my cellutlite at all.</li>
            <li> Seems to really work. Tightens my skin. Definitely fees like my skin toned up. Definitely worth buying!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for four weeks and have already seen a significant difference in the areas of cellulite on my thighs and legs.  The lotion has a very pleasant scent and absorbs and moisturizes my skin without leaving a greasy feeling.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I know there is no permanent cure for \\&quot;cellulite\\&quot;.  But I certainly was hoping for a product that minimized it&#x27;s appearance.  And this product did just that.  It really did better than I expected.  It goes on very smooth.  Absorbs without a \\&quot;greasy&#x27; feeling.  It has a very faint pleasant aroma. I have very sensitive skin, yet it did not cause any break outs.  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference in appearance or should I say lack of appearance of cellulite on my thighs, my problem cellulite area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after I ordered, I also received an ebook that had some great information on Cellulite.  It had tips for how to get the best possible results from the product as well as some additional very helpful information.  I really feel this seller went above and beyond with their product and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve used the product for a few days now and my skin feels great. I think it&#x27;s too early to see results but I think it&#x27;s already working! I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly.  It has a clean scent that is not overpowering.  It is NOT greasy and leaves my skin feeling silky and also helps my very dry skin.  After only a few days of use it is too soon to notice much difference in my cellulite  (sadly of which I have a lot) but I do see and feel some difference in firmness and texture.  Looking forward to the final results ~ Barb</li>
            <li> I am going through a fun and tough weight-loss journey (Fun because I love Zumba but tough because I also love cupcakes). It seemed that no matter how many squats or lunges I did, the cellulite was here to stay, so I was excited to give this a try. Now, honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen a gigantic difference, but I can tell it&#x27;s helping. The formula is nice too! It&#x27;s smooth but not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Great. It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This did not have a very overpowering smell which some do which was nice, it went on smooth and was not oily or had a lot of residue.  I am hoping for good results if not it still is a great lotion!</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on Amazon reviews. At first I was skeptical because I thought maybe half of the reviews could be bogus, but after trying this for two weeks I am convinced. When you try it, it tingles and feels what I could best describe as a cool, menthol feel. It has a citrus smell, which might put off some people but I like it and don&#x27;t mind it at all. I workout and eat a balanced diet but still have problems with cellulite, after using this cream for two weeks I do see a difference in my dimples and I feel my cellulite has smoothed out. Not to say I am 100% dimple free but I do feel that this cream has made a difference, and I am very pleased with my two week results, I plan to continue using this cream to get the maximum results out of it, since it&#x27;s only been two weeks. I also plan to reorder, I am convinced this cream works.</li>
            <li> I have bin using this product for only two weeks and I see a little difference I have to use it longer but it looks like it&#x27;s going to work better the longer I use it.</li>
