            <li>Its good, smell fresh</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>My son has eczema, and most shampoos appeared to bother him and irritate his scalp.  </li>
            <li>The low PH of this shampoo has eliminated any irritation and leaves his hair beautiful and shiny!</li>
            <li>Smells great and is safe for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My kids love bubble baths, if there is no bubble bath they protest, and the bottles are huge, and will get tons of uses out of it.</li>
            <li>Great product for babies with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Everything is very mild of smell, even the lotion and the cream.</li>
            <li>and I  am super glad I did.</li>
            <li>Found out our 2.5 yr old was allergic to L&#x27;oreal kids shampoo...swapped to this and was delighted to find that it smells great, cleanses well, and is safe for our son -- no allergic reaction (dry patches or swollen lymph nodes).</li>
            <li>I have had to use fragrance free soaps</li>
            <li>Great smell and very gentle on my 1 month old.</li>
            <li>Great on flacks and dry skin.</li>
            <li>went through many different soaps and shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Our kids are so set for the next few months which is awesome, I even stole some for my bubble bath the other night, take a break from the strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>I had tried many different shampoos, lotions, oils, olive oil, some days he would walk around looking like a total greaser.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x60;s skin is sensitive and having rash if we would use other than Sebamed kids shampoo :)</li>

            <li>Within 2 weeks of using seba lotion and shampoo his skin is soft.</li>
            <li>No other brand has come closer.</li>
            <li>it is expensive but the emotional cost of uncontrolled eczema is far greater.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so do my kids, we use the wash and the lotions and our issues with dry itchy skin are gone.  </li>

            <li> Smells great and is safe for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin. Found out our 2.5 yr old was allergic to L&#x27;oreal kids shampoo...swapped to this and was delighted to find that it smells great, cleanses well, and is safe for our son -- no allergic reaction (dry patches or swollen lymph nodes).</li>
            <li> My son&#x60;s skin is sensitive and having rash if we would use other than Sebamed kids shampoo :) We love this product :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get rid of the cradle cap like I read it would, but I do like the smell.</li>
            <li> it was more than very good, thank you   It is the best for children, I like it very much   thank you again</li>
            <li> Went to Costco one day and there was a vendor selling this.  My 1 yr old had dandruff/ cradle cap and nothing I tried got rid of it.  I had tried many different shampoos, lotions, oils, olive oil, some days he would walk around looking like a total greaser.  Anyway the lady said this stuff would get rid of it.  Within 2 days it was gone and it has never returned.  I have sensitive skin and so do my kids, we use the wash and the lotions and our issues with dry itchy skin are gone.  This wash has a pleasant smell which is nice since so many years I have had to use fragrance free soaps but this brand gives me no problems at all.</li>
            <li> My son used to get rashes, heat rash and eczema esp after a bath he used to have rashes all over his body especially around his neck, upper chest.  Within 2 weeks of using seba lotion and shampoo his skin is soft. He does not break out on rashes after a bath. I am so glad that my sister and I ran into them at costco. I was not up for it but my sister said this is a German  products you should give it a try and I  am super glad I did.</li>
            <li> They sent me a ton of product from one each of every area for children, baby, &amp; more. Everything safe for ones with sensitive skin, very mild cleanser, perfect PH levels, and best of all no tear as well. My kids love bubble baths, if there is no bubble bath they protest, and the bottles are huge, and will get tons of uses out of it. Everything is very mild of smell, even the lotion and the cream. Plus this isn’t tested on animals so thats always a plus in our home. Our kids are so set for the next few months which is awesome, I even stole some for my bubble bath the other night, take a break from the strong fragrances. The shampoo’s formula is very light weight, and you just need a dab on the sponge and will wash both the kiddo’s, the cleansing bar which is great for our oldest who hates any water or body wash around him. The cleansing bar helps him, and makes it less of a fight when it comes to cleaning. We just throw it into a ziploc when we are done. All these products are amazing and work wonderfully on our munchkins.</li>
            <li> My toddler has a very sensitive skin and scalp. We tried a lot of shampoos and even her pediatrician prescribed some creams but nothing seemed to work until I went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist recommended it. It&#x27;s the only thing that has work since than. Love it.</li>
            <li> Its good, smell fresh</li>
            <li> Normally love their products, but my son has bad eczema and this just made him more itchy. Figured out too late to get refund :(  lotion and cream are great though.</li>
            <li> Great product for babies with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my kids after I bought mine at costco.  It is a good product, I just wish the price was a bit lower</li>
            <li> My son had severe eczema.  went through many different soaps and shampoos.  Sebamed worked for him.  eczema gone. happy baby equals happy mom and dad.  it is expensive but the emotional cost of uncontrolled eczema is far greater.</li>
            <li> It smells good and seems there are lots of content items that can help clam baby. I don&#x27;t know that works PR not, but my baby loves them.</li>
            <li> Great smell and very gentle on my 1 month old. Great on flacks and dry skin. Will continue to use all products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite shampoo. She uses it everyday for our baby. It&#x27;s very hypoallergenic. Recommended for everyday use. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema, and most shampoos appeared to bother him and irritate his scalp.  The low PH of this shampoo has eliminated any irritation and leaves his hair beautiful and shiny!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo we have ever tried. No other brand has come closer. OK a bit pricey, but it is a really great product.</li>
