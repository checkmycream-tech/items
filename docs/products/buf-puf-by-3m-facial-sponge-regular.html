            <li>These are all i ever use and i love them!!</li>
            <li>So popular in the 90&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it showed up on the fist page(best selling product) + it had a good rating as well.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for foot?  </li>
            <li>Tried them, loved them.</li>
            <li>The thickness is good too, easier to grasp.</li>
            <li>so I began the hunt for a good exfoliating sponge or cloth and stumbled across the Buf Puf.</li>
            <li>Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li>If that becomes famous I want MONEY!</li>
            <li>It is \\&quot;rough\\&quot; so that it is effective.</li>
            <li>I personally liked it.</li>
            <li>kind, cause after using it \\&quot;once\\&quot;, or twice, it goes</li>
            <li>and I just love the thing.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love that).  </li>
            <li>This cleanses my face well, I love it.</li>
            <li>Exfoliation is perfect, rough vs. soft side of the sponge is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Over 30, for sure.</li>
            <li>It is much better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the BEST!!</li>
            <li>I love the product and use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>I felt it was so much better than using a washcloth or a cleanser by itself.</li>
            <li>Truly, I don&#x27;t know why more people never used this product nor why 3M has decided to limit where they sell them.</li>
            <li>this is the best facial sponge and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying they do the magic</li>
            <li>I feel much better each time I use it rather than using my body sponge on my face.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Love these sponges.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>This works :-)</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s a genuine miracle worker!</li>
            <li>I love to use these on my face.  </li>
            <li>but i love them</li>
            <li>It was just okay.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Buf Puf plus Clearasil is sure to make you face smooth like a babies ass!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m coining that!</li>
            <li>I decided on this product because of the great reviews and I have to say so far I cannot agree more.</li>
            <li>With the trend now of battery operated facial cleaners-I was very delighted to find a product that I have always used.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s made a marked, noticeable difference on the skin, but it feels very nice and works well.</li>
            <li>Works great daily- much better than a wash cloth and a lot cheaper than buying replacement heads for my Clarsonic.</li>
            <li>This over priced sponge works fine.</li>
            <li>(smooth skin all over, no bumps or stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Just rub lightly in circular motions.  </li>
            <li>and yes they r cheaply made.</li>
            <li>great facial sponge!  </li>
            <li>fantastic they are</li>
            <li>Have used these for years but they are no longer available in my country.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are fabulous for the shower.</li>
            <li>LEAVES YOUR FACE FEELING SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>FANTASTIC ITEM.</li>
            <li>so my dermatologist recommended that I scrub the areas using this sponge in a circular motion each day then follow through with a daily moisturizer and its working great.</li>
            <li>Simple but effective!</li>
            <li>I have not found the original in a drugstore.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice to always have a new one on hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really clean your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is totally clean unless I exfoliate.</li>
            <li>If you want a clean face, this is your product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I was using a similar product that was not as good since for years</li>
            <li>My skin is very fine textured, soft, smooth, and youthful.  </li>
            <li>It was so nice to start using a fresh new one.</li>
            <li>It is the very best, Buf-Puf \\&quot;regular facial sponge\\&quot; that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ever used.</li>
            <li>IT GIVES MY SKIN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GLOW, I CAN&#x27;T LIVE</li>
            <li>I have used a Buf-Puf for many years and was really happy last year to discover the actual product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are kind of pricey, and need to be replaced every couple of weeks, as they get kind of icky, but my skin just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean without them.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so smooth and clean, I just love this product, Use with any facial cleanser,  After skin is cleaned</li>
            <li>Start with gentle motions and increase pressure as you are comfortable.    </li>
            <li>I just feel my face and neck are cleaner and ready to accept the coconut oil I smooth on them.</li>
            <li>It is one of those rare products which works well, yet is simple to use, does not require electricity or recharging, is always handy and can go anywhere.  </li>
            <li>it is worth buying them on line and paying the shipping.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have a specific sponge just for your face.</li>
            <li>I rarely find these in any stores these days</li>
            <li>think there are many reasons I look so young -- good diet, genetics, not smoking, and really taking care of my skin, but I think that exfoliating is the key.  </li>
            <li>GENTLE WIPE IN A CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR FAVORITE SOAP OR FACIAL CLEANSER AND \\&quot;BAM\\&quot;, NICE CLEAN, SOFT SKIN.</li>
            <li>Have tried other similar products, but Buf-Puf is by far the best for a clean, smooth and silky skin.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use it every day, pretty rough on this 65 year old skin, but sure does a nice job of exfoliating when I do use it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, not too rough, not too soft.</li>
            <li>so you must use very gently otherwise</li>
            <li>They arent to hard and they exfoliate great.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to buy this one for first time, then I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.</li>
            <li>I have exfoliated for more than 20 years -- using buf puf and similar products, as well as fruit acid peels, Skyn exfoliating wipes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Replace it regularly and use with your favorite cleansing gels or creams.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin almost all the time</li>
            <li>it feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have used Buff Puffs for many many years but they are hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>they do not do a good job and last only about 10 uses.</li>
            <li>Works very well to clean and exfoliate without being overly abrasive - even on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it almost every day to remove all impurities and my skin is super soft!</li>
            <li>Not as thick or large, but they are definitely good on the scrubbing.     </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve tried to use this gently(not giving too much pressure + making a circle) it will irritate your skin.    </li>
            <li>It can be very abrasive if you use it without soap.  </li>
            <li>The pressure you use determines how much \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; you get.</li>
            <li>I really did think they discontinued it</li>
            <li>and it has been working really well.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>However, I switched to chemical exfoliation because I don&#x27;t like thinking of how much damage rubbing an abrasive object over my skin is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive that long term use has resulted in far fewer wrinkles than many of my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; friends.</li>
            <li>I know people have said those other ones don&#x27;t come close, but I feel out of all the generic knockoffs, this one is fairly comparable.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it with \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap and sometimes with special facial soaps.</li>
            <li>you have not exfoliated your skin much, it will be more sensitive and it takes time to build up skin strength to tolerate a rough sponge.</li>
            <li>The first time I used a buf-puf, I was probably 14 years old.</li>
            <li>I feel so clean coming out of the shower, and coupled with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer I have not had a single new breakout (on my face) since I started using the Buf Puf!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since high school</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive skin then I would recommend you to get a gentle one.</li>
            <li>so I do get more dead skin cell build up if I stop.  </li>
            <li>so I lightened up a bit making small gentle circles around my face with my favorite acne cleanser</li>
            <li>Not available in most stores.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT DEEP CLEANS YOUR SKIN WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FORCE,</li>
            <li>The price seemed a little steep for 1 sponge, but it does hold up far better than the knock-offs.  </li>
            <li>I have one note for new users:  </li>
            <li>My only criticism is that is really seems to cost too much for&lt;br</li>
            <li>An older lady told me that I&#x27;m very well spoken for such a young lady, and talked about how we are the future with our whole lives ahead of us.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the regular over the gentle texture pads.  </li>
            <li>kept referring to my husband and I as the \\&quot;young people\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but my last one was very worn out</li>
            <li>After two weeks I have to say it&#x27;s either too early to tell</li>
            <li>/&gt;totally soft.</li>
            <li>my skin is duller, and looks older and more tired.  </li>
            <li>Love the product but $20 plus for postage is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I was at a party last night with people of all ages and the older guests (and some close to my age)</li>
            <li>As I got older, the need and use of the buf-puf subsided as my face cleared up and constant exfoliation wasn&#x27;t needed.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>the only thing is if you have a sensitive face i would go with the sensitive buf puf</li>
            <li>and I was definitely sad as I remembered it was amazing.     </li>
            <li>Definitely start with the buf puf for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Received item much sooner that expected.</li>
            <li>For awhile I couldn&#x27;t find Buf-Puf and I was afraid, like all the really good products I have found, it was no longer being produced.  </li>
            <li>Who would have thought the original Buf-Puf would be so hard to find?  </li>
            <li>so I was rough on my face when I first received the sponge which left me a bit red</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re rough enough to feel exfoliated, but gentle enough to not cause damage.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> GENTLE WIPE IN A CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR FAVORITE SOAP OR FACIAL CLEANSER AND \\&quot;BAM\\&quot;, NICE CLEAN, SOFT SKIN.</li>
            <li> Have tried other similar products, but Buf-Puf is by far the best for a clean, smooth and silky skin.  </li>
            <li> RIGHT.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it every day, pretty rough on this 65 year old skin, but sure does a nice job of exfoliating when I do use it.</li>

            <li> I have exfoliated for more than 20 years -- using buf puf and similar products, as well as fruit acid peels, Skyn exfoliating wipes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Replace it regularly and use with your favorite cleansing gels or creams.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin almost all the time</li>
            <li> it feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have used Buff Puffs for many many years but they are hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> they do not do a good job and last only about 10 uses.</li>
            <li> Works very well to clean and exfoliate without being overly abrasive - even on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day to remove all impurities and my skin is super soft!</li>
            <li> Not as thick or large, but they are definitely good on the scrubbing.     </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve tried to use this gently(not giving too much pressure + making a circle) it will irritate your skin.    </li>
            <li> It can be very abrasive if you use it without soap.  </li>
            <li> The pressure you use determines how much \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; you get.</li>
            <li> I really did think they discontinued it</li>
            <li> and it has been working really well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> However, I switched to chemical exfoliation because I don&#x27;t like thinking of how much damage rubbing an abrasive object over my skin is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive that long term use has resulted in far fewer wrinkles than many of my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; friends.</li>
            <li> I know people have said those other ones don&#x27;t come close, but I feel out of all the generic knockoffs, this one is fairly comparable.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it with \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap and sometimes with special facial soaps.</li>
            <li> you have not exfoliated your skin much, it will be more sensitive and it takes time to build up skin strength to tolerate a rough sponge.</li>
            <li> The first time I used a buf-puf, I was probably 14 years old.</li>
            <li> I feel so clean coming out of the shower, and coupled with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer I have not had a single new breakout (on my face) since I started using the Buf Puf!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since high school</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive skin then I would recommend you to get a gentle one.</li>
            <li> so I do get more dead skin cell build up if I stop.  </li>
            <li> so I lightened up a bit making small gentle circles around my face with my favorite acne cleanser</li>
            <li> Not available in most stores.  </li>
            <li> I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT DEEP CLEANS YOUR SKIN WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FORCE,</li>
            <li> The price seemed a little steep for 1 sponge, but it does hold up far better than the knock-offs.  </li>
            <li> I have one note for new users:  </li>
            <li> My only criticism is that is really seems to cost too much for&lt;br</li>
            <li> An older lady told me that I&#x27;m very well spoken for such a young lady, and talked about how we are the future with our whole lives ahead of us.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the regular over the gentle texture pads.  </li>
            <li> kept referring to my husband and I as the \\&quot;young people\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> but my last one was very worn out</li>
            <li> After two weeks I have to say it&#x27;s either too early to tell</li>
            <li> /&gt;totally soft.</li>
            <li> my skin is duller, and looks older and more tired.  </li>
            <li> Love the product but $20 plus for postage is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was at a party last night with people of all ages and the older guests (and some close to my age)</li>
            <li> As I got older, the need and use of the buf-puf subsided as my face cleared up and constant exfoliation wasn&#x27;t needed.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> the only thing is if you have a sensitive face i would go with the sensitive buf puf</li>
            <li> and I was definitely sad as I remembered it was amazing.     </li>
            <li> Definitely start with the buf puf for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Received item much sooner that expected.</li>
            <li> For awhile I couldn&#x27;t find Buf-Puf and I was afraid, like all the really good products I have found, it was no longer being produced.  </li>
            <li> Who would have thought the original Buf-Puf would be so hard to find?  </li>
            <li> so I was rough on my face when I first received the sponge which left me a bit red</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re rough enough to feel exfoliated, but gentle enough to not cause damage.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower everyday - it is like new after about 2 months.  </li>
            <li> They keep my skin clear, less oily, and blemishes to a minimum.</li>
            <li> The Buf Puf bath sponge is extra rough</li>
            <li> I have even used it - carefully - with the gritty soaps that are made to cleanse the pores.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that it is not available in Canada.    </li>
            <li> Not much product for the price, however.</li>
            <li> I went for a facial a few years ago, and was told that I should exfoliate once a week.</li>
            <li> It is as rough as the dish washing scrubs.</li>
            <li> Durable but way too rough.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day</li>
            <li> Regular hard exfoliation has made my cell turnover faster</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments and this little sponge is my secret!!!</li>
            <li> can use less face wash when I use a BufPuf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a cleanser with microbeads in it to exfoliate my face for years but with little to no success</li>
            <li> But I was really disappointed because it hurts your skin when you use it to clean your face.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my face glows.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that I look no more than 28.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually, i won&#x27;t buy the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works and its not too hard on the skin</li>
            <li> but this one was not good for me.</li>
            <li> I wish I was not so hard to find Buf Puf in Canada!  </li>
            <li> too bad these buf-puf&#x27;s r hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> The Shoppers Drug Mart brand I have to get here are lousy.  </li>
            <li> Then one day at the store, I just had a random memory of the buf-puf, and started to frantically look for it.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find them in the stores.  </li>
            <li> No one needs all of this &amp;#34;regenerist&amp;#34; crap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Who would have thought the original Buf-Puf would be so hard to find?  Amazon was the only place I could find one.  The price seemed a little steep for 1 sponge, but it does hold up far better than the knock-offs.  I use it in the shower everyday - it is like new after about 2 months.  So, I&#x27;m happy to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  They keep my skin clear, less oily, and blemishes to a minimum. Smooths the skin and cleans deep into pores.  I prefer the regular over the gentle texture pads.  They are kind of pricey, and need to be replaced every couple of weeks, as they get kind of icky, but my skin just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean without them.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it showed up on the fist page(best selling product) + it had a good rating as well.  But I was really disappointed because it hurts your skin when you use it to clean your face. Maybe good for foot?  Although I&#x27;ve tried to use this gently(not giving too much pressure + making a circle) it will irritate your skin.    If you are going to buy this one for first time, then I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. If you have a sensitive skin then I would recommend you to get a gentle one. but this one was not good for me.</li>
            <li> I posted this as a comment, but should have posted as a review:  here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not exfoliated your skin much, it will be more sensitive and it takes time to build up skin strength to tolerate a rough sponge. Definitely start with the buf puf for sensitive skin.  I have exfoliated for more than 20 years -- using buf puf and similar products, as well as fruit acid peels, Skyn exfoliating wipes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now 42.  My skin is very fine textured, soft, smooth, and youthful.  I am constantly mistaken for MUCH younger than I am.  I was at a party last night with people of all ages and the older guests (and some close to my age) kept referring to my husband and I as the \\&quot;young people\\&quot;.  An older lady told me that I&#x27;m very well spoken for such a young lady, and talked about how we are the future with our whole lives ahead of us.  This is not a one time thing: it happens to me all the time, and I&#x27;ve had people go speechless when I tell them my age.  I&#x27;ve been told that I look no more than 28.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are many reasons I look so young -- good diet, genetics, not smoking, and really taking care of my skin, but I think that exfoliating is the key.  There have been times I&#x27;ve stopped exfoliating regularly and within a couple of weeks my skin is duller, and looks older and more tired.  Regular hard exfoliation has made my cell turnover faster so I do get more dead skin cell build up if I stop.  I wish I was not so hard to find Buf Puf in Canada!  The Shoppers Drug Mart brand I have to get here are lousy.  The Buf Puf bath sponge is extra rough and I just love the thing.  I exfoliate head to toe (smooth skin all over, no bumps or stretch marks.  Gotta love that).  I have to order these from Amazon now and have them sent cross border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care of your skin and give yourself a facial every week and it WILL pay off.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT DEEP CLEANS YOUR SKIN WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FORCE, GENTLE WIPE IN A CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR FAVORITE SOAP OR FACIAL CLEANSER AND \\&quot;BAM\\&quot;, NICE CLEAN, SOFT SKIN.</li>
            <li> 25 years ago my dermatologist suggested the Buf-puf to exfoliate the skin on my face as a part of a maintenance regieme.  I have had great luck with the product.  My only regret is that it is not available in Canada.    I have one note for new users:  ALWAYS use with sufficient soapy lather.  It can be very abrasive if you use it without soap.  Start with gentle motions and increase pressure as you are comfortable.    Enjoy the fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> These are all i ever use and i love them!! Really clean your face.</li>
            <li> I found some of my mom&#x27;s buf-pufs from probably the 80&#x27;s or 90&#x27;s, unopened. Tried them, loved them. I was relieved to find that they were still being made. This cleanses my face well, I love it. Exfoliation is perfect, rough vs. soft side of the sponge is wonderful. Will definitely be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Buf-Puf for literally YEARS!!  Over 30, for sure. It is much better than a wash cloth. Just rub lightly in circular motions.  It cleans the skin and gets in around the nose and upper lip areas. Of course, stay away from the eye areas. It is \\&quot;rough\\&quot; so that it is effective. I sometimes use it with \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap and sometimes with special facial soaps. I have even used it - carefully - with the gritty soaps that are made to cleanse the pores. For awhile I couldn&#x27;t find Buf-Puf and I was afraid, like all the really good products I have found, it was no longer being produced.  I purchased several of them just in case I should ever have problems finding them, again. It is one of those rare products which works well, yet is simple to use, does not require electricity or recharging, is always handy and can go anywhere.  Simple but effective!</li>
            <li> This over priced sponge works fine.</li>
            <li> Works well as facial exfoliator. Not much product for the price, however.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since high school and it works beautifully. No need for fancy machines, specialty exfoliating scrubs, this item does it all!!  Replace it regularly and use with your favorite cleansing gels or creams. Everyone comments about my skin...including my dermatologist!!! The pressure you use determines how much \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; you get. I use it everyday and my face glows. It&#x27;s simply the BEST!!</li>
            <li> The puff was very coarse so you must use very gently otherwise you may risk tearing your skin.  I love the product and use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> The first time I used a buf-puf, I was probably 14 years old. I felt it was so much better than using a washcloth or a cleanser by itself. It always left my pores feeling scrubbed inside out! As I got older, the need and use of the buf-puf subsided as my face cleared up and constant exfoliation wasn&#x27;t needed.    I went for a facial a few years ago, and was told that I should exfoliate once a week. Then one day at the store, I just had a random memory of the buf-puf, and started to frantically look for it. I really did think they discontinued it and I was definitely sad as I remembered it was amazing.     I actually found something relatively similar at Target in the beauty section, they are facial cleansing sponges and come in a bag of 12. I know people have said those other ones don&#x27;t come close, but I feel out of all the generic knockoffs, this one is fairly comparable. Not as thick or large, but they are definitely good on the scrubbing.     Truly, I don&#x27;t know why more people never used this product nor why 3M has decided to limit where they sell them. Once I realized this, I knew Amazon would have them cause they have everything!!</li>
            <li> this is the best facial sponge and it lasts longer. do not buy the store brand they r cheaper and yes they r cheaply made. they do not do a good job and last only about 10 uses. too bad these buf-puf&#x27;s r hard to find in the store. it is worth buying them on line and paying the shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this sponge for my face, it seems like it does work. I personally liked it. I&#x27;m not saying they do the magic but it&#x27;s nice to have a specific sponge just for your face. I feel much better each time I use it rather than using my body sponge on my face.</li>
            <li> Works very well to clean and exfoliate without being overly abrasive - even on my very sensitive skin. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; like some rave. But then again, I don&#x27;t have severe acne problem - just occasional pimples and blackheads. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s made a marked, noticeable difference on the skin, but it feels very nice and works well.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will purchase more. extremely pleased. Received item much sooner that expected. I highly recommend this for facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> great facial sponge!  the only thing is if you have a sensitive face i would go with the sensitive buf puf</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THESE SPONGES FOR OVER 30 YEARS. IT GIVES MY SKIN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GLOW, I CAN&#x27;T LIVE W/O THEM.</li>
            <li> Thank you for carrying these.  It is impossible to find them in the stores.  Nothing works like a Buff Puff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used buf-pufs for 10+ years.  They&#x27;re great to scrub the day off of your face!  They&#x27;re rough enough to feel exfoliated, but gentle enough to not cause damage.</li>
            <li> This item is as advertised, and of good quality and perfect for using to&lt;br /&gt;exfoliate.  My only criticism is that is really seems to cost too much for&lt;br /&gt;what it is.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges. Can&#x27;t use it every day, pretty rough on this 65 year old skin, but sure does a nice job of exfoliating when I do use it. The thickness is good too, easier to grasp. The skinnier ones are more difficult to handle.</li>
            <li> I am 59 and have been using these puffs since I was in my 30s...fantastic they are</li>
            <li> It is as rough as the dish washing scrubs. enough SAID. wanna see a picture? i use it for scrubbing floors now. not for face or any type of wash for our bodies.</li>
            <li> I rarely find these in any stores these days and I think I have been using Buf-Puf&#x27;s since I was 14. I am now 49 and my step-daughter has always said my skin was the softest she&#x27;d ever touched. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is totally clean unless I exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Did not last two weeks. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Have used these for years but they are no longer available in my country.&lt;br /&gt;They are fabulous for the shower. Love them</li>
            <li> Durable but way too rough. Feels like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin like porcelain. I get so many compliments and this little sponge is my secret!!! I use it almost every day to remove all impurities and my skin is super soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Buf-Puf for years but my last one was very worn out and I could&#x27;t find another. It was so nice to start using a fresh new one. I just feel my face and neck are cleaner and ready to accept the coconut oil I smooth on them.</li>
            <li> It is perfect. It works and its not too hard on the skin and you can tell a difference once you use it. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate!  This works :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now so I feel like I have enough of an idea of how it works to write a review. As a bit of background info, I am in my later twenties and have suffered from acne problems since I was a teenager. I&#x27;d been using a cleanser with microbeads in it to exfoliate my face for years but with little to no success so I began the hunt for a good exfoliating sponge or cloth and stumbled across the Buf Puf. I decided on this product because of the great reviews and I have to say so far I cannot agree more. I have pretty oily skin almost all the time so I was rough on my face when I first received the sponge which left me a bit red so I lightened up a bit making small gentle circles around my face with my favorite acne cleanser and my face has never looked/felt healthier! I feel so clean coming out of the shower, and coupled with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer I have not had a single new breakout (on my face) since I started using the Buf Puf! After two weeks I have to say it&#x27;s either too early to tell or it&#x27;s a genuine miracle worker! I&#x27;ve never been happier with my complexion! I hope it continues to work for me!</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM.  DURABLE.  GETS THE JOB DONE RIGHT.  LEAVES YOUR FACE FEELING SMOOTH.  CLEANS PORES DEEP TO THE CORE.  FANTASTIC ITEM.</li>
            <li> I have used Buff Puffs for many many years but they are hard to find in stores.  I found them online and ordered 12 of them.  I won&#x27;t buy them this way again only because the postage was outragous.  Love the product but $20 plus for postage is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product in stores any longer. Works great daily- much better than a wash cloth and a lot cheaper than buying replacement heads for my Clarsonic. I use buf puf daily.</li>
            <li> I bought the buf-puf sponge to use on the bumps I have on both arms and it has been working really well. I can&#x27;t use medication since I&#x27;m nursing so my dermatologist recommended that I scrub the areas using this sponge in a circular motion each day then follow through with a daily moisturizer and its working great.</li>
            <li> I love to use these on my face.  They arent to hard and they exfoliate great.  I wish i could find these at my drugstore!  These are pricey to me but i love them so i will continue to purchase them. The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, not too rough, not too soft. However, I switched to chemical exfoliation because I don&#x27;t like thinking of how much damage rubbing an abrasive object over my skin is. Recommended if you want a semi-gentle physical exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so smooth and clean, I just love this product, Use with any facial cleanser,  After skin is cleaned it feels soft and smooth.  I would recommend this prouct to anyone.  I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and nothing compares with it.  Have tried other similar products, but Buf-Puf is by far the best for a clean, smooth and silky skin.  I&#x27;m positive that long term use has resulted in far fewer wrinkles than many of my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; friends.</li>
            <li> It was just okay. it didn&#x27;t get rid of my pimples or anything...</li>
            <li> It is the very best, Buf-Puf \\&quot;regular facial sponge\\&quot; that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ever used. I don&#x27;t know where the company gets their&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sponges, or makes them? but they truly last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box looks like Buf boxes that I&#x27;ve seen forever but,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the sponge itself seems  different. Usually, i won&#x27;t buy the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regular kind, cause after using it \\&quot;once\\&quot;, or twice, it goes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;totally soft. However, i was in a hurry so, i just bought&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it anyway.I Will buy again, If the cost does not go up!</li>
            <li> With the trend now of battery operated facial cleaners-I was very delighted to find a product that I have always used.  Not available in most stores.  The pricing made this a very good deal.</li>
            <li> I have used a Buf-Puf for many years and was really happy last year to discover the actual product on Amazon.  I was using a similar product that was not as good since for years I have not found the original in a drugstore.  If you want a clean face, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> This item works MIRACLES om the skin! I use it every other day and I have yet to see a wrinkel.</li>
            <li> So popular in the 90&#x27;s! No one needs all of this &amp;#34;regenerist&amp;#34; crap.  &amp;#34;Buf Puf plus Clearasil is sure to make you face smooth like a babies ass!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m coining that! If that becomes famous I want MONEY!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these locally-- so I buy them 6 at a time.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to always have a new one on hand.&lt;br /&gt;I can use less face wash when I use a BufPuf.</li>
