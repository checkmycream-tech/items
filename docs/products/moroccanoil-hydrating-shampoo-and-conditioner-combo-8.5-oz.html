            <li>And I absolutely love the smell!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazingly luxurious.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>LOVE Moroccan Oil products</li>
            <li>I love both the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>but I needed to make sure others knew what they&#x27;re purchasing.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it, will buy more</li>
            <li>The conditioner is my favorite part.</li>
            <li>but I was actually able to go two days without washing, which never happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a nutshell, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely a top tier product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love then and bought some.  </li>
            <li>Love these products.  </li>
            <li>It costs more than I like to spend</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely, rinses quickly.</li>
            <li>This product did nothing special for my hair!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny, silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe but if you like warm scents, this will make you happy.</li>
            <li>Came very fast !</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It might be to much for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>But then, anything that is a time saver is worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>So, I paid good money for a half full bottle.</li>
            <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li>Made my thick curly hair more manageable and easy to comb out.</li>
            <li>I bought this expensive shampoo and conditioner because I had heard so many amazing things about it.</li>
            <li>Normally I wash my hair every 3 days but the moment after drying my hair I already felt like it needed to be washed again!</li>
            <li>I have hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length, fine but SUPER thick.</li>
            <li>Shampoo not so good too expensive for quality not conditioning properly when take sun light</li>
            <li>but it does last awhile and is really worth it.  </li>
            <li>They sent me 2 leaking bottles of shampoo and still haven&#x27;t fixed the issue.</li>
            <li>If you want to order Moroccan Oil products you must do it directly from the company.</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my hair feel silky soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced this is the real thing because of all the prior reviews.</li>
            <li>Good product, but expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any extra products and it was soft, soft, soft!</li>
            <li>I use this regularly and the product I received was definitely not the real stuff...</li>
            <li>It helps make my hair more manageable and has seriously decreased the frizz.  </li>

            <li> It made my hair so greasy it actually appeared wet!</li>
            <li> It leaves my coarse, thick hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> When I received the shampoo in the mail, the cap was loose.</li>
            <li> Same with the conditioner, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair normally takes forever to blow dry but these products have cut it down by at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed when washing my hair with the shampoo it makes my hair feel very rough and dry</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying if you have naturally frizzy hair because it just makes the friz worse.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> If this is in fact authentic it is horrible!</li>
            <li> I usually have to use a lot of shampoo</li>
            <li> Not sure that I can use it every time I shampoo because of the cost</li>
            <li> The gel its another issue has castor oil that never good for the hair.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t soooooo expensive</li>
            <li> but because this is expensive, I started out with about a quarter size.</li>
            <li> &quot; I think he was disgusted because I had just washed my hair, no products and hastily blow dried it before I got to the salon</li>

            <li> BEST SHAMPOO AND CONDIT</li>
            <li> Good product, but expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else. LOVE Moroccan Oil products</li>
            <li> Yes,  very good products</li>
            <li> They sent me 2 leaking bottles of shampoo and still haven&#x27;t fixed the issue. It&#x27;s been more than a month! I would like the conditioner any day now....</li>
            <li> I have two daughters who are grown women. That being said, They sill get gifts from me. I think these items are OVER PRICED !!!!!  Thats all I can say.</li>
            <li> When I received the shampoo in the mail, the cap was loose. So, I paid good money for a half full bottle. Since I got this from amazon there is no phone number for me to call and complain.  If you want to order Moroccan Oil products you must do it directly from the company.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing special for my hair! I would not recommend buying if you have naturally frizzy hair because it just makes the friz worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed when washing my hair with the shampoo it makes my hair feel very rough and dry like but once I put the conditioner on it feels amazing. The conditioner makes my hair feel silky soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast service! Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I love both the shampoo and conditioner.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t soooooo expensive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another hair product now that I&#x27;ve used Moroccanoil!  It&#x27;s amazingly luxurious.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing hair product I have found, and I have tried it all.  I have thick, course, dry hair.  It might be to much for fine hair.  It helps make my hair more manageable and has seriously decreased the frizz.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive shampoo and conditioner because I had heard so many amazing things about it. I could not find any at local salons so I hit the Internet.  If this is in fact authentic it is horrible! It made my hair so greasy it actually appeared wet! Normally I wash my hair every 3 days but the moment after drying my hair I already felt like it needed to be washed again! I am normally not so critical but I needed to make sure others knew what they&#x27;re purchasing. I&#x27;m not convinced this is the real thing because of all the prior reviews. Save yourself the $$$</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I love it, will buy more</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and the product I received was definitely not the real stuff...</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is a Must ! The conditioner is my favorite part. It made my hair feel so silky and the smell so good. Came very fast ! I&#x27;m very happy will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Ask my kids...I am a skeptic. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Well...maybe not this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hairdresser told me I should think about using it to make my hair \\&quot;feel like buttah\\&quot; (in his Russian accent, no less)I listened and internally said \\&quot;Yeah, yeah, like everything else you sell.\\&quot; I think he was disgusted because I had just washed my hair, no products and hastily blow dried it before I got to the salon so it was a bit on the frizzy side. (Or hay side, whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Moroccanoil serum before and totally loved it, but because of the price, always look for the cheaper version. Sooooo...I had a gift card for Amazon that I got for Christmas. I know...I saved it for 6 months! What do I have to lose? I may as well add to the supply of hair products that are cluttering my closet and shower. So, using my Prime acct and gift card, I bought the pair of hydrating shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off...the smell. LOVE IT! It&#x27;s hard to describe but if you like warm scents, this will make you happy. I have hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length, fine but SUPER thick. I usually have to use a lot of shampoo but because this is expensive, I started out with about a quarter size. It was perfect. It lathers up nicely, rinses quickly. Same with the conditioner, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair normally takes forever to blow dry but these products have cut it down by at least 5 minutes. Which for me is a lot! But then, anything that is a time saver is worth it. I didn&#x27;t use any extra products and it was soft, soft, soft! There was a review that said her hair was greasy...maybe they didn&#x27;t rinse it out or something but I was actually able to go two days without washing, which never happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I love this stuff. Not sure that I can use it every time I shampoo because of the cost but it is definitely a top tier product.</li>
            <li> I used this on vacation in Chicago at the hotel&#x27;s spa.  I fell in love then and bought some.  I love the smell of it and keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Great product! Made my thick curly hair more manageable and easy to comb out.</li>
            <li> Love these products.  Feels like salon type products.  Leaves hair shiny, silky and smooth.  Would recommend both of these products to everyone.</li>
            <li> Shampoo not so good too expensive for quality not conditioning properly when take sun light your hair is uncomb. The gel its another issue has castor oil that never good for the hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my coarse, thick hair soft and manageable. And I absolutely love the smell!  It costs more than I like to spend but it does last awhile and is really worth it.  I highly recommend!!!</li>
