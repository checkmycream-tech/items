            <li>Perfect product.</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the best conditioners, detanglers, and reconstructors I have used.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is a great dupe for the conditioner you get for boxed dyes, and it&#x27;s what works best for my colored hair.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>and it still looks great.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use this combined with the control freak shampoo I have really good hair days....</li>
            <li>Plus it smells really good, like pineapple.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with my decision to purchase both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells great (pineapple/tropical smell) and makes my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best deep conditioner out there!</li>
            <li>use the BedHead Recovery too and that seems to condition my hair much better.</li>
            <li>I love this reconstructor.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, smells good, moisturizers my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>this product is great for over processed blonde hair!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, secure packaging</li>
            <li>This size is a good buy, as the smaller tubes are still carried by Publix Market but they are pricey&#x3D;$16.</li>
            <li>The price is also very good compared to some other products like this and it has the same or better results.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>I have purchased this conditioner many times before and this time it has left my hair greasy before the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Ive tried a lot of different conditioners and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>hair is extremely hard to brush out when it&#x27;s wet and for that reason I always use a comb in the shower to make sure the conditioner gets through it good.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t seem to detangle or condition my hair as much as I expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also leaves it very shiny.</li>
            <li>I love BedHead products and that is all I use but the Dumb Blonde Conditioner just wasn&#x27;t as good as I think it should be, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so helpful and really keeps your hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I want to buy out all of the old formula!!</li>
            <li>Always loved dumb blonde</li>
            <li>It repairs my hair very well after bleaching it to a platinum/white blonde.  </li>
            <li>It seems to repair my hair from damage and keeps my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>But this old formula, not new one.</li>

            <li> But this old formula, not new one.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this product for years on her long hair and swears by it.</li>
            <li> I have blonde highlighhts and with this product I can wash my hair every other day no problem.</li>
            <li> But only this formula, their new one sucks!  </li>
            <li> This product helps my color last longer, my hair is shiny, and no longer dried from processing.</li>
            <li> and unless you shop at a professional hair products store this can be very hard to locate.</li>
            <li> Kerastase worked well when my hair was severely damaged from hard water, but only up to a point.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> Look for the -yellow- bottle if you want the real deal--their new formula is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy</li>
            <li> I do like the shampoo very much, unfortunately I would only give the conditioner about 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I hate the names of this shampoo though even though I&#x27;m not blonde</li>
            <li> The new formula is horrible though.</li>
            <li> I think something is wrong with the bottle I got.</li>

            <li> Whenever I use this combined with the control freak shampoo I have really good hair days....I hate the names of this shampoo though even though I&#x27;m not blonde lol</li>
            <li> this product is great for over processed blonde hair! so helpful and really keeps your hair soft and manageable! I love it :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It last forever because you only use a size of a quarter amount when applying to your hair. I pray it never goes out of business. Buy,  buy, buy!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner out there! The new formula is horrible though. It makes your hair look greasy and doesn&#x27;t rinse out. I want to buy out all of the old formula!!</li>
            <li> Perfect product. My hair was week and elastic and this was the only reconstructor that had any effect. I&#x27;m not even blonde anymore, but will keep using it forever! But this old formula, not new one.</li>
            <li> The picture of this product is the product that I would give a 5 star rating---the description listed above is not the product pictured, it is a totally different product and does not work.  I let the company know this months ago and you would think that they would correct it, but as shown has not been corrected.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this conditioner many times before and this time it has left my hair greasy before the end of the day. It smells differently than my last bottle and took me forever to get it to come through the pump. I think something is wrong with the bottle I got.</li>
            <li> But only this formula, their new one sucks!  Doesn&#x27;t work as well.  This is the only one I would buy</li>
            <li> I do like the shampoo very much, unfortunately I would only give the conditioner about 3 stars. It just didn&#x27;t seem to detangle or condition my hair as much as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is extremely hard to brush out when it&#x27;s wet and for that reason I always use a comb in the shower to make sure the conditioner gets through it good. I love BedHead products and that is all I use but the Dumb Blonde Conditioner just wasn&#x27;t as good as I think it should be, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I use the BedHead Recovery too and that seems to condition my hair much better.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this product for years on her long hair and swears by it. She both colors it and flat-irons it and it still looks great. This size is a good buy, as the smaller tubes are still carried by Publix Market but they are pricey&#x3D;$16.</li>
            <li> This is a great dupe for the conditioner you get for boxed dyes, and it&#x27;s what works best for my colored hair. I bought several big bottles--why? Because for some reason, TIGI has changed the formula. Look for the -yellow- bottle if you want the real deal--their new formula is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, smells good, moisturizers my color treated hair. Quick delivery, secure packaging</li>
            <li> This product helps my color last longer, my hair is shiny, and no longer dried from processing. Not too heavy and i can use it daily.</li>
            <li> Great product!! You can use the reconstructer daily does not make your hair greasy. I have blonde highlighhts and with this product I can wash my hair every other day no problem. Well worth the price and unless you shop at a professional hair products store this can be very hard to locate. I read the reviews prior to ordering this and I am very pleased with my decision to purchase both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this reconstructor.  It repairs my hair very well after bleaching it to a platinum/white blonde.  Plus it smells really good, like pineapple.</li>
            <li> Always loved dumb blonde</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best conditioners, detanglers, and reconstructors I have used. Smells great (pineapple/tropical smell) and makes my hair more manageable. The price is also very good compared to some other products like this and it has the same or better results. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a lot of different conditioners and this is my favorite. Kerastase worked well when my hair was severely damaged from hard water, but only up to a point. This has continued to improve my damaged hair and is only 1/3 of the cost!  I have very fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  It also leaves it very shiny. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years now. It seems to repair my hair from damage and keeps my hair feeling soft.</li>
