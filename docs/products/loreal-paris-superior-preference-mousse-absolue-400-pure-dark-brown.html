    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought this hair color because it said it was reusable and perfect for touch ups.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Preference and Feria and been very happy -</li>
            <li>A splendid idea but dismal results.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results and can&#x27;t wait to work on my roots when it grows out.</li>
            <li>and I have to say they were very courteous and helpful.  </li>
            <li>end result was nice!</li>
            <li>Color is not as bright in the picture</li>
            <li>I read about this product in a magazine and loved the idea--</li>
            <li>not so good</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice color after I dye it.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, it was GROSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, it smells just like the way hair dye used to smell before all these fancy smell-good dyes came out.</li>
            <li>Or should one dispose of it with hazardous materials like paint?</li>
            <li>I thought this would be perfect because it would allow me to Only color those areas to blend in with my own hair color.  </li>
            <li>Figures, I knew it was too good to be true........  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light color</li>
            <li>the mouse style was nice and easy but the outcome...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m overdue :)</li>
            <li>I read the directions twice to make sure I fully understood how to use it</li>
            <li>I normally use the John Frieda mousse which works beautifully</li>
            <li>I had to go out the next day and buy L&#x27;Oreal Preference (which works great) and re-dye my hair within 24 hours (which can&#x27;t be good for it).</li>
            <li>use only what you need and save the rest, great!  </li>
            <li>This method is definitely more pray n spray.</li>
            <li>If this product covered gray hair better it would get my highest rating</li>
            <li>If you love having hair..... don&#x27;t use this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love Love it.</li>
            <li>This time I decided to try this product because it said that it might be able to be used more than once.</li>
            <li>Okay, I thought.  </li>
            <li>The color turns out beautiful and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I  just assumed this would be as good a product as their much cheaper one!  </li>
            <li>However, it is ammonia based and has a strong odor.</li>
            <li>The results were patchy - some lightly covered &amp; some not covered.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my hair many times with success.</li>
            <li>I did shake the product as directed and followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I went out and got this product right away because I love the concept.</li>
            <li>hair dye is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t worth the price!</li>
            <li>so you can be more exact.</li>
            <li>my hair was clean when I applied it both times.</li>
            <li>Applied and waited the full 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought two boxes, and couldn&#x27;t cover in full my medium length hair...</li>
            <li>I paid $14 for this at Target and luckily saved the receipt.  </li>
            <li>Work quickly when you spray the mousse since it will disappear quickly but you can still massage it in your hair</li>
            <li>Also  there was a mild tingling on the edge of my forehead which never happened with the variety of products I have used over 15 years and did the job well.</li>
            <li>This product is probably good for someone who is just trying to do a rinse on their hair but by no means is this a permanent hair color product for grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I use whatever brand is good at the time (be it for color quality or price), but I decided to give this a try because of being able to keep the bottle for touch ups as neededâ€“that was a huge selling point for me even though it was double the price of a regular box of color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fine)...and not only did it absolutely not cover almost any of my gray hair, but the result was patchy at best.</li>
            <li>I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed with super hot water and eventually it all came out</li>
            <li>I am 34 with gray around my temple on my right side.  </li>
            <li>The timing was right for a reusable hair color for touch-ups</li>
            <li>The color and texture are OK but not as good as Feria, and the smell is nauseating - way worse than either of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this hair color 3 times and have never had an issue and the color is consistent.</li>
            <li>A roots colorer that you can use, save, then use the rest later on when more roots grow out.</li>
            <li>Went back to the restroom and noticed my counter top and towel was not stained with anything.  </li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time reading the directions to make sure that I applied this right.</li>
            <li>I ended up with super soft and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>The product did absolutely NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>very smelly ...  </li>
            <li>&quot; my gray but did not cover them, and I will need to recolor very soon.</li>
            <li>BUT the idea behind it is great...</li>
            <li>When I was done my roots had absolutely no coverage, still gray and now I will need to buy a better product to cover them up.</li>
            <li>I know the dye was capable of depositing color...</li>
            <li>it was going to be convenient and so much easier to use, but it does not work.  </li>
            <li>This product is really F</li>
            <li>I will never use this in whole life.</li>
            <li>And I love  all the other loreal hair dyes.</li>
            <li>i will stay with Naturtint which has always given better results than all the other products I tried.</li>
            <li>left it on for the full 30 minutes and nothing happened.</li>
            <li>I was wooed by the Mousse application and left my tried and true brand.</li>
            <li>I made sure the lid for application was applied correctly - snapped in, pushed down, etc..  </li>
            <li>Hair color is not something new to them!</li>
            <li>USE LESS rather than more, otherwise, you end up with sticky roots when you wash your hair</li>
            <li>So, although this product definitely needs improving, I&#x27;m still a loyal L&#x27;Oreal customer on theirPreference cream color.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend that to anybody over this product save your money and save your time.</li>
            <li>The reason for mixing is that the grey roots come out too light if using the Natural Chessnut alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never ordered from Amazon before but where I normally buy has been out of my color for a month or so</li>
            <li>I was even okay with paying almost twice as much as the product I usually use</li>
            <li>and my hair felt fried, but normal.  </li>
            <li>Normally, after coloring, it looks like I have slung a melted Hershey chocolate bar all over the walls, sink, floor, towels, etc...</li>
            <li>Now I have to plan a salon visit next week to get this right.</li>
            <li>I am sure it can&#x27;t be worse than what it is right now after using this product.</li>
            <li>did not wash my hair first &amp; shook up the bottle multiple times.  </li>
            <li>I just dyed my roots again after the last no result of the Loreal Mousse with my usual product and have a splendid ,no grey left glossy result.  </li>
            <li>and I just wanted a quick touch up to my roots on my crown, so I had to be careful.</li>
            <li>I like this product because you can reuse it and not waste the rest.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and used as much of the product as needed and didn&#x27;t try to skimp.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Most reviews were coming from the UK, and were negative.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very inconsistent - it left patches uncolored - maybe the 2 sides don&#x27;t mix evenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to try this to make coloring and touch up easier but spent quite a bit of money on a product that is sub par to regular permanent hair color.</li>
            <li>I will have to dye again my very fine delicate hair which I usually do as rarely as possible.</li>
            <li>Will have to buy another box of my old dye and fix the issue next week, with fab gray hairs to keep me company.  </li>
            <li>That was only $8 I think but that COVERS your gray completely.    </li>
            <li>And to top it all my hair looked dry, fuzzy and dull.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I tried it, I read the directions and did as it said, pushing down the nozzle until it clicked then shaking vigorously.</li>
            <li>so I use the pure dark brown to correct.</li>
            <li>I have long natural brown hair that gets faded out with the sun</li>
            <li>So apparently the product works well enough to dye your wall decor but not your gray hairs.  </li>

            <li> and I had to clear the drain after using it which I have not had to do using other color products.</li>
            <li> Naturtint Natural Chestnut 4N - 5.6 fl oz  and Naturtint Dark Chestnut Brown 3N.</li>
            <li> I mix the 2 colors, 2/3 of the 4N Natural Chestnut Brown and  1/3 of the dark 3N.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and I mean I re-read the instructions and did EXACTLY as stated.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Damaged my hair and didn&#x27;t cover any grey.</li>
            <li> She offered a refund certificate for another product of theirs that I have used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> used this to cover my roots which are grey.</li>
            <li> It did not color my grey hair at all!</li>
            <li> There were other reviews that said the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Horrible for root touch-up/coverage of grays, but oddly, great for overall color.</li>
            <li> Did this on dry hair.</li>
            <li> my hair now dry......  </li>
            <li> I wanted (at CVS, limited choices.)  </li>
            <li> The color worked on the second attempt and the problem besides it coming out too dark is frizziness and texture issues.</li>
            <li> (i didn&#x27;t even use the conditioner because it made it worse the first time I used the product)</li>
            <li> The color did not catch at all and the grey roots show absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> I am glad to see the tons of bad reviews on this product, so</li>
            <li> This review is from the USA, someone said most of the bad reviews are from the UK.  </li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I used it carefully, according to instructions.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no gray coverage whatsoever.</li>
            <li> harsh on your hair and color does not last.</li>
            <li> What a total waste.</li>
            <li> I used 415 (Iced Chocolate Brunette) and it came out as a dark cherry red on my previously black hair.</li>
            <li> it left a heavy residue weighing my hair down ....</li>
            <li> I started realizing that something was not right.  </li>
            <li> These reviews reported that this hair dye did not work, that it was hard to use, and the washing process left a sticky residue in the hair.</li>
            <li> because I figured at least I&#x27;d get multiple uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> At least it finally worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the dark brown andI</li>
            <li> All that trouble and expense for absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> but when I placed the dispensing cap on, I inadvertently pressed down and dispensed some of the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I came across a review of someone who said they flipped it upside down</li>
            <li> PS to the reviewer who only said the bad reviews were out of the UK - I live in the US.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store a few days ago.</li>
            <li> The gray was about 90% covered, there were a few stragglers there.</li>
            <li> It took me a week with heavy conditioners to soften my poor hair back.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about trying it but figured that it can&#x27;t be that bad compared to other store bought hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product because I hated the waste that went along with other root touch-up products.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go online and see why it wasn&#x27;t working, and if this was really that bad of a product.</li>
            <li> The color is almost imperceptible on my hair, and when used with the conditioner leaves hair with a disgusting thick film on it which takes many washings to get off.</li>
            <li> Actually, the ones who got a container that actually worked were unhappy with the color results!  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews are overwhelming, and here&#x27;s why: L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s directions are THE WORST.</li>
            <li> I took my time and did everything right, but when I washed it out I was so annoyed and frustrated because I saw that my grays and roots were unchanged.</li>
            <li> Very upset :(  </li>
            <li> I have very small amount of grey randomly throughout my hair probably 15%.</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> Use on dirty hair (at least several days unwashed)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> my experience was horrible and somewhat scary and after all that work, my hair looks the same if not more flat than before.  </li>
            <li> product was so bad that I am deciding to let my hair grow out grey just to see what it looks like.</li>
            <li> At first I was terrified - worried that my hair was falling out or something horrible</li>
            <li> But after carefully following the directions I was disappointed to see the results.  </li>
            <li> I agree with all the negative reviews!  </li>
            <li> Everything was even messier than before, however and it was very hard to keep the color where it needed to go.</li>
            <li> I did absolutely everything it said to on the pack...shook it throughout the coloring process, held the can upright while applying (annoying and awkward, but</li>
            <li> Have to agree with other bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Sadly I received a defective product.  </li>
            <li> especially unfortunately L&#x27;Oreal needs to go back to the drawing board  .....</li>
            <li> Is the worst hair color that I used... it is expensive and don&#x27;t color the white hair...</li>
            <li> This stuff is useless.  </li>
            <li> I am a crazy perfectionist and direction reader.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a bad product!</li>
            <li> you will be very disappointed ....</li>
            <li> Awful product, do not buy!</li>
            <li> Nasty, nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> Still horrible here.</li>
            <li> one word terrible!!!!  </li>
            <li> the worst hair product ever!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair color 3 times and have never had an issue and the color is consistent. I have long natural brown hair that gets faded out with the sun so I use the pure dark brown to correct. The color turns out beautiful and natural looking. I&#x27;ve never ordered from Amazon before but where I normally buy has been out of my color for a month or so and I&#x27;m overdue :)</li>
            <li> Horrible for root touch-up/coverage of grays, but oddly, great for overall color. Go figure</li>
            <li> Color is not as bright in the picture</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product because I hated the waste that went along with other root touch-up products.  I was even okay with paying almost twice as much as the product I usually use (L&#x27;oreal Root Rescue) because I figured at least I&#x27;d get multiple uses out of it.  It was a huge disappointment.  I don&#x27;t think it covered even one gray hair.  Not only that, but when I placed the dispensing cap on, I inadvertently pressed down and dispensed some of the product.  Unbeknownst to me until later, it ended up on one of my canvas prints in the bathroom which now has a big brown stain on it.  So apparently the product works well enough to dye your wall decor but not your gray hairs.  Go figure.  Back to Root Rescue.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair color because it said it was reusable and perfect for touch ups. I have very small amount of grey randomly throughout my hair probably 15%. I thought this would be perfect because it would allow me to Only color those areas to blend in with my own hair color.  I read the directions twice to make sure I fully understood how to use it left it on for the full 30 minutes and nothing happened. I normally use the John Frieda mousse which works beautifully and I highly recommend that to anybody over this product save your money and save your time.</li>
            <li> Awful product, do not buy! I have to wonder if L&#x27;Oreal tested this on even one person prior to launching this product. Hair color is not something new to them! I used it carefully, according to instructions. The color is almost imperceptible on my hair, and when used with the conditioner leaves hair with a disgusting thick film on it which takes many washings to get off. It felt like I had smeared baby oil or vaseline on my hair.Nasty, nasty stuff. If I could give it negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> Sadly I received a defective product.  The color and the activator do not mix, so I can&#x27;t use it to dye my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product because you can reuse it and not waste the rest.  It leaves a nice color after I dye it.  C</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT!  Do not buy this ladies!  I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing and trying. I was wooed by the Mousse application and left my tried and true brand. Will not do that again!  Going back to 400 Clairol Expert Age Defy. Anyway - for this Loreal product, I followed the instructions to the letter.  Did this on dry hair. Shook the bottle aggressively.  Applied and waited the full 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When rinsing, the product left gunky build-up on and around my roots.  I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed with super hot water and eventually it all came out and my hair felt fried, but normal.  The only way I can describe it is if you had caked on conditioner.  I was probably in the shower for 30 minutes, working this crud out of my hair.  At first I was terrified - worried that my hair was falling out or something horrible (my hair DID NOT fall out, thankfully).  But a shock to my experience.  Honestly, it was GROSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  After conditioning, rinsing, and towel drying my hair, I checked to see the gray coverage. NOTHING.  The product did absolutely NOTHING.  I am 34 with gray around my temple on my right side.  I would say moderate gray? My gray is patchy, but noticeable, hence the reason why I dye my hair. NO coverage at all.  Did nothing - no color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my experience was horrible and somewhat scary and after all that work, my hair looks the same if not more flat than before.  I just damaged it for no reason.  Will have to buy another box of my old dye and fix the issue next week, with fab gray hairs to keep me company.  Loreal should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> Bought this at CVS.  Have been coloring my hair for 10 years.  This product is a total waste of time.  I followed the instructions - did not wash my hair first &amp; shook up the bottle multiple times.  It did not cover my gray roots fully.  The results were patchy - some lightly covered &amp; some not covered.  It did not improve the feel of my hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.  Now I have to plan a salon visit next week to get this right.</li>
            <li> I am a crazy perfectionist and direction reader. I spent a lot of time reading the directions to make sure that I applied this right. I did absolutely everything it said to on the pack...shook it throughout the coloring process, held the can upright while applying (annoying and awkward, but fine)...and not only did it absolutely not cover almost any of my gray hair, but the result was patchy at best. It almost looked like I hadn&#x27;t dyed my hair. I had to go out the next day and buy L&#x27;Oreal Preference (which works great) and re-dye my hair within 24 hours (which can&#x27;t be good for it). Do not waste your money on this product. You&#x27;ll just have to re-dye your hair the next day. PS to the reviewer who only said the bad reviews were out of the UK - I live in the US. Still horrible here.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased. I followed the directions and shook the bottle 35 times before using. Absolutely no gray coverage whatsoever. Complete waste of time and money. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> The timing was right for a reusable hair color for touch-ups especially unfortunately L&#x27;Oreal needs to go back to the drawing board  ..... when you rinse out the mousse  (i didn&#x27;t even use the conditioner because it made it worse the first time I used the product) it left a heavy residue weighing my hair down .... I felt like I needed to re-wash my hair but I didn&#x27;t have time .... my hair was clean when I applied it both times.</li>
            <li> one word terrible!!!!  the worst hair product ever!!!! you will be very disappointed .... bought two boxes, and couldn&#x27;t cover in full my medium length hair... very smelly ...  my hair now dry......  the worst experience ever....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it!  I read about this product in a magazine and loved the idea--use only what you need and save the rest, great!  But after carefully following the directions I was disappointed to see the results.  It \\&quot;shaded\\&quot; my gray but did not cover them, and I will need to recolor very soon. It also kinda made my scalp feel sizzly when I applied it.  I paid $14 for this at Target and luckily saved the receipt.  It&#x27;s going back, and I&#x27;m going to buy LOreal Excellence Creme again.  That was only $8 I think but that COVERS your gray completely.    I am glad to see the tons of bad reviews on this product, so I know it&#x27;s not just me...just wish I had checked before buying!  I  just assumed this would be as good a product as their much cheaper one!  Don&#x27;t bother with this one--it&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever! Doesn&#x27;t worth the price! It did not color my grey hair at all! Very upset :(  And not once, but twice! Both times came out with same result...</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store a few days ago. I&#x27;ve been coloring my grays for years and I use whatever brand is good at the time (be it for color quality or price), but I decided to give this a try because of being able to keep the bottle for touch ups as neededâ€“that was a huge selling point for me even though it was double the price of a regular box of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it, I read the directions and did as it said, pushing down the nozzle until it clicked then shaking vigorously. All that came out was white foam. I figured it would just darken as time went on. I have a tougher time than some because I got an ombre effect done and I just wanted a quick touch up to my roots on my crown, so I had to be careful. I took my time and did everything right, but when I washed it out I was so annoyed and frustrated because I saw that my grays and roots were unchanged. I decided to go online and see why it wasn&#x27;t working, and if this was really that bad of a product. Wow. The negative reviews are overwhelming, and here&#x27;s why: L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s directions are THE WORST. No one understands this thing, and it doesn&#x27;t seem L&#x27;Oreal does either. It&#x27;s like you need a prep course to figure it out. BUT the idea behind it is great... one bottle that can give you multiple touch ups? SIGN ME UP. The execution is the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I came across a review of someone who said they flipped it upside down and that&#x27;s when the color came out. So, I decided to keep the bottle until I could try it again. I shook it upright and still got all white. When I shook it and flipped it, I got color! It&#x27;s a very light color but it was there. I started to apply. Everything was even messier than before, however and it was very hard to keep the color where it needed to go. I suggest you avoid this if you have highlights and get the root touch up color with the brush so you can be more exact. This method is definitely more pray n spray. The color worked on the second attempt and the problem besides it coming out too dark is frizziness and texture issues. The gray was about 90% covered, there were a few stragglers there. Oh well. At least it finally worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy this again. I suggest mixing your color and activator from another brand in a disposable bowl with a touch up brush and just setting the rest aside for later. It&#x27;s cheaper and easier, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with the nonsense of this product. But if you do decide to buy, remember to flip it over and it should work. If it doesn&#x27;t, all you&#x27;re getting is the activator and you need to continue to shake until something finally comes out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. Damaged my hair and didn&#x27;t cover any grey.</li>
            <li> Is the worst hair color that I used... it is expensive and don&#x27;t color the white hair...I didn t should bought that...</li>
            <li> If this product covered gray hair better it would get my highest rating</li>
            <li> Terrible product! harsh on your hair and color does not last. It took me a week with heavy conditioners to soften my poor hair back. If you love having hair..... don&#x27;t use this stuff. the mouse style was nice and easy but the outcome... not so good</li>
            <li> Yippee!! A roots colorer that you can use, save, then use the rest later on when more roots grow out. Love Love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re trying to cover gray. Does not work. And I love  all the other loreal hair dyes.</li>
            <li> This review is from the USA, someone said most of the bad reviews are from the UK.  This product is horrible.  I wanted to cover up my roots.  I&#x27;ve colored my hair many times with success. This time I decided to try this product because it said that it might be able to be used more than once. I have short hair and used as much of the product as needed and didn&#x27;t try to skimp. When I was done my roots had absolutely no coverage, still gray and now I will need to buy a better product to cover them up. I pulled the dye through the rest of my hair at the end of processing my roots and my hair is now darker, so I know the dye was capable of depositing color...except on my roots.  What a bad product!</li>
            <li> I agree with all the negative reviews!  I tried this thinking it was going to be convenient and so much easier to use, but it does not work.  I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and I mean I re-read the instructions and did EXACTLY as stated.  I made sure the lid for application was applied correctly - snapped in, pushed down, etc..  When I used the product, the mousse came out.  It came out white like the picture.  Okay, I thought.  So far, so good.  I noticed there was not such an overpowering odor as some have......(now, I know why)...I put it on.  Waited the time.  Went back to the restroom and noticed my counter top and towel was not stained with anything.  Normally, after coloring, it looks like I have slung a melted Hershey chocolate bar all over the walls, sink, floor, towels, etc...Nothing.  Wow.  I started realizing that something was not right.  I kept that stuff on my hair for 30 minutes without any dye in it!  I rinsed it out immediately, washed my hair, conditioned and I&#x27;m just hoping whatever I put on there does not damage it.  Ugh!!!!!  This stuff is useless.  The container does not work properly.  There were other reviews that said the same thing.  Actually, the ones who got a container that actually worked were unhappy with the color results!  So, I&#x27;m calling Loreal and going to try to get a refund just for the principle of the matter.  By the way, I didn&#x27;t order this from Amazon, but there were not any reviews that I could find on the Loreal website so I wrote on Amazon.  I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon.  Figures, I knew it was too good to be true........  Update:  I did call Loreal customer service and I have to say they were very courteous and helpful.  She offered a refund certificate for another product of theirs that I have used for a long time.  She said that the container I got just malfunctioned.  She said I could re-color in 2 days.  So, although this product definitely needs improving, I&#x27;m still a loyal L&#x27;Oreal customer on theirPreference cream color.  I should not have changed to begin with, I guess.</li>
            <li> I saw this at CVS and decided to give it a try. There weren&#x27;t any reviews coming from the US on this product. Most reviews were coming from the UK, and were negative. These reviews reported that this hair dye did not work, that it was hard to use, and the washing process left a sticky residue in the hair. I was really nervous about trying it but figured that it can&#x27;t be that bad compared to other store bought hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dye is super easy to use. However, it is ammonia based and has a strong odor. Honestly, it smells just like the way hair dye used to smell before all these fancy smell-good dyes came out. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair since my teens and was used to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the following tips I have after using the product:&lt;br /&gt;1) READ THE INSTRUCTIONS&lt;br /&gt;2) Use on dirty hair (at least several days unwashed)&lt;br /&gt;3) Work quickly when you spray the mousse since it will disappear quickly but you can still massage it in your hair&lt;br /&gt;4) SHAKE THE BOTTLE OFTEN&lt;br /&gt;5) USE LESS rather than more, otherwise, you end up with sticky roots when you wash your hair&lt;br /&gt;6) Don&#x27;t use shampoo during the rinse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result was nice! I ended up with super soft and shiny hair. I used 415 (Iced Chocolate Brunette) and it came out as a dark cherry red on my previously black hair. I am happy with the results and can&#x27;t wait to work on my roots when it grows out. I have quite a bit left in the bottle but I can&#x27;t tell how much is left since it&#x27;s an opaque bottle. I will update this review when I use the same bottle for my roots.</li>
            <li> I just tried this and I still have white roots!!!  All that trouble and expense for absolutely no results.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d read reviews before I bought this. I&#x27;ve used Preference and Feria and been very happy - I chose this because it was the color I wanted (at CVS, limited choices.)  You&#x27;d think it would be easier to use but it&#x27;s very inconsistent - it left patches uncolored - maybe the 2 sides don&#x27;t mix evenly. The color and texture are OK but not as good as Feria, and the smell is nauseating - way worse than either of them. I feel lightheaded now but I&#x27;m going to have to do it again to get the uncolored patches. Boo.</li>
            <li> A splendid idea but dismal results. What a total waste. I will put the rest of the bottle where it belongs, in the trash. Or should one dispose of it with hazardous materials like paint? I followed the instructions to the letter. The color did not catch at all and the grey roots show absolutely no change. I will have to dye again my very fine delicate hair which I usually do as rarely as possible. Also  there was a mild tingling on the edge of my forehead which never happened with the variety of products I have used over 15 years and did the job well. And to top it all my hair looked dry, fuzzy and dull. Loreal, send your chemists back to the lab.    10 days later.   I just dyed my roots again after the last no result of the Loreal Mousse with my usual product and have a splendid ,no grey left glossy result.  Naturtint Natural Chestnut 4N - 5.6 fl oz  and Naturtint Dark Chestnut Brown 3N. I mix the 2 colors, 2/3 of the 4N Natural Chestnut Brown and  1/3 of the dark 3N. The reason for mixing is that the grey roots come out too light if using the Natural Chessnut alone. i will stay with Naturtint which has always given better results than all the other products I tried.</li>
            <li> Have to agree with other bad reviews. I went out and got this product right away because I love the concept. But after using this result was as if I didn&#x27;t even color my hair - gray roots were not covered at all. Looks like I need to go back to my regular brand.</li>
            <li> Does not work save your money. I purchased the dark brown andI used this to cover my roots which are grey. This did not even begin to color over them at all. I did shake the product as directed and followed the directions precisely. This product is probably good for someone who is just trying to do a rinse on their hair but by no means is this a permanent hair color product for grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this to make coloring and touch up easier but spent quite a bit of money on a product that is sub par to regular permanent hair color. Save your money and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was so bad that I am deciding to let my hair grow out grey just to see what it looks like. I am sure it can&#x27;t be worse than what it is right now after using this product. My hair also came out in bunches and I had to clear the drain after using it which I have not had to do using other color products.</li>
            <li> This product is really F*****.  I will never use this in whole life. No color at all. wastage of time and money.</li>
