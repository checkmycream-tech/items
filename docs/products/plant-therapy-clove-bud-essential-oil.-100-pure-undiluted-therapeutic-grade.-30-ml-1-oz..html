            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the clove oil would do as good a job by itself, but in combination with the warm (sea) salt, it works great!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I guess I should have done more research on the botanical name before ordering.</li>

            <li>Love buying from Plant Therapy.</li>

            <li>I was able to forcefully push air through my front teeth with tip of my tongue (the pressure from the air was causing pain).  </li>
            <li>most people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t meant for mouth treatments</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal..</li>
            <li>I did the swishing routine again and applied more of the oil.</li>
            <li>I did the swishing routine again and applied more of the oil.</li>
            <li>Understand I LOVE the smell of clove oil</li>
            <li>&quot; and there is no comparison...  much better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;to make sure their product is of the highest quality.  </li>
            <li>This is ok stuff.</li>
            <li>The rest were sealed appropriately.</li>
            <li>Perfectly yummy scent; makes everything smell exotic and puts you into a warm, cozy place.</li>
            <li>bottle (with euro dropper top of course) and a sweet price!</li>
            <li>It was time for me to order a new palette, so that worked out great.....</li>
            <li>I use a top quality sea salt (Celtic Sea Salt&gt;fine grind, which can be purchase from Amazon.com), and beware of cheap</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the strong scent and that it was available in a 30 oz.</li>
            <li>My order of clove bud came right on time and was packed nice.</li>
            <li>It is too strong by itself.</li>
            <li>After the repair it was fine</li>
            <li>Well packaged and labeled with an easy to use bottle that feels comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>Great product to have in your medical kit for a variety of issues.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a free hand to hold my lip away from the cotton swab while doing all of this.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a free hand to hold my lip away from the cotton swab while doing all of this.  </li>
            <li>Been free of them over a year now.  </li>
            <li>this was exactly what i wanted; i was pleased with the purity of the product as well as the price</li>
            <li>I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
            <li>So far im loving this.</li>
            <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>I use with in a burner in conjunction with cinnamon, eucalyptus and lemon for a clean and fresh air, my take on thieves oil</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d get to a doctor quickly.</li>
            <li>tested it- more pure than the ones I baught at whole foods and cheaper...</li>
            <li>I honestly believe there is still a pinhole in a different part of the tooth that is causing this pain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the clove oil would do as good a job by itself, but in combination with the warm (sea) salt, it works great!s, the pain was pretty much gone</li>
            <li>It numbed it right away</li>
            <li>and I could even chew on the right side.</li>
            <li>First, I mixed 2 tablespoons of (sea) salt in about 6oz of warm water and swished all of it around...</li>
            <li>I used a few drops of the clove oil in a DIY rub that I made of organic olive oil, almond oil, lavender oil, chamomile, and a few drops of the clove oil, this for very dry and itchy skin, so far this has been very good at relieving itching, I had read about the superior qualities of clove oil, and I thank you for your good service.</li>
            <li>so this is very unusual for me.</li>
            <li>What little I used was good.</li>
            <li>I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for Winter!  </li>
            <li>I really love the clove Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I need to order a 3rd time just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>OK, so I know several people are looking for a review for using clove oil to treat a toothache.  </li>
            <li>I literally had my first one done this year and the pain from a dying nerve is horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>with that said, I was only able to use this for about a week.  </li>
            <li>application of pure argan oil cleared that rawness right up.sure</li>
            <li>application of pure argan oil cleared that rawness right up.</li>
            <li>and I have still not had to use the sea water solution or the clove application since the first day.</li>
            <li>Then I used a Q Tip soaked in the oil to apply it directly on top of the tooth...doing this several times.</li>
            <li>I will order this brand next time for sure.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>I like this product, it is good and highly effective!&lt;br /&gt;However, one word of caution: please must, must, must dilute it with other oil for application.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing another \\&quot;leading\\&quot; pure oil product at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]  </li>
            <li>The oil is as it says: 100% Pure, Undiluted and Therapeutic.</li>
            <li>bottles of 100% pure clove that is made</li>
            <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like real cloves.</li>
            <li>I added a drop or two depending on how much you are mixing with it, to my hair conditioner, and my body lotion.</li>
            <li>Within a few days I was able to chew on that side more than I have been able to lately.</li>
            <li>I was also able to &amp;quot;suck&amp;quot; on the tooth with my tongue with my mouth closed, which was also causing pain.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the pressure pain had subsided enough that I have stopped using it for now.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the pressure pain had subsided enough that I have stopped using it for now.  </li>
            <li>VERY PAINFUL!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oil is earthy and intense.</li>
            <li>and, it was indeed much</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really use it much because I ended up not needing it.</li>
            <li>Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available.</li>
            <li>Buying the 30ml size is also more conveinent and also saves me money, so where possible I always look for and choose this larger size.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better because it was more expensive....</li>
            <li>I just wanted to give this some time to calm down before I go back and cause more trauma to an already oversensitive tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money to buy pure essential oil from DoTerra or Young Living.</li>
            <li>They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well.</li>
            <li>my right lower back tooth</li>
            <li>I have purchased many different essential oils from them and feel they are superior to oils I have purchased in the past from other companies.  </li>
            <li>When I mentioned this to the art supply store from which I was ordering my tubes of paint, the person recommended using Clove Bud Essential Oil, brushed lightly in the palette wells before putting the paint in.</li>
            <li>It works better than i&#x27;d have expected for something so simple.</li>
            <li>This clove oil is among the first bottles of essential oils I&#x27;ve ever ordered</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this brand of clove essential oil</li>
            <li>If you use such a product in your mouth, it will certainly be ingested.</li>
            <li>and I was happily surprised at the amount received for the price.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have sensitive teeth and my nerves are closer to the surface</li>
            <li>UPDATE 10/16/2012: Day 6 and the pain is completely gone....</li>
            <li>and I am thankful to God for making a natural cure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(wisdom??) was so sensitive that it felt like a dentist drill had hit a nerve.</li>
            <li>It was just what I needed, large enough to make a large batch that will last us several months.</li>
            <li>decided to purchase this to see if I could get the tooth to calm down naturally.  </li>
            <li>but they left it high</li>
            <li>This is on my list of &amp;#34;Essential Things to Have In Your Medicine Cabinet.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve not tried any other brands, because this one does exactly what I got it for.</li>
            <li>recently had an old filling repaired after it was discovered to have a hole.  </li>
            <li>I had only used the sea salt solution and clove once yesterday morning and by the afternoon the pain was completely gone</li>
            <li>but it was a good thing because I needed it to numb an area where an infected tooth was that needed extraction.  </li>
            <li>I can chew on the right side but the tooth is still a little sore.</li>
            <li>, I have no excuse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was some slight immediate relief within minutes, but after a few hours, the pain was pretty much gone</li>

            <li> and I could even chew on the right side.</li>
            <li> First, I mixed 2 tablespoons of (sea) salt in about 6oz of warm water and swished all of it around...</li>
            <li> I used a few drops of the clove oil in a DIY rub that I made of organic olive oil, almond oil, lavender oil, chamomile, and a few drops of the clove oil, this for very dry and itchy skin, so far this has been very good at relieving itching, I had read about the superior qualities of clove oil, and I thank you for your good service.</li>
            <li> so this is very unusual for me.</li>
            <li> What little I used was good.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for Winter!  </li>
            <li> I really love the clove Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need to order a 3rd time just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> OK, so I know several people are looking for a review for using clove oil to treat a toothache.  </li>
            <li> I literally had my first one done this year and the pain from a dying nerve is horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> with that said, I was only able to use this for about a week.  </li>
            <li> application of pure argan oil cleared that rawness right up.sure</li>
            <li> application of pure argan oil cleared that rawness right up.</li>
            <li> and I have still not had to use the sea water solution or the clove application since the first day.</li>
            <li> Then I used a Q Tip soaked in the oil to apply it directly on top of the tooth...doing this several times.</li>
            <li> I will order this brand next time for sure.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is good and highly effective!&lt;br /&gt;However, one word of caution: please must, must, must dilute it with other oil for application.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing another \\&quot;leading\\&quot; pure oil product at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]  </li>
            <li> The oil is as it says: 100% Pure, Undiluted and Therapeutic.</li>
            <li> bottles of 100% pure clove that is made</li>
            <li> Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like real cloves.</li>
            <li> I added a drop or two depending on how much you are mixing with it, to my hair conditioner, and my body lotion.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I was able to chew on that side more than I have been able to lately.</li>
            <li> I was also able to &amp;quot;suck&amp;quot; on the tooth with my tongue with my mouth closed, which was also causing pain.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the pressure pain had subsided enough that I have stopped using it for now.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the pressure pain had subsided enough that I have stopped using it for now.  </li>
            <li> VERY PAINFUL!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oil is earthy and intense.</li>
            <li> and, it was indeed much</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really use it much because I ended up not needing it.</li>
            <li> Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available.</li>
            <li> Buying the 30ml size is also more conveinent and also saves me money, so where possible I always look for and choose this larger size.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be better because it was more expensive....</li>
            <li> I just wanted to give this some time to calm down before I go back and cause more trauma to an already oversensitive tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money to buy pure essential oil from DoTerra or Young Living.</li>
            <li> They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well.</li>
            <li> my right lower back tooth</li>
            <li> I have purchased many different essential oils from them and feel they are superior to oils I have purchased in the past from other companies.  </li>
            <li> When I mentioned this to the art supply store from which I was ordering my tubes of paint, the person recommended using Clove Bud Essential Oil, brushed lightly in the palette wells before putting the paint in.</li>
            <li> It works better than i&#x27;d have expected for something so simple.</li>
            <li> This clove oil is among the first bottles of essential oils I&#x27;ve ever ordered</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this brand of clove essential oil</li>
            <li> If you use such a product in your mouth, it will certainly be ingested.</li>
            <li> and I was happily surprised at the amount received for the price.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have sensitive teeth and my nerves are closer to the surface</li>
            <li> UPDATE 10/16/2012: Day 6 and the pain is completely gone....</li>
            <li> and I am thankful to God for making a natural cure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (wisdom??) was so sensitive that it felt like a dentist drill had hit a nerve.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed, large enough to make a large batch that will last us several months.</li>
            <li> decided to purchase this to see if I could get the tooth to calm down naturally.  </li>
            <li> but they left it high</li>
            <li> This is on my list of &amp;#34;Essential Things to Have In Your Medicine Cabinet.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve not tried any other brands, because this one does exactly what I got it for.</li>
            <li> recently had an old filling repaired after it was discovered to have a hole.  </li>
            <li> I had only used the sea salt solution and clove once yesterday morning and by the afternoon the pain was completely gone</li>
            <li> but it was a good thing because I needed it to numb an area where an infected tooth was that needed extraction.  </li>
            <li> I can chew on the right side but the tooth is still a little sore.</li>
            <li> , I have no excuse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was some slight immediate relief within minutes, but after a few hours, the pain was pretty much gone</li>
            <li> The morning before I received the oil from Amazon, when I woke up, I slightly clenched my teeth in a normal fashion and</li>
            <li> Other than being busy</li>
            <li> I will see how long I can go without the pain coming back</li>
            <li> I guess the infection was drawn out, with no more treatment other than the first day.</li>
            <li> This bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The is the next morning from my previous review</li>
            <li> but I hate the scent so much it doesn&#x27;t even smell right on that.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a little chip on your tooth, a filling falls out or something you know is minor then by all means - use this for relief until you can get to a dentist.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> you can also put it in home made teeth cleaning solution along with myrrh and other things.</li>
            <li> It literally smells rancid - nothing like the purifying, deep melody of other brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Killed it with only a few drops in the water.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else seemed to work this harsh winter on my hair and skin, which became very dry.</li>
            <li> and I could clench my teeth with only a slight dull pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I could clench my teeth with only a slight dull pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can say I have absolutely NO pain!!</li>
            <li> I have used 4 different Plant Therapy Essential Oils, and so far I have not been disappointed that I chose to try the brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want a root canal on a tooth that doesn&#x27;t have the typical pain associated with needed a root canal.  </li>
            <li> After a few treatments my lip started to split open and became very raw.  </li>

            <li> as expected, small amount for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this to have on hand for my aquarium (in case any of my fish got deathly sick and were suffering), and luckily haven&#x27;t had to use it for that.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> However, my husband bit the inside of his lip a day after this arrived, and I put some of this oil on his gums where he damaged it, and it numbed the area for a few hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tooth had gotten progressively worse the past several days, and when the oil arrived that afternoon, I did 2 things which I had read about on Google.</li>

            <li> just some slight, dull pain.</li>

            <li> NOT&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to have an underlying foul or rancid smell... hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put this on as soon as I see signs of a cold sore coming on and it gone the next day.</li>
            <li> being so late.  </li>
            <li> After having the filing removed and replaced with a temp I am still having pain with pressure and extreme pain with cold.  </li>
            <li> I put some on my skin to see if it was just the initial scent that was bad and after smelling it for a few mintues, I felt sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> I did and after a few used, I became sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> received an email letting me know they were sorry about my&lt;</li>
            <li> , this HAS helped quite a bit with the pressure pain but has done nothing to address the pain with cold.  </li>
            <li> It has a unpleasant smell as well as taste(it might be bad).  </li>
            <li> I almost died years ago from an infected tooth I didn&#x27;t think was bad.  </li>
            <li> Used it to euthanize a sick fish.  </li>
            <li> VERY disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I had to hold my nose while doing all of this because this stuff taste downright awful!  </li>
            <li> Plus the taste is absolutely horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been purchasing another \\&quot;leading\\&quot; pure oil product at a much higher price.  This oil from plant therapy is wonderful and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great product to have in your medical kit for a variety of issues. Quality seems to be excellent.</li>
            <li> Best, most potent, highest grade clove oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The Plant Therapy products are great in terms of quality and very economical.</li>
            <li> I ordered this clove oil to add to my thieves oil blend. It was just what I needed, large enough to make a large batch that will last us several months.</li>
            <li> actually helps with tooth ache! I&#x27;ve given it to two people already and they swear by it. you can also put it in home made teeth cleaning solution along with myrrh and other things.</li>
            <li> As a watercolorist, I have from time to time experienced some mold in my Winsor &amp; Newton watercolors, once they are in the palette. When I mentioned this to the art supply store from which I was ordering my tubes of paint, the person recommended using Clove Bud Essential Oil, brushed lightly in the palette wells before putting the paint in. It was time for me to order a new palette, so that worked out great.....excellent recommendation.</li>
            <li> Love PT!  Smells great</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for Winter!  My clients loved it!</li>
            <li> I use it in my recipe for dog flea/tick spray.  No problem with it. I need to buy 2 bottles next time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful warm scent. I am so pleased with the strong scent and that it was available in a 30 oz. bottle (with euro dropper top of course) and a sweet price! Excellent!</li>
            <li> Made for aroma therapy etc. I used it to reduce chance of mold on outdoor wind chimes from KOSHI worked well to give bamboo veneer a polished look. And smelled amazing on balcony.</li>
            <li> I used a few drops of the clove oil in a DIY rub that I made of organic olive oil, almond oil, lavender oil, chamomile, and a few drops of the clove oil, this for very dry and itchy skin, so far this has been very good at relieving itching, I had read about the superior qualities of clove oil, and I thank you for your good service. thanks.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil and great for toothaches! Stronger then pharmacy product sold on the shelves! You will love it! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make Thieves scented oil. Definitely not the clove I was looking for. Doesn&#x27;t smell like real cloves. I guess I should have done more research on the botanical name before ordering. Instead I thought I could use it to refresh potpourri but I hate the scent so much it doesn&#x27;t even smell right on that. I didn&#x27;t try to contact the seller as I figured it was my fault for not knowing the correct botanical name of what I was ordering.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It arrived immediately (like the next day, I don&#x27;t know they do that)....but it was a good thing because I needed it to numb an area where an infected tooth was that needed extraction.  It numbed it right away and I am keeping this stuff on hand.....just in case something similar happens again.</li>
            <li> I really love the clove Essential Oil.  It has such a wonderful effect as a room refresher.  I would buy this again once I am out of this bottle.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0069SQZ5G Clove Bud Essential Oil. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]  I have used 4 different Plant Therapy Essential Oils, and so far I have not been disappointed that I chose to try the brand. Buying the 30ml size is also more conveinent and also saves me money, so where possible I always look for and choose this larger size.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this product.  I do not ever want to be without this.  Tooth pain can ruin your day in a hurry!  Maybe I need to order a 3rd time just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  This stuff is that good.  Oh yeah, it&#x27;s smells but it also works like a miracle.  I personally would not ignore tooth pain.  I almost died years ago from an infected tooth I didn&#x27;t think was bad.  Cost me hours in ICU, an IV with liquid antibiotics that took me weeks to get my stomach over, the doctors telling me I might not make it as the infection was traveling toward my brain and a root canal.  If you&#x27;ve got a little chip on your tooth, a filling falls out or something you know is minor then by all means - use this for relief until you can get to a dentist.  If you notice any kind of infection then I&#x27;d maybe use this if there was pain but I&#x27;d get to a doctor quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this as a tooth pain remedy. It works better than i&#x27;d have expected for something so simple. This is on my list of &amp;#34;Essential Things to Have In Your Medicine Cabinet.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve not tried any other brands, because this one does exactly what I got it for. Plus, it works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will last a long time. I added a drop or two depending on how much you are mixing with it, to my hair conditioner, and my body lotion. Nothing else seemed to work this harsh winter on my hair and skin, which became very dry. Just a tiny bit of this mixed in made all the difference.</li>
            <li> This product helps to delay the drying out of my oil paints in their enclosed pallet box.</li>
            <li> Used it to euthanize a sick fish.  Killed it with only a few drops in the water.  Recomend for aquarium owners.</li>
            <li> Lovely addition to my oils collection. Smells wonderful. Love buying from Plant Therapy. Always consistantly good products.</li>
            <li> I find that Plant Therapy oils are great quality for the price paid. They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well. (I&#x27;ve never taken oils internally.)</li>
            <li> I buy clove bud oil to use in a facial astringent. This oil is great, good price too. My face is feeling wonderful thanks to clove bud!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this Clove Bud Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for speedy and safe shipping/handling too!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Perfectly yummy scent; makes everything smell exotic and puts you into a warm, cozy place.</li>
            <li> This is low quality essential oil. It&#x27;s worth the money to buy pure essential oil from DoTerra or Young Living.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and the price and delivery time were excellent. The oil is as it says: 100% Pure, Undiluted and Therapeutic. I will order repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Always a pleasures! Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I use this to help repel deer from my flower beds.  10 drops mixed with a gal of water and 1 tsp liquid soap</li>
            <li> I put this on as soon as I see signs of a cold sore coming on and it gone the next day.</li>
            <li> It has a unpleasant smell as well as taste(it might be bad).  And does not relieve pain.  This was a waste of money for me. YMMV.</li>
            <li> This clove oil is among the first bottles of essential oils I&#x27;ve ever ordered and I was happily surprised at the amount received for the price.  Cannot speak to the product itself yet but it was as described and was delivered in a timely manner.  Would use this seller again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> tested it- more pure than the ones I baught at whole foods and cheaper...&lt;br /&gt;awesome product. can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> This is one of the ingredients for my recipe. So far im loving this. This bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> OK, so I know several people are looking for a review for using clove oil to treat a toothache.  Well here&#x27;s my bit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had an old filling repaired after it was discovered to have a hole.  After the repair it was fine but they left it high so it was hitting and caused the tooth to become sore.  After having the filing removed and replaced with a temp I am still having pain with pressure and extreme pain with cold.  The clove oil was my last option before a possible root canal.  I don&#x27;t want a root canal on a tooth that doesn&#x27;t have the typical pain associated with needed a root canal.  I literally had my first one done this year and the pain from a dying nerve is horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase this to see if I could get the tooth to calm down naturally.  I used a cotton swab with this oil on there and rubbed it on the tooth and around the gum line.  Within a few days I was able to chew on that side more than I have been able to lately. I was able to forcefully push air through my front teeth with tip of my tongue (the pressure from the air was causing pain).  I was also able to &amp;quot;suck&amp;quot; on the tooth with my tongue with my mouth closed, which was also causing pain.  I naturally have sensitive teeth and my nerves are closer to the surface them most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this HAS helped quite a bit with the pressure pain but has done nothing to address the pain with cold.  I honestly believe there is still a pinhole in a different part of the tooth that is causing this pain.  I just wanted to give this some time to calm down before I go back and cause more trauma to an already oversensitive tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with that said, I was only able to use this for about a week.  The oil was apparently slowly running down the cotton swab and was brushing the corner of my lip.  This stuff DOES burn when it touches your tongue and your face.  I had to hold my nose while doing all of this because this stuff taste downright awful!  (I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t meant for mouth treatments but DAMN it&#x27;s bad HAHA.)  I didn&#x27;t have a free hand to hold my lip away from the cotton swab while doing all of this.  After a few treatments my lip started to split open and became very raw.  Fortunately the pressure pain had subsided enough that I have stopped using it for now.  And one before bed application of pure argan oil cleared that rawness right up.sure this isn&#x27;t meant for mouth treatments but DAMN it&#x27;s bad HAHA.)  I didn&#x27;t have a free hand to hold my lip away from the cotton swab while doing all of this.  After a few treatments my lip started to split open and became very raw.  Fortunately the pressure pain had subsided enough that I have stopped using it for now.  And one before bed application of pure argan oil cleared that rawness right up.</li>
            <li> Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available. This did not come out smelling good or anything like what I&#x27;m used to. I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
            <li> Mixed with grapeseed oil to fight scabies.  Worked for me!  Been free of them over a year now.  Just have to be methodical with the application and keep at it.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!!  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal..</li>
            <li> UPDATE 10/16/2012: Day 6 and the pain is completely gone....I guess the infection was drawn out, with no more treatment other than the first day. Amazing....and I am thankful to God for making a natural cure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/14/2012: This is the 3rd day and I have still not had to use the sea water solution or the clove application since the first day. I can chew on the right side but the tooth is still a little sore. Otherwise, there is no pain at all. I can&#x27;t help but think that the minerals in the sea salt had something to do (along with the clove oil) with drawing out that infection, if it is gone. I use a top quality sea salt (Celtic Sea Salt&gt;fine grind, which can be purchase from Amazon.com), and beware of cheap imitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/13/2012: The is the next morning from my previous review and I can say I have absolutely NO pain!! Amazing!! I had only used the sea salt solution and clove once yesterday morning and by the afternoon the pain was completely gone and I could even chew on the right side. I will see how long I can go without the pain coming back but the sea solution and clove application may have drawn the infection out. Hope so!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/12/2012: The morning before I received the oil from Amazon, when I woke up, I slightly clenched my teeth in a normal fashion and my right lower back tooth (wisdom??) was so sensitive that it felt like a dentist drill had hit a nerve. VERY PAINFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tooth had gotten progressively worse the past several days, and when the oil arrived that afternoon, I did 2 things which I had read about on Google. First, I mixed 2 tablespoons of (sea) salt in about 6oz of warm water and swished all of it around...mouthful by mouthful. Then I used a Q Tip soaked in the oil to apply it directly on top of the tooth...doing this several times. It burns when it touches the gum and tongue but goes away fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some slight immediate relief within minutes, but after a few hours, the pain was pretty much gone and I could clench my teeth with only a slight dull pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning it feels the same....just some slight, dull pain. I did the swishing routine again and applied more of the oil. I will do this 3 times a day for several days or a week and see if it draws out the infection. Some web sites said it would but some said it wouldn&#x27;t. Will try to remember to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the clove oil would do as good a job by itself, but in combination with the warm (sea) salt, it works great!s, the pain was pretty much gone and I could clench my teeth with only a slight dull pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning it feels the same....just some slight, dull pain.

            <li> This is my first time buying this brand of clove essential oil and i am going to send it back. It literally smells rancid - nothing like the purifying, deep melody of other brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past. I put some on my skin to see if it was just the initial scent that was bad and after smelling it for a few mintues, I felt sick to my stomach. Understand I LOVE the smell of clove oil so this is very unusual for me. VERY disappointed :(</li>
            <li> This clove bud oil is good for toothache</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what i wanted; i was pleased with the purity of the product as well as the price</li>
            <li> My order of clove bud came right on time and was packed nice. The oil is quite potent and has a nice smell. I will order this brand next time for sure.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and labeled with an easy to use bottle that feels comfortable in the hand. Oil is earthy and intense. I would happily purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice scent-fast transaction.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be better because it was more expensive.... NOT&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to have an underlying foul or rancid smell... hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;I just received two one oz. bottles of 100% pure clove that is made&lt;br /&gt;by \\&quot;Now\\&quot; and there is no comparison...  much better.  Also cheaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to write a \\&quot;follow up\\&quot; review on this product.&lt;br /&gt;The owners of this company do care about customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;I received an email letting me know they were sorry about my&lt;br /&gt;perceptions of the product and letting me know that they strive&lt;br /&gt;to make sure their product is of the highest quality.  They sent&lt;br /&gt;me another product.... and, it was indeed much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE.... I did not contact the company.... THEY contacted ME based&lt;br /&gt;on my earlier review.  Based on this, I would not hesitate to&lt;br /&gt;order again from this company, and am going to change my rating to&lt;br /&gt;a 5 star rating!  Anyone can make a mistake at times.  It&#x27;s what&lt;br /&gt;happens when it does happen that counts.  I apologize to the owners&lt;br /&gt;for being so late.  Other than being busy, I have no excuse.</li>
            <li> I recommend Plant Therapy products.  I have purchased many different essential oils from them and feel they are superior to oils I have purchased in the past from other companies.  I</li>
            <li> smells nice in the diffuser!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this oil. I used it for toothache pain when I couldn&#x27;t get to the dentist for 2 days. Then I loaned mine out and it was never returned so I replaced it. It works great for toothache pain.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Exactly what was described. Purchased for disinfecting purposes in a spray for travel. Came in handy for tooth pain as well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product.  I rated it as a 5 star because this product works.  Thank you for offering it.</li>
            <li> This is ok stuff. Didn&#x27;t really use it much because I ended up not needing it. What little I used was good.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is good and highly effective!&lt;br /&gt;However, one word of caution: please must, must, must dilute it with other oil for application. It is too strong by itself. I accidentally dropped some off on my nightstand, the paint actually came off with the drip.</li>
            <li> I use with in a burner in conjunction with cinnamon, eucalyptus and lemon for a clean and fresh air, my take on thieves oil</li>
            <li> Love it, very high quality and excellent packing and shipping.</li>
            <li> The lid wasn&#x27;t sealed, as in the plastic pieces which lock on the plastic pieces had already been opened.  I am the one who opened the package, and I know that it had already been opened.  Since I was mixing up Thieves oil to leave the country with on a missions trip, I went ahead and used it.  This was the same with four of the Essential Oils I purchased from you.  The rest were sealed appropriately.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a mouth pain that someone recommended I use clove oil.  While this product says on one side that it is good for oral pain, it says in another place that it is not to be ingested.  If you use such a product in your mouth, it will certainly be ingested. I did and after a few used, I became sick to my stomach. Plus the taste is absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought this to have on hand for my aquarium (in case any of my fish got deathly sick and were suffering), and luckily haven&#x27;t had to use it for that. However, my husband bit the inside of his lip a day after this arrived, and I put some of this oil on his gums where he damaged it, and it numbed the area for a few hours. Very handy to have on hand.</li>
            <li> as expected, small amount for the price</li>
            <li> I use it a lot during the winter months because it seems to warm us from the inside out. The spicy smell is relaxing to me. The product smells very potent and didn&#x27;t have an off smell</li>
            <li> Great smelling oil and great price!</li>
