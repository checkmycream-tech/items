            <li>Great item, I used it for a while.</li>
            <li>Great brush,  My head says thank you</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>I think this one will be just as good.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think I could ever find a good brush again.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect and I am as happy as pig in the mud, Thanks Earth Therapeutics .</li>
            <li>Nice quality</li>
            <li>OK, BUT HOPING FOR LONGER BRISTLES</li>
            <li>My husband love it.  </li>
            <li>Probably would be fine for most people.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy handling.</li>
            <li>It has good firm bristles and feels good going through my hair and stimulating my scalp.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiffer than many but too close together to be really stimulating to the scalp.</li>
            <li>It is too early to know how well it will hold up, but should be ok.</li>
            <li>The brush wasn&#x27;t as rough as I expected, but still works great.</li>
            <li>It gives you a very invigorating, massaging experience.</li>
            <li>Ii really like the brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>only criticism is the bristles on this new brush are not as soft as my previous one.&lt;br /&gt;That said this brush works great for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased for my sons who are getting older and loosing hair.</li>
            <li>A fine military style brush.</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself, then a few more for my family members.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and cleaner.</li>
            <li>My old brush  lasted 20 plus years</li>
            <li>Bristles are just hard enough to be comfortable.</li>

            <li> Have only had the brush for a few days, but like it so far.</li>
            <li> Brush when hair dry and wear it long in honor of my culture (Native American).  </li>
            <li> But not as large as I had hoped it is very small.</li>
            <li> and guess I had used it for less than 5 total minutes before the bristles started falling out.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> Wanted something with a bigger handle and the bristles very hard you have to soak to loosen up.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush with stiff stimulating bristles for some time.</li>
            <li> Its nearly impossible to find a mans hair brush so when the one i had used for 30 years finally broke in half I looked and looked and bought 2</li>

            <li> Brush when hair dry and wear it long in honor of my culture (Native American).  Keeps hair soft and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. I purchased for my sons who are getting older and loosing hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush. This is what we use for our kids and it makes their glossy and it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> Seems well made and like it will be durable. I have been looking for a brush with stiff stimulating bristles for some time. I was hoping that since this was made with boar bristles that it would be what I was looking for. The bristles are stiffer than many but too close together to be really stimulating to the scalp. Probably would be fine for most people.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly. ðŸ˜€.  But not as large as I had hoped it is very small. Wanted something with a bigger handle and the bristles very hard you have to soak to loosen up.</li>
            <li> The bristles have been falling out in bunches. I&#x27;ve had this brush about a month and guess I had used it for less than 5 total minutes before the bristles started falling out.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. My old brush  lasted 20 plus years I think this one will be just as good.  P.C.</li>
            <li> Its nearly impossible to find a mans hair brush so when the one i had used for 30 years finally broke in half I looked and looked and bought 2 I gave away. This brush is perfect and I am as happy as pig in the mud, Thanks Earth Therapeutics .</li>
            <li> OK, BUT HOPING FOR LONGER BRISTLES</li>
            <li> My husband loves his &amp;#34;mens hair brush&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Stiff but flexible bristles.</li>
            <li> Great brush, price and delivery!</li>
            <li> Like the way it feels</li>
            <li> A fine military style brush.</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality brush. Bought it to replace a Earth Therapeutics brush I bought several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is the bristles on this new brush are not as soft as my previous one.&lt;br /&gt;That said this brush works great for me.</li>
            <li> My husband love it.  Nice quality</li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t think I could ever find a good brush again. 10,000 kudos for this brush</li>
