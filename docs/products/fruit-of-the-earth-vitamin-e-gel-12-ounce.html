            <li>Love this gel and happy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is right and delivery is excellent.</li>
            <li>I do not like oily or alcohol based moisturizers, this goes on so smooth and gives up a great cooling feeling when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>This is an absolutely amazing product i&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>You  may ask the manager of your favorite store to order the product for you.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the vitamin E gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything they say it is and more.</li>
            <li>I plan to order two or three more bottles.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best for your face,-- if you want to protect your skin from windburn,.. and prevent wrinkles or a dry chapped face&lt;</li>
            <li>It works great - and does not sting sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Does not have any strong perfume-like smell and is NOT oily.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for multiple uses!</li>
            <li>Pros: once absorbed, your skin feels great, generally it works Cons:  </li>
            <li>We are very pleased with the quality of the product, and plan on ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>I would never put this product on my face because of the perfume  A fresh or neutral scent would be fine, but this is spicy: in the realm of aftershave, furniture polish...</li>
            <li>It ships quickly and arrives well packaged and sealed.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery as well...</li>
            <li>VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li>My face is never as smooth and soft as when i use this!!!  </li>
            <li>It takes longer to absorb into my skin than I expect, so my first impression was that it felt mildly sticky.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid swimmer.</li>
            <li>Once absorbed, though, my skin is left feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so smooth, and you&#x27;d be pretty hard pressed to find a more affordable product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with dry, sensitive, or ANY KIND OF SKIN.  </li>
            <li>Well - packaged along with FAST delivery.</li>
            <li>and was so excited to have it back-</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product/seller.</li>
            <li>Because I  don&#x27;t like fragrances and because my wife has sensitive eyes when it comes to most moisturizers, this is the only product either of us use on our face and the only one my wife uses on her hands.</li>
            <li>Got a good deal with this seller, not as expensive as others, does not come with free shipping but shipping cost is minimal.  </li>
            <li>it works great for a light everyday lotion- or a little extra for dry spots</li>
            <li>You can also order this product directly  through us.</li>
            <li>I will send you a Direct Order Form.</li>
            <li>Order at least 4 bottles or more at a time.</li>
            <li>A burn scar on my wrist has completely gone away.  </li>
            <li>I could use it alone because the moisture really lasts a long time.  </li>

            <li> This is a reorder.  We order 12 at a time as my husband uses it as lotion after his shower. One lasts him almost a month. It has restored and kept his skin great and never any jockitch. This is hard to find because it was never advertised for the use it works so well as.  It ships quickly and arrives well packaged and sealed. It is on [...] and is MADE IN the USA.</li>
            <li> I am an avid swimmer. As a result, my skin is constantly challenged by the swimming pool&#x27;s chlorine content. The vitamin E gel provides a soothing/hydrating, non-greasy, treatment after a swim. I always notice (and feel) an immediate difference in my skin after using this product. In fact, I use this product in leiu of after-shave-balm. It works great - and does not sting sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for guys too! Does not have any strong perfume-like smell and is NOT oily. It&#x27;s great for preventing chapped skin in the winter AND feels great! No oily residue.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin E gel for about 8 years. Even though I am now over 55, I still have somewhat oily skin which I&#x27;ve had since a teen. It seems that I&#x27;m allergic to any oil based moisturizers as I break out and honestly, never liked that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feel anyway. I LOVE this stuff. It makes your skin feel so smooth, and you&#x27;d be pretty hard pressed to find a more affordable product. I&#x27;ve been told that I have great skin for my age, guess I owe it in part to Vitamin E gel. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Have been using this since I found it on the shelves of a K-Mart about 6 years ago.  I do not like oily or alcohol based moisturizers, this goes on so smooth and gives up a great cooling feeling when you put it on.  The ONLY moisturizer I use and I am a male and soon to be 54.  My kids also use it when they are here visiting.  Even use it on my hair..does the job without making my hair feel \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; all day, eventually wears off so to speak...it was cheaper when I could find it in the stores but this price is as good as it gets now.  Order at least 4 bottles or more at a time.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely amazing product i&#x27;ve been using for years. Works wonders on scars &amp; as an overall daily mositurizer on neck &amp; body. Quick delivery as well...</li>
            <li> Because I  don&#x27;t like fragrances and because my wife has sensitive eyes when it comes to most moisturizers, this is the only product either of us use on our face and the only one my wife uses on her hands. This is just a simple product that works. One bottle lasts us about a year. We keep one in the car and one on the vanity, plus a small dispenser in my wife&#x27;s purse. Just a tiny amount moisturizes and protects the face during our tough winters here in Maine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for your face,-- if you want to protect your skin from windburn,.. and prevent wrinkles or a dry chapped face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this stuff for years in the harshest environments, and my buddies always ask me how I do not get chapped skin, and why do I not have ANY wrinkles at 50 years of age--it is this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be standard issue for all of us in the gulf of mexico! A requirement for facial protection, re-juvenation and just plain comfort.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for multiple uses! My husband uses it to help minimize surgical scars, and to sooth itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt; We are very pleased with the quality of the product, and plan on ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I use this under my daily moisturizer on face and arms/hands.  I could use it alone because the moisture really lasts a long time.  Small lines in face are diminishing.  A burn scar on my wrist has completely gone away.  Got a good deal with this seller, not as expensive as others, does not come with free shipping but shipping cost is minimal.  Highly recommend this product/seller.</li>
            <li> Pros: once absorbed, your skin feels great, generally it works Cons:  takes a long time to absorb, heavy perfume smell  I have used Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera and there is no fragrance in that product.  I simply did not expect any fragrance in this product at all and for me, that is a huge disappointment.  It takes longer to absorb into my skin than I expect, so my first impression was that it felt mildly sticky.  Once absorbed, though, my skin is left feeling soft and healthy. The downside of course is that it made my but smell like aftershave.  I would never put this product on my face because of the perfume  A fresh or neutral scent would be fine, but this is spicy: in the realm of aftershave, furniture polish...motel cleaning products?  Nothing I would ever want to smell like.</li>
            <li> Love this gel and happy I found it on amazon</li>
            <li> This was just a reorder of the Vitamin.  I know it works well, so I just continue to re-order as needed.  Well - packaged along with FAST delivery.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamin E gel. I have been using it for years- until they stopped stocking it at Walmart. I went to all the stores in my area and I couldnt find it anywhere-I was so disappointed- until I found it here. It is the best lotion I have ever had- and was so excited to have it back- it works great for a light everyday lotion- or a little extra for dry spots It is great for travel because it can also be used for a great smoothing shave gel, hair gel, and practically anything else u can imagine. My face is never as smooth and soft as when i use this!!!  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion for my wife awhile back and now she is asking me to re-order it so it must be good stuff!    She says it&#x27;s \\&quot;not greasy or sticky\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I had a hard time finding it in the stores-  you wouldn&#x27;t think so. It is moisturizing and healing all in one.  So simple, but works day after day.  I would recommend it to anyone with dry, sensitive, or ANY KIND OF SKIN.  Very fair price, too.  Send tome to my brother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything they say it is and more. I put it on my face at night before I go to bed, and on my arms in the morning before I go outside. I plan to order two or three more bottles. Try it and you will see what l mean.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I have used it for many years.  Have been very happy ordering it through Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Price is right and delivery is excellent.</li>
