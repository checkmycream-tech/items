            <li>Its really smelling good</li>

            <li>you spray for 10 pumps...would have preferred a strong fragrance...</li>
            <li>the smell was a bit strong for my taste</li>
            <li>Bought this on a whim; light, fresh scent, lasts a good while, and makes me smile.</li>

            <li>THis is a great smelling not deep or too strong cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several bottles of CK brand cologne before and this one is great.</li>
            <li>100% genuine product.</li>
            <li>Also, the price was amazing and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Calvin!!!</li>
            <li>Very fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Instead it was more of  a really clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>While I feel this scent lacks a unique signature like Obscession, Aqua Di Gio Essence,</li>
            <li>It is sweet on the nose without being feminine.</li>
            <li>good experience, would definitely buy</li>
            <li>However, this cologne still keeps me smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>it smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I saw the reviews for CKIN2U and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>(:)Sorry Kids) always the best for online shopping.</li>
            <li>And received it in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this with experience of CKIN2U for womens which my wife had which was really really cool...and long lasting...the one for men is also good however its very mild and the effect goes out after 2 hrs...</li>
            <li>But the best part is that it last a long time!</li>
            <li>It was a very good cologne, the only problem was that it didn&#x27;t last at all!</li>
            <li>This perfume is very nice on the previous reviews say it is not original to me if it&#x27;s me hard on my clothes the aroma all day is certainly a very good recommended size, the aroma is very sweet to people who like gentle but elegant turn</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast the product is great, not much more can really be said Its a nice smelling spray, last a while for me</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it with her, she buried her face in my chest and refused to move.</li>
            <li>First and foremost thing is \\&quot;PRICE\\&quot; which is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>Not as crisp as CK One and not as &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34; [read as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;]</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it is cheap and everyday use.</li>
            <li>It has a deep, clean scent!</li>
            <li>and when i sprayed that on one hand and the Amazon purchased on other, my original perfume lasted easily for over 4 hrs, whereas this perfume i could not smell at all after 30 min.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona, and let me tell you it gets pretty hot here.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I like it.. ready for the quality</li>
            <li>better than other CK perfumes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for fans of Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a strong, overpowering smell like some of those other colognes.</li>
            <li>He had the small sample and loved the big bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong, yet last quite long.</li>
            <li>I bought this last year for my fiance in  department store at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>but I think it fades really fast but for the price that&#x27;s not surprising its ok</li>
            <li>Bought this twice so far.</li>
            <li>Just one dab on my wrists lasted nearly 7 hours including a grueling workout session and shower.</li>
            <li>I still had some perfume left in my old bottle</li>
            <li>THAN I EXPECTED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>, it is none the less a very pleasing scent that I use without hesitation.  </li>

            <li> Makes me smell like the man I am</li>
            <li> This is an excellent mens cologne, at a great price!!</li>
            <li> This cologne is freaking awesome I love it! I use to use CK eternity summer for men. It was a very good cologne, the only problem was that it didn&#x27;t last at all! Luckily, I saw the reviews for CKIN2U and decided to buy it. When it finally got here I sprayed some one my wrist to test the smell. I was a little hesitant at first because I was use to my other cologne. I felt like this one lacked in comparison somewhat. Boy was I wrong! One night I decided to give it a shot and sprayed on me some before going out. I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice of a fragrance it was. It wasn&#x27;t a strong, overpowering smell like some of those other colognes. Instead it was more of  a really clean and fresh smell. The girls really loved it as well. I got many complements from my family and friends. Even my girlfriend loved the stuff. The first time I wore it with her, she buried her face in my chest and refused to move. She said I smelled really good. But the best part is that it last a long time! I live in Arizona, and let me tell you it gets pretty hot here. However, this cologne still keeps me smelling fresh and clean. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching to any other cologne for a while.</li>

            <li> I have used this perfume before thats why i purchased the larger bottle. This is not the same. it smells slightly different and the smell disappears in 15 minutes flat. Amazon policy did not allow me to return this item, so i am stuck. I still had some perfume left in my old bottle and when i sprayed that on one hand and the Amazon purchased on other, my original perfume lasted easily for over 4 hrs, whereas this perfume i could not smell at all after 30 min.</li>
            <li> While I feel this scent lacks a unique signature like Obscession, Aqua Di Gio Essence, etc., it is none the less a very pleasing scent that I use without hesitation.  A very good &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; cologne that I wear a lot.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance, it is cheap and everyday use. I have friends who like this as well, so I would say it is a Universal fragrance.</li>

            <li> I bought this with experience of CKIN2U for womens which my wife had which was really really cool...and long lasting...the one for men is also good however its very mild and the effect goes out after 2 hrs...uinless you spray for 10 pumps...would have preferred a strong fragrance...</li>
            <li> Great price for this cologne. I bought this last year for my fiance in  department store at a much higher price. Great scent - not too strong. Very fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, light fragrance, yet masculine scent. good for every day use. Good price, quick delivery. I highly recommend it for fans of Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li> cheap way to buy this nice cologne</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim; light, fresh scent, lasts a good while, and makes me smile. Lots of compliments, too! Thanks, Calvin!!!</li>
            <li> Great Prince and I love this cologne - received quickly and undamaged!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I love it. My friend loves it and every time I wear this cologne, she sinks her face into my shoulder and says she loves the cologne and it is her favorite now. :)</li>
            <li> the smell was a bit strong for my taste I had to give.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. It is sweet on the nose without being feminine. The only drawback is that the tip for the sprayer somehow shoots a jet as opposed to a mist.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store at this price. It&#x27;s an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> A fan. Bought this twice so far.</li>
            <li> better than other CK perfumes</li>
            <li> You only going to smell this after you spray !The CK disappear to quick !!!&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed !!!I will not recommended this product</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume. 100% genuine product. Came impeccably packed. The scent is not too strong, yet last quite long. Just one dab on my wrists lasted nearly 7 hours including a grueling workout session and shower.</li>
            <li> Believe me, this is one of the best fragrance in the CK line of products for men.First and foremost thing is \\&quot;PRICE\\&quot; which is unbeatable. You won&#x27;t get this price in any departmental\perfumania stores for the 150ML quantity. Letter \\&quot;A\\&quot; stands for Amazon not \\&quot;Apple\\&quot; (:)Sorry Kids) always the best for online shopping. (maybe not all but for most of the products). I am planning to buy one more in couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband and it smells very nice and cheaper than anywhere else that i have found.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast the product is great, not much more can really be said Its a nice smelling spray, last a while for me</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and lasts</li>
            <li> Not as crisp as CK One and not as &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34; [read as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;] either, this is a nice addition to the fragrance line.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, cumpli&amp;oacute; todas mis expectativas, y el tiempo de entrega fue el esperado y acordado muy bueno siii excelnete</li>
            <li> good experience, would definitely buy</li>

THE bottle style, sizing, price, and most of all the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I PLAN TO BUY ANOTHER BOTTLE even before this one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT ALL ROUND!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;NICE DAILY SPORTY SCENT&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY BETTER THAN I EXPECTED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT..........&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++</li>
            <li> Very nice, light scent. Great for work or profession environment. The price for the 5oz on Amazon was the lowest I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Euphoria Intesne is awesome! Great for going out. My gf loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;Corey</li>
            <li> all excellent, and came out when I get to the date, the same characteristics as described at the time of bid</li>
            <li> Not a great fragrance. But good for the cost</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my Dad for Christmas. It&#x27;s his favorite cologne. He loves it! And received it in the mail quickly. It&#x27;s also a big bottle for a great price!!</li>
            <li> Got this gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. He had the small sample and loved the big bottle.</li>
            <li> This smells awesome! i read reviews about how it goes away after a few hours, well, i wore it around 5 pm and still at around 12 AM i had the same smell on me, and i might add i didn&#x27;t even wear a lot. the smell is good enough, not too light or not too strong, def recommend for those who are CK lovers or for ladies looking for your men to smell good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my dad as a gift since he really loved this cologne. Also, the price was amazing and shipping was fast. This is a great seller, I would highly recommend and purchase from again &#x3D;)</li>
