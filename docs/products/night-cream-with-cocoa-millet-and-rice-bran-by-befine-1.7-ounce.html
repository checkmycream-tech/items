            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and not greasy and it makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>got a deluxe sample in my birchbox</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is a great plus (even though I would love if it smelled more like cocoa).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It glides onto your skin and absorbs quickly, and has a very, very light and pleasant smell</li>
            <li>Good price quick delivery.</li>
            <li>, it is an amazing and cheap service) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I do like this a lot, I gave 4 stars because I have tried better moisturizers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now my favorite moisturizer is [[ASIN:B000Z5Y2XQ</li>
            <li>The Philosophy feels more watery, is sort of cooling and is more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It did not sit on top of my face or leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, yet effective in smoothing lines.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is light, it smells nice, and it nourishes my skin with leaving it with a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>This product is the best night cream that I have come across in a long time.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for me, but people with extremely dry skin might want to try something else.</li>
            <li>This natural night cream is great for nourishing your face.</li>
            <li>I got this a while back in a birchbox sample and absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>me, the best test of a night cream is one that intensely hydrates your skin without feeling too greasy and doesn&#x27;t break me out OR burn my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Philosophy has more powerful ingredients.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit off-putting and strange, but my face seems to be happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly, leaving your face smooth.</li>
            <li>I like that this night cream was light and soaked into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It has done amazing things for my beginning-to-age skin at 31 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>Would I recommend this in its full price?</li>
            <li>My favorite Befine product is the [[ASIN:B001BBFRJQ Gentle Cleanser with Sugar, Mint, Oats and Rice by Befine, 3.4 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am super picky with my moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This night cream is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>The price I paid was a great value, and much less than retail.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better stuff if you willing to spend that much money.</li>
            <li>Light, gentle and nourishing.</li>
            <li>Love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Befine has more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Iam putting this cream at night before I go to bed , my face looks fresh in the morning</li>
            <li>This skin cream is wonderful for sensitive skin, healing enough for night-time and light enough for day use.</li>
            <li>When I run out of my sample size, I will absolutely be purchasing a full size cream.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with a pretty oily T zone and this is just about right for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is sensitive and prone to break outs, and I really need to be able to hydrate it</li>
            <li>The product is non greasy, lightweight, smells nice (not strong) and leaves my skin pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>Price is decent and I love the natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>Actually made me break out more.</li>
            <li>As we age, our facial skin dries out easily, and this cream moisturizes and helps restore elasticity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset.</li>
            <li>(it may even be fragrance free and this is simply how the lotion smells).  </li>
            <li>soon enough I might be buying the full size product.</li>
            <li>cream is more like a lotion than a cream, and it is easy to dispense too much - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this cream in my Birchbox last month, and, as I am on the look out for a new day and evening moisturizer, I was excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product, a little goes a long way, so I think the price on Amazon ($15) is very fair (not the $30 the company is starting to charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Befine Night Cream is light and fast absorbing and my face is not an oily mess in the morning</li>
            <li>My very sensitive skin has no adverse reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle night cream I found in sample sizes at a local store.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Mine was old apon arrival.</li>
            <li>The product smelled like it was 10 years old</li>
            <li>Hope in a jar is usually more expensive, but I think worth it.</li>
            <li>This is such a fine little moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not oily, goes on smoothly, and reduces small wrinkles.</li>
            <li>or I get some dry skin patches, and this cream really helps me with that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and it leaves your skin feeling very soft and moisturized the next morning.  </li>
            <li>Because my skin is dry, super sensitive and acne prone, it&#x27;s hard to find products that really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and this night cream went on thin and didn&#x27;t seem to give my face a soft feel in the morning like most other creams.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is not moisturizing enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see a similar lightweight formula for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts long, softens the skin and keeps skin looking &amp;#34;sunny&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, I cannot throw in a mattifying moisturizer, otherwise it will be flaky and get dry cracks of skin; while not giving up producing oil.</li>
            <li> It is thin, but very hydrating.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Both CVS and Rite Aid stopped carrying it, they still have some of the other Befine skin products but not the night cream.   </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out</li>
            <li> Every other lotion im guessing isn&#x27;t the problem</li>
            <li> I have trouble with a lot of face creams irritating my skin, but this one is rather soothing and is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I like it because a little goes a long way and once it&#x27;s on, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> They really shouldn&#x27;t call it a cream because it&#x27;s very thin; even thinner than hand lotion, for example, so I can see why that could be misleading.</li>
            <li> So I usually opt for a heavy-duty moisturizer to treat the dryness, but it is hard to find a moisturizer for dry skin that won&#x27;t be so heavy that will cause break outs.</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle, definitely not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more you can ask for from a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t very harsh.</li>
            <li> It is scarce an hard to find but I will always snatch it up when I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month at least and no irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> skin is complicated and hard to be treated.</li>
            <li> and it is awfully oily.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is such a fine little moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is complicated and hard to be treated. It is acne prone and it is awfully oily. However, I cannot throw in a mattifying moisturizer, otherwise it will be flaky and get dry cracks of skin; while not giving up producing oil. So I usually opt for a heavy-duty moisturizer to treat the dryness, but it is hard to find a moisturizer for dry skin that won&#x27;t be so heavy that will cause break outs. Yeah, feel the drama. &#x3D;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This night cream does the job! It is thin, but very hydrating. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is a great plus (even though I would love if it smelled more like cocoa).&lt;br /&gt;I got a deluxe sample in my birchbox (google it, it is an amazing and cheap service) and soon enough I might be buying the full size product. Until then, I cannot comment on packaging.&lt;br /&gt;For this product, a little goes a long way, so I think the price on Amazon ($15) is very fair (not the $30 the company is starting to charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like this a lot, I gave 4 stars because I have tried better moisturizers. Would I recommend this? Yes, for all skin types, actually. Would I recommend this in its full price? Nope. There&#x27;s better stuff if you willing to spend that much money.</li>
            <li> i got a sample of this product in a Birch Box monthly gift.  It has done amazing things for my beginning-to-age skin at 31 yrs old.  I&#x27;ve used it for a month at least and no irritation whatsoever.  No negatives from me!</li>
            <li> This product is the best night cream that I have come across in a long time. I have oily skin and most night creams are too thick and heavy which causes my skin to breakout. Befine Night Cream is light and fast absorbing and my face is not an oily mess in the morning but now it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. Both CVS and Rite Aid stopped carrying it, they still have some of the other Befine skin products but not the night cream.   Hope I can continue to find it, thank you American Beauty and Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It smells good, it isn&#x27;t greasy, it goes on well, and makes my skin feel supple. Love it!</li>
            <li> This natural night cream is great for nourishing your face. It is not oily, goes on smoothly, and reduces small wrinkles. As we age, our facial skin dries out easily, and this cream moisturizes and helps restore elasticity. The price I paid was a great value, and much less than retail.</li>
            <li> Actually made me break out more. Had to go to dermatologist to fix my face.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and this night cream went on thin and didn&#x27;t seem to give my face a soft feel in the morning like most other creams. On the other hand, it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out so it isn&#x27;t very harsh.</li>
            <li> This is not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. I am super picky with my moisturizers. Because my skin is dry, super sensitive and acne prone, it&#x27;s hard to find products that really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is probably great for combination or oily skin. The product is non greasy, lightweight, smells nice (not strong) and leaves my skin pretty smooth. I have trouble with a lot of face creams irritating my skin, but this one is rather soothing and is not irritating at all. I&#x27;d like to see a similar lightweight formula for dry skin. Love the natural ingredients. Befine is a wonderful natural brand. My favorite Befine product is the [[ASIN:B001BBFRJQ Gentle Cleanser with Sugar, Mint, Oats and Rice by Befine, 3.4 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now my favorite moisturizer is [[ASIN:B000Z5Y2XQ Philosophy Hope in a Jar Daily Moisturizer, All Skin Types, 2 Ounce]]. Both products are similar in how lightweight they are. The Philosophy feels more watery, is sort of cooling and is more moisturizing. The Befine is creamier, isn&#x27;t cooling and doesn&#x27;t give me enogh moisture. The Befine doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, the Hope in a Jar does (I try and keep it away from my eyes). Befine has more natural ingredients. Philosophy has more powerful ingredients. Hope in a jar is usually more expensive, but I think worth it. Hope that gives you some insight!</li>
            <li> My total go to moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This product is moisturizing but not greasy. It absorbs into the skin quickly, leaving your face smooth. For reference, I have oily skin so it&#x27;s perfect for me, but people with extremely dry skin might want to try something else. I might even use this as a day time moisturizer and just add sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Mine was old apon arrival. The product smelled like it was 10 years old and it was like water. I&#x27;m very upset.</li>
            <li> I like that this night cream was light and soaked into the skin quickly. It did not sit on top of my face or leave my skin feeling greasy. The smell is a bit off-putting and strange, but my face seems to be happy with the product. I prefer the Befine Daily Moisturizer, but will likely repurchase this one, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years in combination with the toner and scrub.  My very sensitive skin has no adverse reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this on Amazon. This is a very gentle night cream I found in sample sizes at a local store. So when their supply ran out I was devastated. It lasts long, softens the skin and keeps skin looking &amp;#34;sunny&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This cream is great for night time.  It&#x27;s not too greasy and it leaves your skin feeling very soft and moisturized the next morning.  The scent is very subtle, definitely not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> The best night cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s light, yet effective in smoothing lines.  You can feel it working the moment it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this cream in my Birchbox last month, and, as I am on the look out for a new day and evening moisturizer, I was excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is more like a lotion than a cream, and it is easy to dispense too much - a little goes a long way.  It glides onto your skin and absorbs quickly, and has a very, very light and pleasant smell (it may even be fragrance free and this is simply how the lotion smells).  I&#x27;ve been using it in the evenings, have been really impressed with how my skin felt afterwards as well as in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the best test of a night cream is one that intensely hydrates your skin without feeling too greasy and doesn&#x27;t break me out OR burn my sensitive skin.  I have combination skin that is sensitive and prone to break outs, and I really need to be able to hydrate it or I get some dry skin patches, and this cream really helps me with that.  When I run out of my sample size, I will absolutely be purchasing a full size cream.</li>
            <li> I use this every night after removing my makeup. It&#x27;s smooth and not greasy and it makes my skin feel great. The price is right and it lasts a long time. There&#x27;s not much more you can ask for from a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good price quick delivery. This stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s the only night cream that gets rid of the lines on my face. I look younger when I use it.</li>
            <li> I got this a while back in a birchbox sample and absolutely loved it! I have combination skin and it always leaves my skin feeling moisturized without the grease. Price is decent and I love the natural ingredients in it. This night cream is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with a pretty oily T zone and this is just about right for my skin. They really shouldn&#x27;t call it a cream because it&#x27;s very thin; even thinner than hand lotion, for example, so I can see why that could be misleading. I like it because a little goes a long way and once it&#x27;s on, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Literally the only thing currently not making my skin break out and cleared it in a couple days. Every other lotion im guessing isn&#x27;t the problem it&#x27;s just this one is really good or something idk but I have to use for the rest of my life.I use it during the day too even tho it says at night. So obviously 5 stars from me lol</li>
            <li> This is my favorite night moisturizer. It is scarce an hard to find but I will always snatch it up when I do.</li>
            <li> Iam putting this cream at night before I go to bed , my face looks fresh in the morning</li>
            <li> I actually discovered this brand via Birchbox (a monthly sample company). I got the sample in November and I started using it earlier this year. I LOVE this night cream (well, day cream for me!). It is light, it smells nice, and it nourishes my skin with leaving it with a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Light, gentle and nourishing. This skin cream is wonderful for sensitive skin, healing enough for night-time and light enough for day use.</li>
