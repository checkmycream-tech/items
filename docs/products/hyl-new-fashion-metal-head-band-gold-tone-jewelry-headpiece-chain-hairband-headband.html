            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty with a old school feel.</li>
            <li>: The headpiece was kind of tight on my head so I had to extend it a bit.</li>
            <li>It ships fast and looks as pictured.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS SHIPPED FAST AND PACKAGED</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really gold but more of a copper gold</li>
            <li>I really like this head piece.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a gift for a friend who is really into headchains that are boho chic?</li>
            <li>Very cheapy, costumey.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, wasn&#x27;t what I thought, over all</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t pin it decently in my hair.</li>
            <li>In any event, it was a great thrill for my teenage cousin who ended up getting it, and it&#x27;s not nearly as &#x27;cheapo&#x27; looking as I expected it to be for the price.</li>
            <li>it looks the exact same as the picture</li>
            <li>but it does fit rather oddly.</li>
            <li>Cheap don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li>adjustable, good value, my sister wore it casually for a day out and to her school&#x27;s Egyptian themed winter formal.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I love it, only downside is that one of the chains fell off and i had to remove it since clipping it back in was too hard.</li>
            <li>At least it was incredibly cheap</li>
            <li>It looks kinda cheap and is delicate</li>
            <li>Recently went natural</li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered this it gave me a complete different one</li>
            <li>came in a little earlier but it looks EXACTLY how it looks in the picture</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t pin it decently in my hair.</li>
            <li> In any event, it was a great thrill for my teenage cousin who ended up getting it, and it&#x27;s not nearly as &#x27;cheapo&#x27; looking as I expected it to be for the price.</li>
            <li> it looks the exact same as the picture</li>
            <li> but it does fit rather oddly.</li>

            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love it, only downside is that one of the chains fell off and i had to remove it since clipping it back in was too hard.</li>
            <li> At least it was incredibly cheap</li>
            <li> It looks kinda cheap and is delicate</li>
            <li> Recently went natural</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this it gave me a complete different one</li>
            <li> came in a little earlier but it looks EXACTLY how it looks in the picture</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice but for some reason it came with a piece of chain broken :/</li>
            <li> It was kinda confusing at first.</li>
            <li> Really pretty, delicate piece.</li>
            <li> its cheap but looks expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for long period of time and the color hasn&#x27;t washed off</li>
            <li> Took long to get here but got here just in time</li>
            <li> hard to put on where its fixed correctly and does bot stay on long falls right away difficult to wear</li>
            <li> Nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> You will def be the center of attention.</li>
            <li> I imagine it to be all that I expected</li>
            <li> Four stars only because it was broken on one side when it arrived but was easily fixed.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will remain like this.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;stones&#x27; look a bit odd, but it came in one piece and looks alright, and my sister does like it.</li>
            <li> but when I got it, it broke in half.</li>
            <li> I was pretty unhappy with this head band.</li>
            <li> Stones were too heavy and pulled chain down into eyes.</li>
            <li> but it I will be wearing it with my hair when it get a little cooler that way</li>
            <li> Did not fit well.</li>
            <li> ordered 3and each one was lopsided or missing pieces</li>
            <li> .what a waste of money .never</li>
            <li> It has continued all summer long on that ankle without breaking, turning, or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what you wanted if not better.</li>
            <li> I would definately advise give yourself at least 3 weeks if you want to get it in time for your event.</li>
            <li> I would NOT intend to wear it as &amp;#34;fashion&amp;#34; in any sort of serious manner; strictly for giggles.</li>
            <li> These head pieces were deficient .i</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just poorly constructed or what,</li>
            <li> but they failed to mention that it takes over 3 weeks to receive it.  </li>
            <li> difficult to wear, would not stay on and also broke upon arrival...</li>
            <li> The material is flimsy so I&#x27;m always afraid it will break if I try to adjust it at all.</li>
            <li> Never received the item, supper disappointing.</li>
            <li> 1/2 weeks wasn&#x27;t to bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Had to fix wat broke off orher than that looks great</li>
            <li> Cute head piece but kind of hard to get it to stay in place when wearing it out. The material is flimsy so I&#x27;m always afraid it will break if I try to adjust it at all. Up side is for the price it&#x27;s a cute summer piece.</li>
            <li> Very pretty! I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments. It ships fast and looks as pictured.</li>
            <li> I bought this headpiece of a whim and it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve done. The picture on here doesn&#x27;t even do it justice it&#x27;s so pretty in person! I wore it for Halloween &amp; it was the perfect finishing touch for my costume</li>
            <li> Broke before even used</li>
            <li> Cute but broke immediately.</li>
            <li> Product was  good.Nothing too special. It was kinda confusing at first. And kept getting tangled.I now use it as a necklace lol</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I decided to wrap this around my ankle for a day, and ended up never taking it off. People loved it. I loved it. It has continued all summer long on that ankle without breaking, turning, or irritating my skin. Totally the best anklet ive ever had, for less than $2. Brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ehhhh. It&#x27;s pretty but it does fit rather oddly. For the price I paid, however, I would say the seller must be getting these for free, bc it is easily worth more than the $1 and some change I gave them.  In any event, it was a great thrill for my teenage cousin who ended up getting it, and it&#x27;s not nearly as &#x27;cheapo&#x27; looking as I expected it to be for the price.</li>

            <li> Exactly what I expected. I was looking for a cheap head piece just so I could get a bohemian vibe and I love it. I reccomend this if you want to have some fun and try a new look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: The headpiece was kind of tight on my head so I had to extend it a bit.</li>

            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s so cute! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it to the club!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for I guess... it popped immediately after one wear. Well.. it didn&#x27;t even make it all the way through to the one wear.</li>
            <li> Its a very good looking decorative chain for the hair making a woman feel pretty and femenine.</li>
            <li> Loved it! It looks exactly as the picture! Must buy! Shipping takes a week of so but totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. came in a little earlier but it looks EXACTLY how it looks in the picture and im just in love with it.</li>
            <li> I received my headband earlier then the estimated shipping date which was a plus. It&#x27;s a great buy for the price. It&#x27;s not really gold but more of a copper gold but it&#x27;ll work for me for the price. Packaging was great and the product exceeded my expectations. Would buy again! I gave the product 4 stars because of the color not being gold.</li>
            <li> Its very cute and it fits my big head well. It looks exactly like the picture. I straighten my hair just to wear this cute head band.</li>
            <li> adjustable, good value, my sister wore it casually for a day out and to her school&#x27;s Egyptian themed winter formal. She said it didn&#x27;t fall off or bother her while she was dancing; she even forgot it was on. Nice find.</li>
            <li> Stones were too heavy and pulled chain down into eyes. Wasn&#x27;t able to wear ever</li>

            <li> I really like this head piece. I&#x27;ve had it for long period of time and the color hasn&#x27;t washed off</li>
            <li> Its beautiful... Thx :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t pin it decently in my hair. No matter where I place it, it sags somewhere else.  At least it was incredibly cheap</li>

            <li> Its cute and its adjustable(thank goodness bc i have  quite the large head) and its cute and highly sophisticated! I love it, only downside is that one of the chains fell off and i had to remove it since clipping it back in was too hard. They get tangled easily so have a manequin to put it on. Its an awesome beautiful product</li>
            <li> I ordered this headpiece and thought it would look great for our Persian party but they failed to mention that it takes over 3 weeks to receive it.  I waited and waited but it didn&#x27;t come so I would definately advise give yourself at least 3 weeks if you want to get it in time for your event.</li>

            <li> These head pieces were deficient .i ordered 3and each one was lopsided or missing pieces .of course they came from China so who can afford to ship them back .what a waste of money .never again.👎</li>
