            <li>Overall very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>I love a gray lip.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and would buy more of these for sure.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, like mild vanilla.</li>
            <li>Great Quality, authentic, pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, great coverage, no weird smell or taste like some unusual lipstick colors have.</li>
            <li>I love all NYX products and this is very pretty</li>
            <li>Even on it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s very opaque, stays on, doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light gray color and a matte just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>on smooth..</li>
            <li>Glides on smooth but the color isn&#x27;t what I imagined it would be.</li>
            <li>The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li>Looks great on pale girls :)</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick,It&#x27;s  true to the picture shown it&#x27;s  highly pigmented , it goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>This lipstick is very pretty and unique.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>The color looked more like a grey, I was expecting more of a tan/brown.</li>
            <li>My only qualm is that the lid comes off easily, but, since this colour is so unique, I have chosen to give it 5 stars -- it lasts a long time and looks great on me.</li>
            <li>I have this only two stars because it is a nice texture</li>
            <li>think it will look pretty nice when summer finally gets here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like a little goes a long way, which is really wonderful</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Also, it shipped really fast and was packaged w/ care (lots of bubble wrap!).</li>
            <li>More grey than macaron</li>
            <li>Thought it was a much lighter gray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in a hate/love relationship with this Lippie haha ..</li>
            <li>I really wanted this lipstick on the Nyx website, but it was sold</li>
            <li>It absolutely is not!&lt;br /&gt;It is a pastel</li>
            <li>Shipped SO fast, and color is great and weird.</li>
            <li>The grey will mix with a brighter colour to make it less bright.</li>
            <li>Somehow this outperforms the other NYX Macaron Pastel Lippie that I own (in Earl Grey).</li>
            <li>brand new, mint packaging.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s different but pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy for a matte lipstick, but comfortable for longtime wear.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a lip primer before applying to prevent having to frequently applying throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It did not dry out my lips and did not have</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s to bright and ugly</li>
    </ol>

            <li> knew this, since I had seen other women wearing it, and checked the website.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend looking up the lipstick on the website, or googling the color, before you purchase if you have not seen it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also when you use it, the lipstick goes down by itself.</li>
            <li> you save a few bucks going through here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Totally not what I was expecting. Thought it was a much lighter gray but I can still manage to make it work. I&#x27;m in a hate/love relationship with this Lippie haha ..</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. But it is a different color in person. More grey than macaron</li>
            <li> Looks great on pale girls :)</li>

            <li> I loooove this lippie. I wish it would stay on longer because the color is magnificent.</li>
            <li> PERFECT SHIPPING, my 4 star review lays mainly in the product itself. It&#x27;s a little greasy for a matte lipstick, but comfortable for longtime wear.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great for fall/ winter. To make it more wearable I jus pair it with a lip liner</li>
            <li> Such an awesome color!</li>
            <li> Great lippie!!!!!!! It&#x27;s a light gray color and a matte just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I kinda like wearing this when I am Not wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I think it will look pretty nice when summer finally gets here.&lt;br /&gt;goes on smooth..&lt;br /&gt;lasts for Quite awhile.  doesn&#x27;t feel chalky.</li>
            <li> Nice color! Just wished it stayed on a lil longer otherwise love it</li>
            <li> Not a good color. The seller still hasn&#x27;t contacted me to return it was opened abs melted, DO MOYNBUY</li>
            <li> The color looked more like a grey, I was expecting more of a tan/brown. I didn&#x27;t like it on my lips.</li>
            <li> Item as described but not for me.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted. The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong color and it was really ugly</li>
            <li> Great item as describe AAA+++</li>
            <li> I have this only two stars because it is a nice texture but the color is not as taupe as it appears.  It looks like whitish chalk on the lips. I bought a taupe lip pencil to mix with it to achieve the desired color</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a lip primer before applying to prevent having to frequently applying throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Shipped SO fast, and color is great and weird. Goes on smooth, great coverage, no weird smell or taste like some unusual lipstick colors have. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love all NYX products and this is very pretty it&#x27;s different but pretty</li>
            <li> Not the color I thought I was getting.. it&#x27;s to bright and ugly I hate it ..it kinda looks like a sky blue ahhh</li>
            <li> I really wanted this lipstick on the Nyx website, but it was sold out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was bummed, then I realized Amazon would probably have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough it did, and it was smarter to purchase through Amazon in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nyx website had the Macaron lipsticks for $6 each. But if you only plan to purchase one item, shipping is $5.&lt;br /&gt;So you save a few bucks going through here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I&#x27;d say is the color IS different in the picture.  It looks brown. It absolutely is not!&lt;br /&gt;It is a pastel gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew this, since I had seen other women wearing it, and checked the website.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend looking up the lipstick on the website, or googling the color, before you purchase if you have not seen it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was just what I expected, and like I said, I saved a few bucks going through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome color! Great for ombré lips.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT......the pigmentation is great....can&#x27;t wait until I get the entire collection....</li>
            <li> Great Quality, authentic, pretty fast shipping. Overall very happy with this purchase (:</li>
            <li> Somehow this outperforms the other NYX Macaron Pastel Lippie that I own (in Earl Grey). This stays on my lips much longer, and looks wonderful. I love a gray lip. It can also be easily mixed with other colours to create something a bit muted. The grey will mix with a brighter colour to make it less bright. I&#x27;ve also layered it with a brownish lipliner to create a gray-brown lip shade. My only qualm is that the lid comes off easily, but, since this colour is so unique, I have chosen to give it 5 stars -- it lasts a long time and looks great on me.</li>
            <li> brand new, mint packaging.  Very confident with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Glides on smooth but the color isn&#x27;t what I imagined it would be. Also when you use it, the lipstick goes down by itself.</li>

            <li> This lipstick is very pretty and unique. Great price. It smells really nice, like mild vanilla. It applies thin but opaque and has a creamy texture. I feel like a little goes a long way, which is really wonderful so I&#x27;m not using a ton of product. It did not dry out my lips and did not have a cake-y or thick feel to it. I absolutely love it and would buy more of these for sure. Also, it shipped really fast and was packaged w/ care (lots of bubble wrap!).</li>
