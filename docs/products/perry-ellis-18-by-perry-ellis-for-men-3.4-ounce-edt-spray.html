            <li>Glad I found this.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite of all the Perry Ellis fragrances.</li>
            <li>I Love The Way it Smells</li>
            <li>go?\\&quot;  18 comes out of the bottle with a blend of citrus and spice notes that settles into a nice clean and fresh scent that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much more needs to be said of the longevity -</li>
            <li>I would imagine that compliments would occur if I did not have so many in my collection.  </li>
            <li>Very clean.</li>
            <li>Most definitely, easy on the nose</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great smell in my body this fragrance smell same all day</li>
            <li>I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li>I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li>What I have found is that most, some better than others, the longevity is below average.  </li>
            <li>sillage is positive, but quickly settles to just at the skin level.  </li>
            <li>It has a Soft and smooth smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I have not received any compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor, I enjoy wearing 18.  </li>
            <li>Not too much problem.</li>
            <li>My cousin really loves it.</li>
            <li>but very soon you will not feel it...</li>
            <li>Fluid is not as strong as what is bought in stores locally.</li>
            <li>Try something new...</li>
            <li>new...</li>
            <li>but the bottle is filled with a fragrance which smells nothing like the actual cologne (which Ive been using for years) but instead smells like soap water, which isn&#x27;t a gross smell, but if I wanted to smell like Soap water I&#x27;d pay 4 bucks for it at walmart.</li>
            <li>I have bought perry ellis 18 at dept. stores in the past, but it cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to smell the same all day anyways?  </li>
            <li>This cologne is not too strong or too weak.  </li>
            <li>Even on the shirtsleeve, the fragrance is barely traceable following 2 hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> not good when hot in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> The packaging is above average and another step by Perry Ellis to portray a richness of the fragrance to those of BVLGARI, Ralph Lauren, Versace, and others.  </li>
            <li> will add that I am inspired by the bottle design, providing a different shape and look from the typical cologne.  </li>
            <li> it diminishes rapidly and hardly detectable after two hours following the initial application.  </li>

            <li> Excellent fragrance. I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day and I had to get one for myself as I kept stealing it from him lol...</li>
            <li> This cologne is not too strong or too weak.  Smells like a perfect blend of stuff. This smell is something you can get use to smelling without being over powered. It has a Soft and smooth smell. Good for any occasion. The only down side of this cologne is the half life. Most of the smell is gone in about 4-6 hours. Not too much problem. Who wants to smell the same all day anyways?  Lol. So this is perfect for parties and nights out. It draws compliments before it fades away into thin air.</li>

            <li> Wow smells great! Great job Perry Ellis! Would buy 10/10</li>
            <li> I pulled the bottle out of the box super excited to try on the fragrance and was extremely disappointed to find that this wasn&#x27;t the actual Perry Ellis 18 cologne.

Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> No problem here. Smells great. The bottle looks great. My cousin really loves it. We had no problems. Great job.</li>
            <li> Great smell in my body this fragrance smell same all day</li>
            <li> Glad I found this. It is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Fluid is not as strong as what is bought in stores locally. It smells like PE18 but it smells a little weak and needs two extra squirts to be like</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis has done it right with his Fragrences I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light and it&#x27;s last it makes you wanna have sex with yourself it smells so good.</li>

Nicely done..!!  The packaging is above average and another step by Perry Ellis to portray a richness of the fragrance to those of BVLGARI, Ralph Lauren, Versace, and others.  works hard creating a richness feel with it&#x27;s fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance probably works best in Spring and Summer, but given the brevity of the fragrance, you will need to reapply often.  18 would work for just about any occasion and as you might guess, it is not overpowering - no complaints from your co-workers..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have not received any compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor, I enjoy wearing 18.  I would imagine that compliments would occur if I did not have so many in my collection.  If you can find 18 in the $20-$25 range, possibly cheaper, I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  Yes, the longevity is lousy, but the fragrance deserves a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give 18 4.0 stars out of 5.  I like the bottle and the fragrance is pleasant.  Try something new... You may like it..!!hing new... You may like it..!!</li>
