            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>This is a truly enjoyable aftershave to use.</li>

            <li>Nivea in my experience  has always made good aftershaves and this is no different, a good buy, I like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this after shave, because it smells really good</li>
            <li>I enjoy their after shave balms, but dislike feeling greasy all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of smell that drove me away from modern shaving foams and</li>
            <li>scent is something in the range of the \\&quot;aqua\\&quot; or \\&quot;blue\\&quot; colognes... very fresh and light.</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and clean but never overpowering.</li>
            <li>B000C1VZX8 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men.</li>
            <li>- I love the smell, I really do.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh scent with some staying power.</li>
            <li>Quick response and timely delivery.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m a huge Nivea fan.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite Nivea product.</li>
            <li>Smells good and works as expected.</li>
            <li>I found this at a local grocery, and liked the sent, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>but for now, this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Nice clean subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Really calms the skin after a shave, too.</li>
            <li>like this, I really do, but a three star rating is all it&#x27;s going to get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a subtle but pleasant scent — a little more modern than the musky aftershaves of old.</li>
            <li>still gave it a four since new</li>
            <li>This may sound backwards, but this leaves my skin far less irritated than the greasy aftershave lotions.</li>
            <li>Got this as a Christmas gift for my husband, since he was running out of the old bottle he had.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good, not great, not wonderful but good, a solid good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>In general, I prefer after-shave splashes that contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nice clean subtle scent. Great value. My husband thinks formula might have recently changed because it caused him minor skin irritation and doesn&#x27;t leave his skin with the same &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; feeling as it previously did.</li>

            <li> Clean, fresh scent with some staying power. A bit of a floral and soapy scent. Really calms the skin after a shave, too. Great post shave product.</li>
            <li> What a great product and it smells great.  A very clean scent that doesn’t linger.  It wakes me up and makes my face feel wonderful.  I wish they had it in the stores but I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it..</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. It is what I expect from Nivea! I have used their produces in the past and will continue to do so in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works as expected.</li>
            <li> You can buy this at Walmart for $5.77. This has a nice scent that is not too strong. What is real nice about this product is the effect after you  apply, any irritation is immediately relieved along with redness. I like the Tabac[[ASIN:B000C1VZX8 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men. Aftershave 10.1 Oz.]] the best but this is a good change of pace. Both are about the same price.</li>
            <li> I have tender skin and horrible allergies. Most aftershaves leave me feeling greasy, irritated, and sneezing from the horrible scents. I found this at a local grocery, and liked the sent, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is something in the range of the \\&quot;aqua\\&quot; or \\&quot;blue\\&quot; colognes... very fresh and light. Not overpowering. I&#x27;ve been actually skipping cologne on the days I splash this on after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a bite to it--obviously from alcohol content. I like it. This may sound backwards, but this leaves my skin far less irritated than the greasy aftershave lotions. Currently we are in the midst of summer, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out like the winter... but for now, this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much. Quick response and timely delivery. Good quality.</li>
            <li> They had a version of this stuff in the Middle East about 7-10 years ago and was devastated when I could not find it here in the states. This stuff smells very fresh and feels great. My new favorite Nivea product.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m a huge Nivea fan.  I use their shave creams in the tube regularly with a brush.  I enjoy their after shave balms, but dislike feeling greasy all day.  In general, I prefer after-shave splashes that contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured this would be a homerun.  It works perfectly like it should to calm and soothe my skin after shaving, HOWEVER, the scent reminds me of something from Gilette or Adidas.  It&#x27;s definitely not up to par for Nivea.  It smells very cheap and artificial.  It&#x27;s the kind of smell that drove me away from modern shaving foams and gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it a four since new AS splashes that contain alcohol are becoming rarer and rarer, plus it works GREAT.</li>
            <li> This is a truly enjoyable aftershave to use. It contains alcohol, but there&#x27;s no burn or sting when I apply it. It&#x27;s got a subtle but pleasant scent — a little more modern than the musky aftershaves of old. The scent fades within minutes. Great aftershave.</li>
            <li> Anything else leaves me greasy with red bumps. After using this for a few months 90% of my redness has disappeared. This is the only aftershave I use currently.</li>
            <li> I give this a three star rating for a few reasons...&lt;br /&gt;1 - I love the smell, I really do.&lt;br /&gt;2 - As an aftershave it&#x27;s really middle of the road. Remember, this is a personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;3 - For my skin it just doesn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;I rampaged my face with a razor, heal me&amp;#34; kind of satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;I like this, I really do, but a three star rating is all it&#x27;s going to get. Three stars is saying... &amp;#34;hey, it&#x27;s good, not great, not wonderful but good, a solid good&amp;#34;. I would not buy this again, but please, give it a try, it might be to more of your liking.&lt;br /&gt;Just an FWIW... I have tried aftershaves from $50 to $3 and I prefer Skin Bracer... not sure why, but my skin likes it.</li>
