    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My hair never looked like the model in the commercials, my skin never looked flawless, etc.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I ended up ditching it and bought LiLash which worked GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>good product but</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Talika and saw the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>While this was good for wearing invisible mascara, I didn&#x27;t get a visible difference with use.</li>
            <li>And when do men (even the ones that love you) ever notice things like this unless there&#x27;s a noticeable change!     </li>
            <li>a time - more like one a day (an improvement!)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I have now been using this product for a month, sans eye make-up of any kind, and have yet to notice any difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have also concluded that Talika is not as effective either.  </li>
            <li>This one worked for us,and we love it,but be pacient,and use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I used this product twice a day for four weeks, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>or perhaps you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe he wasn&#x27;t mezmerized by my lashes....</li>
            <li>Also, as a tip, if you are a savvy shopper you can get either serum on Ebay for a better price.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>the 1st week, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed, but something did seem different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just about to order more talika from talika.com and discard my mavala.  </li>
            <li>Notice how many eyelashes are lost when removing mascara.</li>
            <li>Also, try supplements such as BIOTIN - Great for hair growth (and complexion!)  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be getting more.</li>
            <li>all my gaps were filled in.</li>
            <li>I am actually losing more eyelashes!!</li>
            <li>Use it,and when you notice any small good change,keep using it and enjoy the fact that you do somthing good to your beauty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the try for me!</li>
            <li>so much so that I am going to order more to ensure I never run out.</li>
            <li>True story:</li>
            <li>I have good eyelashes but wanted to see if the hype was true and that these products actually help your eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li>but I now have eyelashes, for the first time in years, after using this product!  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes didn&#x27;t stop falling out completely (although one a day was fine!)</li>
            <li>Talika does make a great little nylon mascara product \\&quot;Lash Extender\\</li>
            <li>It helps a great deal to avoid mascara during the treatment - the weight of the make up can be too heavy for your lashes and weaken them as a result.</li>
            <li>When I did notice the growth and fullness it was kind of sudden.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It arrived pretty quickly, and I started to use the gel-like substance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, when I put it on right before my mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump up.</li>
            <li>When he finished he smiled and said \\&quot;your eyelashes are so long</li>
            <li>I liked the results of using Talika Lipocils Eyelash Conditioning Gel so much I ordered again and would definitely recommend it to anyone with problem eyelashes.</li>
            <li>somhow give you result from first use!!!somthing</li>
            <li>For the first time since they fell I have added mascara to my eyelashes and they are the longest they have ever been.  </li>
            <li>I had read glowing reviews of this product, from various websites &amp; chatrooms, and many mentioned seeing results within a month.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to try after a different product caused most of my eyelashes to fall out.  </li>
            <li>It really worked!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item because some of my lashes had fallen due to my adding warm compresses to my eyes because I had a bump on one of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>You dont check your skin every day to see the result(specially if it is the prodyct you are using for long time,and you are sure about it).So,it is a friendship between you and your skincare,this concept works here.</li>
            <li>I have never had an experience where a product claim actually came true until I tried Lipocils!  </li>
            <li>Just be smart about it though.  </li>
            <li>Though they were longer and thicker, I still needed mascara to reveal my new lush,  yet light colored lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Talika for 3 weeks and the product really does work.</li>
            <li>It really works, no joke.  </li>
            <li>It took a few weeks but it filled them right in!</li>
            <li>&quot; that is better than false eyelashes and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>That product I would HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, on the bright side, my eyebrows do seem thicker and a thin spot seems to be filling in.</li>
            <li>I used Revitalash for a year (a tube lasted that long on just upper lashes) and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>So far, this particular product does not meet expectations.    </li>
            <li>The instructions of this product clearly indicated that this product would work in 28 days.</li>
            <li>After some extensive research on lash-restoring products, I finally decided to try Talika because the price was neither astronomical nor cheap, and because of reviews I had read that I believe now are likely bogus.    </li>
            <li>A small tube with a mascara wand - easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li>In my experience, eyelash tinting or lipocils alone will not lead to a dramatic difference in your eyelashes if they are very light colored.</li>
            <li>However, if you are lucky enough to have dark eyelashes, Talika Lipocils alone will most likely make a dramatic difference in  appearance of your lashes.</li>
            <li>I bought Talika Lipocils in hopes that I had finally found the product that would make my bare lashes look as though I had mascara on.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you have light colored lashes, then the only dramatic differences you&#x27;ll generally see in your eyelashes will appear when you wear mascara.    </li>

            <li> I bought Talika Lipocils in hopes that I had finally found the product that would make my bare lashes look as though I had mascara on.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you have light colored lashes, then the only dramatic differences you&#x27;ll generally see in your eyelashes will appear when you wear mascara.    </li>
            <li> If you have naturally dark, yet short or thin lashes, using Talika without any other products will most likely make your naked lashes look as though they are coated with mascara.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long lashes, but I wanted a product that would make them longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> The only plus I had with this product was that my eyelashes were no longer falling out due to the environmental factors (that&#x27;s why I gave it the 2 stars for the rating).I am now using the Revitalash, and that seems to be working for me.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have become very fragile and thin in the past year and this helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it was stress related or even diet related</li>
            <li> and her other customers complain it makes their lashes grow too long.</li>
            <li> I had long thick eyelashes, even thin spots filled in on lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I added it to my few eyelashes, from the root up and didn&#x27;t notice anything until about a month later.  </li>
            <li> But tinting and \\&quot;lipocil-ing\\&quot;  together make lashes look dark, long, and lustrous.</li>
            <li> However I used this product for 6 weeks (which would roughly be 44 days)morning and night very carefully and diligently...</li>
            <li> Does using this product alone make a dramatic difference in your eyelashes, so much of a difference that it looks as though you are wearing mascara?</li>
            <li> I wear glasses, and the constant rubbing of my lashes against the lenses makes them short and thin.</li>
            <li> So the tube ran dry a few months ago and my budget has changed a lot since then.  </li>
            <li> I brushed the wand against my hand and all I got was the least little bit of moisture.  </li>
            <li> not real sure it did anything....</li>
            <li> I admit I was apprehensive.. as it costs $100 less</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical but after several weeks of using LiLash, all of a sudden</li>
            <li> So perhaps I just have thin eyelashes and that won&#x27;t change but just keep an open mind with this product</li>
            <li> After the eyelash tinting, I realized that my NATURAL lashes almost looked like false ones!     </li>
            <li> All I can say to those that feel it doesn&#x27;t work is that maybe you are not giving it enough time and hoping to see dramatic results in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing because who wants to waste 40 bucks on eyelash gel???   </li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed with my Talika purchase, considering that the point of my buying this product was to make my naked lashes look long, thick, and dark.</li>
            <li> (On a side note, I used this on my eyebrows as well to fill in small gaps from overplucking.</li>
            <li> This past Saturday, I had stepped out of the mall and something (probably dirt from all the construction nearby) blew into my eye.</li>
            <li> However, after using Talika for about 2 months, I think it works just as well, not better, but just as well.  </li>
            <li> I previously had very thick long lashes, and so I became frustrated.</li>
            <li> My little sister asked if I was wearing fake lashes!  </li>
            <li> It took about a month to notice, but now it&#x27;s a dramatic difference to me.</li>
            <li> For the price you&#x27;d be crazy to at least not try!  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> When I put on mascara they look fake</li>
            <li> I obsessed over them, but these serums have changed that.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing because a) the product is somewhat expensive and b)I felt like my eyelashes &amp; brows were a bit</li>
            <li> This stuff is very expensive</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes started to fall out again :(</li>
            <li> focusing on the directions to apply at the base of the eyelids and applying to the eyelashes, and I never saw an improvement in the length or thickness of my lashes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have never had an experience where a product claim actually came true until I tried Lipocils!  My hair never looked like the model in the commercials, my skin never looked flawless, etc. but I now have eyelashes, for the first time in years, after using this product!  It took about a month to notice, but now it&#x27;s a dramatic difference to me.</li>
            <li> After some extensive research on lash-restoring products, I finally decided to try Talika because the price was neither astronomical nor cheap, and because of reviews I had read that I believe now are likely bogus.    After over two months of application, I have seen no change in my eyelash length, whatsoever. Perhaps this conditioner helps to prevent eyelash loss, but it does nothing to enhance growth. I have good eyelashes but wanted to see if the hype was true and that these products actually help your eyelashes grow. So far, this particular product does not meet expectations.    I may try something else.    Talika does make a great little nylon mascara product \\&quot;Lash Extender\\&quot; that is better than false eyelashes and easy to apply. That product I would HIGHLY recommend. This product? Useless.</li>
            <li> I have been usingthe product for about a month, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, when I put it on right before my mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump up.</li>
            <li> somhow give you result from first use!!!somthing different will happen to your lashes from day1(as always my sister Jawaher say&#x27;s),and it is.See,when it coms to eyelashes treatments,consider it as a part of your skincare program.You dont check your skin every day to see the result(specially if it is the prodyct you are using for long time,and you are sure about it).So,it is a friendship between you and your skincare,this concept works here.Use it,and when you notice any small good change,keep using it and enjoy the fact that you do somthing good to your beauty.This one worked for us,and we love it,but be pacient,and use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because some of my lashes had fallen due to my adding warm compresses to my eyes because I had a bump on one of my eyes.  Anyhow, as they had fallen in sporadic clumps, I started looking on the internet for something to help them grow and thus found Talika Lipocils.  I added it to my few eyelashes, from the root up and didn&#x27;t notice anything until about a month later.  When I did notice the growth and fullness it was kind of sudden.  I was thrilled.  For the first time since they fell I have added mascara to my eyelashes and they are the longest they have ever been.  All I can say to those that feel it doesn&#x27;t work is that maybe you are not giving it enough time and hoping to see dramatic results in just a few weeks.  Please give it time, it does work... so much so that I am going to order more to ensure I never run out.</li>
            <li> I have seen lot of growth in my eyelashes.  Love this product, I havent seen any growth in my eyebrows with their eyebrow product though.  I am waiting patiently..</li>
            <li> I bought Talika Lipocils in hopes that I had finally found the product that would make my bare lashes look as though I had mascara on. I found the following:    Do Talika Lipocils lenghten eyelashes? Yes. Do they thicken eyelashes? Yes. Does using this product alone make a dramatic difference in your eyelashes, so much of a difference that it looks as though you are wearing mascara? It depends.    If you have naturally dark, yet short or thin lashes, using Talika without any other products will most likely make your naked lashes look as though they are coated with mascara. HOWEVER, if you have light colored lashes, then the only dramatic differences you&#x27;ll generally see in your eyelashes will appear when you wear mascara.    I was initially disappointed with my Talika purchase, considering that the point of my buying this product was to make my naked lashes look long, thick, and dark. Though they were longer and thicker, I still needed mascara to reveal my new lush,  yet light colored lashes.  I was about to return my lipocil after four weeks of use, until I visited a specialist who tinted my eyelashes.     After the eyelash tinting, I realized that my NATURAL lashes almost looked like false ones!     In my experience, eyelash tinting or lipocils alone will not lead to a dramatic difference in your eyelashes if they are very light colored. But tinting and \\&quot;lipocil-ing\\&quot;  together make lashes look dark, long, and lustrous. However, if you are lucky enough to have dark eyelashes, Talika Lipocils alone will most likely make a dramatic difference in  appearance of your lashes.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day for four weeks, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results. As promised, Talika has made my lashes thicker, longer and fuller. I wear glasses, and the constant rubbing of my lashes against the lenses makes them short and thin. This product is amazing and I&#x27;m very happy I ordered it. (On a side note, I used this on my eyebrows as well to fill in small gaps from overplucking. It took a few weeks but it filled them right in! Great stuff and I highly recommend it.)</li>
            <li> I went online to see if I could find a product to enhance my eyelashes. However I did some searches and came up with the Talika Lipocils. The instructions of this product clearly indicated that this product would work in 28 days. However I used this product for 6 weeks (which would roughly be 44 days)morning and night very carefully and diligently... focusing on the directions to apply at the base of the eyelids and applying to the eyelashes, and I never saw an improvement in the length or thickness of my lashes. The only plus I had with this product was that my eyelashes were no longer falling out due to the environmental factors (that&#x27;s why I gave it the 2 stars for the rating).I am now using the Revitalash, and that seems to be working for me. I would say that everyone is different, so maybe if it didn&#x27;t work for me, it may work for someone else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> good product but not real sure it did anything....guess i was looking for a miracle</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it didn&#x27;t seem like there was anything in the bottle.  I brushed the wand against my hand and all I got was the least little bit of moisture.  I tried and tried to get some on my eyelashes but nothing worked.  All it did was make my eyes water...it goes back today. Hopefully I can get my money back and use Double Lash that worked for me.</li>
            <li> I had read glowing reviews of this product, from various websites &amp; chatrooms, and many mentioned seeing results within a month. I have now been using this product for a month, sans eye make-up of any kind, and have yet to notice any difference in my eyelashes. Disappointing because a) the product is somewhat expensive and b)I felt like my eyelashes &amp; brows were a bit thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on the bright side, my eyebrows do seem thicker and a thin spot seems to be filling in. So perhaps I just have thin eyelashes and that won&#x27;t change but just keep an open mind with this product or perhaps you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very expensive and I&#x27;ve diligently used it as the directions state. I havent seen growth. I am actually losing more eyelashes!! I was going to buy the mascara if I grew the eyelashes but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. *sigh*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Talika for 3 weeks and the product really does work. I have fairly long lashes, but I wanted a product that would make them longer and fuller. Talika gave me both. I was very skeptical about purchasing because who wants to waste 40 bucks on eyelash gel???   What Talika has done for me:   1. My lashes are longer   2. They are fuller (all the lashes seem to be the same length)   3. When I put on mascara they look fake (I only need one coat)       True story: This past Saturday, I had stepped out of the mall and something (probably dirt from all the construction nearby) blew into my eye. My fiance starting blowing in it to help me get it out. When he finished he smiled and said \\&quot;your eyelashes are so long and you&#x27;re so beautiful\\&quot;. Then he kissed me. Okay, maybe he wasn&#x27;t mezmerized by my lashes....but he did notice. And when do men (even the ones that love you) ever notice things like this unless there&#x27;s a noticeable change!     I will continue to purchase and apply once daily for maintenance as suggested.     You wont regret it ladies!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes didn&#x27;t grow. Now I&#x27;m trying Mary Kay&#x27;s Lash Lengthening mascara, my MK rep (and a trusted friend) say it has vitamin B12 in it and her other customers complain it makes their lashes grow too long. It&#x27;s worth the try for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try after a different product caused most of my eyelashes to fall out.  This eyelash conditioning gel has worked miracles on my eyelashes.  They have finally grown back and are thicker and longer than before.  I liked the results of using Talika Lipocils Eyelash Conditioning Gel so much I ordered again and would definitely recommend it to anyone with problem eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I used Revitalash for a year (a tube lasted that long on just upper lashes) and fell in love.  It really worked!  So the tube ran dry a few months ago and my budget has changed a lot since then.  I got on Amazon to see if there were any alternatives to Revitalash, as I paid $130 for it.  I stumbled upon Talika and saw the good reviews.  I admit I was apprehensive.. as it costs $100 less and I believe you get what you pay for often.  However, after using Talika for about 2 months, I think it works just as well, not better, but just as well.  I like Lipocils because it goes on with a wand like mascara instead of with a tiny brush along the lash line.  My little sister asked if I was wearing fake lashes!  Both products I tried do take patience.  One day, after a while, you just notice the change.  I have to say, even if I had the money to buy the more expensive revitalash, I would still purchase the Lipocils instead.  It really works, no joke.  My lashes were so short and sparce I obsessed over them, but these serums have changed that.  For the price you&#x27;d be crazy to at least not try!  Also, as a tip, if you are a savvy shopper you can get either serum on Ebay for a better price.  Just be smart about it though.  Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!! okay, so I figured out a catch!  Talika lasts 2 months, Revitalash lasts a year.  I have also concluded that Talika is not as effective either.  So with the math and the results as a factor, I am going back to Revitalash.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes suddenly started to fall out. I&#x27;m not sure whether it was stress related or even diet related but they fell out 3 or four at a time. I was loosing up to 7 eyelashes a day! I previously had very thick long lashes, and so I became frustrated. Anyhow, I decided to try Talika after numerous searches for an eyelash product online.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It arrived pretty quickly, and I started to use the gel-like substance. A small tube with a mascara wand - easy enough to apply. I didn&#x27;t only brush my eyelashes with the gel, but I used the tip of the wand to &#x27;line&#x27; my lower and upper lash line so the roots of my lashes were coated. I did this morning and evening, religiously!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During the 1st week, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed, but something did seem different. I noticed my eyelashes weren&#x27;t falling out 7 at a time - more like one a day (an improvement!) and also my lash line seemed to be filling in. I continued using the gel morning and evening and within the second week I could definitely see an improvement! I was thrilled! My eyelashes didn&#x27;t stop falling out completely (although one a day was fine!) however, my eyelashes (especially the lashes in the centre) were longer! My lash line did become thicker and by the time I&#x27;d finished using the tube all my gaps were filled in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I then decided to switch to Mavala (because everyone gave it 5 stars) and my eyelashes started to fall out again :( I think some things work for some people and not for others - stick with what you know. I&#x27;m just about to order more talika from talika.com and discard my mavala.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It just takes a lot of patience and time -  &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped everyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;p.s &gt; It helps a great deal to avoid mascara during the treatment - the weight of the make up can be too heavy for your lashes and weaken them as a result. Notice how many eyelashes are lost when removing mascara. Also, try supplements such as BIOTIN - Great for hair growth (and complexion!)  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. My eyelashes have become very fragile and thin in the past year and this helped tremendously. It also helps my eyelashes stay put when I remove my makeup. There is definitely and improvement in thickness and strength.</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything for my lashes - I used it faithfully for months.  It conditioned my lashes - softer, but no growth.  I ended up ditching it and bought LiLash which worked GREAT!  I was really skeptical but after several weeks of using LiLash, all of a sudden I had long thick eyelashes, even thin spots filled in on lower eyelid.  I no longer had to wear mascara and if I did wear it, only one coat.  LiLash is much more expensive, but &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27;. They have a 90-day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> While this was good for wearing invisible mascara, I didn&#x27;t get a visible difference with use. Maybe you need to use it for longer but I won&#x27;t be getting more.</li>
