            <li>If something is good and works, why do they change it?</li>
            <li>This did more harm than good!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>love the product!</li>
            <li>So much better than waxing or tweezing!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!!!!</li>
            <li>this would probably work best on fine to medium hair, not the best for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>This works amazing.</li>
            <li>Which is amazing for my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>I even placed a warm rag on my chin to soften the hairs and it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>and I actually kind of like the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Remember to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>Honestly if you don&#x27;t mind applying I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I liked this product</li>
            <li>I will gladly tell others about how good it works.</li>
            <li>The soothing aloe finishing cream is a nice touch,</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think this product should be removed from the shelves.</li>
            <li>so my face it always nice and hair free,will buy again and again.</li>
            <li>the after creme really soothes your skin and smells great!</li>
            <li>Removed with warm terry style wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>If you buy it, you will be buying much more often that you would have when the product was good....</li>
            <li>With the price, I highly believe that this is one of the best Hair remover in the market.</li>
            <li>Unless you are a man with a full beard this stuff works just great.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product many times and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can find better ones out there!</li>
            <li>more painful/expensive lip waxing for me! :)</li>
            <li>the bleach stuff smells really strong and burns!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product it worked great.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use - leave on for 5 minutes and rinse off and comes with a great soothing moisturising cream.  </li>
            <li>This might work on fine hair, say on cheeks, but I have two stubborn coarser hairs on my chin, and it didn&#x27;t work at all, at all!</li>
            <li>I have very light skin</li>
            <li>So many horror stories of chemical burns with depilatories and that was no region I wanted to risk.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>so much better than waxing..</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions, making sure not to rub it in.</li>
            <li>I tried this for two more times after a couple of days, but still, nothing happened.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have read more into the description.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>i love that it works &amp; doesn&#x27;t have that foul hair remover smell.</li>
            <li>I was a faithful consumer of this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>NOT SO any more.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it was an okay product</li>
            <li>I love this product, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any discoloration or any of that.</li>
            <li>more</li>
            <li>Although I will say I like using this slightly better since it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I ordered some more and tried again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>I followed the simple instructions and it worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>so when my &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; gets unruly, I whip out this magic trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, it removes the hair-</li>
            <li>This is the best product on the market for removing facial hair that I have use.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use the conditioner, i think that is what helped.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it lasts for ever!</li>
            <li>OK so I tried it on.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>When I removed it, most of, but not all, the hair came off, but I had this numb-but-burning sensation all along the sides of my mouth where I had applied the creme.</li>
            <li>but it mostly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Cream Hair Remover works better than any others used before.  </li>
            <li>That hurts more than waxing, and if you can&#x27;t do it yourself, it is much more costly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it was much more inexpensive than some products I considered, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Love this product; I use it to exfoliate my lower face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Much better price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now tried it twice, this time leaving the creme on a bit longer in hope of better results.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask.</li>
            <li>This worked much better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>So I finally went with this and followed the directions as thorougly as i could and the end results were GREAT!</li>
            <li>In fact, removing the fuzz just made the thicker hairs stand out even more.</li>
            <li>but this has lessened the more I use it.</li>
            <li>i love it gets the job</li>
            <li>none i don&#x27;t have to be pulling hair from my chin every day any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>many chemical burns,laser treatments and waxing</li>
            <li>I roll my eyes and tell her to buy wax strips, they&#x27;re better and faster.</li>
            <li>No pain, all reward :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I use to love it.</li>
            <li>, I dont recomend this product the better way is do wax</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am SO GLAD I did this.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t stop touching the area, because it is so smooth!</li>
            <li>and definitely bide by the directions, keep it at or under 8 minutes, and it should work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It works great and is super effective and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s willing to make sure they&#x27;re washing it off within 8 minutes of putting it on.</li>
            <li>THE MOST POPULAR FAVORABLE REVIEW SAYS TO LEAVE IT ON THE FULL 8 MINS.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, Sally Hansen hair removal cream did the job better than I even hoped, considering I tasked it with removing some thicker hair and gave my skin a pretty good scrubbing in the process.</li>
            <li>I let the cream sit for the full 8 minutes; I then wiped off the creme with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Great hair removal for even sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>AND MOST IMPORTANTLY READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it was.</li>
            <li>, however, it is more effective when you first purchase it.</li>
            <li>Other then that everything went great, and I will be using the product again!</li>
            <li>This product even though I paid a little more then this a wholile ago it seems to be the best for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about finding what works best with your hair though, sometimes I need it on longer than other times.</li>
            <li>/burn very very mildly, but nothing like the Nair.</li>
            <li>It works very quickly.</li>
            <li>but this one is way better specially for the price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had good luck with even a pad I would normally use to remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That was exactly the kind of results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This product works, it is effective, and very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Tthis product does remove hair, and at first I was really impressed with the product when I tried it last week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for two years now and it was working just fine.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how pleasant the creme hair remover smelled.</li>
            <li>product does work for light to fine hair if you have thicker hair then try Nair or Nads.</li>
            <li>There was a tiny bit of irritation, but nothing unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the product and it definitey beats waxing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product on four separate occasions to ensure an accurate result and review.</li>
            <li>have found that instead of using that crappy lotion it comes with (which I throw away) using an acne lotion afterwards feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>could qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Hair free lip.</li>
            <li>Works great, fast, and has amazing results in only 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>LEAVES THE FACE SMOOTH AND WITHOUT DISCOLORATION.</li>
            <li>THE MOISTURIZER IS SOOTHING AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Great upper lip hair removal creme!</li>
            <li>Used it on my friend with sensitive skin loved the results.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this hair removal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the cheapest and best product for facial hair removal thanks to amazon.</li>
            <li>Heyyyy this stuff really works!!!  </li>
            <li>Run away fast!!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick and easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>This has been a very consistent hair remover product with little to no ingredient changes, so it&#x27;s been great always having this as a go-to product!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I love it the first time I used it I was just trying it out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  definitely getting loads more of these for sure!</li>
            <li>it took me to clean it up off of the part I wanted hair to stay on.</li>
            <li>Even if you are not a sensitive skin, you still cannot keep them on your skin more than 8 minutes!!</li>
            <li>If you are preparing for a special occation, use it about 3 days before.</li>
            <li>it makes your hairs pretty much just fall out on their own and</li>
            <li>I just made sure not to rub it or touch it to much.</li>
            <li>I would leave it on (my upper lip) for 4 minutes and it removed all the hair; then I&#x27;d use the crème to soothe it and all was good.  </li>
            <li>I applied a generous amount and waited the full eight minutes before wiping any off.</li>
            <li>Good product, actually purchased it because I had already tried it from my sister.  </li>
            <li>cool</li>
            <li>Not bad, gets hair off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad by anyways just shaving is quicker and cheaper.</li>
            <li>The stuff does nothing after 8 minutes except irritate my skin and honestly seems to get less effective every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions and left it on for eight minutes--it removed very very fine light hairs that would have been fine on my face anyway--but did not remove the darker hairs.  </li>
            <li>(I have pretty fine hair).</li>
            <li>They said to wash it with mild soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product back in April to get rid of the hair above my lip and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>I went ahead quickly removed it with a textured washcloth and</li>
            <li>The stuff has a really strong chemical smell which I&#x27;m sure can&#x27;t mean good things, but it is cheap and does it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li>And yeah, it doesn&#x27;t really smell all that great, but it does smell better than a lot of the other, less effective products out there!</li>
            <li>FIrst of all I should say that I very rarely review products, unless they impress me.</li>
            <li>Do not leave it on for more than 4 minutes when the product is new.</li>
            <li>While I waited I experienced no burning or irritation, I did experience a warming sensation on my upper lip which I guessed was just a normal reaction.</li>
            <li>because i still think its an excellent product, i tried this as a teenager for fine face hairs and 15 years later i still havent tried any other products because this one works!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love this the first time I used it, but after the second and third use, it&#x27;s become more effective.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this product would leave me feeling smooth for weeks.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my upper lip hair, and read the panflet carefully, and did everything they say you should do to get excellent results.... even leaving the produtc for no longer than 8 minutes(ZZZZzzzz) and....</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it was inexpensive, so worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I was really scared and apprehensive because I read so many mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I did it.</li>
            <li>I now have a nice scar on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to not rub it in like you would lotion, but gently place it on the skin with a decent amount of cream.</li>
            <li>On top of that they didn&#x27;t refund my money and it was right before first day at a new school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products for facial hair removal and this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried other facial hair removers, but this works the best.</li>
            <li>The new smell is much more pleasant than previous versions!</li>
            <li>And if it starts to sting, please wash it off right away.  </li>
            <li>So I went a minute longer and that was the right time for me.  </li>
            <li>So, if your goal is to burn the skin right off of your face then, yes, this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for what I call excessive peach fuzz, works great.  </li>
            <li>After my first two attempts, I followed the guided steps in one of the reviewers post about waiting the full 8 mins and adding a bit more cream with the same ending result.</li>
            <li>I then applied a little more of the conditioner and was able to leave the house with a</li>
            <li>but I find it very noticeable quickly.</li>
            <li>I left this on for 5 min, wiped it off and my face is smooth and hair free.  </li>
            <li>This product works the best for my facial hair, for some reason other products aren&#x27;t strong enough to remove all the hair, but this one is.</li>
            <li>Again, this is the only facial hair removal cream that works effectively on me, just be sure to really watch how your skin reacts when using this product.</li>
            <li>Get a wash cloth wet it with warm water and remove hair one area at a time but rinsing the cloth with very warm water inbetween small areas.</li>
            <li>after washing my hands 18848 times the only saving grace was the lotion which smelt delightful like lavender which I slathered all over my raw hands.</li>
            <li>Good quality smells a little offensive but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>those who are complaining about chemical burns, you probably should have done a test strip first.</li>
            <li>I tried the Sally Hansen Creme Hair Remover for the first time tonight.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I will make a broader patch to catch those areas better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my upper lip and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It smells funny</li>
            <li>but hey, you&#x27;ll have funny smells when there is a chemical on your face.</li>
            <li>REMEMBER TO TEST FIRST</li>
            <li>did the test first</li>
            <li>With only one application I was able to get rid of /all/ hair in question.</li>
            <li>Now this was MY FIRST time using a creme hair removal</li>
            <li>I am glad I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested on trying it...</li>
            <li>First let me start off by saying that I bought this at the store.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to use the cream twice for 7-8 min each time, but now I can only do 4 min twice</li>
            <li>I also apply a pretty generous layer.</li>
            <li>It seems to grow back stronger with more numbers, so I think I&#x27;ll try waxing before I end up looking like the wife of Sasquatch.</li>
            <li>I loved this product the first few times I used it...</li>
            <li>I first noticed the hair along my jawline was growing thicker and longer, I tried waxing.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love this product!</li>
            <li>I have very blonde hairs on the top parts of my eyebrows and in between.</li>
            <li>It also does not burn like most facial hair removal creams have done for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this, and will definitely buy it again when I run out!</li>
            <li>The first time I was nervous</li>
            <li>The hairs didn&#x27;t grow back like before, but my face is even more oily and makeup won&#x27;t stay on my face.</li>
            <li>When I first used it on my chin</li>
            <li>For the price and the ease of buying it at your local Walmart this is one of the better products there.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s evident to say I will not be purchasing or even reusing it.</li>
            <li>This left me hairless and very smooth, and I liked the after-lotion which soothed my skin and left me feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t use this right before you need to be absolutely presentable -</li>
            <li>I bought this product at my local grocery store and was super excited about being able to remove the hair on my upper lip at home!</li>
            <li>and it left my face bright red</li>
            <li>It is very efficient, it removes the hair very well and does leaves a fresh feeling afer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of annoyed that I&#x27;m now more scruffy after trying this product.</li>
            <li>I loved waxing the best but after a terrifying almost scarring event I&#x27;ll never chance it again.</li>
            <li>tomorrow morning cause there is a little bit of hairs that were missed on the sides of my mouth but other than that I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time yesterday on my chin (after doing the patch test and waiting 24 hours) and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past with good results.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and continued to wait the full 8 minutes, and there was maybe 1-2 hairs if any that were gone after wiping the cream off.</li>
            <li>Not painful, not a terrible smell, and I usually use this right before a shower.</li>
            <li>I can leave it on now for 12 minutes (with little irritation) and most of the hair is still there!  </li>
            <li>Despite my facial hair being dark and stubborn,this product worked great an removed it as desired.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to use, but it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I think a certain ingredient in there gave me an allergic reaction</li>
            <li>hair in the sunlight or in certain angles.</li>
            <li>I only left it on for about 5 minutes and most of the hair came off!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too worried about it spreading while I cleaned it up because if it took eight whole minutes for it to get rid of my hair, no damage would be done in the thirty seconds</li>
            <li>so, I conclude with this review, that this stuff worked really rather well</li>
            <li>I followed the directions very closely and tested a patch before using it on my face.  </li>
            <li>I had literally 3 or 4 stray hairs on the very edges that didn&#x27;t remove.  </li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>you apply the extra smooth cream.</li>
            <li>I really recommend the product.</li>
            <li>If you just wipe it off gently, the hair probably will not come off.  </li>
            <li>Sure you get a softer touch but your re applying cream in 4-5 days roughly.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be too much for Sally Hansen to handle.  </li>
            <li>and now I will never have to worry about how much my mustache is glistening in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Haha.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>No, worse.</li>
            <li>I could not keep this product on the whole time it said to.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a real bummer.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll give it two stars, just because--at first--it worked really well.</li>
            <li>At $5, I didn&#x27;t really expect this cream to work.</li>
            <li>It does really remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>Waxing works well (and really doesn&#x27;t hurt that much), but you need to let the hair grow out to a 1/4 of inch.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work.  </li>
            <li>This is really gentle on your face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>After much consideration, I decided to take a chance and buy a hair removal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really only had light peach fuzz to begin with, so</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>It literally burned the skin off of my face and did absolutely NOTHING to remove hair.</li>
            <li>but now it burns the center of my top lip and still leaves hair.</li>
            <li>GENTLY DISOLVES THE HAIR WITHOUT ANY BURNING OR IRRITATION.</li>
            <li>Absolutely would recommend.</li>
            <li>It really works believe me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li>I have to use quite allot more than I expected</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it worked REALLY FAST.  </li>
            <li>gave this product 5 stars because it did remove all my hair so fast.  </li>
            <li>have Irish skin, sensitive to most chemicals...</li>
            <li>Next, I&#x27;d probably go something more natural or organic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a chemical smell it smells like 9 week old boiled eggs!!!</li>
            <li>You can rinse with plain warm water which means DO NOT USE SOAP.</li>
            <li>You could barely see the hairs unless looking super closely, but they were there</li>
            <li>It is low odor, very easy to use, and does not leave my face red.</li>
            <li>It does successfully remove the facial hair, but it doesn&#x27;t get the roots and makes the hairs grow back larger and thicker.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, I had a red, embarrassing upper lip for 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since a conditioning creme is given for use after the remover (smells like lovely roses,)</li>
            <li>When I went to wipe it off, I had the most extreme burning pain.</li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail today and of course being excited to use it I ripped it open and used it as soon as I brought it inside.</li>
            <li>Have tried other products, Surgicare for one, and this seems to work better and faster.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The after lotion smelt relatively nice, and seemed to calm the tight feel a bit, but probably isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li>the test is to see how long I remain hair free.</li>
            <li>following the directions explicitly and leaving it on for the full 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin, so I did the test strip on my arm first, had no reaction, and I&#x27;ve continued to use it</li>
            <li>I would say more than half a bottle still remains.</li>
            <li>The downside to it being so potent is that it also tends to leave my upper lip very red sometimes</li>
            <li>but it is more likely that I&#x27;m not cleaning my face well enough.</li>
            <li>I used it above my upper lip and even though the directions recommend against it I used it over top of my eyebrows and under them.</li>
            <li>Works like magic and takes a short period of time only.  </li>
            <li>Now it has a highly perfumed smell.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it for those suffering with this issue who don&#x27;t want to shave or suffer through laser for a condition that you will eventually age out of.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended to all who use this type of product.</li>
            <li>okay, for whatever reason, but the area above my upper lip was much too sensitive for these chemicals.  </li>
            <li>For only $5, I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, there was no reaction, everything seemed to be going as normal -</li>
            <li>I thought this was normal</li>
            <li>I normally just ignore that sensation.</li>
            <li>But at such a reasonable price, I was willing to try it on my daughter&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>Ten minutes on, then wipe off with soft warm wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, if you&#x27;re not sure if you should get it or not GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li>On my upper lip I have to leave this on a little longer than it says for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>then applied it to the first target area on my face and let it set the full eight minutes using a soft washcloth to massage the cream gently in the direction of my hair growth being a little surprised even the fairly coarse hairs began to vanish right in front of me.</li>
            <li>I am now looking for a new product.</li>
            <li>so when I tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s Creme Hair Remover and it worked, I adopted this product and can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I am very surprised my skin wasn&#x27;t irritated by this.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin when it comes to hair remover.</li>
            <li>The only time I&#x27;ve felt like it wasn&#x27;t good enough was when I was rushed and didn&#x27;t leave it long enough.  </li>
            <li>not saying that this will happen to everyone, since everyone has different skin, and I bet it works fine for some people, but beware of the aftercare lotion, especially those of you who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I will do the exact same procedure.</li>
            <li>the tube is pretty big</li>
            <li>first thing I did was a patch test on my inner elbow like the instructions stated, waited 8 minutes and wiped it off-</li>
            <li>at first i left it on like the instruction</li>
            <li>I mention that because Im aware that some hair remover products dont work well on coarse hair; this cream MAY be one of those products, but the instruction pamphlet didn&#x27;t mention whether or not the coarseness of your hair mattered.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer the wax strips by sally hansen, but this was better.</li>
            <li>Very smelly and barely removes any hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend following the instructions exactly to prevent any adverse effects.</li>
            <li>Not very strong and certainly not as annoying as the Sally Hansen cream bleach products.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sensitive skin but left on 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This removes pretty much all the hair - there might be one or two little ones left over, but that&#x27;s easy enough to pluck.</li>
            <li>Its not exactly what I wanted but its not bad.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, so much so that I can&#x27;t even get my eyebrows waxed because I break out in red bumps for days.  </li>
            <li>Like any skin topical, it&#x27;s always smart to do a test spot before lathering it on.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise the &amp;#34;brush-on&amp;#34; version and stay clear from this product.</li>
            <li>dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother doing the test section, and went straight to my upper lip and applied it.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin including acne and eczema.</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and realized I had one around 16.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been sensitive after the application, specifically after washing it off.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove any hair at all, as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to remove facial hair, maybe lazering it off is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>So far anyhow.</li>
            <li>It says it suppose to keep that area smooth for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it works as well because it doesn&#x27;t really remove coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing to wow about just another hair remover product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the peach fuzz that has been on the sides of my mouth, carefully following the directions and and testing the area on my arm a whole day before.</li>
            <li>But I can no longer use this product because it&#x27;s not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for people who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>I was surprised this works.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all.</li>
            <li>I have a professional job, and going to work in that state was quite embarrassing for me.  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t leave it on too long, but it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>This was a few weeks ago and my face is still hair free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend rubbing at your face if you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li>However, when I applied the aftercare lotion, my face started stinging, even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is thinner and doesn&#x27;t remove hair nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So sensitive that I can&#x27;t get my eyebrows waxed and even if my face is itchy</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it did not make me break out with a rash or acne.</li>
            <li>Saves me from having to go back to the dermatologist for facial hair laser which, after over a year&#x27;s worth of scheduled laser, still yields growth anyway.  </li>
            <li>The product took most of the hair off of my upper lip, leaving a few matted hairs that I then plucked.</li>
            <li>I left that one on for a few more minutes before wiping it off.  </li>
            <li>After all these years, it did have kind of an egg smell, no, not great</li>
            <li>and then I started to take it off because I wanted time to move slowly and didnt want some of my skin to still be covered in it for more than 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>I think this a fine package deal too, cheaper than other options, and I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it as needed.</li>
            <li>Then, I put the lotion they give you on top and although my upper lip felt tight I had no other issues.</li>
            <li>so I left some hairs still on my face the second time it worked beautifully it did leave every other small hair</li>
            <li>No burn, and no little hairs that glisten in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>I see some stray hairs every now and then, but they&#x27;re so brittle that I can actually pull them out easily with my fingers or sometimes with a slight tug of tweezers.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, both areas where I applied it were smooth while the process left only very minor</li>
            <li>I had a small amount of redness right away that I am certain</li>
            <li>This used to be a good product, not sure what was changed with it,  but definitely  a waste of money</li>
            <li>Most face skin is very sensitive and needs to be \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I normally have a couple of white heads pop up a couple days after</li>
            <li>I gently rinsed with cool water, let it air dry and put the little moisturizer creme on that came with the package.</li>
            <li>few hours later, though, I touched my face to feel how smooth my newly hairless face was, but it was actually prickly!</li>
            <li>After the 6-8 minutes, I removed removal creme and my upper lip was clean, less irritated, and soothed.  </li>
            <li>It did not remove any hair from my lip or chin and it left my chin very sore and red.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the directions exactly, and perhaps do a small test spot on your face before doing your whole face you should avoid any of the horror stories of people who burn themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No pain or burning, I have a very sensitive skin and it worked for my upper lips.</li>
            <li>As someone with mild asthema i try to avoid perfumes so its more unpleasant to wear</li>
            <li>hair along my jawline was fairly thick, but the hair itself is fine and blond.  </li>
            <li>I have quite a thick layer of fine, clearish &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; all over my lower face and along my hairline, jawline, and upper lip  and have sensitive</li>
            <li>I want so badly to feel beautiful with a lady stache, but I just can&#x27;t and finally getting rid of it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps me clear, especially in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not burn or barely smell.</li>
            <li>Then I took a wet wash cloth and scrubbed the hair off gently.</li>
            <li>and I have yet to go blindfrom the eyebrow-removal sesh, and the burning on my upper lip from the after-remover is nearly completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and barely takes hair off that it used to take off.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would say i am on the sensitive skin side, ive used sally Hansen facial hair remover before and it burned my skin!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wax facial hair because my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li>the results last a while so far its just been a couple of days like 3 or so</li>
            <li>No hair came off with the wet cotton ball, so I washed it off gently, re-applied and waited closer to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t grown back for weeks and my skin was soft.</li>
            <li>I am back to getting it waxed professionally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After all the cream was off my face (the second time I completely ignored that wretched after-remover stuff), I splashed fairly cool water on my face for a few moments to get rid of the tingling and any extra cream that may have resided in my eyebrows that I hadn&#x27;t noticed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly I am 57 and have used many different products and gagets to remove the thick corse hair on my chine and neck area.</li>
            <li>The product did not smell like vanilla, but it was less strong than other depilatory</li>
            <li>I used to love this product, used it for several years, but now its tooootally burning my skin and hardly taking off my hair!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth slightly tingling even after 30 minutes, but no real pain .</li>
            <li>Like, it&#x27;s mostly better now (just a little spot of red right under the area in between my nostrils), and I definitely didn&#x27;t get anything serious like a chemical burn, but it did hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I left the cream on for a bit longer than the recommended 8 minutes on one side of my upper lip - the skin dried out a bit the next day but everywhere else was fine.</li>
            <li>I can live with the smell as long as I am getting rid of the hair without any pain.</li>
            <li>I waited just a few hours because I knew my skin would react right away if I were having an allergy to it.</li>
            <li>It made it slightly easier to pluck, but the whole point of this product is to remove all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably give it a few more tries before I give up on it entirely.</li>
            <li>I used a wash cloth with warm water and pushed down hard to wipe the creme off, in the opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li>it cleared it up and left no dark spots..</li>
            <li>a few weeks later I used it again, this time I left it on for the full recommended time.</li>
            <li>The stuff worked fairly well on my eyebrows (there is a small spot that I suppose I didn&#x27;t put the cream on thick enough or</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, but it isn&#x27;t super tough either, so I was surprised I could wait the maximum amount of time.</li>
            <li>I will trust a professional from now on--more expensive but a better outcome.</li>
            <li>It is mostly just blonde hair on my upper lip with a few dark hairs...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this removes maybe 50% of my facial hairs - it&#x27;s better on thinner hair above my lip, but worse on mid-range hairs between my eyebrows and on/under my jawline, and barely removed any hairs from my mole at all.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive don&#x27;t leave it on to long.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;d advise anyone to give it a chance if it doesn&#x27;t work the first time, especially considering the relatively low price compared to other similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time my new tube is not working as expected.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t pleasantly fragrant, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li>So far unbelievably this has not broken me out once</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product to those who are struggling with upper lip hair or other facial hair issues especially if you do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t let it dry on your face so use enough to cover hair completely.</li>

            <li> Good product does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> She said it felt good on her face</li>
            <li> If something is good and works, why do they change it?</li>
            <li> This did more harm than good!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> love the product!</li>
            <li> So much better than waxing or tweezing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!!!!!</li>
            <li> this would probably work best on fine to medium hair, not the best for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This works amazing.</li>
            <li> Which is amazing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I even placed a warm rag on my chin to soften the hairs and it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> and I actually kind of like the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Remember to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> Honestly if you don&#x27;t mind applying I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this product</li>
            <li> I will gladly tell others about how good it works.</li>
            <li> The soothing aloe finishing cream is a nice touch,</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think this product should be removed from the shelves.</li>
            <li> so my face it always nice and hair free,will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> the after creme really soothes your skin and smells great!</li>
            <li> Removed with warm terry style wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> If you buy it, you will be buying much more often that you would have when the product was good....</li>
            <li> With the price, I highly believe that this is one of the best Hair remover in the market.</li>
            <li> Unless you are a man with a full beard this stuff works just great.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can find better ones out there!</li>
            <li> more painful/expensive lip waxing for me! :)</li>
            <li> the bleach stuff smells really strong and burns!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it worked great.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use - leave on for 5 minutes and rinse off and comes with a great soothing moisturising cream.  </li>
            <li> This might work on fine hair, say on cheeks, but I have two stubborn coarser hairs on my chin, and it didn&#x27;t work at all, at all!</li>
            <li> I have very light skin</li>
            <li> So many horror stories of chemical burns with depilatories and that was no region I wanted to risk.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> so much better than waxing..</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, making sure not to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I tried this for two more times after a couple of days, but still, nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have read more into the description.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> i love that it works &amp; doesn&#x27;t have that foul hair remover smell.</li>
            <li> I was a faithful consumer of this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> NOT SO any more.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it was an okay product</li>
            <li> I love this product, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any discoloration or any of that.</li>
            <li> more</li>
            <li> Although I will say I like using this slightly better since it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I ordered some more and tried again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li> I followed the simple instructions and it worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> so when my &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; gets unruly, I whip out this magic trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, it removes the hair-</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for removing facial hair that I have use.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use the conditioner, i think that is what helped.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it lasts for ever!</li>
            <li> OK so I tried it on.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> When I removed it, most of, but not all, the hair came off, but I had this numb-but-burning sensation all along the sides of my mouth where I had applied the creme.</li>
            <li> but it mostly gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Cream Hair Remover works better than any others used before.  </li>
            <li> That hurts more than waxing, and if you can&#x27;t do it yourself, it is much more costly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it was much more inexpensive than some products I considered, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Love this product; I use it to exfoliate my lower face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Much better price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried it twice, this time leaving the creme on a bit longer in hope of better results.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask.</li>
            <li> This worked much better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> So I finally went with this and followed the directions as thorougly as i could and the end results were GREAT!</li>
            <li> In fact, removing the fuzz just made the thicker hairs stand out even more.</li>
            <li> but this has lessened the more I use it.</li>
            <li> i love it gets the job</li>
            <li> none i don&#x27;t have to be pulling hair from my chin every day any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> many chemical burns,laser treatments and waxing</li>
            <li> I roll my eyes and tell her to buy wax strips, they&#x27;re better and faster.</li>
            <li> No pain, all reward :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I use to love it.</li>
            <li> , I dont recomend this product the better way is do wax</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am SO GLAD I did this.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t stop touching the area, because it is so smooth!</li>
            <li> and definitely bide by the directions, keep it at or under 8 minutes, and it should work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> It works great and is super effective and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s willing to make sure they&#x27;re washing it off within 8 minutes of putting it on.</li>
            <li> THE MOST POPULAR FAVORABLE REVIEW SAYS TO LEAVE IT ON THE FULL 8 MINS.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, Sally Hansen hair removal cream did the job better than I even hoped, considering I tasked it with removing some thicker hair and gave my skin a pretty good scrubbing in the process.</li>
            <li> I let the cream sit for the full 8 minutes; I then wiped off the creme with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Great hair removal for even sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> AND MOST IMPORTANTLY READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it was.</li>
            <li> , however, it is more effective when you first purchase it.</li>
            <li> Other then that everything went great, and I will be using the product again!</li>
            <li> This product even though I paid a little more then this a wholile ago it seems to be the best for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about finding what works best with your hair though, sometimes I need it on longer than other times.</li>
            <li> /burn very very mildly, but nothing like the Nair.</li>
            <li> It works very quickly.</li>
            <li> but this one is way better specially for the price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had good luck with even a pad I would normally use to remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That was exactly the kind of results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product works, it is effective, and very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Tthis product does remove hair, and at first I was really impressed with the product when I tried it last week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for two years now and it was working just fine.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how pleasant the creme hair remover smelled.</li>
            <li> product does work for light to fine hair if you have thicker hair then try Nair or Nads.</li>
            <li> There was a tiny bit of irritation, but nothing unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the product and it definitey beats waxing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product on four separate occasions to ensure an accurate result and review.</li>
            <li> have found that instead of using that crappy lotion it comes with (which I throw away) using an acne lotion afterwards feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> could qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Hair free lip.</li>
            <li> Works great, fast, and has amazing results in only 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> LEAVES THE FACE SMOOTH AND WITHOUT DISCOLORATION.</li>
            <li> THE MOISTURIZER IS SOOTHING AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> Great upper lip hair removal creme!</li>
            <li> Used it on my friend with sensitive skin loved the results.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this hair removal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the cheapest and best product for facial hair removal thanks to amazon.</li>
            <li> Heyyyy this stuff really works!!!  </li>
            <li> Run away fast!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick and easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> This has been a very consistent hair remover product with little to no ingredient changes, so it&#x27;s been great always having this as a go-to product!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I love it the first time I used it I was just trying it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  definitely getting loads more of these for sure!</li>
            <li> it took me to clean it up off of the part I wanted hair to stay on.</li>
            <li> Even if you are not a sensitive skin, you still cannot keep them on your skin more than 8 minutes!!</li>
            <li> If you are preparing for a special occation, use it about 3 days before.</li>
            <li> it makes your hairs pretty much just fall out on their own and</li>
            <li> I just made sure not to rub it or touch it to much.</li>
            <li> I would leave it on (my upper lip) for 4 minutes and it removed all the hair; then I&#x27;d use the crème to soothe it and all was good.  </li>
            <li> I applied a generous amount and waited the full eight minutes before wiping any off.</li>
            <li> Good product, actually purchased it because I had already tried it from my sister.  </li>
            <li> cool</li>
            <li> Not bad, gets hair off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad by anyways just shaving is quicker and cheaper.</li>
            <li> The stuff does nothing after 8 minutes except irritate my skin and honestly seems to get less effective every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions and left it on for eight minutes--it removed very very fine light hairs that would have been fine on my face anyway--but did not remove the darker hairs.  </li>
            <li> (I have pretty fine hair).</li>
            <li> They said to wash it with mild soap and water.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product back in April to get rid of the hair above my lip and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> I went ahead quickly removed it with a textured washcloth and</li>
            <li> The stuff has a really strong chemical smell which I&#x27;m sure can&#x27;t mean good things, but it is cheap and does it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li> And yeah, it doesn&#x27;t really smell all that great, but it does smell better than a lot of the other, less effective products out there!</li>
            <li> FIrst of all I should say that I very rarely review products, unless they impress me.</li>
            <li> Do not leave it on for more than 4 minutes when the product is new.</li>
            <li> While I waited I experienced no burning or irritation, I did experience a warming sensation on my upper lip which I guessed was just a normal reaction.</li>
            <li> because i still think its an excellent product, i tried this as a teenager for fine face hairs and 15 years later i still havent tried any other products because this one works!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this the first time I used it, but after the second and third use, it&#x27;s become more effective.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would leave me feeling smooth for weeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my upper lip hair, and read the panflet carefully, and did everything they say you should do to get excellent results.... even leaving the produtc for no longer than 8 minutes(ZZZZzzzz) and....</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it was inexpensive, so worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was really scared and apprehensive because I read so many mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I did it.</li>
            <li> I now have a nice scar on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to not rub it in like you would lotion, but gently place it on the skin with a decent amount of cream.</li>
            <li> On top of that they didn&#x27;t refund my money and it was right before first day at a new school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for facial hair removal and this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other facial hair removers, but this works the best.</li>
            <li> The new smell is much more pleasant than previous versions!</li>
            <li> And if it starts to sting, please wash it off right away.  </li>
            <li> So I went a minute longer and that was the right time for me.  </li>
            <li> So, if your goal is to burn the skin right off of your face then, yes, this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for what I call excessive peach fuzz, works great.  </li>
            <li> After my first two attempts, I followed the guided steps in one of the reviewers post about waiting the full 8 mins and adding a bit more cream with the same ending result.</li>
            <li> I then applied a little more of the conditioner and was able to leave the house with a</li>
            <li> but I find it very noticeable quickly.</li>
            <li> I left this on for 5 min, wiped it off and my face is smooth and hair free.  </li>
            <li> This product works the best for my facial hair, for some reason other products aren&#x27;t strong enough to remove all the hair, but this one is.</li>
            <li> Again, this is the only facial hair removal cream that works effectively on me, just be sure to really watch how your skin reacts when using this product.</li>
            <li> Get a wash cloth wet it with warm water and remove hair one area at a time but rinsing the cloth with very warm water inbetween small areas.</li>
            <li> after washing my hands 18848 times the only saving grace was the lotion which smelt delightful like lavender which I slathered all over my raw hands.</li>
            <li> Good quality smells a little offensive but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> those who are complaining about chemical burns, you probably should have done a test strip first.</li>
            <li> I tried the Sally Hansen Creme Hair Remover for the first time tonight.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I will make a broader patch to catch those areas better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my upper lip and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It smells funny</li>
            <li> but hey, you&#x27;ll have funny smells when there is a chemical on your face.</li>
            <li> REMEMBER TO TEST FIRST</li>
            <li> did the test first</li>
            <li> With only one application I was able to get rid of /all/ hair in question.</li>
            <li> Now this was MY FIRST time using a creme hair removal</li>
            <li> I am glad I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested on trying it...</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying that I bought this at the store.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to use the cream twice for 7-8 min each time, but now I can only do 4 min twice</li>
            <li> I also apply a pretty generous layer.</li>
            <li> It seems to grow back stronger with more numbers, so I think I&#x27;ll try waxing before I end up looking like the wife of Sasquatch.</li>
            <li> I loved this product the first few times I used it...</li>
            <li> I first noticed the hair along my jawline was growing thicker and longer, I tried waxing.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have very blonde hairs on the top parts of my eyebrows and in between.</li>
            <li> It also does not burn like most facial hair removal creams have done for me.  </li>
            <li> Love this, and will definitely buy it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> The first time I was nervous</li>
            <li> The hairs didn&#x27;t grow back like before, but my face is even more oily and makeup won&#x27;t stay on my face.</li>
            <li> When I first used it on my chin</li>
            <li> For the price and the ease of buying it at your local Walmart this is one of the better products there.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s evident to say I will not be purchasing or even reusing it.</li>
            <li> This left me hairless and very smooth, and I liked the after-lotion which soothed my skin and left me feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use this right before you need to be absolutely presentable -</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local grocery store and was super excited about being able to remove the hair on my upper lip at home!</li>
            <li> and it left my face bright red</li>
            <li> It is very efficient, it removes the hair very well and does leaves a fresh feeling afer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of annoyed that I&#x27;m now more scruffy after trying this product.</li>
            <li> I loved waxing the best but after a terrifying almost scarring event I&#x27;ll never chance it again.</li>
            <li> tomorrow morning cause there is a little bit of hairs that were missed on the sides of my mouth but other than that I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday on my chin (after doing the patch test and waiting 24 hours) and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past with good results.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and continued to wait the full 8 minutes, and there was maybe 1-2 hairs if any that were gone after wiping the cream off.</li>
            <li> Not painful, not a terrible smell, and I usually use this right before a shower.</li>
            <li> I can leave it on now for 12 minutes (with little irritation) and most of the hair is still there!  </li>
            <li> Despite my facial hair being dark and stubborn,this product worked great an removed it as desired.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to use, but it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I think a certain ingredient in there gave me an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> hair in the sunlight or in certain angles.</li>
            <li> I only left it on for about 5 minutes and most of the hair came off!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too worried about it spreading while I cleaned it up because if it took eight whole minutes for it to get rid of my hair, no damage would be done in the thirty seconds</li>
            <li> so, I conclude with this review, that this stuff worked really rather well</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very closely and tested a patch before using it on my face.  </li>
            <li> I had literally 3 or 4 stray hairs on the very edges that didn&#x27;t remove.  </li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> you apply the extra smooth cream.</li>
            <li> I really recommend the product.</li>
            <li> If you just wipe it off gently, the hair probably will not come off.  </li>
            <li> Sure you get a softer touch but your re applying cream in 4-5 days roughly.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be too much for Sally Hansen to handle.  </li>
            <li> and now I will never have to worry about how much my mustache is glistening in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Haha.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> No, worse.</li>
            <li> I could not keep this product on the whole time it said to.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a real bummer.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll give it two stars, just because--at first--it worked really well.</li>
            <li> At $5, I didn&#x27;t really expect this cream to work.</li>
            <li> It does really remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Waxing works well (and really doesn&#x27;t hurt that much), but you need to let the hair grow out to a 1/4 of inch.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work.  </li>
            <li> This is really gentle on your face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After much consideration, I decided to take a chance and buy a hair removal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really only had light peach fuzz to begin with, so</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> It literally burned the skin off of my face and did absolutely NOTHING to remove hair.</li>
            <li> but now it burns the center of my top lip and still leaves hair.</li>
            <li> GENTLY DISOLVES THE HAIR WITHOUT ANY BURNING OR IRRITATION.</li>
            <li> Absolutely would recommend.</li>
            <li> It really works believe me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li> I have to use quite allot more than I expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it worked REALLY FAST.  </li>
            <li> gave this product 5 stars because it did remove all my hair so fast.  </li>
            <li> have Irish skin, sensitive to most chemicals...</li>
            <li> Next, I&#x27;d probably go something more natural or organic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a chemical smell it smells like 9 week old boiled eggs!!!</li>
            <li> You can rinse with plain warm water which means DO NOT USE SOAP.</li>
            <li> You could barely see the hairs unless looking super closely, but they were there</li>
            <li> It is low odor, very easy to use, and does not leave my face red.</li>
            <li> It does successfully remove the facial hair, but it doesn&#x27;t get the roots and makes the hairs grow back larger and thicker.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, I had a red, embarrassing upper lip for 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since a conditioning creme is given for use after the remover (smells like lovely roses,)</li>
            <li> When I went to wipe it off, I had the most extreme burning pain.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and of course being excited to use it I ripped it open and used it as soon as I brought it inside.</li>
            <li> Have tried other products, Surgicare for one, and this seems to work better and faster.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The after lotion smelt relatively nice, and seemed to calm the tight feel a bit, but probably isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> the test is to see how long I remain hair free.</li>
            <li> following the directions explicitly and leaving it on for the full 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin, so I did the test strip on my arm first, had no reaction, and I&#x27;ve continued to use it</li>
            <li> I would say more than half a bottle still remains.</li>
            <li> The downside to it being so potent is that it also tends to leave my upper lip very red sometimes</li>
            <li> but it is more likely that I&#x27;m not cleaning my face well enough.</li>
            <li> I used it above my upper lip and even though the directions recommend against it I used it over top of my eyebrows and under them.</li>
            <li> Works like magic and takes a short period of time only.  </li>
            <li> Now it has a highly perfumed smell.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it for those suffering with this issue who don&#x27;t want to shave or suffer through laser for a condition that you will eventually age out of.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to all who use this type of product.</li>
            <li> okay, for whatever reason, but the area above my upper lip was much too sensitive for these chemicals.  </li>
            <li> For only $5, I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, there was no reaction, everything seemed to be going as normal -</li>
            <li> I thought this was normal</li>
            <li> I normally just ignore that sensation.</li>
            <li> But at such a reasonable price, I was willing to try it on my daughter&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Ten minutes on, then wipe off with soft warm wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, if you&#x27;re not sure if you should get it or not GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li> On my upper lip I have to leave this on a little longer than it says for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> then applied it to the first target area on my face and let it set the full eight minutes using a soft washcloth to massage the cream gently in the direction of my hair growth being a little surprised even the fairly coarse hairs began to vanish right in front of me.</li>
            <li> I am now looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> so when I tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s Creme Hair Remover and it worked, I adopted this product and can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I am very surprised my skin wasn&#x27;t irritated by this.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin when it comes to hair remover.</li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ve felt like it wasn&#x27;t good enough was when I was rushed and didn&#x27;t leave it long enough.  </li>
            <li> not saying that this will happen to everyone, since everyone has different skin, and I bet it works fine for some people, but beware of the aftercare lotion, especially those of you who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I will do the exact same procedure.</li>
            <li> the tube is pretty big</li>
            <li> first thing I did was a patch test on my inner elbow like the instructions stated, waited 8 minutes and wiped it off-</li>
            <li> at first i left it on like the instruction</li>
            <li> I mention that because Im aware that some hair remover products dont work well on coarse hair; this cream MAY be one of those products, but the instruction pamphlet didn&#x27;t mention whether or not the coarseness of your hair mattered.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer the wax strips by sally hansen, but this was better.</li>
            <li> Very smelly and barely removes any hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend following the instructions exactly to prevent any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Not very strong and certainly not as annoying as the Sally Hansen cream bleach products.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sensitive skin but left on 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This removes pretty much all the hair - there might be one or two little ones left over, but that&#x27;s easy enough to pluck.</li>
            <li> Its not exactly what I wanted but its not bad.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, so much so that I can&#x27;t even get my eyebrows waxed because I break out in red bumps for days.  </li>
            <li> Like any skin topical, it&#x27;s always smart to do a test spot before lathering it on.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise the &amp;#34;brush-on&amp;#34; version and stay clear from this product.</li>
            <li> dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother doing the test section, and went straight to my upper lip and applied it.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin including acne and eczema.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and realized I had one around 16.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been sensitive after the application, specifically after washing it off.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove any hair at all, as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> If you really want to remove facial hair, maybe lazering it off is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> So far anyhow.</li>
            <li> It says it suppose to keep that area smooth for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it works as well because it doesn&#x27;t really remove coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing to wow about just another hair remover product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the peach fuzz that has been on the sides of my mouth, carefully following the directions and and testing the area on my arm a whole day before.</li>
            <li> But I can no longer use this product because it&#x27;s not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for people who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> I was surprised this works.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all.</li>
            <li> I have a professional job, and going to work in that state was quite embarrassing for me.  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t leave it on too long, but it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> This was a few weeks ago and my face is still hair free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend rubbing at your face if you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> However, when I applied the aftercare lotion, my face started stinging, even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is thinner and doesn&#x27;t remove hair nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So sensitive that I can&#x27;t get my eyebrows waxed and even if my face is itchy</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it did not make me break out with a rash or acne.</li>
            <li> Saves me from having to go back to the dermatologist for facial hair laser which, after over a year&#x27;s worth of scheduled laser, still yields growth anyway.  </li>
            <li> The product took most of the hair off of my upper lip, leaving a few matted hairs that I then plucked.</li>
            <li> I left that one on for a few more minutes before wiping it off.  </li>
            <li> After all these years, it did have kind of an egg smell, no, not great</li>
            <li> and then I started to take it off because I wanted time to move slowly and didnt want some of my skin to still be covered in it for more than 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> I think this a fine package deal too, cheaper than other options, and I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it as needed.</li>
            <li> Then, I put the lotion they give you on top and although my upper lip felt tight I had no other issues.</li>
            <li> so I left some hairs still on my face the second time it worked beautifully it did leave every other small hair</li>
            <li> No burn, and no little hairs that glisten in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> I see some stray hairs every now and then, but they&#x27;re so brittle that I can actually pull them out easily with my fingers or sometimes with a slight tug of tweezers.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, both areas where I applied it were smooth while the process left only very minor</li>
            <li> I had a small amount of redness right away that I am certain</li>
            <li> This used to be a good product, not sure what was changed with it,  but definitely  a waste of money</li>
            <li> Most face skin is very sensitive and needs to be \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I normally have a couple of white heads pop up a couple days after</li>
            <li> I gently rinsed with cool water, let it air dry and put the little moisturizer creme on that came with the package.</li>
            <li> few hours later, though, I touched my face to feel how smooth my newly hairless face was, but it was actually prickly!</li>
            <li> After the 6-8 minutes, I removed removal creme and my upper lip was clean, less irritated, and soothed.  </li>
            <li> It did not remove any hair from my lip or chin and it left my chin very sore and red.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the directions exactly, and perhaps do a small test spot on your face before doing your whole face you should avoid any of the horror stories of people who burn themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No pain or burning, I have a very sensitive skin and it worked for my upper lips.</li>
            <li> As someone with mild asthema i try to avoid perfumes so its more unpleasant to wear</li>
            <li> hair along my jawline was fairly thick, but the hair itself is fine and blond.  </li>
            <li> I have quite a thick layer of fine, clearish &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; all over my lower face and along my hairline, jawline, and upper lip  and have sensitive</li>
            <li> I want so badly to feel beautiful with a lady stache, but I just can&#x27;t and finally getting rid of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps me clear, especially in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not burn or barely smell.</li>
            <li> Then I took a wet wash cloth and scrubbed the hair off gently.</li>
            <li> and I have yet to go blindfrom the eyebrow-removal sesh, and the burning on my upper lip from the after-remover is nearly completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and barely takes hair off that it used to take off.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would say i am on the sensitive skin side, ive used sally Hansen facial hair remover before and it burned my skin!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wax facial hair because my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li> the results last a while so far its just been a couple of days like 3 or so</li>
            <li> No hair came off with the wet cotton ball, so I washed it off gently, re-applied and waited closer to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t grown back for weeks and my skin was soft.</li>
            <li> I am back to getting it waxed professionally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all the cream was off my face (the second time I completely ignored that wretched after-remover stuff), I splashed fairly cool water on my face for a few moments to get rid of the tingling and any extra cream that may have resided in my eyebrows that I hadn&#x27;t noticed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secondly I am 57 and have used many different products and gagets to remove the thick corse hair on my chine and neck area.</li>
            <li> The product did not smell like vanilla, but it was less strong than other depilatory</li>
            <li> I used to love this product, used it for several years, but now its tooootally burning my skin and hardly taking off my hair!</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth slightly tingling even after 30 minutes, but no real pain .</li>
            <li> Like, it&#x27;s mostly better now (just a little spot of red right under the area in between my nostrils), and I definitely didn&#x27;t get anything serious like a chemical burn, but it did hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left the cream on for a bit longer than the recommended 8 minutes on one side of my upper lip - the skin dried out a bit the next day but everywhere else was fine.</li>
            <li> I can live with the smell as long as I am getting rid of the hair without any pain.</li>
            <li> I waited just a few hours because I knew my skin would react right away if I were having an allergy to it.</li>
            <li> It made it slightly easier to pluck, but the whole point of this product is to remove all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably give it a few more tries before I give up on it entirely.</li>
            <li> I used a wash cloth with warm water and pushed down hard to wipe the creme off, in the opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> it cleared it up and left no dark spots..</li>
            <li> a few weeks later I used it again, this time I left it on for the full recommended time.</li>
            <li> The stuff worked fairly well on my eyebrows (there is a small spot that I suppose I didn&#x27;t put the cream on thick enough or</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, but it isn&#x27;t super tough either, so I was surprised I could wait the maximum amount of time.</li>
            <li> I will trust a professional from now on--more expensive but a better outcome.</li>
            <li> It is mostly just blonde hair on my upper lip with a few dark hairs...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this removes maybe 50% of my facial hairs - it&#x27;s better on thinner hair above my lip, but worse on mid-range hairs between my eyebrows and on/under my jawline, and barely removed any hairs from my mole at all.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive don&#x27;t leave it on to long.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;d advise anyone to give it a chance if it doesn&#x27;t work the first time, especially considering the relatively low price compared to other similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time my new tube is not working as expected.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t pleasantly fragrant, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> So far unbelievably this has not broken me out once</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product to those who are struggling with upper lip hair or other facial hair issues especially if you do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t let it dry on your face so use enough to cover hair completely.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll live with the hair from now on, not worth the pain and damage</li>
            <li> The hair on my upper lip is a MIXTURE OF BLONDE AND DARK HAIR, I wouldn&#x27;t say its very thick hair, but it is definitely more than just peach fuzz</li>
            <li> stuff is easier on my sensitive skin than the other brand.  </li>
            <li> On this last attempt, I waited until my facial hair was long enough (about 2 cm or so) on both the sides of my mouth and chin.</li>
            <li> For me personally,this worked a 100% -especially on my coarse and thick chin hair which none of the creams I tried in the past has been able to get rid of.</li>
            <li> &quot; it on, really put quit a bit on my lip, then wait a little longer than suggested, but it does the trick!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t yet removed all the hair completely from my lip, but I don&#x27;t dare leave it on longer since my skin got a little red last time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much of that I believe</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a couple of times it left what seemed almost like a chemical burn on my upper lip because when I went to apply make up the skin was very dry, flaky and hurt and was noticeable under my make up.</li>
            <li> She is 50 years old and little hairs grow around her chin, upper lip and between eyebrows sometimes.</li>
            <li> I put a bit less than the instructed amount on, but left it on for the full eight minutes (my hair is very dark) and my little upper lip hairs came off like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for an efficient facial hair remover for a long long time and this is it!After</li>
            <li> I feel it is due to a lack of adequate product rather than product failure</li>
            <li> I continued using the washcloth until no more product was visible on my face and the cloth appeared clean, and then used a wet one to wipe away any hidden residue from my face to be thorough.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, so I was a little nervous, but so far all I notice is a slight tingling - no redness.</li>
            <li> (well, at least since being an adult and responsible enough to read and follow directions) so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other products, but from reading others reviews it seems like it&#x27;s a product that does wonders for some and near nothing for others, but I think it&#x27;s affordable enough to at least give it a shot to see what category you fall into.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other creams which have worked, but they left my face red and irritated</li>
            <li> The area is red at first from the pressure, but after rinsing with cold water and reapplying moisturizer, my skin returns to normal.</li>
            <li> I have some really coarse dark hairs on my chin and also a mostly blonde mustache.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully, and after leaving the cream on my upper lips for about 7 minutes, nothing happened whatsoever!!!</li>
            <li> but as another reviewer stated you don&#x27;t keep it on for long.  </li>
            <li> Lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> and if you leave too long it burns the skin.</li>
            <li> But my chin I have to be careful it doesn&#x27;t burn and can only leave it on for a shorter time.</li>
            <li> I left the cream on for 4 minutes and then wiped it off with a damp cotton ball, followed by a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I was thinking; this stuff can&#x27;t possibly remove the black medium-coarse hairs on my upper lip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lo and behold, I applied it to my lip, waited 8 minutes, wiped it off with a damp cloth, and tada!</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t irritate it too much and only gets a little pink for a few minutes after using it.</li>
            <li> The other hand I tried three minutes and the same thing.</li>
            <li> It actually mad my hairs more defined and noticeable than they&#x27;d ever been.</li>
            <li> I also felt burns on both my chin and upper lip and after a few minutes, I noticed a small dot of blood on the left side of my upper lip and then an hour later, the entirety of my upper lip showed redness.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very carefully and left it on within the allotted time frame.  </li>
            <li> The tube lasted a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I patted my skin dry and applied a generous amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> I rinsed with water, patted dry and applied the Vit E lotion that came with it.  </li>
            <li> Apply to dry area where you want to remove hair.</li>
            <li> It barely removed anything and small white bumps were on my skin for about 40 minutes</li>
            <li> It took off every single hair though.</li>
            <li> If a single application doesn&#x27;t do the trick for you, don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li> I mean it does a decent job</li>
            <li> The results could be different for someone with dark hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dark coerce hair on my upper lip and my chin</li>
            <li> it was irritating at first..</li>
            <li> it was the last bit to have cream applied to and therefore had it on for less time) where I still have a couple hairs</li>
            <li> In the past, if I left it on for 12 minutes, my skin would be extremely red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> Now the skin in that area is really rough and dry.</li>
            <li> less glowing upper lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i only tried a small section on my upper lip since thats where i had problems before, after about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> After using this product (and after my skin was no longer irritated), I had to go back over the treated areas with a small facial trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because the last hair removal creme I bought didn&#x27;t work, but I was amazed at how well this product worked!</li>
            <li> I never want to shave them or wax them and have a mess of hair grow back.</li>
            <li> I put it on for the full 8 minutes and wiped down very slowly with a slightly damp cloth and the hair just melted away.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time less than five minutes ago and I am shocked how well this really worked!  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t quite do the job, it left hair behind on my upper lip, so last night I decided to leave it on a little longer, 6 minutes to be exact, and I washed my face with cold water and a wet cotton ball to gently go over it so that it would get all the hairs</li>
            <li> I used it on the sides of my face, tiny little fuzzy hair.</li>
            <li> your face may be a little red afterwards for awhile!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use, apply it thickly, let it sit and wipe down with toilet paper or a soft washcloth.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that since buying my last bottle and then this one, they changed their formula...</li>
            <li> After kissing my boyfriend a few times, he commented asking if his beard was making my skin red</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every few weeks for my upper lip and chin hairs.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I was fairly careful in removing it.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about 8 minutes, and then I either use a tissue or wet wash cloth and apply a lot of pressure as I wipe the cream off.  </li>
            <li> Delivered and works as expected.</li>
            <li> My husband called the poison control center.  </li>
            <li> This product does nothing as suggested, promise or expected.</li>
            <li> I used on my chin and carefully read the directions.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt tingly afterward, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a start, my skin is somewhat delicate, so as instructed I tested the cream on my inner elbow initially with no unusual discomfort or redness.</li>
            <li> This is second round.  </li>
            <li> Then I wait 8minutes and take it off with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> but in the right light it looked terrible!</li>
            <li> But my upper lip is prickly and that&#x27;s not very nice.</li>
            <li> Today  my face is raw and red.  </li>
            <li> The lower rated reviews seem to be consistent in that sensitive skin users have had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> and I did not think the numbing would last this long, but I do fell it fading slowly.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any ugly little hairs so far, definitely recommend and absolutely will buy again</li>
            <li> It can burn a little bit if you leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> When I woke this morning there were some small straglers still left</li>
            <li> i have tried other brands that works too</li>
            <li> I cannot put anything on my face due to pain.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not worth the 5.00 I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try based on the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I put this cream on for about  minutes, wiped it off with a wet paper towel and WA LAA!</li>
            <li> I have been buying Sally Hansen for years and saw it on the website as i was purchasing other products i decided to get this to meet my minimum for shipping.  </li>
            <li> This product is a disappointed, you&#x27;re better off shaving.</li>
            <li> I prefer it over other hair removal options.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> They must have just changed the formula as this one is a little drippy where the former formula stayed where you put it and did not run a little like this one.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands of hair remover in the past with no problems, although they didn&#x27;t not necessarily remove all the hair</li>
            <li> Taking care of your fingers while you are putting them on your legs or other parts.</li>
            <li> For the past year or so I&#x27;ve noticed hair on my upper lip that just looked so unattractive to me</li>
            <li> and she felt it working, and din&#x27;t experience any pain or discomfort that she felt using other products in the past that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> As opposed to other cream removers I&#x27;ve tried, this one works.</li>
            <li> I tested a small patch on my inner arm to see if I was irritated</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and remove a small section after only TWO MINUTES.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the reason I only gave this product a 4 star was because of the hair left behind...</li>
            <li> I applied it as directed yesterday morning, and left it on my upper lip for approximately 4 minutes</li>
            <li> Today my chin is red and raw with little scabs all over it.  </li>
            <li> The second time it hardly removed any hair.</li>
            <li> It not only failed to work, it left my face red and raw.  </li>
            <li> , I left it on 9 mins, it always leaves a little behind enough to notice it.</li>
            <li> I had finally decided to do something about the mustache I had been noticing for the past few years now.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> It should last for at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It only missed a few (2 or 3) small hairs</li>
            <li> The tube of cream being so thin (liquidy) does not last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I spread a thick layer on my inner arm and waited 8 mins.</li>
            <li> Once there were no signs I put the cream on my upper lip in a thick layer.</li>
            <li> Worthless for a guy.&lt;br /&gt;Probably better for women&#x27;s legs.</li>
            <li> There are so many things I hate about this product that it would take forever to list them all.</li>
            <li> I have a mix of peach fuzz and a some thicker hairs on my chin, which is frustrating since I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It left a few thicker, darker hairs behind which i plucked, no big deal.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about five minutes before wiping it off, and there was still a few fuzzies left behind.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed in that, but the smell was so bad</li>
            <li> I blatantly ignored the &#x27;don&#x27;t use on eyebrow area&#x27; warning and put it very carefully around my eyebrows and in between and all that jazz with a Q-tip and left it on for the eight minutes before wiping it off with some toilet paper.</li>
            <li> Even some previous Sally Hansen products.</li>
            <li> I leave it on about half and hour or until I can feel a slight burn and it works.</li>
            <li> My upper was RED and still hairy unfortunately.</li>
            <li> By three and a half minutes it was burning.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my tube at Walgreens about a year ago, and it&#x27;s about half way full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way less odor than some of the others.  </li>
            <li> so there is less plucking.</li>
            <li> This lasted for about half a day.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t matter how thick or how long</li>
            <li> I usually have to do it at least 15 minutes for my dark upper lip hair or else it won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> I kept it on a little less than the directions told me to</li>
            <li> had to apply a cold pack from my freezer, and now, even just an hour after, my upper lip area is sore, red, and extremely irritated.  </li>
            <li> off!It smells a little, but they all do.</li>
            <li> After 3 minutes I wiped off a little bit with a moist cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous after reading the reviews</li>
            <li> Not even a little sting.</li>
            <li> It did burn a little when I put on the lotion afterward.</li>
            <li> And the little lotion is so soothing.</li>
            <li> My advice would be to try a little spot on your face and see how your skin reacts to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll leave it on a little longer.</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;ve had it a while, you will find it takes a little longer to work than 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> I remove it with a little pressure</li>
            <li> I look so bad my teenage daughter refused to go shopping with me even though the focus was new clothes for her.      </li>
            <li> I could see some hairs on the cotton ball, but they were hard to spot and it was difficult to tell if it really removed all the hair on that spot, but it looked like it.  </li>
            <li> am only giving it 4 stars because my upper lip still feels numb.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this...</li>
            <li> I was tired of bleaching my upper lip hair...</li>
            <li> After 4 minutes, I wiped firmly with a cotton swab and noticed it was working, so I removed the remainder.  </li>
            <li> was from the pressure of wiping firmly to get the hairs off.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up plucking those with tweezers since there were so few.  </li>
            <li> it is always messy at the stores..</li>
            <li> a few bumps appeared on my arm that resembled hives, but they did not itch and were gone within another five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As I said my chin has corse gray hair and yes with age it turns gray and has progressed over the years from a few to plenty.</li>
            <li> but then as soon as I washed it off - the burning started immediately, and after application of the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; the burning only got worse, despite my hope that it would diminish the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I left it on, but ended up washing it off when the stinging got worse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite messy.</li>
            <li> I purchased item based on the description and a few comments.</li>
            <li> Otherwise,  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> A few of my pimples even started to bleed.</li>
            <li> The stinging and burning continued so much that by the following morning I had two nasty red scabs from chemical burns!</li>
            <li> Even after a few days, my face was like that.</li>
            <li> I suggested to use a few times and then see if it would work as it always helped me.</li>
            <li> (I mean I spent money on this, so I&#x27;m not gonna waste</li>
            <li> My chin has a patch of corse hair and grows in black, ick!</li>
            <li> Definitely less pain than waxing!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it it burned and stung really bad for a while.</li>
            <li> I was worried about it at first because of some of the bad reviews I&#x27;ve heard.</li>
            <li> I have to do this at least once a week, because my hair is so dark, but this cream works every time.</li>
            <li> I found a lot of hair remover creams are normally very harsh at least on my skin and tend to burn slightly.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this was the only product I could find in my small town</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> So instead of the usual 10 minutes of plucking</li>
            <li> Please think twice though, because I had used this in the past with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical from reading mixed reviews, but this product worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> but I was extremely disappointed that the hairs came back a week later.</li>
            <li> I payed 9 dollars for this product which was expensive especially for something</li>
            <li> To top this review off, the product had a horrible smell of poop and chemicals.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my face/skin/hair has changed or the product has changed their formula.</li>
            <li> Not okay.</li>
            <li> and i was always not sure what to do about it because I knew</li>
            <li> the directions say to leave it on for no more than 8 minutes, which would explain my irritation.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t smell bad and left a small rash for less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I then take a tissue and wipe it hard to pull the hair off.</li>
            <li> Also, use common sense, if you see the hair coming up out of the cream, then it&#x27;s working and wipe it</li>
            <li> Some folks complained about the smell.  </li>
            <li> I cupped my hand with COLD water and held that to my face to wash off any extra hair.</li>
            <li> Do not wash your face for at least two hours before and about two hours after.</li>
            <li> They recommended at least 20 mins.  </li>
            <li> It smelt horrible like boiled eggs and diarreah (the cream) and left me with hairs and stubble like I shaved my knuckles and left it for a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a cheap and terrible product.</li>
            <li> and I have not seen any negative effects.</li>
            <li> i got a small sensations, (NOT burning) and took it off, no burning, no marks, NO HAIR!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just got an insanely short shelf-life, or if the hair on my chin/lip (which is totally disgusting, I know) somehow mutated into this Freak Facial Hair and decided to wreak havoc like King Kong in Manhattan</li>
            <li> No more mustache!</li>
            <li> Then follow with running my chin under cold water for as long as I could stand it.  </li>
            <li> Removed it immediately and am left with a terrible chemical burn on my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A thin layer will hardly sink into the follicles, as it&#x27;s cream is a heavier consistency.</li>
            <li> Two minutes in it began tingling, but not to bad so left it on.  </li>
            <li> Nothing left except the hair I started with and the bad smell.</li>
            <li> I used a cold, wet piece of tissue to wipe it off.</li>
            <li> i followed all directions and was left with burnt skin on my face like a sunburn that was painful and eventually peeled.</li>
            <li> Back to razors I guess as waxing is just too painful.</li>
            <li> ALSO I do not know why people are complaining about the smell, I hardly noticed it when I put it on!</li>
            <li> The stupid cream ripped off all the skin on my upper lip!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try another product, as I&#x27;ve always just been &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; and not really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Yet another thing that&#x27;s a money pit and trial and error not to mention frustrating.  </li>
            <li> but this just made it WAY worse.</li>
            <li> So frustrating.</li>
            <li> so I proceeded to put a thin layer on my face and give it 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Would rate 0 stars If I could, worse product my face texture changed ever sense</li>
            <li> So basically I put this on my face s thin layer and don&#x27;t rub it in.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken.</li>
            <li> The cream is now very thin, so coverage is not good.</li>
            <li> This item SUCKS!!</li>
            <li> I have used products in the past with bad orders.  </li>
            <li> This product works well, but unfortunately for me, if you are an idiot you may burn half your face off along with your hair like I did.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product it removes hair well.</li>
            <li> Really scary.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> But when I went to use it on my upper lip and my chin area, it burned my skin something terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy!!!</li>
            <li> It took out even the darkest, grossest hairs from their roots like butter; it didn&#x27;t burn my face, or leave any sort of weird redness or blisters</li>
            <li> The Nair facial hair remover smelled awful and was twice the price, and although it did the job, I was looking for a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about any hair removal creams, until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> I bought Sally Hansen because I thought it was a brand I could trust: I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not remove all the hair, but it burned my skin terribly.  </li>
            <li> areas where I applied the product became kinda oily, which is weird for me because I have dry/combination skin.</li>
            <li> This beats painful threading and waxing, at half the cost and regrowth time!!!</li>
            <li> followed the instructions carefully because I read reviews about people who have had horrible reactions to the chemicals, which almost made me not use it.</li>
            <li> I know people who have tried other products, and gotten horrible rashes.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying any of these products are dangerous and if you use them cautiously they will work well.</li>
            <li> In the past I experimented with nair and it was awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell bad though, that cream.</li>
            <li> But has a bad odor.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews saying the smell was bad</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and</li>
            <li> It hurts too bad</li>
            <li> My face was burning and stinging so bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe the manufacturer changed the formulation or maybe I got a bad tube, either</li>
            <li> Had a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> but it was painful and always created bumps.</li>
            <li> but now I have an ugly scab on my chin.</li>
            <li> am tired of products changing for the worst.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, but it does the job without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and all I got was a numb chin!</li>
            <li> Today I am all scarred up! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Im kinda disappointed...</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> Will not be using :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, though :(</li>
            <li> I hate when it drips. :-(</li>
            <li> I rinsed over and over with very, very cold water.  </li>
            <li> I read a thousand reviews hoping to find a product recommended for use in base of spine region to help with a pilodinal cyst healing.  </li>
            <li> It was not unbearable, just annoying and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Painful, noticeable burns!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> HATE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst face hair remover I ever tried.</li>
            <li> This gave me an awful chemical burn on my chin.  </li>
            <li> smells awful and dose&#x27;nt work</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst products I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> It made me break out horribly.</li>
            <li> I felt terrible.</li>
            <li> NOTHING.Just the disgusting smell.</li>
            <li> and I now have terrible acne which I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for months.</li>
            <li> The chemistry burn is terrible!</li>
            <li> This product is awful.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> This product works the best for my facial hair, for some reason other products aren&#x27;t strong enough to remove all the hair, but this one is. The downside to it being so potent is that it also tends to leave my upper lip very red sometimes and I&#x27;ve noticed a couple of times it left what seemed almost like a chemical burn on my upper lip because when I went to apply make up the skin was very dry, flaky and hurt and was noticeable under my make up. After kissing my boyfriend a few times, he commented asking if his beard was making my skin red and I knew it wasn&#x27;t his beard, it was the red skin that I had to cover up with concealer because of this product. I used it for the recommended amount of time, however I don&#x27;t always use the lotion that comes with it if I&#x27;m in a hurry which might be what causes the redness. Again, this is the only facial hair removal cream that works effectively on me, just be sure to really watch how your skin reacts when using this product.</li>
            <li> Great hair removal for even sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> 4 because i still think its an excellent product, i tried this as a teenager for fine face hairs and 15 years later i still havent tried any other products because this one works!  My only complaint is that since buying my last bottle and then this one, they changed their formula... After all these years, it did have kind of an egg smell, no, not great but i was used to it.  Now it has a highly perfumed smell.  As someone with mild asthema i try to avoid perfumes so its more unpleasant to wear this now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont have sensitive skin so i never use the after lotion, i assume its to eliminate any possible irritation?  I apply with tip of finger to area, leave about five minutes, then vigorously rub off, then wash.  Works every time, lasts several weeks for me.</li>
            <li> I read a thousand reviews hoping to find a product recommended for use in base of spine region to help with a pilodinal cyst healing.  So many horror stories of chemical burns with depilatories and that was no region I wanted to risk.  In the end I decided a product designed for the fave must be gentler than the others so we&#x27;d give it a shot.  I&#x27;m so happy to say it worked like a charm and I highly recommend it for those suffering with this issue who don&#x27;t want to shave or suffer through laser for a condition that you will eventually age out of.  It&#x27;s been a perfect solution for us.  Sally Hansen will not officially reccomend using the product anywhere but the face, but it works!  We aren&#x27;t even using the moisturizer that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Despite my facial hair being dark and stubborn,this product worked great an removed it as desired. It even worked great on my sideburns!&lt;br /&gt;I left the product on for about 10 mins. It did not burn or barely smell. Then I took a wet wash cloth and scrubbed the hair off gently. I patted my skin dry and applied a generous amount of lotion. There was a tiny bit of irritation, but nothing unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the product and it definitey beats waxing!</li>
            <li> It burned my skin..it was irritating at first..I didn&#x27;t exceed d time..it left my cheeks with red burns..I used turmeric..it cleared it up and left no dark spots..but my skin looks irregular now! I will never use it again..thank god..it cleared up!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it at all. The first time I tried it it burned and stung really bad for a while. It barely removed anything and small white bumps were on my skin for about 40 minutes</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t work.  I even placed a warm rag on my chin to soften the hairs and it didn&#x27;t work.  This item SUCKS!! Do not buy any Sally Hansen hair removal waxes or creams for face because they don&#x27;t work!! I know b/c I&#x27;ve tried them all and all I got was a numb chin! Save your money!</li>
            <li> This works amazing. I have to do this at least once a week, because my hair is so dark, but this cream works every time. No burn! Also, use common sense, if you see the hair coming up out of the cream, then it&#x27;s working and wipe it off!It smells a little, but they all do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every few weeks for my upper lip and chin hairs. They are blonde so they&#x27;re not too noticeable except when in sunlight, but I don&#x27;t like them anyways. I leave it on for the maximum amount of time and then use moist cotton swabs to remove it. I see some stray hairs every now and then, but they&#x27;re so brittle that I can actually pull them out easily with my fingers or sometimes with a slight tug of tweezers. I have very light skin but this doesn&#x27;t irritate it too much and only gets a little pink for a few minutes after using it. The lotion they include for afterwards definitely helps soothe the area and I actually kind of like the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are complaining about chemical burns, you probably should have done a test strip first.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail...and decided to try it...works great!!! Glad i ordered and will continue using it...so much better than waxing..</li>
            <li> So I bought this product from Walgreens about two hours ago and almost immediately put it to use once I got home. I didn&#x27;t bother doing the test section, and went straight to my upper lip and applied it. I put a bit less than the instructed amount on, but left it on for the full eight minutes (my hair is very dark) and my little upper lip hairs came off like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the thing. The hair remover (that smelly, smelly thing) didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all, but when I went to put a bit of that after-remover stuff on, it burned. BURNED. Like, it&#x27;s mostly better now (just a little spot of red right under the area in between my nostrils), and I definitely didn&#x27;t get anything serious like a chemical burn, but it did hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nextly. I blatantly ignored the &#x27;don&#x27;t use on eyebrow area&#x27; warning and put it very carefully around my eyebrows and in between and all that jazz with a Q-tip and left it on for the eight minutes before wiping it off with some toilet paper. I wasn&#x27;t too worried about it spreading while I cleaned it up because if it took eight whole minutes for it to get rid of my hair, no damage would be done in the thirty seconds it took me to clean it up off of the part I wanted hair to stay on. Nevertheless, I was fairly careful in removing it. The stuff worked fairly well on my eyebrows (there is a small spot that I suppose I didn&#x27;t put the cream on thick enough or it was the last bit to have cream applied to and therefore had it on for less time) where I still have a couple hairs and I suppose I&#x27;ll wait til tomorrow or something to fix that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all the cream was off my face (the second time I completely ignored that wretched after-remover stuff), I splashed fairly cool water on my face for a few moments to get rid of the tingling and any extra cream that may have resided in my eyebrows that I hadn&#x27;t noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, I conclude with this review, that this stuff worked really rather well and I have yet to go blindfrom the eyebrow-removal sesh, and the burning on my upper lip from the after-remover is nearly completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell bad though, that cream.</li>
            <li> I was using this but then it changed, it stopped working and just burned my face. Embarassing, good luck</li>
            <li> HATE IT!!!!! DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my upper lip hair, and read the panflet carefully, and did everything they say you should do to get excellent results.... even leaving the produtc for no longer than 8 minutes(ZZZZzzzz) and.... nothing at all! it didn&#x27;t work! not even on one itsy bitsy hair. &#x27;t If I were you I wouldn&#x27;t  bother. It&#x27;s the worst face hair remover I ever tried.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific.  I have, or had, blonde hair on my upper lip that was bothering me. After reading reviews and swallowing my nervousness, I decided to go with the Sally Hansen creme hair remover kit. I followed the instructions, making sure not to rub it in. After 3 minutes I wiped off a little bit with a moist cotton ball.  Wow.  All of the hair was gone! I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick and easy it was to use. I also have very sensitive skin, so much so that I can&#x27;t even get my eyebrows waxed because I break out in red bumps for days.  I had zero redness or breaking out with this product.  I am very, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that instead of using that crappy lotion it comes with (which I throw away) using an acne lotion afterwards feels fantastic. I have no idea why, but the lotion it comes with makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s on fire. I would actually register it as pain. But the lotion with the 2% acne chemical in it seems to neutralize it. Go figure. It works great and is super effective and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s willing to make sure they&#x27;re washing it off within 8 minutes of putting it on.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for what I call excessive peach fuzz, works great.  Recommend this product for you! Great price too!  Beats the cost of threading &amp; no pain</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully, and after leaving the cream on my upper lips for about 7 minutes, nothing happened whatsoever!!! None of my hair was removed. I tried this for two more times after a couple of days, but still, nothing happened. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this... I&#x27;m sure you can find better ones out there!</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions and left it on for eight minutes--it removed very very fine light hairs that would have been fine on my face anyway--but did not remove the darker hairs.  Don&#x27;t buy it--it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I tried the Sally Hansen Creme Hair Remover for the first time tonight.  I was tired of bleaching my upper lip hair...the bleach stuff smells really strong and burns!  I wanted to try waxing, but I know it will hurt!  I was actually looking at getting wax when I ran into this product.  For only $5, I thought it was worth a try.  When I read the reviews before using it, however, I was worried about getting a chemical burn!  I followed the directions very closely and tested a patch before using it on my face.  No problems.  Again, I followed the directions for application and only left it on for 4 minutes.  After 4 minutes, I wiped firmly with a cotton swab and noticed it was working, so I removed the remainder.  I had a small amount of redness right away that I am certain was from the pressure of wiping firmly to get the hairs off.  I rinsed with water, patted dry and applied the Vit E lotion that came with it.  I had literally 3 or 4 stray hairs on the very edges that didn&#x27;t remove.  I feel it is due to a lack of adequate product rather than product failure and I ended up plucking those with tweezers since there were so few.  Next time, I will make a broader patch to catch those areas better.  Some folks complained about the smell.  It isn&#x27;t pleasantly fragrant, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  Not very strong and certainly not as annoying as the Sally Hansen cream bleach products.  Oh, and I didn&#x27;t experience any burning sensation. I will definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product it removes hair well.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I thought I was getting something else. Its not exactly what I wanted but its not bad. It is not a bleach it is actually a hair remover. Maybe I should have read more into the description.</li>
            <li> No pain or burning, I have a very sensitive skin and it worked for my upper lips. I love it</li>
            <li> Not bad, gets hair off. But it left bumps on my skin and they are there for over 2 weeks now. I think a certain ingredient in there gave me an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Works very well</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my mother, she has used this brand since i was a child, and she keeps using it!</li>
            <li> always use this product.. didn&#x27;t even know it could be ordered through you guys.. it is always messy at the stores.. you definitely have my business.</li>
            <li> I have seen many scary reviews on this product and just wanted to add my two cents. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin including acne and eczema. My hubby was coming home from being deployed and I wanted to look smokin...hence my need for a product like this. Sadly, this was the only product I could find in my small town and I bought it. I was a little nervous after reading the reviews but I tried it anyway. Here is how I did it...I spread a thick layer on my inner arm and waited 8 mins. No redness when I washed off, no irritation, and I wasnt burning. I waited just a few hours because I knew my skin would react right away if I were having an allergy to it. Once there were no signs I put the cream on my upper lip in a thick layer. I waited for 7 minutes and then I started to take it off because I wanted time to move slowly and didnt want some of my skin to still be covered in it for more than 8 minutes. I used a cold, wet piece of tissue to wipe it off. Now here is the key...I did this at night when I knew I didnt have to show anyone my face and when I wiped I just wiped off the cream. I could see the hairs that were wanting to come off but I would have needed to rub to get them off...I didnt. I left them there. YES, it was a gross sight but I had NO irritation, redness, blisters, NOTHING. Which is amazing for my skin. I cupped my hand with COLD water and held that to my face to wash off any extra hair. Then, I put the lotion they give you on top and although my upper lip felt tight I had no other issues. I just made sure not to rub it or touch it to much. When I woke this morning there were some small straglers still left so I will do it again tonight and I will do the exact same procedure. Anyway, the reason I only gave this product a 4 star was because of the hair left behind...otherwise it worked for me.</li>
            <li> love the product! i love that it works &amp; doesn&#x27;t have that foul hair remover smell. i have tried other brands that works too but this one is way better specially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past with good results.  Last night I followed the instructions and when I went to wipe off, my face started burning.  Today  my face is raw and red.  I cannot put anything on my face due to pain.  This product could cause severe skin problems - watch out!</li>
            <li> My wife got the product and she tried it on today. It is very efficient, it removes the hair very well and does leaves a fresh feeling afer you apply the extra smooth cream. I really recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I was a faithful consumer of this product for many years.  It used to work great...I would leave it on (my upper lip) for 4 minutes and it removed all the hair; then I&#x27;d use the crème to soothe it and all was good.  Loved it. NOT SO any more.  They must have changed the formulation.  I can leave it on now for 12 minutes (with little irritation) and most of the hair is still there!  In the past, if I left it on for 12 minutes, my skin would be extremely red and irritated.  I am now looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my upper lip and I love it.  The smell isn&#x27;t great but as another reviewer stated you don&#x27;t keep it on for long.  I use it after I shower and my skin is softened.  I usually moisturize my upper lip first, then apply the cream.  I leave it on for about 8 minutes, and then I either use a tissue or wet wash cloth and apply a lot of pressure as I wipe the cream off.  If you just wipe it off gently, the hair probably will not come off.  The area is red at first from the pressure, but after rinsing with cold water and reapplying moisturizer, my skin returns to normal.</li>
            <li> Ouch!  This stuff is not worth the 5.00 I spent on it.  I followed the directions very carefully and left it on within the allotted time frame.  It did not remove any hair from my lip or chin and it left my chin very sore and red.  The product burned and left my skin irritated.  I would never purchase this product again nor would I recommend it to anyone I know.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to the salon.</li>
            <li> Burned my upper lip, red splotches left and all my hair still there.  Should have stuck with Nair.</li>
            <li> This was one of two brands I ordered. Did not work at all even when I left it on the longest time suggested. Will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great! I had finally decided to do something about the mustache I had been noticing for the past few years now. I am 21 years old and realized I had one around 16. It is mostly just blonde hair on my upper lip with a few dark hairs...but in the right light it looked terrible! I did not want to shave and have the stubble look and i did not want to wax, so I decided to use this hair remover. I was nervous to remove the hair at all because I did not want it to grow back worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions carefully because I read reviews about people who have had horrible reactions to the chemicals, which almost made me not use it. The product recommended that you test out the creme on your arm ( the opposite side of the elbow ). Which I did, I experienced no burning or itching using the product. I did notice however 10 minutes after I had taken it off a few bumps appeared on my arm that resembled hives, but they did not itch and were gone within another five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited 24 hours before I used it on my upper lip. I applied a generous amount and waited the full eight minutes before wiping any off. While I waited I experienced no burning or irritation, I did experience a warming sensation on my upper lip which I guessed was just a normal reaction. I used a wash cloth with warm water and pushed down hard to wipe the creme off, in the opposite direction of hair growth. It removed all the hair and looked great! It did not turn red and no hives appeared either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it 4 stars because my upper lip still feels numb. It has been almost 24 hours since I used the product and I did not think the numbing would last this long, but I do fell it fading slowly. ALSO I do not know why people are complaining about the smell, I hardly noticed it when I put it on! Other then that everything went great, and I will be using the product again!</li>
            <li> I switched to this as a cheaper alternative to another brand (SurgiCream..?). That was around 7 or 8 years ago.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed!  The only time I&#x27;ve felt like it wasn&#x27;t good enough was when I was rushed and didn&#x27;t leave it long enough.  That was my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is easier on my sensitive skin than the other brand.  It smells funny but hey, you&#x27;ll have funny smells when there is a chemical on your face. :) Using a wash cloth works best for me during removal but I&#x27;ve had good luck with even a pad I would normally use to remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the lotion that goes on after isn&#x27;t working well for me but it is more likely that I&#x27;m not cleaning my face well enough. I once skipped the lotion and washed my face and had no lingering problems, so that is my go to method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this stuff to anyone who asks!</li>
            <li> i followed all directions and was left with burnt skin on my face like a sunburn that was painful and eventually peeled. i will never use this product again. don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have read reviews that say that it burned their skin. Well every one can not use it the same way. It does say to test it first in a small unnotible area. If your skin is sensitive don&#x27;t leave it on to long. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SENCE I WAS IN MY TEEN YEARS AND I AM ABOUT TO TURN 41 IN 2 WEEKS AND I AM STILL USING IT. You can&#x27;t let it dry on your face so use enough to cover hair completely. Do not wash your face for at least two hours before and about two hours after. Apply to dry area where you want to remove hair. Wait the minutes indicated. Get a wash cloth wet it with warm water and remove hair one area at a time but rinsing the cloth with very warm water inbetween small areas. Remember to keep it warm. That helpes melt the hair off. You can rinse with plain warm water which means DO NOT USE SOAP. I don&#x27;t use the conditioner and I don&#x27;t wash my face until about 4 hours later. If you are preparing for a special occation, use it about 3 days before. REMEMBER TO TEST FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li> It works no burning ! Smells great I love it</li>
            <li> Delivered and works as expected.</li>
            <li> FIrst of all I should say that I very rarely review products, unless they impress me. Secondly I am 57 and have used many different products and gagets to remove the thick corse hair on my chine and neck area. Even some previous Sally Hansen products. So instead of the usual 10 minutes of plucking I thought I would give this a try based on the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Well ladies I have to say I am impressed. As I said my chin has corse gray hair and yes with age it turns gray and has progressed over the years from a few to plenty. I put this cream on for about  minutes, wiped it off with a wet paper towel and WA LAA! to my surprise all the hair was gone. My skin is smooth slightly tingling even after 30 minutes, but no real pain . I will use this again and recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;Now the test is to see how long I remain hair free.</li>
            <li> Try Veet or Nair, but not this. The stuff does nothing after 8 minutes except irritate my skin and honestly seems to get less effective every time I use it. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Heyyyy this stuff really works!!!  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the test first and so now I use it regularly and so I don&#x27;t have to pluck.  ocuch</li>
            <li> I have been using the &amp;#34;Brush-On&amp;#34; Sallie Hansen product for my upper lip for over five years.  I&#x27;ve always been sensitive after the application, specifically after washing it off.  I wanted to try another product, as I&#x27;ve always just been &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; and not really happy with the results.  I noticed this at the drugstore and went ahead and gave it a try this afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, there was no reaction, everything seemed to be going as normal - but then as soon as I washed it off - the burning started immediately, and after application of the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; the burning only got worse, despite my hope that it would diminish the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to apply a cold pack from my freezer, and now, even just an hour after, my upper lip area is sore, red, and extremely irritated.  I&#x27;d advise the &amp;#34;brush-on&amp;#34; version and stay clear from this product.</li>
            <li> This gave me an awful chemical burn on my chin.  I followed the instructions, but it started to sting soon after application.  I thought this was normal so I left it on, but ended up washing it off when the stinging got worse.  I was left with a second-degree burn on my chin.  My husband called the poison control center.  They said to wash it with mild soap and water.  Then follow with running my chin under cold water for as long as I could stand it.  They recommended at least 20 mins.  My skin reminded me of how ice looks after you sprinkle rock salt on it.  I healed, after a couple weeks.  I understand that this may not happen to everyone.  Please think twice though, because I had used this in the past with no problems.  And if it starts to sting, please wash it off right away.  Don&#x27;t wait like I did!</li>
            <li> I see people are complaining that this doesn&#x27;t work. Unless you are a man with a full beard this stuff works just great. Leave it on for about 5-8 minutes wipe off with tissue and then wash your face. Simple. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;This product does work for light to fine hair if you have thicker hair then try Nair or Nads.</li>
            <li> I used this product once before and it didn&#x27;t quite do the job, it left hair behind on my upper lip, so last night I decided to leave it on a little longer, 6 minutes to be exact, and I washed my face with cold water and a wet cotton ball to gently go over it so that it would get all the hairs, well, it got all the hairs and then some, my skin!! Today I am all scarred up! &#x3D;( I used it on the sides of my face, tiny little fuzzy hair. I&#x27;m so bummed out and upset!</li>
            <li> It works. But has a bad odor. It also seemed like it was being stored for a while.but it was an okay product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical from reading mixed reviews, but this product worked like a charm. I used this cream on my upper lip, cheeks, neck and a bit on my forehead. This left me hairless and very smooth, and I liked the after-lotion which soothed my skin and left me feeling soft. With only one application I was able to get rid of /all/ hair in question. I left the cream on for a bit longer than the recommended 8 minutes on one side of my upper lip - the skin dried out a bit the next day but everywhere else was fine. The product did not smell like vanilla, but it was less strong than other depilatory creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and worked perfectly.  I have used products in the past with bad orders.  This fragrance with this product was pleasant.  I left the cream on for close to 5 mintues.</li>
            <li> Tried it on a 4-day stubble of a beard.  Didn&#x27;t remove any hair at all, as far as I can tell.  Worthless for a guy.&lt;br /&gt;Probably better for women&#x27;s legs.</li>
            <li> Not painful, not a terrible smell, and I usually use this right before a shower. I bought this months ago, maybe 5, and I use it weekly. I would say more than half a bottle still remains. I love this product, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any discoloration or any of that.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I only have scarce facial hair as a guy, hoping if I tried this product I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave anymore.  It does successfully remove the facial hair, but it doesn&#x27;t get the roots and makes the hairs grow back larger and thicker.  If you really want to remove facial hair, maybe lazering it off is the way to go.  I&#x27;m kind of annoyed that I&#x27;m now more scruffy after trying this product.</li>
            <li> So, they say you shouldn&#x27;t shave your face. They say it grows back quicker and thicker. I&#x27;m not sure how much of that I believe and I know a lot of women who shave with no issues.  Ive tried everything affordable. I loved waxing the best but after a terrifying almost scarring event I&#x27;ll never chance it again. Really scary.  I found a lot of hair remover creams are normally very harsh at least on my skin and tend to burn slightly. I normally just ignore that sensation. This product even though I paid a little more then this a wholile ago it seems to be the best for me. So far anyhow. Yet another thing that&#x27;s a money pit and trial and error not to mention frustrating.  The reason I give this product 2 stars is simply because it&#x27;s just another hair removal product that doesn&#x27;t do what it should for the time period given. It says it suppose to keep that area smooth for a few weeks. Ha! In my experience it&#x27;s no different then shaving. Although shaving is quicker and cheaper.  Sure you get a softer touch but your re applying cream in 4-5 days roughly. You could probably get a week out of it or more I guess that&#x27;s up to you but I find it very noticeable quickly. Honestly if you don&#x27;t mind applying I&#x27;d recommend this product. It&#x27;s not bad by anyways just shaving is quicker and cheaper. Lasts just as long. Although I will say I like using this slightly better since it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. When I shave it tends to leave pimple like bumps ( irritation) and this seems to eliminate that.  I think I forgot to mention. I use this on my face. My chin has a patch of corse hair and grows in black, ick! And my cheek just under my ear. Update: it&#x27;s June of 2015 and I still feel the same way about this cream. I ordered some more and tried again. I don&#x27;t feel it works as well because it doesn&#x27;t really remove coarse hair. I mean it does a decent job but it doesn&#x27;t matter how thick or how long, I left it on 9 mins, it always leaves a little behind enough to notice it. Again gets rid of irritation but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have been buying Sally Hansen for years and saw it on the website as i was purchasing other products i decided to get this to meet my minimum for shipping.  Nothing to wow about just another hair remover product.</li>
            <li> smells awful and dose&#x27;nt work</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time less than five minutes ago and I am shocked how well this really worked!  I used it on my UPPER LIP.  The hair on my upper lip is a MIXTURE OF BLONDE AND DARK HAIR, I wouldn&#x27;t say its very thick hair, but it is definitely more than just peach fuzz and I thought it would be too much for Sally Hansen to handle.  Boy was I wrong.  Now this was MY FIRST time using a creme hair removal (well, at least since being an adult and responsible enough to read and follow directions) so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other products, but from reading others reviews it seems like it&#x27;s a product that does wonders for some and near nothing for others, but I think it&#x27;s affordable enough to at least give it a shot to see what category you fall into.  I&#x27;m so glad I did and now I will never have to worry about how much my mustache is glistening in the sun.  Haha.  Oh man, you won this time Media.  I want so badly to feel beautiful with a lady stache, but I just can&#x27;t and finally getting rid of it makes me feel like a kid on Christmas morning.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this everywhere! I am glad I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;This hair remover works great!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst products I have ever tried.  It not only failed to work, it left my face red and raw.  It felt like a toxic compound.  The effects took hours to go away even with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. I got this item from target to use on my upper lip. Thankfully I tried it out on my hairy knuckles. The cream immediately started tingling and burning my finger I applied it with as well as my knuckles. I kept it on for shorter time since it was hurting so about like 2:45 instead of 3. It smelt horrible like boiled eggs and diarreah (the cream) and left me with hairs and stubble like I shaved my knuckles and left it for a few days. The other hand I tried three minutes and the same thing. I would have continued using it if the smell wasn&#x27;t so retched. I saw the reviews saying the smell was bad but I thought I could handle it. It&#x27;s not like a chemical smell it smells like 9 week old boiled eggs!!! after washing my hands 18848 times the only saving grace was the lotion which smelt delightful like lavender which I slathered all over my raw hands. It&#x27;s also quite messy.</li>
            <li> This product does work but expect to leave it on a lot longer then they recommend which a lot of the reviews state. I leave it on about half and hour or until I can feel a slight burn and it works.</li>
            <li> This product  doesn&#x27;t  remove any hair, just a tiny bit and it makes your skin, red and sore afterwards.  I would  NOT recommend.  This used to be a good product, not sure what was changed with it,  but definitely  a waste of money</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  Can&#x27;t use wax or tweezers as my skin is so fragile it bruises me.  I left this on for 5 min, wiped it off and my face is smooth and hair free.  Plan on expanding the treatment area later before I shower.</li>
            <li> I did the test that Sally Hansen suggested. I had no allergic reaction. But when I went to use it on my upper lip and my chin area, it burned my skin something terrible. My lip bled. I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough. Now the skin in that area is really rough and dry. I&#x27;m not very happy!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and after 8 minutes nothing came off. I usually have to do it at least 15 minutes for my dark upper lip hair or else it won&#x27;t come off. It doesn&#x27;t sting after 15 minutes either so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter that has some hair on her upper lip. I was worried about it at first because of some of the bad reviews I&#x27;ve heard. But at such a reasonable price, I was willing to try it on my daughter&#x27;s face. It worked wonders and my daughter is very happy about the results! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product does nothing as suggested, promise or expected. I purchased item based on the description and a few comments. If you&#x27;re interested on trying it...no problem.  Otherwise,  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about a week ago and used it two nights ago. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and the tube is pretty big so it will last for numerous amounts of uses. I kept it on a little less than the directions told me to but it worked. I used it above my upper lip and even though the directions recommend against it I used it over top of my eyebrows and under them. I have very sensitive skin, so I am very surprised my skin wasn&#x27;t irritated by this. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Not even a little sting. But my upper lip is prickly and that&#x27;s not very nice. It took off every single hair though. But not buying again because I might as well just shaved it. This product is a disappointed, you&#x27;re better off shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it was inexpensive, so worth a try. I followed the simple instructions and it worked perfectly for me. It did burn a little when I put on the lotion afterward. But kept the hair off for weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get my lip waxed.  It hurts too bad so when I tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s Creme Hair Remover and it worked, I adopted this product and can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for quite some time.  I have dark hair so when my &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; gets unruly, I whip out this magic trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Irish skin, sensitive to most chemicals...(rashes always broke out when I tried to fight a pimple.)  The first time I tried this, I had a red, embarrassing upper lip for 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since a conditioning creme is given for use after the remover (smells like lovely roses,) I applied that prior to the depilatory. After the 6-8 minutes, I removed removal creme and my upper lip was clean, less irritated, and soothed.  I then applied a little more of the conditioner and was able to leave the house with a less glowing upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great Sally Hansen product.</li>
            <li> Good product - works well to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff always works for me. I prefer it over other hair removal options.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but I was extremely disappointed that the hairs came back a week later. Plus it burned a lot after application.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink, burn, redden, etc. It is one of the best I have used. It stays put too! I hate when it drips. :-(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it says. I&#x27;ll just stick to waxing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how pleasant the creme hair remover smelled. This is a big step up from the Nair creme I had been using for years. I thought I&#x27;d take a chance on this as it was inexpensive and could qualify for free shipping. The directions call for leaving it on for only three minutes.  I was skeptical, but it worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This did more harm than good! I kept it on the amount of time in the instructions and it gave me a chemical burn &amp; ingrown hairs. Sure, it removes the hair- but it was still pokey after the hair was removed &amp; irritated.</li>
            <li> There are so many things I hate about this product that it would take forever to list them all. First let me start off by saying that I bought this at the store. I payed 9 dollars for this product which was expensive especially for something this crappy. I am so dissapointed. I throughly read the instruction and then put on my face. After 5 minutes,I checked to see if hair had been taken off. Nope. It actually mad my hairs more defined and noticeable than they&#x27;d ever been.I began to feel a stinging and burning so I immediately removed it. My face was burning and stinging so bad.It made me break out horribly. A few of my pimples even started to bleed.I felt terrible. On top of that they didn&#x27;t refund my money and it was right before first day at a new school.To top this review off, the product had a horrible smell of poop and chemicals. No, worse. I had severe acne and was trying to fix it but this just made it WAY worse. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this and if I had known this before I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> It worked.  I am not disappointed in that, but the smell was so bad I could not keep this product on the whole time it said to.  It still removed some of my hair.  I used it on my upper lip and cheek areas.</li>
            <li> Good quality, I like it.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product, used it for several years, but now its tooootally burning my skin and hardly taking off my hair! So frustrating. I used to be able to use the cream twice for 7-8 min each time, but now I can only do 4 min twice and it BURNS and barely takes hair off that it used to take off. Not sure if my face/skin/hair has changed or the product has changed their formula. But it&#x27;s a real bummer. As I type, I have redness and itchy pain. Not okay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this the first time I used it, but after the second and third use, it&#x27;s become more effective. So, I&#x27;d advise anyone to give it a chance if it doesn&#x27;t work the first time, especially considering the relatively low price compared to other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have what I&#x27;d call medium-thickness hair and I leave it on for the maximum amount of time (eight minutes). I also apply a pretty generous layer. This removes pretty much all the hair - there might be one or two little ones left over, but that&#x27;s easy enough to pluck.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for removing facial hair that I have use.  It is quick and easy to use - leave on for 5 minutes and rinse off and comes with a great soothing moisturising cream.  Definitely recommend it even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got mine at walmart, but I wanted to leave a review. This stuff is amazing. People are complaing of smell. So when you put chemicals on your face you expect it to smell like roses? It smells kimda like the stuff they use for perms. I am used ot that smell since my mother always got perms. I have an unwanted patch of hair on both sides of my face, sort of like sideburns. My husband jokes sometimes that I am elvis. I was waxing it but it was painful and always created bumps. So now I used this and ALL of the hair came off. That was exactly the kind of results I was looking for. I can live with the smell as long as I am getting rid of the hair without any pain. I love this stuff and I will be buying it regularly. Thank you Sally Hanson!!</li>
            <li> This might work on fine hair, say on cheeks, but I have two stubborn coarser hairs on my chin, and it didn&#x27;t work at all, at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product on four separate occasions to ensure an accurate result and review. After trying this, I did not find it to work for me on any of my attempts. After my first two attempts, I followed the guided steps in one of the reviewers post about waiting the full 8 mins and adding a bit more cream with the same ending result. On this last attempt, I waited until my facial hair was long enough (about 2 cm or so) on both the sides of my mouth and chin. I have sensitive skin and continued to wait the full 8 minutes, and there was maybe 1-2 hairs if any that were gone after wiping the cream off. I will not be making any further attempts to try this and will stick to plucking my facial hair until I can find a product that works for me.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well on &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; chin/upper lip hair. still needed to pluck after.</li>
            <li> I would say i am on the sensitive skin side, ive used sally Hansen facial hair remover before and it burned my skin! But after reading the reviews i decided to try it again (its been years) and this time it worked. I left it on for about 5-6 minutes which is on the longer side, but it took off the hair (side burns, upper lip) i only tried a small section on my upper lip since thats where i had problems before, after about 5 minutes i got a small sensations, (NOT burning) and took it off, no burning, no marks, NO HAIR! feels smooth. Just make sure to use the conditioner, i think that is what helped. I believe this product is different for everyone, but worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s cheap and it lasts for ever! I can&#x27;t wax facial hair because my skin is too sensitive (I&#x27;ve tried ALL types of wax). This works perfectly and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a depilatory for my upper lip for years.  They must have just changed the formula as this one is a little drippy where the former formula stayed where you put it and did not run a little like this one.  Other than that it works quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I like this product..... didn&#x27;t break out or have redness.... it removed the hair on face and arms.....</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll give it two stars, just because--at first--it worked really well. It took out even the darkest, grossest hairs from their roots like butter; it didn&#x27;t burn my face, or leave any sort of weird redness or blisters than anyone else has reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a couple of times of using it, I began to notice that it didn&#x27;t work quite as well anymore. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just got an insanely short shelf-life, or if the hair on my chin/lip (which is totally disgusting, I know) somehow mutated into this Freak Facial Hair and decided to wreak havoc like King Kong in Manhattan (I&#x27;m pretty sure if I look closely, I can see Ann Darrow). It seems to grow back stronger with more numbers, so I think I&#x27;ll try waxing before I end up looking like the wife of Sasquatch.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years but it seems as of the formula is changed and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job anymore. Will look for something else.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm and in 5 minutes for me (I have pretty fine hair). The new smell is much more pleasant than previous versions! And the little lotion is so soothing.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo22FS6EJ29PVG0]]Hello Friends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my video review as well as my radio show review of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Radio Show Link:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.blogtalkradio.com/drafshanhashmi/2014/09/20/review-of-sally-hansen-cream-hair-remover-kit-by-dr-afshan-hashmi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dr.Afshan Hashmi</li>
            <li> At $5, I didn&#x27;t really expect this cream to work. The Nair facial hair remover smelled awful and was twice the price, and although it did the job, I was looking for a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did was a patch test on my inner elbow like the instructions stated, waited 8 minutes and wiped it off- no burning, no redness, nothing. I was thinking; this stuff can&#x27;t possibly remove the black medium-coarse hairs on my upper lip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lo and behold, I applied it to my lip, waited 8 minutes, wiped it off with a damp cloth, and tada! No more mustache! It did start to tingle/burn very very mildly, but nothing like the Nair. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, but it isn&#x27;t super tough either, so I was surprised I could wait the maximum amount of time. Just listen to your face; if it burns, wipe it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more painful/expensive lip waxing for me! :)</li>
            <li> Im kinda disappointed...at first i left it on like the instruction said then i re applied a couple days for 2 mins longer on a different area and it burned my skin....</li>
            <li> Good quality smells a little offensive but it gets the job done. Had no irritation after use.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I did the test prior to using like the instructions said. OK so I tried it on. NOTHING.Just the disgusting smell. OK. So I wait a week try again. My upper was RED and still hairy unfortunately. I&#x27;ll stick with my eyebrow razor instead.&lt;br /&gt;Sad life of a hairy woman. This is why I believe in evolution.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I love it the first time I used it I was just trying it out so I left some hairs still on my face the second time it worked beautifully it did leave every other small hair but I just plugged them out it makes your hairs pretty much just fall out on their own and the results last a while so far its just been a couple of days like 3 or so and I don&#x27;t see any ugly little hairs so far, definitely recommend and absolutely will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this for the peach fuzz that has been on the sides of my mouth, carefully following the directions and and testing the area on my arm a whole day before. No reaction on my arm so I proceeded to put a thin layer on my face and give it 3 minutes. No hair came off with the wet cotton ball, so I washed it off gently, re-applied and waited closer to 8 minutes. When I removed it, most of, but not all, the hair came off, but I had this numb-but-burning sensation all along the sides of my mouth where I had applied the creme. I gently rinsed with cool water, let it air dry and put the little moisturizer creme on that came with the package. The stinging and burning continued so much that by the following morning I had two nasty red scabs from chemical burns! A week later, they are still there and will likely leave some scars for a while. SO EMBARASSING! Not to mention the smell is foul, as others have mentioned. I think I&#x27;ll live with the hair from now on, not worth the pain and damage it did to my skin.</li>
            <li> The stuff has a really strong chemical smell which I&#x27;m sure can&#x27;t mean good things, but it is cheap and does it&#x27;s job pretty well. It hasn&#x27;t yet removed all the hair completely from my lip, but I don&#x27;t dare leave it on longer since my skin got a little red last time. Next, I&#x27;d probably go something more natural or organic. But this stuff is going to last me forever, so it will be awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for facial hair removal and this one works the best for me. It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of hair remover in the past with no problems, although they didn&#x27;t not necessarily remove all the hair I wanted it to.  I used on my chin and carefully read the directions.  I did not rub in, just dabbed on the area I wanted to cover.  You are supposed to leave it in for 3-8 minutes.  Two minutes in it began tingling, but not to bad so left it on.  By three and a half minutes it was burning.  Rinsed it off.  Today my chin is red and raw with little scabs all over it.  So I have a chemical burn and the hair is still there.      I look so bad my teenage daughter refused to go shopping with me even though the focus was new clothes for her.      Run away fast!!!</li>
            <li> It does really remove unwanted hair. It is the only hair remover brand that my wife uses, and stands by</li>
            <li> I loved this product the first few times I used it... My hair didn&#x27;t grown back for weeks and my skin was soft. But I can no longer use this product because it&#x27;s not for sensitive skin and it left my face bright red and I now have terrible acne which I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for months. I would recommend it for people who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> for cost and effort, solid buy. Not the best product in the world but it mostly gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Cream Hair Remover works better than any others used before.  The addition of the after-use skin smoother is terrific.  Highly recommended to all who use this type of product.</li>
            <li> Good product, actually purchased it because I had already tried it from my sister.  Works like magic and takes a short period of time only.  Saves me from having to go back to the dermatologist for facial hair laser which, after over a year&#x27;s worth of scheduled laser, still yields growth anyway.  Definitely a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I was surprised this works.  Years ago I had tried Nair for legs.  It not only didn&#x27;t remove the hair, but left me with a burning rash that lasted for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first noticed the hair along my jawline was growing thicker and longer, I tried waxing.  Waxing works well (and really doesn&#x27;t hurt that much), but you need to let the hair grow out to a 1/4 of inch.  I also tried string tweezing.  That hurts more than waxing, and if you can&#x27;t do it yourself, it is much more costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work.  But it was much more inexpensive than some products I considered, so I gave it a try.  I started with the shortest time recommended and found that didn&#x27;t work.  So I went a minute longer and that was the right time for me.  If I go over 5 minutes I get a burning feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair along my jawline was fairly thick, but the hair itself is fine and blond.  The results could be different for someone with dark hair.  I find I can do this once every 7 to 8 days when the hair is just starting to reemerge.</li>
            <li> Love this product; I use it to exfoliate my lower face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me clear, especially in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 1st time purchasing it from Amazon (Much better price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product back in April to get rid of the hair above my lip and it worked perfectly! The only thing is that you might want to leave the stuff on the area for about five minutes instead of 2, because then it won&#x27;t remove all the hair. Also this is NOT A PERMANENT FIX. I recommend  to use this with the bleaching cream. Other than that I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is really gentle on your face. I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about any hair removal creams, until I tried this one. I have very blonde hairs on the top parts of my eyebrows and in between.I never want to shave them or wax them and have a mess of hair grow back. I try to ignore them but when you apply make up, you see them sometimes. I applied the cream as directed and within the three minute mark, my stubborn baby hairs were gone. I love how smooth it was. There was no irritation or burning feeling at all. The after cream was so soothing and silky. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased my tube at Walgreens about a year ago, and it&#x27;s about half way full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, apply it thickly, let it sit and wipe down with toilet paper or a soft washcloth. Voil&amp;aacute;! Hair free lip. Generously apply the calming liquid and don&#x27;t wash it off (say with soap and water or facial cleanser) or sweat, else it&#x27;ll sting and burn. Don&#x27;t skip the liquid! If you do need to wash your face, avoid the area that you just depilated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: DON&#x27;T MIX THIS SYSTEM WITH ANOTHER DEPILATOR. IT WILL TURN RED, STING AND BURN. I know from experience.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of facial hair and have always bleached it over the years, but you can still see&lt;br /&gt;my hair in the sunlight or in certain angles. After much consideration, I decided to take a chance and buy a hair removal. I was really scared and apprehensive because I read so many mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I did it. It worked great on my skin and it removed all my hair. I did leave it on for 8 min and wiped it off immediately after. My skin felt tingly afterward, but that&#x27;s to be expected. My advice would be to try a little spot on your face and see how your skin reacts to it. I think this product is great and inexpensive! I wish I would have done this 15 years ago!</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> I have some really coarse dark hairs on my chin and also a mostly blonde mustache. I used this for the first time yesterday on my chin (after doing the patch test and waiting 24 hours) and it worked very well. I left it on for 5 minutes only - next time I&#x27;ll leave it on a little longer. Today I used it on my upper lip - also leaving it on for 5 minutes. I have somewhat sensitive skin, so I was a little nervous, but so far all I notice is a slight tingling - no redness. So it works for me and I will continue using it. So much better than waxing or tweezing!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local grocery store and was super excited about being able to remove the hair on my upper lip at home! I followed the direction to the dot and left the cream on as directed. When I went to wipe it off, I had the most extreme burning pain. The stupid cream ripped off all the skin on my upper lip!!! I went to my doctor who told me it was a severe skin burn and I had to put burn cream on it as well as take antibiotics for a week. I now have a nice scar on my upper lip. NEVER EVER EVER will I use an over the counter product on my lip again! I am back to getting it waxed professionally. STAY AWAY</li>
            <li> I have used several different methods of hair removal (different creams, tweezers, and waxing) and this Sally Hansen Cream is what I always return to.  It is low odor, very easy to use, and does not leave my face red. It also does not burn like most facial hair removal creams have done for me.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it worked great. The second time it hardly removed any hair. Third time it started to burn after 3 minutes and didn&#x27;t remove any hair. Gave it one last try tonight, it started to burn the second I put it on. Removed it immediately and am left with a terrible chemical burn on my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cheap and terrible product.</li>
            <li> It hearts my fingers. The chemistry burn is terrible! Even if you are not a sensitive skin, you still cannot keep them on your skin more than 8 minutes!! Taking care of your fingers while you are putting them on your legs or other parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried it twice, this time leaving the creme on a bit longer in hope of better results. No such luck! I&#x27;d say this removes maybe 50% of my facial hairs - it&#x27;s better on thinner hair above my lip, but worse on mid-range hairs between my eyebrows and on/under my jawline, and barely removed any hairs from my mole at all. I bought Sally Hansen because I thought it was a brand I could trust: I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT. It is painless (unless you have a cut obviously) BUT IT WORKS AMAZINGLY! Love this, and will definitely buy it again when I run out! RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> This product is awful.  I am a 36 year-old woman, and bought it to remove the hair on my upper lip and my sideburns.  I applied it as directed yesterday morning, and left it on my upper lip for approximately 4 minutes (max time is supposed to be 8 minutes) and then wiped it off.  Not only did it not remove all the hair, but it burned my skin terribly.  As soon as I wiped it off, I began to experience a burning sensation.  My face burned all day yesterday, to the point that each time my nose began to run I flinched in pain.  During the night last night my skin blistered up, and I awoke to several scabs all around my upper lip.  I have a professional job, and going to work in that state was quite embarrassing for me.  I will say that the product worked on my sideburns okay, for whatever reason, but the area above my upper lip was much too sensitive for these chemicals.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Once a week keeps me from sprouting a mustache like a man. What more could I ask. If a single application doesn&#x27;t do the trick for you, don&#x27;t worry about it. Put yourself on a schedule. After you&#x27;ve used it regularly for awhile the strays should succumb.</li>
            <li> I had to apply this 3 times before it removed facial hair. It&#x27;s easy enough to use, but it didn&#x27;t work well. I will trust a professional from now on--more expensive but a better outcome.</li>
            <li> This worked much better than I had hoped. I have used it twice so far. The first time I was nervous so I didn&#x27;t leave it on too long, but it worked pretty well. a few weeks later I used it again, this time I left it on for the full recommended time. It worked perfectly. There was no burning, no redness, and no irritation at all. This was a few weeks ago and my face is still hair free. I really only had light peach fuzz to begin with, so I don&#x27;t know how it works on courser hair.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and of course being excited to use it I ripped it open and used it as soon as I brought it inside. For the past year or so I&#x27;ve noticed hair on my upper lip that just looked so unattractive to me and i was always not sure what to do about it because I knew once I got rid of it, I would have to keep up with it. So I finally went with this and followed the directions as thorougly as i could and the end results were GREAT! I only left it on for about 5 minutes and most of the hair came off! I need to do it again tomorrow morning cause there is a little bit of hairs that were missed on the sides of my mouth but other than that I am very happy with the results. I completely recommend this product to those who are struggling with upper lip hair or other facial hair issues especially if you do not have sensitive skin. Works great, fast, and has amazing results in only 5 minutes. Plus the redness went away within about an hour.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and your face will be hairless for about 2 weeks. Used it on my friend with sensitive skin loved the results.</li>
            <li> Good product does what it says it will do. I will gladly tell others about how good it works. Thanks</li>
            <li> I know people who have tried other products, and gotten horrible rashes.  I have never had a problem, and always have great results.  When my Sister-in-law got a rash that lasted for several weeks from another brand, I gave her a box of Hansen for the face, and told her to follow the instructions.  Now, she loves it, too.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but unfortunately for me, if you are an idiot you may burn half your face off along with your hair like I did. I don&#x27;t recommend rubbing at your face if you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> This was the best remover I&#x27;ve tried.  Way less odor than some of the others.  Goes on smooth and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Really works.  But it smells and if you leave too long it burns the skin.</li>
            <li> Would rate 0 stars If I could, worse product my face texture changed ever sense i used this product one time and threw it out.</li>
            <li> Tthis product does remove hair, and at first I was really impressed with the product when I tried it last week. I followed the instructions and left it on for 5 minutes since my hair is thicker, and the process was painless. However, when I applied the aftercare lotion, my face started stinging, even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. The tingling eventually went away, so I thought it was all good.&lt;br /&gt;A few hours later, though, I touched my face to feel how smooth my newly hairless face was, but it was actually prickly! Looking closely in a mirror, I could see that there was hair where I applied the product, but they were very very short hairs, so either the product only removed the hair on the surface of my skin, or the hairs were already growing back. You could barely see the hairs unless looking super closely, but they were there and it felt like I just shaved my face.&lt;br /&gt;The areas where I applied the product became kinda oily, which is weird for me because I have dry/combination skin. Even after a few days, my face was like that. When I would put on makeup, even after powdering, my makeup wouldn&#x27;t stay on where I had the product and I would look oily after a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;Today, I decided to give it another try. The hairs didn&#x27;t grow back like before, but my face is even more oily and makeup won&#x27;t stay on my face. And the actual hair remover didn&#x27;t hurt my face, but the aftercare lotion stung my face like hell and it still hurts. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this product again once I run out (I mean I spent money on this, so I&#x27;m not gonna waste it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying that this will happen to everyone, since everyone has different skin, and I bet it works fine for some people, but beware of the aftercare lotion, especially those of you who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a mix of peach fuzz and a some thicker hairs on my chin, which is frustrating since I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used other creams which have worked, but they left my face red and irritated so I wanted something milder. This cream removed some of the peach fuzz, but left the majority of the hair. In fact, removing the fuzz just made the thicker hairs stand out even more. It made it slightly easier to pluck, but the whole point of this product is to remove all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably give it a few more tries before I give up on it entirely.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this hair removal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a start, my skin is somewhat delicate, so as instructed I tested the cream on my inner elbow initially with no unusual discomfort or redness. Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then applied it to the first target area on my face and let it set the full eight minutes using a soft washcloth to massage the cream gently in the direction of my hair growth being a little surprised even the fairly coarse hairs began to vanish right in front of me. I continued using the washcloth until no more product was visible on my face and the cloth appeared clean, and then used a wet one to wipe away any hidden residue from my face to be thorough. Afterwards, both areas where I applied it were smooth while the process left only very minor redness- I suspect friction-related- with no discomfort at all. I did finish up by washing my entire face with water and applying the soothing agent they included in the kit to keep my skin calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream&#x27;s smell is not at all noxious or overpowering but will not be mistaken for a perfume. The trick is to ensure you wash your face thoroughly after your hair is removed and refresh it with the soothing lotion. This worked wonderfully for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Sally Hansen hair removal cream did the job better than I even hoped, considering I tasked it with removing some thicker hair and gave my skin a pretty good scrubbing in the process. And, still, my face came out unscathed. I think this a fine package deal too, cheaper than other options, and I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it as needed.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use this instead of getting waxed! It can burn a little bit if you leave it on too long. The after care lotion does help a lot! And yeah, it doesn&#x27;t really smell all that great, but it does smell better than a lot of the other, less effective products out there! Also, don&#x27;t use this right before you need to be absolutely presentable - your face may be a little red afterwards for awhile!</li>
            <li> Have tried other products, Surgicare for one, and this seems to work better and faster. The soothing aloe finishing cream is a nice touch,</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is harmful to your skin. It literally burned the skin off of my face and did absolutely NOTHING to remove hair. Not only do I still see hair but now I have an ugly scab on my chin. I do not have sensitive skin so I didn&#x27;t do the test that they recommend. So, if your goal is to burn the skin right off of your face then, yes, this is the stuff for you. Honestly, I think this product should be removed from the shelves.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for years to remove blonde peach fuzz from my jawline.  It is easy to use and gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> ouch! It used to be my saving grace but now it burns the center of my top lip and still leaves hair. The formula must have changed so I guess this is the last time I&#x27;ll be using it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product removed SOME of my hair and it left my upper lip red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the spot test on my inner elbow as suggested and waited 24 hours; my skin showed no signs of irritation so I decided to go ahead and try it on my upper lip and chin area. I let the cream sit for the full 8 minutes; I then wiped off the creme with a warm wash cloth. Some of the hairs came off, but I could still see hair on my face and chin! After I removed all the cream and touched my face, I could still feel hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. I was really hoping that this product would leave me feeling smooth for weeks.  After using this product (and after my skin was no longer irritated), I had to go back over the treated areas with a small facial trimmer. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add: I&#x27;m am african american woman with coarse hair. I mention that because Im aware that some hair remover products dont work well on coarse hair; this cream MAY be one of those products, but the instruction pamphlet didn&#x27;t mention whether or not the coarseness of your hair mattered.</li>
            <li> I use this every week. Ten minutes on, then wipe off with soft warm wet washcloth. Apply cream. No burn, and no little hairs that glisten in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying any of these products are dangerous and if you use them cautiously they will work well. I have dark coerce hair on my upper lip and my chin and I use this between my eyebrows so there is less plucking. When I first used it on my chin I could only leave it on for about three minutes and then had too wash it off. As soon as this product starts to tingle or feel like it is stinging wash it off immediately or you will get a burn. Most face skin is very sensitive and needs to be \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;. On my upper lip I have to leave this on a little longer than it says for it to be effective. But my chin I have to be careful it doesn&#x27;t burn and can only leave it on for a shorter time. I then take a tissue and wipe it hard to pull the hair off. I know it says not to do this but it is the only way it comes off. Then I wash it with soap and water and apply the cream that comes with it. I normally have a couple of white heads pop up a couple days after but this has lessened the more I use it. For the price and the ease of buying it at your local Walmart this is one of the better products there. You can always go to a beauty store but who has the time.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my mother and she loves it! She is 50 years old and little hairs grow around her chin, upper lip and between eyebrows sometimes. After the first few uses, they weren&#x27;t there anymore! She said it felt good on her face and she felt it working, and din&#x27;t experience any pain or discomfort that she felt using other products in the past that do the same thing. This product works, it is effective, and very inexpensive! It should last for at least a couple of weeks. I will be purchasing this product again and again!! Highly recommend !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I put Vaseline on my face prior to putting this thing on my face (1 inch or so beyond the field of application). Cream goes on next..left it on for 8-9 mins. Wipe off face with cotton square. Wash face then apply rosewater and aloe/hydrating mask. No burning. Done.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair remover cream for my upper lip and chin,i decided to get the sally hansen cream i love it gets the job none i don&#x27;t have to be pulling hair from my chin every day any more.I use it once a week so my face it always nice and hair free,will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because the last hair removal creme I bought didn&#x27;t work, but I was amazed at how well this product worked! It only missed a few (2 or 3) small hairs but I probably did not dab enough creme on those areas. This product is amazing, if you&#x27;re not sure if you should get it or not GO FOR IT! You won&#x27;t regret it, and the after creme really soothes your skin and smells great! I&#x27;m in love. &lt;3</li>
            <li> Not the same formula as my last sally Hansen cream hair remover. It is thinner and doesn&#x27;t remove hair nearly as well. Will not be using :(</li>
            <li> I give 5 stars.  Pretty sensitive skin but left on 10 minutes.  Removed with warm terry style wash cloth.  No redness, hair gone.  This is second round.  Was about 6 weeks between treatments.  I was using Olay&#x27;s product.  But I can buy almost 3 Hansen kits for what 1 Olay cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for an efficient facial hair remover for a long long time and this is it!After many chemical burns,laser treatments and waxing I&#x27;ve found the cheapest and best product for facial hair removal thanks to amazon.For me personally,this worked a 100% -especially on my coarse and thick chin hair which none of the creams I tried in the past has been able to get rid of.I used it for around 8minutes with some redness which is already fading. I&#x27;m  definitely getting loads more of these for sure! To all the women with hirsutism-this works!!</li>
            <li> I have tried it twice...following the directions explicitly and leaving it on for the full 8 minutes. Nothing left except the hair I started with and the bad smell. Back to razors I guess as waxing is just too painful.</li>
            <li> So I was at my sisters this weekend and she comes out and has what I thought was nair on her face. I roll my eyes and tell her to buy wax strips, they&#x27;re better and faster. She tells me how they hurt and she hates the pain. So, on a whim, I decided to try this cream. I needed to wax and was away from home so I figured it couldnt hurt. This stuff was amazing! I put it on for the full 8 minutes and wiped down very slowly with a slightly damp cloth and the hair just melted away. In the past I experimented with nair and it was awful. From the rash to the smell to the fact that it didn&#x27;t work. It was horrible. This stuff didn&#x27;t smell bad and left a small rash for less than 5 minutes. I&#x27;ve been using hair removers since I was 13, so it&#x27;s been 17 years. In terms of cream, this was the best. I usually prefer the wax strips by sally hansen, but this was better. No pain, all reward :)</li>
            <li> I have to spead this on about 3 times for it to remove a lot of the hair and it still doesn&#x27;t take it all off!</li>
            <li> Scarred upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;Darken my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Follow directions.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t indicate that it cause skin to darken.&lt;br /&gt;Removed hair .&lt;br /&gt;Now I have too lighten my skin to get it back to brown .</li>
            <li> GENTLY DISOLVES THE HAIR WITHOUT ANY BURNING OR IRRITATION. LEAVES THE FACE SMOOTH AND WITHOUT DISCOLORATION. THE MOISTURIZER IS SOOTHING AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> As opposed to other cream removers I&#x27;ve tried, this one works.</li>
            <li> Great upper lip hair removal creme! I&#x27;ve always threaded or waxed my upper lip, this was until I saw the creme remover kit on sale. I figured I would give it a try, after about 4 months I&#x27;ve used it twice! This beats painful threading and waxing, at half the cost and regrowth time!!! I definitely recommend using this creme remover</li>
            <li> Very smelly and barely removes any hair. Will be looking for a different hair removal solution.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Use it all the time. Absolutely would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times and have been very pleased. This time my new tube is not working as expected. I could leave the product on for days and it won&#x27;t remove any hair. Maybe the manufacturer changed the formulation or maybe I got a bad tube, either or, I am changing brands. I am disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it works well, however, it is more effective when you first purchase it. Do not leave it on for more than 4 minutes when the product is new. After you&#x27;ve had it a while, you will find it takes a little longer to work than 4 minutes. This is just my personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other facial hair removers, but this works the best. It has been over 4 months since i started using it and I don&#x27;t regret any purchase that I have made. I use it for my upper lip, It only takes four-eight minutes and eliminates all the hair. I have a sensitive skin and I have not seen any negative effects. With the price, I highly believe that this is one of the best Hair remover in the market.</li>
            <li> So far unbelievably this has not broken me out once and I have very sensitive skin when it comes to hair remover.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have extremely sensitive skin. So sensitive that I can&#x27;t get my eyebrows waxed and even if my face is itchy and I scratch it, my nail marks will be on my face. Horrible! . I tested a small patch on my inner arm to see if I was irritated and then my neck to see if I was irritated. But nothing!! No red marks.  So basically I put this on my face s thin layer and don&#x27;t rub it in. Then I wait 8minutes and take it off with a wet washcloth. I remove it with a little pressure so I can see the hair coming off. It&#x27;s awesome It really works believe me but then again everything works different for different people! Just try it it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li> I got this because it is cheaper than going to a salon, every two \\&quot;ish\\&quot; weeks. I use it on my upper lip, and knew it worked because my mom let me use some of hers! So, the only I notice is I have to \\&quot;cake\\&quot; it on, really put quit a bit on my lip, then wait a little longer than suggested, but it does the trick!</li>
            <li> I ordered it and then next thing you knew, it was here! And it works PERFECTLY! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The seal was broken. Had a bad smell to it. It looks likenitnwas used before. No way I even used it.</li>
            <li> I used this for years and had no complaints or problems. The tube lasted a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I bough another on here and this product has changed and is horrible. The cream is now very thin, so coverage is not good. It does not remopve the hair. I have repeated the process until my skin was burnt, and still hair remained. The tube of cream being so thin (liquidy) does not last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am tired of products changing for the worst. If something is good and works, why do they change it? If you buy it, you will be buying much more often that you would have when the product was good....maybe that is why it changed. They woun&#x27;t see me buying it again.....and I use to love it.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, but it does the job without irritating my skin. I&#x27;d recommend following the instructions exactly to prevent any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well. I have to use quite allot more than I expected but it beats the heck out of getting my upper lip waxed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove any hair even after the maximum allowed time on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same product before I even thought about checking reviews. The lower rated reviews seem to be consistent in that sensitive skin users have had a bad reaction. Like any skin topical, it&#x27;s always smart to do a test spot before lathering it on. I have always had sensitive skin, so I did the test strip on my arm first, had no reaction, and I&#x27;ve continued to use it whenever necessary since. This has been a very consistent hair remover product with little to no ingredient changes, so it&#x27;s been great always having this as a go-to product! It&#x27;s very important to not rub it in like you would lotion, but gently place it on the skin with a decent amount of cream. A thin layer will hardly sink into the follicles, as it&#x27;s cream is a heavier consistency. It&#x27;s all about finding what works best with your hair though, sometimes I need it on longer than other times.</li>
            <li> This product burn my skin I just put thee minutes, I dont recomend this product the better way is do wax</li>
            <li> I had never used any sort of facial hair removal before buying this.  I have quite a thick layer of fine, clearish &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; all over my lower face and along my hairline, jawline, and upper lip  and have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it worked REALLY FAST.  THE MOST POPULAR FAVORABLE REVIEW SAYS TO LEAVE IT ON THE FULL 8 MINS.  DO NOT DO THIS!!!  Follow the directions and remove a small section after only TWO MINUTES.  In that very short time, it worked.  It removed ALL my hair-totally in 2-3 mins.  I did the test on my inner elbow for the 8 mins and had no reaction or stinging whatsoever.  I went ahead and applied it to my face and checked after 2 mins.  I could see some hairs on the cotton ball, but they were hard to spot and it was difficult to tell if it really removed all the hair on that spot, but it looked like it.  I went ahead quickly removed it with a textured washcloth and cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO GLAD I did this.  Even after only being on for 2 mins, I had a stinging, burning sensation~ especially along my upper lip and the areas it had been on the longest.  This lasted for about half a day.  I did not get any redness or blistering, but had I left it on for 8 minutes, I can&#x27;t imagine what would have happened.  I rinsed over and over with very, very cold water.  It helped ease the stinging.  I also put on some Aloe based sunburn lotion to help sooth it.  It was not unbearable, just annoying and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 5 stars because it did remove all my hair so fast.  If you follow the directions exactly, and perhaps do a small test spot on your face before doing your whole face you should avoid any of the horror stories of people who burn themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside the elbow test did not work at all.  Even after 8 minutes, I felt nothing at all, and when I removed it, there was no stinging like on my face after only 2 mins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for two years now and it was working just fine. However the last couple of times I tried using it above my upper lip, I&#x27;ve been getting zero results and BURNS. Painful, noticeable burns! I don&#x27;t know why, though :(</li>
            <li> I left the cream on for 4 minutes and then wiped it off with a damp cotton ball, followed by a wet wash cloth. The product took most of the hair off of my upper lip, leaving a few matted hairs that I then plucked. I have sensitive skin, and it did not make me break out with a rash or acne. The after lotion smelt relatively nice, and seemed to calm the tight feel a bit, but probably isn&#x27;t necessary. I definitely prefer this over Nair products and over waxing!</li>
            <li> Yes is works. But it also burned my upper lip somewhat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping for the facial hair on my upper lip and chin to disappear and it did work on my chin, but not so much on my upper lip. Although the hair on my upper lip wasn&#x27;t visible, I could still roughness meaning it didn&#x27;t necessarily remove it all. I also felt burns on both my chin and upper lip and after a few minutes, I noticed a small dot of blood on the left side of my upper lip and then an hour later, the entirety of my upper lip showed redness. It&#x27;s evident to say I will not be purchasing or even reusing it.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me. It left a few thicker, darker hairs behind which i plucked, no big deal. I left it on for about five minutes before wiping it off, and there was still a few fuzzies left behind. so i wiped it all off (i&#x27;d already reached a point of no return) and washed with water before applying another layer. I left that one on for a few more minutes before wiping it off.  All in all i probably left it on for 10 minutes combined- the directions say to leave it on for no more than 8 minutes, which would explain my irritation. I then put on the extrasmooth aftercare lotion, which stung the irritated spots for just a second before cooling and moisturizing the areas i speak i can&#x27;t stop touching the area, because it is so smooth! this would probably work best on fine to medium hair, not the best for coarse hair. and definitely bide by the directions, keep it at or under 8 minutes, and it should work perfectly. Definitely less pain than waxing!</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It works very quickly.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and they said did not work. I suggested to use a few times and then see if it would work as it always helped me.</li>
