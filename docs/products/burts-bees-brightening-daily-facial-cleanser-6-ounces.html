            <li>I love this moisturizer!!  </li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are amazing!</li>
            <li>It has a fruity smell which was pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It faded the acne scars I had just under my eyes and even did a good job minimizing some of the under eye puffiness</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good fragrance</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is good stuff</li>
            <li>It does not look good without makeup over it, unless you like the look of a shiny face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells divine, but that doesn&#x27;t surprise me coming from Burt&#x27;s Bees as all of their products smell so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how good my complexion looks after using this!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- nice citrus scent (pleasant though I would prefer no-scent at all)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer, feels good going on.  </li>
            <li>Nice lotion, smells good.</li>
            <li>I love this face Cream!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off - I LOVE the smell!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>i love burts bees products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizing cream, but for $16 it better do everything it claims, not just part of it.</li>
            <li>though this might be a nice change of pace.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are upfront and honest about their ingredients and quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A nice general-purpose moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think this will fill the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t say if the lighter skin is their own or not, he he.  </li>
            <li>I have used their lip gloss before and liked that a lot too.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of a pump, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Good texture, nice scent (light lemon-y).  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent, VERY strong, like a mix of marshmallows and orange cream-cycle ice-cream bars.</li>
            <li>comes in a pump dispenser which makes it very easy to control portion</li>
            <li>It smells good, goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very good most especially on sensitive skin like mine :)</li>
            <li>Good product with bold claims.</li>
            <li>I love the pump style dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Love Burts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months, and my acne scars have faded almost to invisibility, and my skin is a wonderful milky white.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month now, and I will update this review if I see more gradual</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light as well, smells a bit like lemon and a bit like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This product smells fabulous and applies nicely ...</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I am devoted to their Orange Essence Face wash, so</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>I do, however, love it for a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this face cream.</li>
            <li>and my skin is noticably brighter and more even.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve always enjoyed most Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packaged in a pump -- and you may find that the pump dispenses more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I just make sure to not get any on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The pump puts out more than I need on one press-down</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I have tried SO many facial regimens, searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>I have been a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan for many years, so was really glad to see this product turn up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>and it does seem to be doing what it states. :-)  </li>
            <li>I also love the scent.</li>
            <li>(isn’t that ALWAYS the way when after years and years you finally find something that works perfectly for you).</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the smoothness and smell as it goes on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the intensive hydration face cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the cleanser and the toner; I&#x27;ll write a separate review for those.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, since it is Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>You are not going to find a better product for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>If you want to read more about what I thought of this product, you can check out my blog here: hub.me/agy0d</li>
            <li>This is a nice, light lotion with a pretty scent and a pleasant feel.</li>
            <li>Packaging easy to use, nice fragrance, absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>but it feels great on and have high hopes it will fade my sun</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into your skin, which I love!</li>
            <li>This product would probably work best for people with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a huge proponent of Burt&#x27;s Bees for years, and I love their Radiance Day Lotion.</li>
            <li>I can feel it sitting on my face, making my skin feel even oilier than normal (and that is even after allowing it to absorb in for a good 15-30 mins and then applying a pore mattifying lotion on top of it)&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Has been working great for me so far.</li>
            <li>every where else) and this wasn&#x27;t too greasy and it absorbed nicely into my skin and the dispensing system</li>
            <li>Also, I DO think--though I haven&#x27;t used it for eight full weeks yet, and I&#x27;ll update once I have--that this moisturizer HAS helped even out my skin tone!</li>
            <li>Just ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li>it is the kind you just push on (like the one on a hairspray bottle), and the kind I personally am most likely to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started see some mild results after about 6 weeks about more noticeable results after about 14 weeks.</li>
            <li>This face cream is light, goes on smoothly, and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>It faded discolorations, evened out my skin tone, brightened my face and made my skin feel super soft and it did all of this for a great price.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it has a really great smell for a moisturizing cream - it&#x27;s not too strong, just light and airy, and it appeals to me personally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural/floral/lemony but light and not obtrusive</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li>That would make them more useful.</li>
            <li>Amazing, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin which is why I thought this would be a good product to use.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have asthma and granted, am probably more sensitive to strong scents more so than others, but the strong smell is a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li>Even without any significant brightening effects I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li>Have noticed a significant difference in just 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This cream has a nice light texture and I love the scent, better than all of the other creams that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and have very sensitive skin (turns red and scars easily).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh and not too strong.</li>
            <li>Taste good, not suitable for oily skin, but the moisture is good, worthy of recommendation</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a month of twice-daily use, it hasn&#x27;t been the most effective solution for dark spots, though it has more of a brightening effect than some higher-priced products.</li>
            <li>Very good facial moisturizer for normal skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks bright when immediately applied, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Nice to know that it is all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>so not the full 8 weeks yet.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this moisturizer is no different.</li>
            <li>but I knew it will take more than a couple of weeks to lighten as much as I want.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance was light and fresh, something floral.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since using their products, as someone with dry, sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been continually impressed with performance and value.</li>
            <li>I love the lemony fragrance and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a nice overall moisturizer, it&#x27;s light and it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores at all or made me break out.</li>
            <li>Mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is potent, and I really dislike it sitting right under my nose.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I made an exception for this lotion because I really love it.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused my skin to break out any more than it normally would.</li>
            <li>The cream is a refreshing moisturizer and the fragrance is fresh and healthy and not feminine - so men definitely can use this also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin and are looking for a product that will give your skin a healthy, even appearance, then this might work for you as well.</li>
            <li>think this one is a winner, and a great option for anyone who loves Olay Total Effects but wants to go more natural.</li>
            <li>also felt that the delivery pump requires a learning curve--the first time I used it I got a gigantic blob, so much so that I had to look at the bottle again to make sure it wasn&#x27;t, in fact, a body lotion.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and supple through most of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 3/4/2015: Still using this product a year later, and I have it on Subscribe &amp; Save now because I love it!  </li>
            <li>Ummmmmm, i think the texture is a little bit too thick(creamy) for me, it is not sticky but it doesn&#x27;t go on easily on my face, it would be much better if it is more like a lotion</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling quite oily after the cleanser and toner make it feel crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>I tend to have oily skin with breakouts, but am more sensitive to drying out in the winter.  </li>
            <li>far as the brightening aspect of this product&#x27;s claims, I do feel that my skin tone is more even looking while using this, but not drastically so.  </li>
            <li>It may be a nice light moisturizer for summer but really doesn&#x27;t give enough moisture for winter.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between this and my Olay Total Effects</li>
            <li>I love that it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This skin cream feels really nice and especially at at drugstore price rather than a cosmetic counter price.</li>
            <li>I cannot use any moisturizer on my face that contains SPF at all, or my skin completely freaks out and practically starts spurting even more sebum out like a garden hose.</li>
            <li>I have been sensitive to many, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any obvious changes in my skin, but its a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m still using it is because it the most organic friendly face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and comes in a nice little container.  </li>
            <li>The citrus infusions likely will help, but for real resurfacing and depigmenting age spots, it is probabloy faster an dmore certain to have a good IPL or RF or UP treatment.</li>
            <li>I also love the company values, their products are either 100% natural or very close.</li>
            <li>The feel of this product is kind of heavy, and I didn&#x27;t particularly enjoy the feel of smoothing it on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally scented, smells like flowers, it&#x27;s very mild on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just exactly what i need to correct the discoloration on my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I applied this, I immediately started thinking about Froot Loops cereal... why, you may ask?  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream was the fragrance.</li>
            <li>But for my skin type, I&#x27;ve come to realize I need to use this one only at night, as my skin has been much more oily feeling during the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed especially with their Citrus Facial Scrub, their Orange Essence Facial Cleanser, and the Rosewater Toner.</li>
            <li>really like it!  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could make this better would be if it contained a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Although, Burt&#x27;s Bees products are usually higher priced than the others.</li>
            <li>I have been on a fruitless search for a daily moisturizer for my finicky face ever since my all-time favorite was discontinued</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to forego using this product, which is a pity, because I really liked the way it felt.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and have noticed a difference in my skin tone, and my skin has become much softer!</li>
            <li>Really....I will continue to buy it simply for days when a super light moisturizer is needed.</li>
            <li>Plus this company is environmentally friendly and only uses sustainable natural products, which is all the more reason why you should try this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly devoted Burt&#x27;s Bees user and I was so excited when they finally released a product to help with dark spots.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has done an amazing job at brightening up my skin and dark spots</li>
            <li>I love that they use as many natural ingredients as possible, with this face cream registering a total of 99%</li>
            <li>So strong and sickeningly sweet to me that I cannot wear it under my make-up for fear of other people smelling it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized and super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not super oily, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>This has certainly worked and I also want to try the intensive hydration once done with this.</li>
            <li>Made my pores large</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, but after a minute my face feels tight</li>
            <li>BURT&#x27;S BEES is a company that has been around for quite a while and their other skin products are very fine.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try, but it&#x27;s definitely a heavier, more moisturizing cream - while good for the dry winter weather, I can safely say that I would not be able to use this in the summer without my skin feeling at least a little bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise,</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my skin feel when it has been applied.  </li>
            <li>And finally, I really like the smell-</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;- cream doesn&#x27;t blend as smoothly into the skin as standard moisturizers (like Clinique, Olay, or Ponds), it leaves a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a product for discoloration, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I think the system works really well</li>
            <li>I bought the whole Brightening kit and it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, it does not come close to what my old PERFECT day/daily moisturizer did for my skin, and I am still searching for a replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is very light; much like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, so moisturizing is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>soft right</li>
            <li>I really love it the most for it&#x27;s moisturization, because it has helped keep dry skin at bay during seasonal changes without being heavy, sticky, or pore clogging.</li>
            <li>It is a very light and non greasy moisturizer with a slight glow to it.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a few days but so far its great.  </li>
            <li>My makeup does go on just fine after using, and it doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li>But I appreciate that it&#x27;s 99% natural, and has no fake perfumes or scents.  </li>
            <li>have less acne, it has a nice natural scent, highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s your main concern, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about this particular cream,</li>
            <li>But as far as &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; my skin tone, it hasn&#x27;t really done that either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy, and my skin is not tight or itchy after using.  </li>
            <li>All products are clearly and boldly labeled, &amp;#34;99.5% Natural&amp;#34; or something similar.</li>
            <li>I normally like heavier moisturizers, I live in the desert</li>
            <li>Nice enough for moisturizing, not sure how much impact it has had on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I do feel as if I&#x27;m a little more sensitive for a day or so</li>
            <li>The scent dissipates quickly and doesn&#x27;t linger very long.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>the pump dispenses WAY too much, and I have to be REALLY careful when using it not to push down too much and end up with way more lotion than I need.</li>
            <li>I barely give a half-squirt to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products, and I really wanted to like this one too, but I just can&#x27;t get over the smell.  </li>
            <li>My dry skin absorbed it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just got the product so it is too early to see that miracle aspect, but as for the product and container they live up to the company&#x27;s promises so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned woman in FL so to say I accumulate freckles is an understatement along with the 1 or 2 acne scars I earned as an impatient teen and my skin is combination (oily in T-Zone and dry</li>
            <li>I like the way that it penetrates into your skin feeling soft takes a while to even the tones out</li>
            <li>While it is very drying, especially in the winter months, it does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>how velvety soft my skin feels after I apply the cream.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has evened out my skin tone and diminished the redness while keeping my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My sensisitve skin is extremely sensitive and I often burn with moistirizers used after cleansing, but this moisturizer has never caused any irritation or burning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a mostly natural lotion, but I was still surprised by the color of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>-texture(I have normal-dry skin), i like the natural smell of it, and it does even my skin tone a bit.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and my skin looks even and clear.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother mine at all.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a couple of weeks, so I can&#x27;t really say if the product will diminish spots on my skin, as the product says it may take up to eight weeks for results, applying it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>So far so god.</li>
            <li>has &#x27;natural&#x27; list of ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any issues or breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this pretty much nonstop for a month and a half</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it has a distinct scent, possibly due to the daisy extract advertised on the label.  </li>
            <li>Not offensive or interfering with other scent products, but nothing exciting, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>They use the same home-remedy for lightening skin that has been around since before the original Brady Bunch: lemon juice or other types of citric acid.</li>
            <li>While I was applying it for the first time, I thought it seemed too thick and would leave my skin sticky and oily-looking, but it quickly absorbed and my skin was the softest it&#x27;s ever felt.</li>
            <li>but it doesn hydrate my normal skin enough.  </li>
            <li>I will not be using this product again as I have other moisturizers that are less costly, do not create a reaction, and I do not feel that my skin was &amp;#34;brightened&amp;#34; or more &amp;#34;even toned&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>so it can be hard to find a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, additionally I have some redness and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li>, the container is pretty small compared to the other creams and lotions available.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in dark spots (freckles mostly), but I haven&#x27;t purchased the cream for that specifically, only the other two items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really quite unfortunate because I feel like the other products really are making my skin brighter and more even.</li>
            <li>So you have to push the pump only a little way down to get a more normal amount for facial use.  </li>
            <li>(I started noticing a difference in the general appearance of my skin in about a week).</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb enough during the day, and I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup doesn&#x27;t stay all day like it did with my old daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>In fact, it barely added any texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, using it daily as a NIGHT cream for two months so far, it does have its benefits and has not run out yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it would even out ruddiness and even potentially dark eye circles, but the fine print on the box explains that is \\&quot;a skin brightening agent, helping to reduce the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation\\&quot;</li>
            <li>While I generally use Neutrogena&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil-free moisture for sensitive skin,&amp;#34; occasional forays lead me to try alternatives such as Baxter of California&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil-free moisturizer&amp;#34; and the topic of this review, which is labeled as &amp;#34;brightening</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice an immediate brighter effect, but I am noticing that certain dark spots seem to be getting lighter.</li>
            <li>I also feel that if all my BB creams, powders, concealers, eye shadows and lipsticks already contain SPF, then I can very well do without my moisturizer being loaded down with it, too.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my skin is sensitive, super excessively oily and extremely acne prone.</li>
            <li>I do not consider this a true ‘day’ moisturizer due to it being extremely heavy &amp; non-absorbing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this moisturizer!!  </li>
            <li> amazing!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are amazing!</li>
            <li> It has a fruity smell which was pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It faded the acne scars I had just under my eyes and even did a good job minimizing some of the under eye puffiness</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Good fragrance</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is good stuff</li>
            <li> It does not look good without makeup over it, unless you like the look of a shiny face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells divine, but that doesn&#x27;t surprise me coming from Burt&#x27;s Bees as all of their products smell so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how good my complexion looks after using this!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- nice citrus scent (pleasant though I would prefer no-scent at all)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, feels good going on.  </li>
            <li> Nice lotion, smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this face Cream!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off - I LOVE the smell!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> i love burts bees products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizing cream, but for $16 it better do everything it claims, not just part of it.</li>
            <li> though this might be a nice change of pace.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are upfront and honest about their ingredients and quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A nice general-purpose moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think this will fill the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t say if the lighter skin is their own or not, he he.  </li>
            <li> I have used their lip gloss before and liked that a lot too.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of a pump, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Good texture, nice scent (light lemon-y).  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent, VERY strong, like a mix of marshmallows and orange cream-cycle ice-cream bars.</li>
            <li> comes in a pump dispenser which makes it very easy to control portion</li>
            <li> It smells good, goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Very good most especially on sensitive skin like mine :)</li>
            <li> Good product with bold claims.</li>
            <li> I love the pump style dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Love Burts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months, and my acne scars have faded almost to invisibility, and my skin is a wonderful milky white.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now, and I will update this review if I see more gradual</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and light as well, smells a bit like lemon and a bit like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product smells fabulous and applies nicely ...</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I am devoted to their Orange Essence Face wash, so</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> I do, however, love it for a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this face cream.</li>
            <li> and my skin is noticably brighter and more even.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve always enjoyed most Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packaged in a pump -- and you may find that the pump dispenses more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I just make sure to not get any on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The pump puts out more than I need on one press-down</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I have tried SO many facial regimens, searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> I have been a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan for many years, so was really glad to see this product turn up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> and it does seem to be doing what it states. :-)  </li>
            <li> I also love the scent.</li>
            <li> (isn’t that ALWAYS the way when after years and years you finally find something that works perfectly for you).</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the smoothness and smell as it goes on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the intensive hydration face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the cleanser and the toner; I&#x27;ll write a separate review for those.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, since it is Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> You are not going to find a better product for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> If you want to read more about what I thought of this product, you can check out my blog here: hub.me/agy0d</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light lotion with a pretty scent and a pleasant feel.</li>
            <li> Packaging easy to use, nice fragrance, absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> but it feels great on and have high hopes it will fade my sun</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into your skin, which I love!</li>
            <li> This product would probably work best for people with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge proponent of Burt&#x27;s Bees for years, and I love their Radiance Day Lotion.</li>
            <li> I can feel it sitting on my face, making my skin feel even oilier than normal (and that is even after allowing it to absorb in for a good 15-30 mins and then applying a pore mattifying lotion on top of it)&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Has been working great for me so far.</li>
            <li> every where else) and this wasn&#x27;t too greasy and it absorbed nicely into my skin and the dispensing system</li>
            <li> Also, I DO think--though I haven&#x27;t used it for eight full weeks yet, and I&#x27;ll update once I have--that this moisturizer HAS helped even out my skin tone!</li>
            <li> Just ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li> it is the kind you just push on (like the one on a hairspray bottle), and the kind I personally am most likely to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started see some mild results after about 6 weeks about more noticeable results after about 14 weeks.</li>
            <li> This face cream is light, goes on smoothly, and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> It faded discolorations, evened out my skin tone, brightened my face and made my skin feel super soft and it did all of this for a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a really great smell for a moisturizing cream - it&#x27;s not too strong, just light and airy, and it appeals to me personally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural/floral/lemony but light and not obtrusive</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li> That would make them more useful.</li>
            <li> Amazing, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin which is why I thought this would be a good product to use.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have asthma and granted, am probably more sensitive to strong scents more so than others, but the strong smell is a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li> Even without any significant brightening effects I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a significant difference in just 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This cream has a nice light texture and I love the scent, better than all of the other creams that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and have very sensitive skin (turns red and scars easily).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh and not too strong.</li>
            <li> Taste good, not suitable for oily skin, but the moisture is good, worthy of recommendation</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of twice-daily use, it hasn&#x27;t been the most effective solution for dark spots, though it has more of a brightening effect than some higher-priced products.</li>
            <li> Very good facial moisturizer for normal skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks bright when immediately applied, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Nice to know that it is all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> so not the full 8 weeks yet.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this moisturizer is no different.</li>
            <li> but I knew it will take more than a couple of weeks to lighten as much as I want.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance was light and fresh, something floral.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using their products, as someone with dry, sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been continually impressed with performance and value.</li>
            <li> I love the lemony fragrance and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a nice overall moisturizer, it&#x27;s light and it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores at all or made me break out.</li>
            <li> Mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is potent, and I really dislike it sitting right under my nose.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I made an exception for this lotion because I really love it.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused my skin to break out any more than it normally would.</li>
            <li> The cream is a refreshing moisturizer and the fragrance is fresh and healthy and not feminine - so men definitely can use this also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin and are looking for a product that will give your skin a healthy, even appearance, then this might work for you as well.</li>
            <li> think this one is a winner, and a great option for anyone who loves Olay Total Effects but wants to go more natural.</li>
            <li> also felt that the delivery pump requires a learning curve--the first time I used it I got a gigantic blob, so much so that I had to look at the bottle again to make sure it wasn&#x27;t, in fact, a body lotion.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and supple through most of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 3/4/2015: Still using this product a year later, and I have it on Subscribe &amp; Save now because I love it!  </li>
            <li> Ummmmmm, i think the texture is a little bit too thick(creamy) for me, it is not sticky but it doesn&#x27;t go on easily on my face, it would be much better if it is more like a lotion</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling quite oily after the cleanser and toner make it feel crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> I tend to have oily skin with breakouts, but am more sensitive to drying out in the winter.  </li>
            <li> far as the brightening aspect of this product&#x27;s claims, I do feel that my skin tone is more even looking while using this, but not drastically so.  </li>
            <li> It may be a nice light moisturizer for summer but really doesn&#x27;t give enough moisture for winter.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between this and my Olay Total Effects</li>
            <li> I love that it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This skin cream feels really nice and especially at at drugstore price rather than a cosmetic counter price.</li>
            <li> I cannot use any moisturizer on my face that contains SPF at all, or my skin completely freaks out and practically starts spurting even more sebum out like a garden hose.</li>
            <li> I have been sensitive to many, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any obvious changes in my skin, but its a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m still using it is because it the most organic friendly face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and comes in a nice little container.  </li>
            <li> The citrus infusions likely will help, but for real resurfacing and depigmenting age spots, it is probabloy faster an dmore certain to have a good IPL or RF or UP treatment.</li>
            <li> I also love the company values, their products are either 100% natural or very close.</li>
            <li> The feel of this product is kind of heavy, and I didn&#x27;t particularly enjoy the feel of smoothing it on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally scented, smells like flowers, it&#x27;s very mild on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just exactly what i need to correct the discoloration on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I applied this, I immediately started thinking about Froot Loops cereal... why, you may ask?  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream was the fragrance.</li>
            <li> But for my skin type, I&#x27;ve come to realize I need to use this one only at night, as my skin has been much more oily feeling during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed especially with their Citrus Facial Scrub, their Orange Essence Facial Cleanser, and the Rosewater Toner.</li>
            <li> really like it!  </li>
            <li> The only thing that could make this better would be if it contained a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Although, Burt&#x27;s Bees products are usually higher priced than the others.</li>
            <li> I have been on a fruitless search for a daily moisturizer for my finicky face ever since my all-time favorite was discontinued</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to forego using this product, which is a pity, because I really liked the way it felt.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and have noticed a difference in my skin tone, and my skin has become much softer!</li>
            <li> Really....I will continue to buy it simply for days when a super light moisturizer is needed.</li>
            <li> Plus this company is environmentally friendly and only uses sustainable natural products, which is all the more reason why you should try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly devoted Burt&#x27;s Bees user and I was so excited when they finally released a product to help with dark spots.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has done an amazing job at brightening up my skin and dark spots</li>
            <li> I love that they use as many natural ingredients as possible, with this face cream registering a total of 99%</li>
            <li> So strong and sickeningly sweet to me that I cannot wear it under my make-up for fear of other people smelling it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moisturized and super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not super oily, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> This has certainly worked and I also want to try the intensive hydration once done with this.</li>
            <li> Made my pores large</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, but after a minute my face feels tight</li>
            <li> BURT&#x27;S BEES is a company that has been around for quite a while and their other skin products are very fine.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try, but it&#x27;s definitely a heavier, more moisturizing cream - while good for the dry winter weather, I can safely say that I would not be able to use this in the summer without my skin feeling at least a little bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise,</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my skin feel when it has been applied.  </li>
            <li> And finally, I really like the smell-</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;- cream doesn&#x27;t blend as smoothly into the skin as standard moisturizers (like Clinique, Olay, or Ponds), it leaves a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for a product for discoloration, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think the system works really well</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Brightening kit and it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it does not come close to what my old PERFECT day/daily moisturizer did for my skin, and I am still searching for a replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is very light; much like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, so moisturizing is very important to me.  </li>
            <li> soft right</li>
            <li> I really love it the most for it&#x27;s moisturization, because it has helped keep dry skin at bay during seasonal changes without being heavy, sticky, or pore clogging.</li>
            <li> It is a very light and non greasy moisturizer with a slight glow to it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days but so far its great.  </li>
            <li> My makeup does go on just fine after using, and it doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> But I appreciate that it&#x27;s 99% natural, and has no fake perfumes or scents.  </li>
            <li> have less acne, it has a nice natural scent, highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s your main concern, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this particular cream,</li>
            <li> But as far as &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; my skin tone, it hasn&#x27;t really done that either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy, and my skin is not tight or itchy after using.  </li>
            <li> All products are clearly and boldly labeled, &amp;#34;99.5% Natural&amp;#34; or something similar.</li>
            <li> I normally like heavier moisturizers, I live in the desert</li>
            <li> Nice enough for moisturizing, not sure how much impact it has had on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I do feel as if I&#x27;m a little more sensitive for a day or so</li>
            <li> The scent dissipates quickly and doesn&#x27;t linger very long.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> the pump dispenses WAY too much, and I have to be REALLY careful when using it not to push down too much and end up with way more lotion than I need.</li>
            <li> I barely give a half-squirt to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products, and I really wanted to like this one too, but I just can&#x27;t get over the smell.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin absorbed it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just got the product so it is too early to see that miracle aspect, but as for the product and container they live up to the company&#x27;s promises so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned woman in FL so to say I accumulate freckles is an understatement along with the 1 or 2 acne scars I earned as an impatient teen and my skin is combination (oily in T-Zone and dry</li>
            <li> I like the way that it penetrates into your skin feeling soft takes a while to even the tones out</li>
            <li> While it is very drying, especially in the winter months, it does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> how velvety soft my skin feels after I apply the cream.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has evened out my skin tone and diminished the redness while keeping my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> My sensisitve skin is extremely sensitive and I often burn with moistirizers used after cleansing, but this moisturizer has never caused any irritation or burning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a mostly natural lotion, but I was still surprised by the color of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> -texture(I have normal-dry skin), i like the natural smell of it, and it does even my skin tone a bit.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and my skin looks even and clear.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother mine at all.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple of weeks, so I can&#x27;t really say if the product will diminish spots on my skin, as the product says it may take up to eight weeks for results, applying it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> So far so god.</li>
            <li> has &#x27;natural&#x27; list of ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any issues or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty much nonstop for a month and a half</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it has a distinct scent, possibly due to the daisy extract advertised on the label.  </li>
            <li> Not offensive or interfering with other scent products, but nothing exciting, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> They use the same home-remedy for lightening skin that has been around since before the original Brady Bunch: lemon juice or other types of citric acid.</li>
            <li> While I was applying it for the first time, I thought it seemed too thick and would leave my skin sticky and oily-looking, but it quickly absorbed and my skin was the softest it&#x27;s ever felt.</li>
            <li> but it doesn hydrate my normal skin enough.  </li>
            <li> I will not be using this product again as I have other moisturizers that are less costly, do not create a reaction, and I do not feel that my skin was &amp;#34;brightened&amp;#34; or more &amp;#34;even toned&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so it can be hard to find a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, additionally I have some redness and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> , the container is pretty small compared to the other creams and lotions available.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in dark spots (freckles mostly), but I haven&#x27;t purchased the cream for that specifically, only the other two items.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really quite unfortunate because I feel like the other products really are making my skin brighter and more even.</li>
            <li> So you have to push the pump only a little way down to get a more normal amount for facial use.  </li>
            <li> (I started noticing a difference in the general appearance of my skin in about a week).</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb enough during the day, and I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup doesn&#x27;t stay all day like it did with my old daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In fact, it barely added any texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, using it daily as a NIGHT cream for two months so far, it does have its benefits and has not run out yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of weird.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it would even out ruddiness and even potentially dark eye circles, but the fine print on the box explains that is \\&quot;a skin brightening agent, helping to reduce the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation\\&quot;</li>
            <li> While I generally use Neutrogena&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil-free moisture for sensitive skin,&amp;#34; occasional forays lead me to try alternatives such as Baxter of California&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil-free moisturizer&amp;#34; and the topic of this review, which is labeled as &amp;#34;brightening</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice an immediate brighter effect, but I am noticing that certain dark spots seem to be getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I also feel that if all my BB creams, powders, concealers, eye shadows and lipsticks already contain SPF, then I can very well do without my moisturizer being loaded down with it, too.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my skin is sensitive, super excessively oily and extremely acne prone.</li>
            <li> I do not consider this a true ‘day’ moisturizer due to it being extremely heavy &amp; non-absorbing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the other products from this line (I&#x27;m still finishing up my last bottles of the Naturally Acne Solutions)</li>
            <li> though, it does a decent job of evening skin tone when used a few days in a row.</li>
            <li> It has an awful floral scent - probably the daisies as they aren&#x27;t known to be a nice smelling flower - but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> far as even tone and brightening: I have noticed a difference in the dark spot department.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t address whether it is working to even out my skin tone because I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Very thick but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of many on expensive products, but have never found one that gave me these results.</li>
            <li> Now, I do not yet have age spots, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not it helps with those, but ruddiness and dark eye circles are not due to pigmentation or dark spots, so apparently the evening out and brightening that I was looking for are out of the target claims of this product.</li>
            <li> Very dark, cystic acne marks have gradually lightened, but are still clearly visible after a month now and still require concealer to hide completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream, however, is far too heavy.</li>
            <li> It is thick and my skin looked very shiny and greasy after I applied it.  </li>
            <li> gradually evened out the appearance of my skin color, not perfectly, but significantly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to help with the dry skin I get on my face in the winter.</li>
            <li> During winter weather, my skin feels dry again after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to judge whether or not it&#x27;s making a difference in lightening any dark spots on my face, I have used it faithfully since receiving it.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to a few friends who have reported back to me with the same results...</li>
            <li> Also I found myself with smaller bumps, similar to a very very slight rash, although there was no redness, itching, or flaking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, the back of the dispenser indicates this about the product: &amp;#34;Clinically proven to visibly even skin tone and help diminish the appearance of dark spots and discoloration, 100% of women say brighter skin after using&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in dark spots, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly fond of this fragrance, but it isn&#x27;t so bothersome to me that I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my skin gets very, very dry.</li>
            <li> While the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after application, certain consumers might find its presence objectionable, unnecessary or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smooths on thick but not heavy and bulky--hard to explain if you haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, I certainly didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic changes in my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m notoriously pink cheeked with dark circles under my eyes, a red nose, and otherwise pale Swedish</li>
            <li> The moisturizer has a creamy texture and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> thing about this moisturizer is, a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it four stars as opposed to five due to the stinky smell.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> ; in other words, age spots.  </li>
            <li> This makes me want to check out some of Burt&#x27;s Bees other skin care products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that there is no real long-lasting whole-face brightening effect.</li>
            <li> This cream is somewhat thicker than the Radiance cream but a small amount does seem to go a long way as long as you apply it in firm strokes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if this is because with natural products, the results are not instant or dramatic; rather, they are usually gradual over time.  </li>
            <li> However, I used this product for 30 days and did not see any improvement to the hyperpigmentation on my face due to previous acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About diminishing the dark spots and discoloration...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hide the dark circles under my eyes, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unfortunately after using the whole bottle I have to say that I saw no improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> no noticeable effect on dark spots</li>
            <li> I am gabriella union dark skinned.</li>
            <li> I do have acne scars and some patchy redness that do seem to have faded slightly, but not disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The effect is subtle but the overall tone of my skin has a smoother, cleaner look to it.</li>
            <li> The sunspot on my cheek has not faded even slightly so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product hoping for any lightening effects.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slightly floral, a wildflower type of floral maybe, but it&#x27;s not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd color though (somewhat greyish) which might take some people aback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even wearing less make up now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and a half now...</li>
            <li> It looks less blotchy in coloring.</li>
            <li> minor complaint -</li>
            <li> Also brightens my skin a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pleasant lemony fragrance and creamy oatmeal-colored lotion in this little bottle.  </li>
            <li> Will update this in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t like how heavy and oily this feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Especially as the style of the bottle also makes it impossible to put any back.</li>
            <li> I have a small brown spot on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for the past month</li>
            <li> not sure what ingredient causes my skin to sweat.</li>
            <li> Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream is on the expensive side for moisturizing creams, but it only takes a dab to moisturize my face each morning.  </li>
            <li> I wear heavy makeup and foundation, but this moisturizer didn&#x27;t go on too thick or greasy before my make-up.</li>
            <li> It is in a pump that delivers a small amount of the cream each time, whereas the Radiance is in a glass jar.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they give us only 30 days to review products, so I can&#x27;t say if this worked for me or not.  </li>
            <li> Not sure yet on the tone evening properties.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and greasy, and I am not fond of the scent.</li>
            <li> though I read some negative reviews about that.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least every night, some times twice a</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is saving my skin!</li>
            <li> I just wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> But seriously...</li>
            <li> It is a subtle lemon smell.</li>
            <li> I moved to a dryer state and was desperate to find something that would help with my dry patches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very slow.</li>
            <li> really cold or windy weather, I do find that I need an additional night cream.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works!  That&#x27;s what matters.  All the sun damage spots have faded or are just gone and my skin is an almost uniform shade.</li>
            <li> I love the pump style dispenser.  I love the lemony fragrance and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Using at night. Smells delightful. Seems to be giving my skin a more-even tone. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly devoted Burt&#x27;s Bees user and I was so excited when they finally released a product to help with dark spots. I&#x27;m a fair skinned woman in FL so to say I accumulate freckles is an understatement along with the 1 or 2 acne scars I earned as an impatient teen and my skin is combination (oily in T-Zone and dry every where else) and this wasn&#x27;t too greasy and it absorbed nicely into my skin and the dispensing system works well. I started see some mild results after about 6 weeks about more noticeable results after about 14 weeks. It faded the acne scars I had just under my eyes and even did a good job minimizing some of the under eye puffiness I sometimes struggle with and it lightened up the freckles just under my eyes. I haven&#x27;t used any of the other products from this line (I&#x27;m still finishing up my last bottles of the Naturally Acne Solutions) but I definitely look forward to it!</li>
            <li> I like the way that it penetrates into your skin feeling soft takes a while to even the tones out it&#x27;s very slow.</li>
            <li> Good product but do not see any difference in this and their regular moisturizer</li>
            <li> Very thick but absorbs quickly. Nice to know that it is all natural ingredients. Love Burts</li>
            <li> Notin like this product, was just perfect am so happy. Just exactly what i need to correct the discoloration on my face</li>
            <li> Very good facial moisturizer for normal skin.  Good fragrance and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good most especially on sensitive skin like mine :)</li>
            <li> While it is very drying, especially in the winter months, it does what it advertises.  I try not to use it more than once a week, but the results are startling.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months, and my acne scars have faded almost to invisibility, and my skin is a wonderful milky white.  I do feel as if I&#x27;m a little more sensitive for a day or so after I use it, so be cautious and use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> amazing! I have a small brown spot on my face and I can&#x27;t even see it now and that&#x27;s only after a couple uses at Daisy stuff must work miracles I&#x27;ve seen it in more expensive products Burt&#x27;s Bees is good stuff</li>
            <li> This face cream is light, goes on smoothly, and absorbs easily.  I have been using it at night after cleansing before bed.  I really like how it makes my skin feel when it has been applied.  I tend to have oily skin with breakouts, but am more sensitive to drying out in the winter.  During this winter, when the heaters have been on drying everything out, my skin has stayed moisturized and looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brightening aspect of this product&#x27;s claims, I do feel that my skin tone is more even looking while using this, but not drastically so.  I do have acne scars and some patchy redness that do seem to have faded slightly, but not disappeared.  I&#x27;m wondering if this is because with natural products, the results are not instant or dramatic; rather, they are usually gradual over time.  I have been using it for a month now, and I will update this review if I see more gradual change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied this, I immediately started thinking about Froot Loops cereal... why, you may ask?  I asked myself the same question, especially since I haven&#x27;t had Froot Loops since I was a kid!  Then it dawned on me, that is what this cream smells like!  I&#x27;m not particularly fond of this fragrance, but it isn&#x27;t so bothersome to me that I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/4/2015: Still using this product a year later, and I have it on Subscribe &amp; Save now because I love it!  I do feel like using over time gradually evened out the appearance of my skin color, not perfectly, but significantly.  I really love it the most for it&#x27;s moisturization, because it has helped keep dry skin at bay during seasonal changes without being heavy, sticky, or pore clogging.</li>
            <li> I love this face Cream! It leaves my skin moisturized and super soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I made an exception for this lotion because I really love it. I bought this to help with the dry skin I get on my face in the winter. While I was applying it for the first time, I thought it seemed too thick and would leave my skin sticky and oily-looking, but it quickly absorbed and my skin was the softest it&#x27;s ever felt. It doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily at all.  I think all of my dryness was gone after about 2 or 3 applications. It hasn&#x27;t caused my skin to break out any more than it normally would. And finally, I really like the smell- it&#x27;s fresh and not too strong. I would recommend this to anyone to try.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream was the fragrance. It has a fruity smell which was pleasant and not overpowering. The scent dissipates quickly and doesn&#x27;t linger very long. The moisturizer has a creamy texture and a little goes a long way. My dry skin absorbed it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for the past month and I am pleased with the results. The effect is subtle but the overall tone of my skin has a smoother, cleaner look to it.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer did even out my skin tone and reduce the appears of my dark/sun spots, however it made my skin sweat. It&#x27;s kind of weird. About 5 mins after I would put it on, I would start sweating on my &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; Zone. I started using this just on the target spots instead of all over my face. I&amp;#34;m not sure what ingredient causes my skin to sweat. I do have sensitive skin which is why I thought this would be a good product to use. Although it did help, I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> BURT&#x27;S BEES is a company that has been around for quite a while and their other skin products are very fine. This moisturizing cream is said to brighten the skin and even the appearance. According to the package insert this miracle happens after 8 weeks diurnal use. Just got the product so it is too early to see that miracle aspect, but as for the product and container they live up to the company&#x27;s promises so far. The cream is a refreshing moisturizer and the fragrance is fresh and healthy and not feminine - so men definitely can use this also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About diminishing the dark spots and discoloration...it seems that is asking a lot from a cream that contains Aqua (water, eau), cetyl alcohol, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, tapioca starch, prunus armeniaca (apricot) kernel oil, bellis perennis (daisy) flower extract, leucojum aestivum bulb extract, pearl powder, vaccinium myrtillus fruit extract, citrus medica limonum (lemon) fruit extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fruit extract, citrus medica limonum (lemon) peel oil, saccharum officinarum (sugar cane) extract, acer saccharum (sugar maple) extract, emblica officinalis fruit powder, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, vitis vinifera (grape) seed oil, melissa officinalis leaf extract, chondrus crispus (carrageenan), zea mays (corn) starch, candelilla/jojoba/rice bran polyglyceryl-3 esters, tocopherol, xanthan gum, sucrose, glyceryl stearate, sodium stearoyl lactylate, cetearyl alcohol, alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, sodium PCA, parfum (fragrance), phenoxyethanol, citral, geraniol, limonene, linalool. The citrus infusions likely will help, but for real resurfacing and depigmenting age spots, it is probabloy faster an dmore certain to have a good IPL or RF or UP treatment. But time will tell....Grady Harp, January 14</li>
            <li> This is a nice overall moisturizer, it&#x27;s light and it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores at all or made me break out. The scent is nice and light as well, smells a bit like lemon and a bit like sunscreen. But as far as &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; my skin tone, it hasn&#x27;t really done that either. I&#x27;ve been using this pretty much nonstop for a month and a half and it hasn&#x27;t done anything at all for my ruddy skin tone. It&#x27;s a good moisturizing cream, but for $16 it better do everything it claims, not just part of it.</li>
            <li> Nice enough for moisturizing, not sure how much impact it has had on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> While I generally use Neutrogena&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil-free moisture for sensitive skin,&amp;#34; occasional forays lead me to try alternatives such as Baxter of California&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil-free moisturizer&amp;#34; and the topic of this review, which is labeled as &amp;#34;brightening even-tone moisturizing cream.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it works well as a facial moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your face all shiny.  &#x27;nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it has a distinct scent, possibly due to the daisy extract advertised on the label.  While the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after application, certain consumers might find its presence objectionable, unnecessary or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the back of the dispenser indicates this about the product: &amp;#34;Clinically proven to visibly even skin tone and help diminish the appearance of dark spots and discoloration, 100% of women say brighter skin after using&amp;#34; it.  At the bottom, though, it reads &amp;#34;after 8 weeks of use.&amp;#34;  After two weeks of use, I certainly didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic changes in my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good product with bold claims.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream is on the expensive side for moisturizing creams, but it only takes a dab to moisturize my face each morning.  I like the pump feature which lets me squeeze out only as much as I need, so none is wasted.  The cream has a pearly tone to it but it spreads out and absorbs in without being visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how velvety soft my skin feels after I apply the cream.  I didn&#x27;t notice an immediate brighter effect, but I am noticing that certain dark spots seem to be getting lighter. (I should use it on the back of my hands for those sun spots, too.)  It doesn&#x27;t hide the dark circles under my eyes, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In really cold or windy weather, I do find that I need an additional night cream.  During winter weather, my skin feels dry again after I wash my face.  Warmer days are changing that, thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the velvety feel of this cream, its lightening features, and its moisturizing effects.  I just wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> This product smells fabulous and applies nicely ...unfortunately after using the whole bottle I have to say that I saw no improvements in my skin. It may be a nice light moisturizer for summer but really doesn&#x27;t give enough moisture for winter. The sunspot on my cheek has not faded even slightly so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product hoping for any lightening effects. Really....I will continue to buy it simply for days when a super light moisturizer is needed.</li>
            <li> I am 33 and I have been using Olay Total Effects Daily Moisturizer for probably for over 10 years now.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I am devoted to their Orange Essence Face wash, so I though this might be a nice change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off - I LOVE the smell!  It&#x27;s natural/floral/lemony but light and not obtrusive and it&#x27;s gone as soon as the lotion is rubbed in.  It&#x27;s very creamy, and my skin is not tight or itchy after using.  It&#x27;s also not super oily, which is nice.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between this and my Olay Total Effects Daily Moisturizer from a day-to-day use and moisturization stand point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this one is a winner, and a great option for anyone who loves Olay Total Effects but wants to go more natural.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and blends so well though I read some negative reviews about that.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  It works well.  I&#x27;ve used it for five days now, twice a day.  I love the way my skin looks and feels.  I wanted to cut back on the number of lotions I have and use the same one day and night. But for my skin type, I&#x27;ve come to realize I need to use this one only at night, as my skin has been much more oily feeling during the day. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb enough during the day, and I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup doesn&#x27;t stay all day like it did with my old daytime moisturizer. It&#x27;s my fault for not realizing that would be the case, as it is a cream and not a lotion, and creams are heavier than lotions. So I&#x27;ll be using something different during the day.  I do, however, love it for a night time moisturizer. All skin types are different, so my experience might not be the same as yours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge proponent of Burt&#x27;s Bees for years, and I love their Radiance Day Lotion. I decided to give this a try, but it&#x27;s definitely a heavier, more moisturizing cream - while good for the dry winter weather, I can safely say that I would not be able to use this in the summer without my skin feeling at least a little bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, though, it does a decent job of evening skin tone when used a few days in a row. And personally, I like the smell - it&#x27;s slightly floral, a wildflower type of floral maybe, but it&#x27;s not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint - the pump dispenses WAY too much, and I have to be REALLY careful when using it not to push down too much and end up with way more lotion than I need. Especially as the style of the bottle also makes it impossible to put any back.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this face cream.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so it can be hard to find a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, additionally I have some redness and uneven skin tone.  I love this moisturizer!!  I have seen  big difference in my skin since I started using it about two week ago.  It has evened out my skin tone and diminished the redness while keeping my skin soft and hydrated.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is saving my skin! I&#x27;m very fair and have very sensitive skin (turns red and scars easily). I have been using it for 3 weeks and my skin is noticably brighter and more even. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees skin care products for years, though I&#x27;d never tried this product before. I&#x27;ve been impressed especially with their Citrus Facial Scrub, their Orange Essence Facial Cleanser, and the Rosewater Toner. I also love the company values, their products are either 100% natural or very close. All products are clearly and boldly labeled, &amp;#34;99.5% Natural&amp;#34; or something similar. They are upfront and honest about their ingredients and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using their products, as someone with dry, sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been continually impressed with performance and value. This Brightening Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream was the perfect addition to my morning routine. I wear heavy makeup and foundation, but this moisturizer didn&#x27;t go on too thick or greasy before my make-up. In fact, it barely added any texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this moisturizer is, a little goes a LONG way. I barely give a half-squirt to cover my whole face. It smooths on thick but not heavy and bulky--hard to explain if you haven&#x27;t tried it. My sensisitve skin is extremely sensitive and I often burn with moistirizers used after cleansing, but this moisturizer has never caused any irritation or burning. Also, I DO think--though I haven&#x27;t used it for eight full weeks yet, and I&#x27;ll update once I have--that this moisturizer HAS helped even out my skin tone! I&#x27;m notoriously pink cheeked with dark circles under my eyes, a red nose, and otherwise pale Swedish skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;ll keep using this product and update if there are changes, but as of now, I&#x27;m impressed. But I&#x27;ve always enjoyed most Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light lotion with a pretty scent and a pleasant feel. It&#x27;s packaged in a pump -- and you may find that the pump dispenses more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of twice-daily use, it hasn&#x27;t been the most effective solution for dark spots, though it has more of a brightening effect than some higher-priced products. However, it&#x27;s hydrating and absorbs well. A nice general-purpose moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has done an amazing job at brightening up my skin and dark spots but I noticed the edges of my eyebrow hair was starting to lighten as well!  Not really a big deal since the product works so well so I just make sure to not get any on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to judge whether or not it&#x27;s making a difference in lightening any dark spots on my face, I have used it faithfully since receiving it. The pump puts out more than I need on one press-down so I end up using it on my neck and hands as well as my face. It has an awful floral scent - probably the daisies as they aren&#x27;t known to be a nice smelling flower - but it dissipates quickly. The lotion itself is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny or greasy. It&#x27;s an odd color though (somewhat greyish) which might take some people aback. I&#x27;ve given it four stars as opposed to five due to the stinky smell. Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Good texture, nice scent (light lemon-y).  I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in dark spots, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks.  Even without any significant brightening effects I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have tried SO many facial regimens, searching for the perfect one. I have spent a lot of many on expensive products, but have never found one that gave me these results. I use the cleanser and moisturizer before bed every night and when I rise in the morning. In just a couple of weeks, my skin is noticeably clearer, brighter, softer and even toned. Everyone I know has noticed... I&#x27;m even wearing less make up now. I recommended it to a few friends who have reported back to me with the same results... Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The feel of this product is kind of heavy, and I didn&#x27;t particularly enjoy the feel of smoothing it on.  It is thick and my skin looked very shiny and greasy after I applied it.  It does not look good without makeup over it, unless you like the look of a shiny face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also felt that the delivery pump requires a learning curve--the first time I used it I got a gigantic blob, so much so that I had to look at the bottle again to make sure it wasn&#x27;t, in fact, a body lotion.  So you have to push the pump only a little way down to get a more normal amount for facial use.  Even the cap annoys me:  it is the kind you just push on (like the one on a hairspray bottle), and the kind I personally am most likely to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mostly natural lotion, but I was still surprised by the color of the lotion.  The box says that the color may vary; mine was an unappealing light brown color.  I guess I&#x27;ve never seen a lotion in that color, and it will take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light; much like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  Not offensive or interfering with other scent products, but nothing exciting, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the claims that this product evens skin tone, it seems that they have a very specific meaning for that.  I was thinking it would even out ruddiness and even potentially dark eye circles, but the fine print on the box explains that is \\&quot;a skin brightening agent, helping to reduce the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation\\&quot;; in other words, age spots.  Now, I do not yet have age spots, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not it helps with those, but ruddiness and dark eye circles are not due to pigmentation or dark spots, so apparently the evening out and brightening that I was looking for are out of the target claims of this product. I&#x27;ll still use it now that I have it, and if I find that it does help with ruddiness, etc, I&#x27;ll come back here and edit the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands today, though, I think thisis just a so-so lotion, and not one I would spend a lot of money for.</li>
            <li> Ummmmmm, i think the texture is a little bit too thick(creamy) for me, it is not sticky but it doesn&#x27;t go on easily on my face, it would be much better if it is more like a lotion-texture(I have normal-dry skin), i like the natural smell of it, and it does even my skin tone a bit.</li>
            <li> I have been a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan for many years, so was really glad to see this product turn up. It is a very light and non greasy moisturizer with a slight glow to it. Can&#x27;t wait to see how well it evens out my skin tone. Will update this in a few weeks. Almost no scent either.</li>
            <li> Just ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have never used this brand before today, but I can already tell I am going to like it.  I live in a dry climate, so moisturizing is very important to me.  I think this will fill the bill nicely.  Also brightens my skin a little.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, feels good going on.  A little goes a long way.  Mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days but so far its great.  My face is so soft and my skin looks even and clear.  It smells good, goes on smooth.  I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Great for melasma &amp; acne scarring!  Have noticed a significant difference in just 3 weeks.  Have started to use this on my chest and shoulders as well to see if it will lighten sun spots there as well.</li>
            <li> works well. I like the scent.</li>
            <li> I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Royal Jelly face cream for years and have never found another to match it in how it makes my skin look and feel. However I thought I&#x27;d try this one as it&#x27;s made by the same company and I&#x27;m glad that I did. It really does brighten your skin after a few weeks of use, especially under the eyes. This cream is somewhat thicker than the Radiance cream but a small amount does seem to go a long way as long as you apply it in firm strokes. It smells divine, but that doesn&#x27;t surprise me coming from Burt&#x27;s Bees as all of their products smell so good. I love that they use as many natural ingredients as possible, with this face cream registering a total of 99% natural.&lt;br /&gt;Another difference between this and the Royal Jelly cream is the container. It is in a pump that delivers a small amount of the cream each time, whereas the Radiance is in a glass jar.  [[ASIN:B002DPUY5G Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Cream, 2 Fluid Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;All in all though I like both creams equally and will probably continue to use my Radiance cream long-term, perhaps adding in this one for the under-eye area.</li>
            <li> This is great.  It&#x27;s naturally scented, smells like flowers, it&#x27;s very mild on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it!  Not heavy or greasy and it does seem to be doing what it states. :-)  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and a half now... so not the full 8 weeks yet.  But I appreciate that it&#x27;s 99% natural, and has no fake perfumes or scents.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother mine at all.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this moisturizer is no different. It feels silky on my skin and holds up the entire day. I love that it is made from natural ingredients. The only thing that could make this better would be if it contained a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The label claims 100% of women who use this see lighter skin after 8 weeks, using it twice daily.  They don&#x27;t say if the lighter skin is their own or not, he he.  But seriously...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant lemony fragrance and creamy oatmeal-colored lotion in this little bottle.  They use the same home-remedy for lightening skin that has been around since before the original Brady Bunch: lemon juice or other types of citric acid. Using it in low concentrations means waiting weeks and weeks to see if it works.  If used faithfully, this method has been proven to work some. Unfortunately, they give us only 30 days to review products, so I can&#x27;t say if this worked for me or not.  I&#x27;ll have to update my review in two months.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple of weeks, so I can&#x27;t really say if the product will diminish spots on my skin, as the product says it may take up to eight weeks for results, applying it twice a day.  I apply my facial creams twice a day in the morning and evening.  This cream has a nice light texture and I love the scent, better than all of the other creams that I have tried.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and comes in a nice little container.  I am also only giving it 3 stars because I feel that this is a rather pricey cream for 1.8 ounces, the container is pretty small compared to the other creams and lotions available.  Although, Burt&#x27;s Bees products are usually higher priced than the others.</li>
            <li> This is not a product that works with my skin. It&#x27;s very heavy and greasy, and I am not fond of the scent. This might work for a different skin type but not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream just in the mornings for about a week, and I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement in my skin. It looks less blotchy in coloring. I also love the scent. It is a subtle lemon smell. This makes me want to check out some of Burt&#x27;s Bees other skin care products. I have used their lip gloss before and liked that a lot too. This skin cream feels really nice and especially at at drugstore price rather than a cosmetic counter price.</li>
            <li> Just beginning this product but it feels great on and have high hopes it will fade my sun damaged brown spots.</li>
            <li> very good product, aborbs very good to skin</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t Burt&#x27;s bees products have SPF? That would make them more useful. Otherwise I have to combine with another product with SPF.</li>
            <li> I have been on a fruitless search for a daily moisturizer for my finicky face ever since my all-time favorite was discontinued (isn’t that ALWAYS the way when after years and years you finally find something that works perfectly for you). Anyway, my skin is sensitive, super excessively oily and extremely acne prone. I cannot use any moisturizer on my face that contains SPF at all, or my skin completely freaks out and practically starts spurting even more sebum out like a garden hose. I also feel that if all my BB creams, powders, concealers, eye shadows and lipsticks already contain SPF, then I can very well do without my moisturizer being loaded down with it, too. I started using this moisturizer over two months ago (beginning of June - end of August at time of this review, 2014).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;• Actually did brighten and even out my complexion in a fairly short period of time (I started noticing a difference in the general appearance of my skin in about a week). It does make your skin look brighter and healthier, without a pearly/pixie dust look to it.&lt;br /&gt;• It did help fade acne marks. Lighter marks disappeared in 1-2 weeks. Very dark, cystic acne marks have gradually lightened, but are still clearly visible after a month now and still require concealer to hide completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;• I do not consider this a true ‘day’ moisturizer due to it being extremely heavy &amp; non-absorbing. Even using the lightest touch on the pump to get the smallest amount possible out to cover my face, neck &amp; decolette, this moisturizer never sunk into my skin. I can feel it sitting on my face, making my skin feel even oilier than normal (and that is even after allowing it to absorb in for a good 15-30 mins and then applying a pore mattifying lotion on top of it)&lt;br /&gt;• It has a very strong scent, VERY strong, like a mix of marshmallows and orange cream-cycle ice-cream bars. So strong and sickeningly sweet to me that I cannot wear it under my make-up for fear of other people smelling it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, using it daily as a NIGHT cream for two months so far, it does have its benefits and has not run out yet. Needless to say, it does not come close to what my old PERFECT day/daily moisturizer did for my skin, and I am still searching for a replacement. I would not recommend this product to people who have oily and/or acne prone skin. This product would probably work best for people with extremely dry skin. If you have normal skin and are looking for a product that will give your skin a healthy, even appearance, then this might work for you as well.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Taste good, not suitable for oily skin, but the moisture is good, worthy of recommendation</li>
            <li> I just started using this moisturizer a couple of weeks ago. So far so god. I have been sensitive to many, but not this one. It leaves my skin very soft and supple through most of the day. Not sure yet on the tone evening properties. It also has a pleasent scent.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Packaging easy to use, nice fragrance, absorbs easily.  Starting to lighten but I knew it will take more than a couple of weeks to lighten as much as I want.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> This lotion looks and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love the smoothness and smell as it goes on my skin. It is a great moisturizer. Can&#x27;t address whether it is working to even out my skin tone because I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how good my complexion looks after using this!</li>
            <li> Wonderful face moisturizer</li>
            <li> Has been working great for me so far. I moved to a dryer state and was desperate to find something that would help with my dry patches on my cheeks. This has certainly worked and I also want to try the intensive hydration once done with this. I love the intensive hydration face cleanser. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are amazing!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a really great smell for a moisturizing cream - it&#x27;s not too strong, just light and airy, and it appeals to me personally.  I did notice some brightening, evening effects - while not a &amp;#34;miracle worker,&amp;#34; definite improvement.</li>
            <li> After using this cream daily for 2 months, here&#x27;s the result:&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- comes in a pump dispenser which makes it very easy to control portion&lt;br /&gt;- creamy but not too oily&lt;br /&gt;- nice citrus scent (pleasant though I would prefer no-scent at all)&lt;br /&gt;- has &#x27;natural&#x27; list of ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- no noticeable effect on dark spots&lt;br /&gt;- cream doesn&#x27;t blend as smoothly into the skin as standard moisturizers (like Clinique, Olay, or Ponds), it leaves a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line, I would look elsewhere for a moisturizer or skin brightening solution.</li>
            <li> I am gabriella union dark skinned. This lotion Doesn&#x27;t do anything. There is not difference at all. The only reason why I&#x27;m still using it is because it the most organic friendly face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I will finish this, then buy something that makes sence.&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products, and I really wanted to like this one too, but I just can&#x27;t get over the smell.  It is potent, and I really dislike it sitting right under my nose.  I have asthma and granted, am probably more sensitive to strong scents more so than others, but the strong smell is a deal breaker for me.  I&#x27;m going to have to forego using this product, which is a pity, because I really liked the way it felt.</li>
            <li> i love burts bees products!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about 8 weeks now. I use it at least every night, some times twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of a pump, which is nice. A little goes a long way! It is a yellowish color and smells alright (smell doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin). It absorbs quickly into your skin, which I love! Leaves skin soft right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as even tone and brightening: I have noticed a difference in the dark spot department. My acne scars have diminished in color. Any discoloration is also gone. The only complaint is that there is no real long-lasting whole-face brightening effect. My skin looks bright when immediately applied, but it doesn&#x27;t last. If that&#x27;s your main concern, look elsewhere. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a product for discoloration, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, smells good. Have yet to see if it works, though I have only used it once.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month. I don&#x27;t see any obvious changes in my skin, but its a nice moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any issues or breakouts. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have this moisturizing cream, the cleansing wash, and the toner. I am really pleased with the cleanser and the toner; I&#x27;ll write a separate review for those. This cream, however, is far too heavy. It leaves my skin feeling quite oily after the cleanser and toner make it feel crisp and clean. I normally like heavier moisturizers, I live in the desert so my skin gets very, very dry. I don&#x27;t know what it is about this particular cream, but about an hour after I use it I feel like I have to wash my face again because my face just feels so oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really quite unfortunate because I feel like the other products really are making my skin brighter and more even. I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in dark spots (freckles mostly), but I haven&#x27;t purchased the cream for that specifically, only the other two items. I think the system works really well, I just don&#x27;t like how heavy and oily this feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I use it morning and night and have noticed a difference in my skin tone, and my skin has become much softer!</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Brightening kit and it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;I have less acne, it has a nice natural scent, highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, since it is Burt&#x27;s Bees but it doesn hydrate my normal skin enough.  It goes on nicely, but after a minute my face feels tight like I didn&#x27;t put any moisturizer on.  My makeup does go on just fine after using, and it doesn&#x27;t look dry. I need something with just moisture, no toning properties. Maybe this would work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Amazing, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This worked great as a moisturizer. It went on creamy, with the consistency of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Lotion. The fragrance was light and fresh, something floral. However, I used this product for 30 days and did not see any improvement to the hyperpigmentation on my face due to previous acne. My spots fade with time, and I bought this product to hopefully speed up the process... -Again it did not do that. Also I found myself with smaller bumps, similar to a very very slight rash, although there was no redness, itching, or flaking. I will not be using this product again as I have other moisturizers that are less costly, do not create a reaction, and I do not feel that my skin was &amp;#34;brightened&amp;#34; or more &amp;#34;even toned&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. It faded discolorations, evened out my skin tone, brightened my face and made my skin feel super soft and it did all of this for a great price. You are not going to find a better product for a cheaper price. Plus this company is environmentally friendly and only uses sustainable natural products, which is all the more reason why you should try this product. It&#x27;s not that great of a moisturizer, though. If you want to read more about what I thought of this product, you can check out my blog here: hub.me/agy0d</li>
