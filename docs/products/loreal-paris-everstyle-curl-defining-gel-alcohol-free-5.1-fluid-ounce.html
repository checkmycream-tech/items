            <li>So now I am buying it on Amazon, this product is perfect for my frizzy, curly hair!</li>
            <li>Still going to look for the perfect product.</li>
            <li>However, when ever I give people a hug, they always compliment on how great it smells!  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for heavier hair, looser curl.</li>
            <li>I had been using Alfia&#x27;s Beautiful Curls Gel because it didn&#x27;t have alcohol</li>
            <li>So happy to have found it on Amazon</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>Not even great</li>
            <li>This gel doesn&#x27;t do a great job of defining my curls.</li>
            <li>It does a good gob of controlling frizz and adding shine to hair but it leaves hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>It does define curls, and does a good job of it.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it...</li>
            <li>I will continue to fight the good fight and beg and plead for L&#x27;Oreal to ship boat loads to my nearest store</li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Which I guess is a good thing, if you don&#x27;t have a lot of curl.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This product makes my curls look amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing....</li>
            <li>I actually liked this product for defining curls/coils.</li>
            <li>Or I have to use a combo of products to get nice curly definition but avoid curl crunch.</li>
            <li>This was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>No stickiness, no feeling like I had lacquer on my hair, just a nice control.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice gel.</li>
            <li>...the fragrance is VERY strong, and it does not go away until you wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying as far as this gel is intended to work,  it is magnificent.  </li>
            <li>this is a wonderful gel, it defines your curls so perfectly, i will definitely be purchasing it again, highly recommended for naturals</li>
            <li>I buy it because I like that its Vegan,alcohol free and very appealing to my need.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true</li>
            <li>This product does have a strong scent, which in my opinion was nice.</li>
            <li>(I love their kids line, works like a charm, smells good, super cute and colorful)&lt;br</li>
            <li>have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Also, it does not make my hair crunchy like most gels.  </li>
            <li>The two together work much better than the one alone.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t find anything better, I might buy this again</li>
            <li>This is by far the best curling gel on the market and its alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I have 4B hair and wanted to try something cheap but effective.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this gel.</li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t deliver for my 3A/3B hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE this gel.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheap and honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well.  </li>
            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>I loved the way it enhanced my short curls; my hair looked and felt great.  </li>
            <li>However, I won&#x27;t be able to use it again because of the unbearable fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair was better</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find this hair product at many stores.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad that I did.</li>
            <li>My curls have never held more than two days before.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and I am going to stock up on more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love love it</li>
            <li>Oh and, I used to get this at the drugstore, and have since not been able to find it ANYWHERE, except for Amazon of course.  </li>
            <li>Love love this gel for my hair.</li>
            <li>While many are faithful to the Ecostyler product line, I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK to my taste.</li>
            <li>I just freshen it up with some spritzes of water and rescrunch - and looks as good as it did right after the shower.  </li>
            <li>I found the L&#x27;Or√©al Tousle cream first and loved it</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at CVS, but it&#x27;s becoming more sparse each time that I look for it.</li>
            <li>but this one works so nice, good and soft...</li>
            <li>They also use a cheap brand of hair bleach, to make more of a profit.</li>
            <li>I have gone through more than several gels and I am happy that I found this for my curly hair (not just my pubes).</li>
            <li>So with this style hair comes easy breakage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>, how I wish mainstream companies like L&#x27;Oreal would realize that fragrance does NOTHING to enhance their products, and causes many of us who would be loyal users to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>So many reviewers have said what I&#x27;ve found to be true - curls never looked better - and it KEEPS the good look - even after sleeping all night - it still holds the next day.  </li>
            <li>So I was super excited when I found it still available on amazon!</li>
            <li>This hair gel is light and holds just as I expect it to without the salon price.</li>
            <li>I am loving the EverCurl line from L&#x27;oreal, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair and scalp</li>
            <li>Last all day and is great for touch up at the end of the day to re-style for the evening.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s curls are different but this stuff works great in mine.</li>
            <li>BAM fantastic again.</li>
            <li>I bought this at target hoping it would be a cheap alternative to kinky curly custard.</li>
            <li>I have started using paraben and alcohol free products for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>but if the Tousle cream becomes available then I would still choose the cream over the curl defining gel.</li>
            <li>this price and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite curl gel so far, it has a nice soft smell, nothing too overwhelming, it controls frizz and defines my waves nicely.</li>
            <li>Good product, but not a firm hold for wife&#x27;s 3C curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried everything as we all know that &amp;#34;quest to find the perfect product&amp;#34; I have about 5 bottles of half full bottles of hair gel that just dont cut it like this gel product does.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this from sone one else which it was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li>but  more liberally because I knew that the crunchiness would produce great soft curls the next day.</li>
            <li>I love how this product really make my hair curly</li>
            <li>This has become my absolute favorite curly hair product</li>
            <li>and she said she could tell I did something noticeably different and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I tried other gels, and tried home made hair gel recipes, but they weren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>I apply this product to damp hair and it dries quickly, without any residue.</li>
            <li>I then reordered the shipment was quick.  </li>
            <li>Some how this gel separates the curls and leaves them super kinky.  </li>
            <li>Sent quickly.</li>
            <li>I now use the mousse first and follow lightly with this.  </li>
            <li>it does define my curls a bit better than normal</li>
            <li>it was hot!</li>
            <li>But I put some of this gel in a spray bottle with water, let my hair mostly air dry, then sprayed this on the top layer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the fragrance is a tad too strong for me, it smells nice, but just a bit much (seems to be the case with all L&#x27;Oreal hair products).  </li>
            <li>Defines the curls and leaves its shiny fresh look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair gel for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Love how it keeps my curls soft not crunchy.</li>
            <li>I do recommend that you use some kind of leave in conditioner prior to using this gel.</li>
            <li>I did find that it works best for me if I towel dry my hair thouroughly and even let it air dry some.</li>
            <li>I ultimately decided to try this gel because the price was good and the it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>Stand up for yourself, and don&#x27;t let &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; salons do something that you know isn&#x27;t right).</li>
            <li>After I used this gel, I was able to wear my hair down for 5 days in a row without refreshing it.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you use it with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Silk and Gloss Dual Oil Care, you get more shine and a little more softness and bounce.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention I have a 3&amp;5 year old, and travel 70% of the time, using a product that&#x27;s this easy is a life and time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thick natural curly hair and this works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with their Tousle Cream because it breaks easily and leaves soft curls that hold all day with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found out later they learn in beauty school not to do that, but I guess they would rather save 20 minutes and squeeze in more appointments, than do the right thing, even if they can see that it is gradually ruining my hair.</li>
            <li>It is not a faint smell either, and it lingers on my hair and in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what exactly</li>
            <li>And I am pretty picky about what I put on my hair, but I couldn&#x27;t find any offensive ingredients in this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first gel that doesn&#x27;t make my hair gross/sticky/limp.</li>
            <li>The look was very similar and price way better.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Good consistency but makes hair stiff and can cause shrinkage.</li>
            <li>I admit at first I really believed I had found my solution.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I put too much, which gave it the crunchy look.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super tight curls, so many products for curly hair leave my hair fly-away and a bit frizzy.  </li>
            <li>; however, if I run my fingers through my hair once it&#x27;s dry it takes that wetness away and leave my hair bodaciously curly and sexy without frizz or flaking.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very wavy and this does a nice job of taming it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>And my curls were still defined, albeit more loose than the beginning of the week.</li>
            <li>But by the end of my fast paced crazy day, my hair was still great!</li>
            <li>I really like the way it gets rid of frizz and tames my hair.</li>
            <li>In fact my whole life I have been battling this frizz.</li>
            <li>I used my diffuser and was ready to go.</li>
            <li>have waited my whole life for this gel.</li>
            <li>I am a believer in the whole EverStyle and EverCurl line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and it holds the curls very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that I can get by an extra day without having to wash it (and by wash it, I mean just using conditioner most of the time).  </li>
            <li>so I straighten it and after years of keeping it a dark brown I have transitioned back to my natural color by highlighting lightly until I&#x27;m happy with a low maintenance DO.</li>
            <li>also allows my style to survive over night WAY better than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I finally found the right stuff!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: The local store where I was buying the L&#x27;Oreal Tousle cream stopped selling it, so I decided to give this product another try since I still had a full bottle.</li>
            <li>Upon using this product, my hair is soft, with control, but at first you&#x27;ll have to experiment on the amount you&#x27;ll need.  </li>
            <li>I think the key to this product is the different oils they put in it, which makes it silky soft, and saves me the time of having to add my own separately.  </li>
            <li>This gel is better than the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Sculpt and Hold Cream Gel which is really heavy and doesn&#x27;t do much for picking up curl like this does.  </li>
            <li>And my ratty hair is too damaged to style it, to help it look decent.</li>
            <li>So I like to use this on second day hair or when I want my edges to be super sleek.</li>
            <li>I am highly depressed ya&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>, I highly suggest you keep this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The other positive reviewers were so right!</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and have used diva curl , mixed chick the more expensive products and to be honest</li>
            <li>I used about the equivalent of two peas worth and what was I left with?  </li>
            <li>I notice that when I use this product my hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy as it normally is.</li>
            <li>The new salon, who bragged about being color experts, put bleach on my scalp, then put me under the dryer, even though I said my hair has always lightened without the dryer.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair curlier, not crunchy, and very soft.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and you even get second day hair identical to the first day.  </li>
            <li>Use more than a small, lima bean-sized amount at one time, and you&#x27;ll have the Something About Mary hairstyle.</li>
            <li>This products actually works pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is light, not sticky, and keeps the curls without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li>Whether your hair is short curly or long curly, I think you will enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>It actually made my hair lay soft and pretty, and I didn&#x27;t feel as depressed anymore about my hair.</li>
            <li>I docked it a star because I would like it to have a little more hold as my second day hair tends to get a bit frizzy again.</li>
            <li>It has been difficult to find in my local stores, so I am happy that I can purchase this through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Walmart used to carry this product and as they do (quite frequently) they reset the aisle and discontinued it in stores.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>The waves are already soft and SO DEFINED.</li>
            <li>Yeah, my wild hair needs a lot.</li>
            <li>where women of color transition from relaxed hair to natural curls.</li>
            <li>One natural blogger named Mahoghanycurls gave this product a glowing recommendation</li>
            <li>After several visits, my once pretty hair is fried, and I actually had new bald spots on my scalp on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>Overall, for frizzy curls, this product will help tame them and not damage your hair as much since it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>EVERYONE try this gel...but dont take all of it because I&#x27;m about to buy as much as possible to last me a while ;)</li>
            <li>$ isn&#x27;t a lot, but still pushing the higher $ of the regular shelf item at the big box places and pharmacies..</li>
            <li>I like my hair to look and feel soft, not wet and crunchy.</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair when it is still pretty wet.</li>
            <li>And then let that guy air dry, I&#x27;m telling you the compliments I get on my hair is too much to count.</li>
            <li>I used to have pretty long bleached blonde hair, until I switched salons.</li>
            <li>It provides just enough soft curl</li>
            <li>I have learned how much to use (not much at all) and how to distribute it throughout my hair in order to avoid the crunchiness.</li>
            <li>I have natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li>, it looks like it&#x27;s wet; for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>About a 8 months ago maybe a few more or less, I ran across this product, Loreal.</li>
            <li>I am a natural African American woman, I was looking for an alternative to ECO styler gel ( it can be a tad drying on your hair)  </li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because if I use too much it makes my hair look wet</li>
            <li>I finally after  20 years of being self conscious of what my curls might look like because I could not find the balance of natural soft curls that are being held tight with being too crunchy or too loose, frizzy and unstructured, to what the curls that you&#x27;ve always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Let me tell you about my hair- natural color is sandy blonde, curly, fine yet, corse yet very thick and of course FRIZZY!</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair with a mixture of textures, and just to give you an idea on the frizz factor, when I brush the curl out (just for hair coloring purposes), we&#x27;re talking major fro.</li>

            <li> this is a wonderful gel, it defines your curls so perfectly, i will definitely be purchasing it again, highly recommended for naturals</li>
            <li> I buy it because I like that its Vegan,alcohol free and very appealing to my need.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true</li>
            <li> This product does have a strong scent, which in my opinion was nice.</li>
            <li> (I love their kids line, works like a charm, smells good, super cute and colorful)&lt;br</li>
            <li> have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does not make my hair crunchy like most gels.  </li>
            <li> The two together work much better than the one alone.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t find anything better, I might buy this again</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling gel on the market and its alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I have 4B hair and wanted to try something cheap but effective.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this gel.</li>
            <li> Most don&#x27;t deliver for my 3A/3B hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE this gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap and honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well.  </li>
            <li> Love love love it</li>
            <li> I loved the way it enhanced my short curls; my hair looked and felt great.  </li>
            <li> However, I won&#x27;t be able to use it again because of the unbearable fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair was better</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this hair product at many stores.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that I did.</li>
            <li> My curls have never held more than two days before.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and I am going to stock up on more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love love it</li>
            <li> Oh and, I used to get this at the drugstore, and have since not been able to find it ANYWHERE, except for Amazon of course.  </li>
            <li> Love love this gel for my hair.</li>
            <li> While many are faithful to the Ecostyler product line, I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK to my taste.</li>
            <li> I just freshen it up with some spritzes of water and rescrunch - and looks as good as it did right after the shower.  </li>
            <li> I found the L&#x27;Or√©al Tousle cream first and loved it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at CVS, but it&#x27;s becoming more sparse each time that I look for it.</li>
            <li> but this one works so nice, good and soft...</li>
            <li> They also use a cheap brand of hair bleach, to make more of a profit.</li>
            <li> I have gone through more than several gels and I am happy that I found this for my curly hair (not just my pubes).</li>
            <li> So with this style hair comes easy breakage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> , how I wish mainstream companies like L&#x27;Oreal would realize that fragrance does NOTHING to enhance their products, and causes many of us who would be loyal users to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> So many reviewers have said what I&#x27;ve found to be true - curls never looked better - and it KEEPS the good look - even after sleeping all night - it still holds the next day.  </li>
            <li> So I was super excited when I found it still available on amazon!</li>
            <li> This hair gel is light and holds just as I expect it to without the salon price.</li>
            <li> I am loving the EverCurl line from L&#x27;oreal, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair and scalp</li>
            <li> Last all day and is great for touch up at the end of the day to re-style for the evening.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s curls are different but this stuff works great in mine.</li>
            <li> BAM fantastic again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at target hoping it would be a cheap alternative to kinky curly custard.</li>
            <li> I have started using paraben and alcohol free products for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> but if the Tousle cream becomes available then I would still choose the cream over the curl defining gel.</li>
            <li> this price and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite curl gel so far, it has a nice soft smell, nothing too overwhelming, it controls frizz and defines my waves nicely.</li>
            <li> Good product, but not a firm hold for wife&#x27;s 3C curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried everything as we all know that &amp;#34;quest to find the perfect product&amp;#34; I have about 5 bottles of half full bottles of hair gel that just dont cut it like this gel product does.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from sone one else which it was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> but  more liberally because I knew that the crunchiness would produce great soft curls the next day.</li>
            <li> I love how this product really make my hair curly</li>
            <li> This has become my absolute favorite curly hair product</li>
            <li> and she said she could tell I did something noticeably different and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> I tried other gels, and tried home made hair gel recipes, but they weren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> I apply this product to damp hair and it dries quickly, without any residue.</li>
            <li> I then reordered the shipment was quick.  </li>
            <li> Some how this gel separates the curls and leaves them super kinky.  </li>
            <li> Sent quickly.</li>
            <li> I now use the mousse first and follow lightly with this.  </li>
            <li> it does define my curls a bit better than normal</li>
            <li> it was hot!</li>
            <li> But I put some of this gel in a spray bottle with water, let my hair mostly air dry, then sprayed this on the top layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the fragrance is a tad too strong for me, it smells nice, but just a bit much (seems to be the case with all L&#x27;Oreal hair products).  </li>
            <li> Defines the curls and leaves its shiny fresh look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair gel for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Love how it keeps my curls soft not crunchy.</li>
            <li> I do recommend that you use some kind of leave in conditioner prior to using this gel.</li>
            <li> I did find that it works best for me if I towel dry my hair thouroughly and even let it air dry some.</li>
            <li> I ultimately decided to try this gel because the price was good and the it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Stand up for yourself, and don&#x27;t let &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; salons do something that you know isn&#x27;t right).</li>
            <li> After I used this gel, I was able to wear my hair down for 5 days in a row without refreshing it.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you use it with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Silk and Gloss Dual Oil Care, you get more shine and a little more softness and bounce.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention I have a 3&amp;5 year old, and travel 70% of the time, using a product that&#x27;s this easy is a life and time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick natural curly hair and this works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with their Tousle Cream because it breaks easily and leaves soft curls that hold all day with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found out later they learn in beauty school not to do that, but I guess they would rather save 20 minutes and squeeze in more appointments, than do the right thing, even if they can see that it is gradually ruining my hair.</li>
            <li> It is not a faint smell either, and it lingers on my hair and in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what exactly</li>
            <li> And I am pretty picky about what I put on my hair, but I couldn&#x27;t find any offensive ingredients in this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first gel that doesn&#x27;t make my hair gross/sticky/limp.</li>
            <li> The look was very similar and price way better.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Good consistency but makes hair stiff and can cause shrinkage.</li>
            <li> I admit at first I really believed I had found my solution.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I put too much, which gave it the crunchy look.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super tight curls, so many products for curly hair leave my hair fly-away and a bit frizzy.  </li>
            <li> ; however, if I run my fingers through my hair once it&#x27;s dry it takes that wetness away and leave my hair bodaciously curly and sexy without frizz or flaking.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very wavy and this does a nice job of taming it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> And my curls were still defined, albeit more loose than the beginning of the week.</li>
            <li> But by the end of my fast paced crazy day, my hair was still great!</li>
            <li> I really like the way it gets rid of frizz and tames my hair.</li>
            <li> In fact my whole life I have been battling this frizz.</li>
            <li> I used my diffuser and was ready to go.</li>
            <li> have waited my whole life for this gel.</li>
            <li> I am a believer in the whole EverStyle and EverCurl line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and it holds the curls very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that I can get by an extra day without having to wash it (and by wash it, I mean just using conditioner most of the time).  </li>
            <li> so I straighten it and after years of keeping it a dark brown I have transitioned back to my natural color by highlighting lightly until I&#x27;m happy with a low maintenance DO.</li>
            <li> also allows my style to survive over night WAY better than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I finally found the right stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: The local store where I was buying the L&#x27;Oreal Tousle cream stopped selling it, so I decided to give this product another try since I still had a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Upon using this product, my hair is soft, with control, but at first you&#x27;ll have to experiment on the amount you&#x27;ll need.  </li>
            <li> I think the key to this product is the different oils they put in it, which makes it silky soft, and saves me the time of having to add my own separately.  </li>
            <li> This gel is better than the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Sculpt and Hold Cream Gel which is really heavy and doesn&#x27;t do much for picking up curl like this does.  </li>
            <li> And my ratty hair is too damaged to style it, to help it look decent.</li>
            <li> So I like to use this on second day hair or when I want my edges to be super sleek.</li>
            <li> I am highly depressed ya&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> , I highly suggest you keep this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The other positive reviewers were so right!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have used diva curl , mixed chick the more expensive products and to be honest</li>
            <li> I used about the equivalent of two peas worth and what was I left with?  </li>
            <li> I notice that when I use this product my hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy as it normally is.</li>
            <li> The new salon, who bragged about being color experts, put bleach on my scalp, then put me under the dryer, even though I said my hair has always lightened without the dryer.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair curlier, not crunchy, and very soft.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and you even get second day hair identical to the first day.  </li>
            <li> Use more than a small, lima bean-sized amount at one time, and you&#x27;ll have the Something About Mary hairstyle.</li>
            <li> This products actually works pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is light, not sticky, and keeps the curls without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> Whether your hair is short curly or long curly, I think you will enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> It actually made my hair lay soft and pretty, and I didn&#x27;t feel as depressed anymore about my hair.</li>
            <li> I docked it a star because I would like it to have a little more hold as my second day hair tends to get a bit frizzy again.</li>
            <li> It has been difficult to find in my local stores, so I am happy that I can purchase this through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Walmart used to carry this product and as they do (quite frequently) they reset the aisle and discontinued it in stores.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> The waves are already soft and SO DEFINED.</li>
            <li> Yeah, my wild hair needs a lot.</li>
            <li> where women of color transition from relaxed hair to natural curls.</li>
            <li> One natural blogger named Mahoghanycurls gave this product a glowing recommendation</li>
            <li> After several visits, my once pretty hair is fried, and I actually had new bald spots on my scalp on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> Overall, for frizzy curls, this product will help tame them and not damage your hair as much since it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> EVERYONE try this gel...but dont take all of it because I&#x27;m about to buy as much as possible to last me a while ;)</li>
            <li> $ isn&#x27;t a lot, but still pushing the higher $ of the regular shelf item at the big box places and pharmacies..</li>
            <li> I like my hair to look and feel soft, not wet and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when it is still pretty wet.</li>
            <li> And then let that guy air dry, I&#x27;m telling you the compliments I get on my hair is too much to count.</li>
            <li> I used to have pretty long bleached blonde hair, until I switched salons.</li>
            <li> It provides just enough soft curl</li>
            <li> I have learned how much to use (not much at all) and how to distribute it throughout my hair in order to avoid the crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I have natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li> , it looks like it&#x27;s wet; for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> About a 8 months ago maybe a few more or less, I ran across this product, Loreal.</li>
            <li> I am a natural African American woman, I was looking for an alternative to ECO styler gel ( it can be a tad drying on your hair)  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because if I use too much it makes my hair look wet</li>
            <li> I finally after  20 years of being self conscious of what my curls might look like because I could not find the balance of natural soft curls that are being held tight with being too crunchy or too loose, frizzy and unstructured, to what the curls that you&#x27;ve always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Let me tell you about my hair- natural color is sandy blonde, curly, fine yet, corse yet very thick and of course FRIZZY!</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair with a mixture of textures, and just to give you an idea on the frizz factor, when I brush the curl out (just for hair coloring purposes), we&#x27;re talking major fro.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;3b&amp;#34; curly, long, fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp that other products irritate.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last for a long time if it&#x27;s an issue.</li>
            <li> Even when I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry, I can count on it drying without frizz and to work with it with white flakes or any consequences...</li>
            <li> But it leaves the hair crispier than some other gels, and it&#x27;s really dulling and heavy.  </li>
            <li> my hair texture in the front is like a wet and wavy weave and in the back Shirley temple curls with nothing in it.  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t overdo the amount, it won&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> Plus, the size is much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> About a month after not being able to find this product on the shelves, I has to start searching because I&#x27;m sick of buying and using products that are more expensive and give subpar results.</li>
            <li> I used it for a second time today, same method but less product.</li>
            <li> It does help tame my wild curls.</li>
            <li> I have found that the alcohols in hair gels tend to really dry out my hair and don&#x27;t protect against humidity as well.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out hair or leave too crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I was not a fan of Kinky curly because it takes forever to dry, leaves the hair a little too stiff and if you use too much you&#x27;re in trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh and the tube was rather small for the price I laid it down next to a new tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I can not live without it.</li>
            <li> (Did I mention I am sick of having so many different products to do my hair all the time?!)</li>
            <li> What I find scary is that I actually have a very poor sense of smell; so, I can only imagine how strong this product smells to someone with a normal sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> I have hair slightly longer than shoulder length, with big, thicker curls.  </li>
            <li> I have thick sort of wavy hair which is very much prone to frizz, I have used a lot of curl mousse in the past, but that tends to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> i will continue trying this untill its empty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different combinations of products to tame my frizzy 3b hair for MONTHS.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed, I expected a better product from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick and usually requires a lot of product, but I used only a tiny bit of this because I hadn&#x27;t tried it before.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy as some other product seem to do.</li>
            <li> but I will try other things in the meantime.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m really not enthousiastic!</li>
            <li> I found I don&#x27;t need to add any other products to my hair like I would with other curl gels.</li>
            <li> I apply while my hair is wet and use lots!</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;ll put the product on my hair while wet and let it air dry, then I scrunch it to break the gel</li>
            <li> I dont feel guilty about using so much like  </li>
            <li> get out of the shower and use thick leave in conditioner then a dollup of this guy and tie it up with a TEE SHIRT that is the key not a towel not a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and I have considerably less hairfall as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried using less of it</li>
            <li> It dries shinier and it coats my hair where it&#x27;s less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have thick long ringlet curls</li>
            <li> opportunity is that I need it in a larger container with a pump because ill be using it as long as I can keep my hands omit.</li>
            <li> It has a little crunch to it but for us curly girls...</li>
            <li> nothing works without a little crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little to crunchy for hold</li>
            <li> But, that was fixable with a few passes with my hands through my hair once it dried.  </li>
            <li> There still will be some frizzy left behind though.</li>
            <li> The curl definition was poor and my hair was flat.</li>
            <li> but this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to break and leaves my hair feeling crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> Used this to tame my transitioning hair...</li>
            <li> Usual</li>
            <li> Kinky, thin curls that look crunchy and wet.  </li>
            <li> Very stiff and cakes in your hair unless you use very very little...  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair very stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> what this does to my hair, maybe i haven&#x27;t tried this long enough but it smells awkward and the substance feels weird.</li>
            <li> Oh and let me add that I worked out those 5 days too, hard</li>
            <li> I have curly hard to control hair.</li>
            <li> This product is helping me to recover my natural curls after a disastrous relaxing treatment.</li>
            <li> The thing I least like about it is the smell.</li>
            <li> I mean my hair has...</li>
            <li> Finally after wasting a lot of money on other products that were just plain awful,  who knew that this inexpensive gel would be nirvana.  </li>
            <li> The worst thing was that it was very crunchy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m just not impressed with this gel at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to continue my search because this gel just stinks.</li>
            <li> so this was a disappointment...</li>
            <li> Then my hair dried and it looked kinda horrible.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It does have what I consider an annoying smell but the smell does go away after a while.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my 3 b/c hair and it was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love how this product really make my hair curly</li>
            <li> Good consistency but makes hair stiff and can cause shrinkage. It does a good gob of controlling frizz and adding shine to hair but it leaves hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying as far as this gel is intended to work,  it is magnificent.  I have S-wavy type hair and my curls/waves have never looked better.  Also, it does not make my hair crunchy like most gels.  This would be my HG product if it weren&#x27;t for the smell.  I HATE the smell of this stuff.  It is not a faint smell either, and it lingers on my hair and in my bathroom.  What I find scary is that I actually have a very poor sense of smell; so, I can only imagine how strong this product smells to someone with a normal sense of smell.  If L&#x27;Oreal would make this with a different, less-pungent fragrance or no fragrance at all, I would never consider buying anything else.  Unfortunately, I have to continue my search because this gel just stinks.</li>
            <li> Walmart used to carry this product and as they do (quite frequently) they reset the aisle and discontinued it in stores. I have a sensitive scalp that other products irritate. This hair gel is light and holds just as I expect it to without the salon price. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp or make me itchy. It&#x27;s very smooth and a little goes a long way! So happy to have found it on Amazon so I can continue using a product that took me wks to find!</li>
            <li> I am a natural African American woman, I was looking for an alternative to ECO styler gel ( it can be a tad drying on your hair)  my hair texture in the front is like a wet and wavy weave and in the back Shirley temple curls with nothing in it.  I was hopeful but this I&#x27;ll re gift or mix with eco styler. Oh and the tube was rather small for the price I laid it down next to a new tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It does define curls, and does a good job of it.  But it leaves the hair crispier than some other gels, and it&#x27;s really dulling and heavy.  If you use it with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Silk and Gloss Dual Oil Care, you get more shine and a little more softness and bounce.  The two together work much better than the one alone. I am loving the EverCurl line from L&#x27;oreal, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair and scalp and I have considerably less hairfall as well.  This gel is better than the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Sculpt and Hold Cream Gel which is really heavy and doesn&#x27;t do much for picking up curl like this does.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol, parabens and is 100% vegan.  If I don&#x27;t find anything better, I might buy this again but I will try other things in the meantime.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what exactly what this does to my hair, maybe i haven&#x27;t tried this long enough but it smells awkward and the substance feels weird. i will continue trying this untill its empty but i&#x27;m really not enthousiastic!</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful gel, it defines your curls so perfectly, i will definitely be purchasing it again, highly recommended for naturals</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is light, not sticky, and keeps the curls without weighing the hair down. Excellent!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling gel on the market and its alcohol free. Last all day and is great for touch up at the end of the day to re-style for the evening.  Defines the curls and leaves its shiny fresh look.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and cakes in your hair unless you use very very little...  They offered the same item a year ago in a slightly different package but the dame name and I loved it...so this was a disappointment... Must have changes the formula</li>
            <li> I have 4B hair and wanted to try something cheap but effective. I actually liked this product for defining curls/coils. This product leaves the hair shining and coily. I apply this product to damp hair and it dries quickly, without any residue. If you have tried kinky curly you will find the texture similar, but this goes on smoother. I was not a fan of Kinky curly because it takes forever to dry, leaves the hair a little too stiff and if you use too much you&#x27;re in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree with the reviewer that commented on the scent. This product does have a strong scent, which in my opinion was nice. The scent does not last for a long time if it&#x27;s an issue. It smells like herbal essences products if you have tried their products. If you are on a budget this is for you.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it gets rid of frizz and tames my hair. It is a great product. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how curly this makes my hair!  I use the \\&quot;plunking\\&quot; technique (google: Jessicurl), as I always have, and this stuff takes the cake for curl making!  I only gave it 4 stars because if I use too much it makes my hair look wet; however, if I run my fingers through my hair once it&#x27;s dry it takes that wetness away and leave my hair bodaciously curly and sexy without frizz or flaking.  I use the Everysleek shampoo, conditioner, leave-in and sleek and shine serum all as directed.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 3 b/c hair and it was terrible. My hair is long and thick and usually requires a lot of product, but I used only a tiny bit of this because I hadn&#x27;t tried it before. The curl definition was poor and my hair was flat. The worst thing was that it was very crunchy.</li>
            <li> I finally found the right stuff! I have gone through more than several gels and I am happy that I found this for my curly hair (not just my pubes).</li>
            <li> So many reviewers have said what I&#x27;ve found to be true - curls never looked better - and it KEEPS the good look - even after sleeping all night - it still holds the next day.  I just freshen it up with some spritzes of water and rescrunch - and looks as good as it did right after the shower.  I can&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;m sold.  Stocking up!</li>
            <li> I am highly depressed ya&#x27;ll I&#x27;ve googled where to purchase this, I&#x27;ve contacted L&#x27;oreal just to BEGGG them to send me this buy the case to the nearest store. Thank you Lord Amazon has this...I have thick long ringlet curls and I&#x27;ve tried everything as we all know that &amp;#34;quest to find the perfect product&amp;#34; I have about 5 bottles of half full bottles of hair gel that just dont cut it like this gel product does. I will continue to fight the good fight and beg and plead for L&#x27;Oreal to ship boat loads to my nearest store but I am so thankful Amazon carries it. Everyone should attemp to try this it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get out of the shower and use thick leave in conditioner then a dollup of this guy and tie it up with a TEE SHIRT that is the key not a towel not a hair dryer. And then let that guy air dry, I&#x27;m telling you the compliments I get on my hair is too much to count. EVERYONE try this gel...but dont take all of it because I&#x27;m about to buy as much as possible to last me a while ;)</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this gel. As does every girl with curls, I have a lot of curly hair products. Most don&#x27;t deliver for my 3A/3B hair. Or I have to use a combo of products to get nice curly definition but avoid curl crunch. This has become my absolute favorite curly hair product and I can not live without it. As long as you don&#x27;t overdo the amount, it won&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy. It will be touchable and defined and shiny. Everyone&#x27;s curls are different but this stuff works great in mine.</li>
            <li> Wow! Finally after wasting a lot of money on other products that were just plain awful,  who knew that this inexpensive gel would be nirvana.  Its perfect! It provides just enough soft curl and you even get second day hair identical to the first day.  It does have what I consider an annoying smell but the smell does go away after a while.  I&#x27;m hooked and will buy over and over again. The other positive reviewers were so right!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;3b&amp;#34; curly, long, fine, thin hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2+ years.  I use this every day with EverStyle Curl Activating Mousse.  I used to use this alone with Mixed-Chicks Leave-in...but my dermatologist said I had dandruff from the leave-in so...I now use the mousse first and follow lightly with this.  It has a little crunch to it but for us curly girls...nothing works without a little crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use only salon products but NEVER got results like I do with these 2 hair products.  Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> This was a nice surprise. I used to have pretty long bleached blonde hair, until I switched salons. The new salon, who bragged about being color experts, put bleach on my scalp, then put me under the dryer, even though I said my hair has always lightened without the dryer. They also use a cheap brand of hair bleach, to make more of a profit. After several visits, my once pretty hair is fried, and I actually had new bald spots on my scalp on the crown of my head. (Hint: Stand up for yourself, and don&#x27;t let &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; salons do something that you know isn&#x27;t right). I found out later they learn in beauty school not to do that, but I guess they would rather save 20 minutes and squeeze in more appointments, than do the right thing, even if they can see that it is gradually ruining my hair. And my ratty hair is too damaged to style it, to help it look decent. I tried other gels, and tried home made hair gel recipes, but they weren&#x27;t that great. But I put some of this gel in a spray bottle with water, let my hair mostly air dry, then sprayed this on the top layer. It actually made my hair lay soft and pretty, and I didn&#x27;t feel as depressed anymore about my hair. And I am pretty picky about what I put on my hair, but I couldn&#x27;t find any offensive ingredients in this.</li>
            <li> LOVE this gel. I&#x27;ve now been using it for over 6 months and it&#x27;s the first gel that doesn&#x27;t make my hair gross/sticky/limp.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair gel for my naturally curly hair.  I have found that the alcohols in hair gels tend to really dry out my hair and don&#x27;t protect against humidity as well.  This curl defining gel is perfect for me!  It has been difficult to find in my local stores, so I am happy that I can purchase this through Amazon.com.  Whether your hair is short curly or long curly, I think you will enjoy this product.  And, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy as some other product seem to do.</li>
            <li> A little to crunchy for hold I was looking for, I have curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick sort of wavy hair which is very much prone to frizz, I have used a lot of curl mousse in the past, but that tends to dry out my hair. I have been hearing a lot about curl gel and I found this product. This has been my favorite curl gel so far, it has a nice soft smell, nothing too overwhelming, it controls frizz and defines my waves nicely. I found I don&#x27;t need to add any other products to my hair like I would with other curl gels. I docked it a star because I would like it to have a little more hold as my second day hair tends to get a bit frizzy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different combinations of products to tame my frizzy 3b hair for MONTHS.  I bought this because it was cheap and honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well.  Cuts the frizz and defines my curls, even makes them shiny... also allows my style to survive over night WAY better than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.  Love love love it... want to stock up for life.</li>
            <li> ...the fragrance is VERY strong, and it does not go away until you wash your hair.  I loved the way it enhanced my short curls; my hair looked and felt great.  No stickiness, no feeling like I had lacquer on my hair, just a nice control.  However, I won&#x27;t be able to use it again because of the unbearable fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, how I wish mainstream companies like L&#x27;Oreal would realize that fragrance does NOTHING to enhance their products, and causes many of us who would be loyal users to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price. Use sparingly or it can cause your hair to become &#x27;crunchy&#x27;. Does not cause breakouts, bonus.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you about my hair- natural color is sandy blonde, curly, fine yet, corse yet very thick and of course FRIZZY! In fact my whole life I have been battling this frizz. Of course in doing so I straighten it and after years of keeping it a dark brown I have transitioned back to my natural color by highlighting lightly until I&#x27;m happy with a low maintenance DO. So with this style hair comes easy breakage. I rotate my shampoos and conditioners based on what my hair and scalp are telling me.  About a 8 months ago maybe a few more or less, I ran across this product, Loreal. I buy it because I like that its Vegan,alcohol free and very appealing to my need. (Did I mention I am sick of having so many different products to do my hair all the time?!) I use it and BAM my hair was better then it had ever ever been curly! I used my diffuser and was ready to go. Usual this doesn&#x27;t last... But by the end of my fast paced crazy day, my hair was still great! Not even great it was hot! Too good to be true I thought, used it again... BAM fantastic again. Even when I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry, I can count on it drying without frizz and to work with it with white flakes or any consequences... Some days I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair and instead I just use the curling mouse to revamp it. (I love their kids line, works like a charm, smells good, super cute and colorful)&lt;br /&gt;So today... About a month after not being able to find this product on the shelves, I has to start searching because I&#x27;m sick of buying and using products that are more expensive and give subpar results. 6$ isn&#x27;t a lot, but still pushing the higher $ of the regular shelf item at the big box places and pharmacies..&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this and have control over keeping this on the shelves, I highly suggest you keep this one. I finally after  20 years of being self conscious of what my curls might look like because I could not find the balance of natural soft curls that are being held tight with being too crunchy or too loose, frizzy and unstructured, to what the curls that you&#x27;ve always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I have waited my whole life for this gel. I mean my hair has...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. Did I mention I have a 3&amp;5 year old, and travel 70% of the time, using a product that&#x27;s this easy is a life and time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only opportunity is that I need it in a larger container with a pump because ill be using it as long as I can keep my hands omit. Looks like I need to order a lot... I wonder if I can get a bulk discount...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls thank you.&lt;br /&gt;90mphMom</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> I like it but the texture of my hair has changed since it grew back after chemo</li>
            <li> I bought this at target hoping it would be a cheap alternative to kinky curly custard. I admit at first I really believed I had found my solution. The look was very similar and price way better. Then my hair dried and it looked kinda horrible. I even asked one of my friends about it and she said she could tell I did something noticeably different and not in a good way. The plus side to this though is that its always under 6 dollars and it did wonders for my edges! So I like to use this on second day hair or when I want my edges to be super sleek. I apply while my hair is wet and use lots! I dont feel guilty about using so much like  I do when I use KCC because its so affordable and always at walmart or target for a great price! I have 4 something curly hair btw!</li>
            <li> My hair is very wavy and this does a nice job of taming it without weighing it down. I did find that it works best for me if I towel dry my hair thouroughly and even let it air dry some.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I was expecting but this gel did not hold the curl while preventing the frizz.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this hair product at many stores. Love how it keeps my curls soft not crunchy. Hope L&#x27;oreal keeps this product on the shelves.</li>
            <li> Love love love. This product makes my curls look amazing. I am a believer in the whole EverStyle and EverCurl line.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Wal-mart on two separate occasions and then they stopped carrying it. So now I am buying it on Amazon, this product is perfect for my frizzy, curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite awhile now and than I find out it has become discontinued!!! UGH!! I have thick natural curly hair and this works great! So I was super excited when I found it still available on amazon!</li>
            <li> Used this to tame my transitioning hair...it does define my curls a bit better than normal but it&#x27;s not something I would buy again unless I couldn&#x27;t find anything else.</li>
            <li> Good product, but not a firm hold for wife&#x27;s 3C curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out hair or leave too crunchy.  Still going to look for the perfect product.</li>
            <li> I have started using paraben and alcohol free products for my curly hair. I found the L&#x27;Or√©al Tousle cream first and loved it but then I saw this product and thought I would give it a try. It makes my hair very stiff and crunchy. Usually I&#x27;ll put the product on my hair while wet and let it air dry, then I scrunch it to break the gel but this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to break and leaves my hair feeling crunchy and stiff. I tried using less of it but that didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;m going to stick with their Tousle Cream because it breaks easily and leaves soft curls that hold all day with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The local store where I was buying the L&#x27;Oreal Tousle cream stopped selling it, so I decided to give this product another try since I still had a full bottle. I have learned how much to use (not much at all) and how to distribute it throughout my hair in order to avoid the crunchiness. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product and I will probably continue using it but if the Tousle cream becomes available then I would still choose the cream over the curl defining gel. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have natural mixed hair. I think it ranges from 2, all 3s and some 4a. Finding a product that works for all my hair types is a bit of a challenge. I ultimately decided to try this gel because the price was good and the it had decent reviews. WOW. I am SO glad that I did. My curls have never held more than two days before. After I used this gel, I was able to wear my hair down for 5 days in a row without refreshing it. And my curls were still defined, albeit more loose than the beginning of the week. Oh and let me add that I worked out those 5 days too, hard (sweaty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the kinky-curly leave in conditioner/detangler BEFORE using this gel. I also chose to apply the gel a but  more liberally because I knew that the crunchiness would produce great soft curls the next day. I used it for a second time today, same method but less product. The waves are already soft and SO DEFINED. My curls have never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this price and the results are fantastic. I love this stuff and I am going to stock up on more. I do recommend that you use some kind of leave in conditioner prior to using this gel. However,  I only recommend it because it worked well for me that way. It might be different for your curls. Bottom line, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Use more than a small, lima bean-sized amount at one time, and you&#x27;ll have the Something About Mary hairstyle. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from sone one else which it was lost in the mail. I then reordered the shipment was quick.  I absolutely love this product.  You can no longer purchase this in the stores.  I have curly hair and have used diva curl , mixed chick the more expensive products and to be honest I would purchase this over them.  Love love it</li>
            <li> I just have one word.... amazing.... that&#x27;s the way my hair looks after try lots of products ... but this one works so nice, good and soft...no alcohol so don&#x27;t hurt your hair.... try it... you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I had been using Alfia&#x27;s Beautiful Curls Gel because it didn&#x27;t have alcohol and it wasn&#x27;t toxic, but I would pay $17.99 per week for one bottle (and the price seems to go up $1 every year!).  Yeah, my wild hair needs a lot. Finally, my wallet said, &amp;#34;Hold up girl, you can&#x27;t afford to keep doing this!&amp;#34;  Enter L&#x27;Oreal Paris Everstyle Curl Defining Gel (alcohol-free).  I had my doubts, but low and behold it was a match made in heaven!  I have long curly hair with a mixture of textures, and just to give you an idea on the frizz factor, when I brush the curl out (just for hair coloring purposes), we&#x27;re talking major fro. Upon using this product, my hair is soft, with control, but at first you&#x27;ll have to experiment on the amount you&#x27;ll need.  The first time I used it, I put too much, which gave it the crunchy look.  But, that was fixable with a few passes with my hands through my hair once it dried.  It&#x27;s also nice that I can get by an extra day without having to wash it (and by wash it, I mean just using conditioner most of the time).  Just put it in a pony tail and go!  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the fragrance is a tad too strong for me, it smells nice, but just a bit much (seems to be the case with all L&#x27;Oreal hair products).  However, when ever I give people a hug, they always compliment on how great it smells!  I think the key to this product is the different oils they put in it, which makes it silky soft, and saves me the time of having to add my own separately.  Oh and, I used to get this at the drugstore, and have since not been able to find it ANYWHERE, except for Amazon of course.  Good luck my fellow curly haired girls &amp; guys, I hope it works for you.  I know how temperamental curls can be.  ;)</li>
            <li> Love love this gel for my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m just not impressed with this gel at all.  I have hair slightly longer than shoulder length, with big, thicker curls.  I used about the equivalent of two peas worth and what was I left with?  Kinky, thin curls that look crunchy and wet.  Some how this gel separates the curls and leaves them super kinky.  Which I guess is a good thing, if you don&#x27;t have a lot of curl.  This just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. Some reviewers claimed it made their hair looking shiny....and that it does, in fact it makes your hair look so shiny, it looks like it&#x27;s wet; for the whole day.  I&#x27;m sorry I like my hair to look and feel soft, not wet and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at CVS, but it&#x27;s becoming more sparse each time that I look for it. I finally found it on Amazon and ordered 4 tubes because I thought that it was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve watched hundreds of YouTube videos where women of color transition from relaxed hair to natural curls. One natural blogger named Mahoghanycurls gave this product a glowing recommendation so I gave it a try. While many are faithful to the Ecostyler product line, I&#x27;m not a fan. Loreal Everstyle Curl Defining Gel has been my go-to product. It dries shinier and it coats my hair where it&#x27;s less frizzy. The product dries without white flakes or build up. It defines my curls immediately upon application.</li>
            <li> This product is helping me to recover my natural curls after a disastrous relaxing treatment. It leaves hair curlier, not crunchy, and very soft. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have curly hard to control hair. For me, I spend money on products to find that they do not work on my hair type even though they are advertised to. This products actually works pretty well for the price. I put it in my hair when it is still pretty wet. I notice that when I use this product my hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy as it normally is. It does help tame my wild curls. There still will be some frizzy left behind though. Overall, for frizzy curls, this product will help tame them and not damage your hair as much since it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gel. It&#x27;s lightweight and it holds the curls very well. The only thing some people might not like the smell. It&#x27;s strong. But it&#x27;s OK to my taste.</li>
            <li> Sent quickly. Item as described. Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super tight curls, so many products for curly hair leave my hair fly-away and a bit frizzy.  This is perfect for heavier hair, looser curl.</li>
            <li> definitely NOT holding my curls. It kinda holds them for a hour or 2, but after that forget it, I&#x27;m back to looking like there&#x27;s nothing in my hair. Disappointed, I expected a better product from L&#x27;Oreal. Plus, the size is much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> This gel doesn&#x27;t do a great job of defining my curls. The thing I least like about it is the smell.</li>
    </ol>
