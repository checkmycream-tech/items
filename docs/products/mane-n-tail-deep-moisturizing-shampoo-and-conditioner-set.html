            <li>and I have seen a tremendous improvement with my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference in volume after the very first use.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is fine, but I don&#x27;t feel it really did anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product my hair is long and is not damage anymore I am so happy I found something that works for my hair</li>

            <li>Had use this products 25yrs ago and now when back to use it  .. as far as I can remmenber is better now with the Moisturizing Love</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>the reviews Ive seen are so great, so ill try it more often and write a difference in 3  months</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have ordered and been pleased with the service and the product.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be shiny and soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>However, I used this on my children and their hair (virgin hair) was soft silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>A friend gave me some of this conditioner to try and I love the shine it left on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I am growing my hair out...</li>
            <li>a good price for two big bottles that will last me awhile.</li>
            <li>To fix this problem I simply rotate this product with a clarifying shampoo and it is still working great, my hair is getting so long with very minimal breakage :)</li>
            <li>My hair feels really soft after washing felt the difference after first wash , i recommend cant wait to see results !</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>cause it grows so fast</li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner really made a difference on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I also love soft hair which is why I bought the deep moisture one.</li>
            <li>I did not experience greasy or oily residue in my hair like other reviewers, but maybe they wash their hair more often</li>
            <li>I like how my hair feels and behaves with other products better.</li>
            <li>The next day my hair still feels clean.</li>
            <li>I am a bleached blonde with warm tones added to my hair, and this product had a strange reaction with my color.  </li>
            <li>The smell also lasts pretty long and not bad.</li>
            <li>My hair has a very &#x27;clean&#x27; feel--not weighed down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>will highly recommend for any type of hair ...</li>
            <li>since high school 1978.</li>
            <li>it is kind of hard to massage through my hair.</li>
            <li>In my experience, good for thin, greasier hair.</li>
            <li>Seeing the positive reviews I might be having an unusual reaction to an ingredient, but if I were you I&#x27;d back away and find something else just in case.</li>
            <li>I recommend this absolutely for anyone that wants to add volume to his or her long hair.</li>
            <li>so I said to myself that enough is enough my bottle is still full</li>
            <li>This is only an issue if you have hair that is a certain color with certain tones that conflict with blue.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft after usage.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and</li>
            <li>I bought this in early October and it&#x27;s now March.</li>
            <li>Overall, adds body and volume, but is also very drying.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>still really like this shampoo and conditioner, but I noticed like another reviwer said, that sometimes my hair would still feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; after and like it left some oil buildup.</li>
            <li>After using this product for the first time my hair had more shine, body, and didn&#x27;t feel as heavy and weighed down.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find it online, but it actual use it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair feeling as clean and refreshed as this same product did in the past.</li>
            <li>I also see new hair growing, there&#x27;s tiny hairs pointing up on my hairline which is obviously new hair coming in.</li>
            <li>For some reason and due to all the positive reviews I alway had some high hopes for this product, I trusted it to make my hair grow faster, and I it did, it made wonders with my hair.</li>
            <li>Im starting to try my new mane n tale shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>The whole myth about mane n tail making your hair grow faster isn&#x27;t true, at least in my experience, but it is gonna make your hair a lot nicer</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s now about 7 inches long since I started in March), but it does seem fuller and healthier with practically no damaged ends (though most of the time I towel dry and comb my hair rather than blow dry it).</li>
            <li>I have normal brown hair that I bleach and dye to my desired blonde</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m only 24 years old!</li>
            <li>I love his shampoo but being that my hair is very thick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine but it leaves my hair feeling a bit dry and definitely not as smooth as I&#x27;d like despite being a &amp;#34;deep conditioning&amp;#34; formula.  </li>
            <li>My scalp has calmed down since going back to my old shampoo and conditioner; I wish I&#x27;d never abandoned them in the first place.</li>
            <li>I figured it was normal and then used the conditioner and left it on for three minutes, rinsed and my hair was so dry.</li>
            <li>Even on days that I wash my hair, my hair actually feels dried out rather than oily, and I have more flyaways than usual.</li>
            <li>Only 3 stars because it did what the title implies my hair and scalp are not nearly as dry as they were before (living in a desert climate) but with almost three feet of hair to brush out the knots that this product leaves behind even after conditioning make getting ready in the morning very time consuming.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed new hair regrowth where it was previously thinning.</li>

            <li> my hair is long and usually the hair on my top of head is frizz and looks unhealthy.</li>
            <li> my hair was a dry mess from bleaching,in one week this stuff has givcen me back my hair,and i have far less breakage now.</li>

            <li> I need to buy more of this but you cant find it any were else in the stores.  If you do its more then what I want to spend.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Makes my hair feel strong &amp; grow faster!! :)</li>
            <li> Shampoo bottle was opened and spilled all inside the box. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for your hair; cleans well and seems to thicken it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered and been pleased with the service and the product.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair! Makes my hair soft after usage. My husband has dreadlocks and he loves it as well!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I used to have extremely dry, thin hair &amp; after using the shampoo and the conditioner, my hair is so silky, shiny &amp; soft. I also see new hair growing, there&#x27;s tiny hairs pointing up on my hairline which is obviously new hair coming in. My mom&#x27;s also been using this product for many years and she always has to get a haircut after a few months cause it grows so fast (she prefers to have shorter hair).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Favorite stuff. All I ever use now. My hair feels so healthy and growing.</li>
            <li> love these hair products</li>
            <li> More body..very nice..</li>
            <li> My hair feels really soft after washing felt the difference after first wash , i recommend cant wait to see results !</li>
            <li> I have damaged/dry hair from years of coloring.  My hair was more manageable, shiny, and smooth after using this.  I will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;I love how it feels when I brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You. Real Cool.</li>
            <li> I bought this in early October and it&#x27;s now March. My hair grew about 7inches since I started using this product. I have very slow growing hair too. Keeps it healthy in the process. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> my hair was a dry mess from bleaching,in one week this stuff has givcen me back my hair,and i have far less breakage now.</li>
            <li> Mane &#x27;n Tail does a great job making my hair feel fuller, and may even be stimulating growth.  However it does make my hair very dry, so I end up using moisturizing productions before blow drying.  Overall, adds body and volume, but is also very drying.</li>
            <li> My scalp hates this stuff. Unholy amounts of itchiness, my friends. Seeing the positive reviews I might be having an unusual reaction to an ingredient, but if I were you I&#x27;d back away and find something else just in case. My scalp has calmed down since going back to my old shampoo and conditioner; I wish I&#x27;d never abandoned them in the first place.</li>
            <li> good for us and the dogs.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my hair longer for two yeArs but it remains at the sAme length:( I heard such great things about this set and decided to try it. I also love soft hair which is why I bought the deep moisture one. So, I washed my hair with this (it doesn&#x27;t lather well) and my hair felt like straw. It was disgusting. I figured it was normal and then used the conditioner and left it on for three minutes, rinsed and my hair was so dry. My hair had never felt like thAt before. I was desperate to grow it though, so I used it for a month. My hair used to be shiny and soft and tangle free. After using this, it is dry, knotty, and has no luster at all. I am so upset:(  I gAve it three stars becAuse I noticed about a half an inch of growth. That&#x27;s the only good thing about this product. I think ill go back to using my old shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this at walmart for under 3 bucks, the size was smaller but way way cheaper at walmart for the same product. I would say this is no miracle and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that it helps my hair grow faster. What I did like is that it was cheaper and did the same job my salon shampoo and conditioner that I pay 30 bucks a bottle for so that is a good deal. My hair did seem a bit fluffy which doesn&#x27;t look flattering for me so I had to use a couple squirts of redken anti-snap. I have normal brown hair that I bleach and dye to my desired blonde so I do roots like every 6 weeks and was hoping this would help my slightly damaged hair. However, I used this on my children and their hair (virgin hair) was soft silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> NO MATTER WHAT ETHNICITY YOU ARE, IF YOU HAVE HARD TO MANAGE COURSE THICK HAIR, THIS IS THE STUFF YOU SHOULD GIVE A TRY. BESIDES THE PANTENE DEEP THIS IS ALL I USE ON MY ANGRY HEAD ;)</li>
            <li> I decided to try these after reading a few reviews and a recommendation from a friend. I have relaxed hair that gets especially dry towards the ends. The shampoo felt like it stripped my hair and the conditioner was watery. It was almost the same consistency as the shampoo. My hair didn&#x27;t feel any different after each application and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair manageable</li>
            <li> Has helped me stop losing hair. Adds texture to my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried these products some months ago and I have seen a tremendous improvement with my hair.  Mane &#x27;n&#x27;Tail, the products every hair need.</li>
            <li> For some reason and due to all the positive reviews I alway had some high hopes for this product, I trusted it to make my hair grow faster, and I it did, it made wonders with my hair. My hair it&#x27;s now longer and after a long time this is still my go to shampoo when I&#x27;m looking for that extra length and strength.  I know it seems ridiculous but mane n tail has actually payed off every penny to me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is now my holly grail hair growth method along with dietary supplements and I love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product my hair is long and is not damage anymore I am so happy I found something that works for my hair thank you :)</li>
            <li> my girlfriend gave it a 3/5 but she can be bipolar at times originally 4/5 so im assuming from her the long term use doesnt have the effects she desired</li>
            <li> Got this shampoo for hair loss. Now drinking lots of vitamins (5 various a day) plus this shampoo and conditioner. Not sure which of these but my hair started to grow. I think the shampoo contributed as well. My hair is also very obedient now.</li>
            <li> I too was sucked into purchasing it to help my hair grow but after using it off and on for a few months I really don&#x27;t see any difference. I already don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so maybe thats why and I switch between other shampoo and conditioners for color treated hair so those may factor into the growth but I still found it to be good and a good price for two big bottles that will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> PERFECT AND FAST DELIVERY :)</li>
            <li> Hard to find this version in the stores. I was excited to find it online, but it actual use it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair feeling as clean and refreshed as this same product did in the past.</li>
            <li> Had use this products 25yrs ago and now when back to use it  .. as far as I can remmenber is better now with the Moisturizing Love It I noticing the changes on my hair  will highly recommend for any type of hair ...</li>
            <li> the condiotioner  is good but I dont like the shampo</li>
            <li> Great product and at a reasonable price.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Heard so many good things about this brand. finally decided to give it a try. Smells amazing! Not too strong. Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a great buy because this product came super fast &amp; the stuff wasn&#x27;t damaged :) so I recommend this product..</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this product. Price is good and ships quickly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fine, but I don&#x27;t feel it really did anything special for my hair. I have not noticed my hair growing any faster. I did not experience greasy or oily residue in my hair like other reviewers, but maybe they wash their hair more often (I wash every 2-3 days). Even on days that I wash my hair, my hair actually feels dried out rather than oily, and I have more flyaways than usual. I like how my hair feels and behaves with other products better. I&#x27;ll finish using the bottles, but I don&#x27;t expect that I will be ordered these again.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me some of this conditioner to try and I love the shine it left on my hair.  I got lots of compliments…so I decided to buy it.  Love it.  She also said that the shampoo helps to grow healthier, longer hair…I can&#x27;t testify personally to this yet…I&#x27;ll post again after I try the product for longer time. This shampoo &amp; conditioner really made a difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to others</li>
            <li> I have really dry, brittle, thin, easily damaged, terrible hair.  This shampoo and conditioner really moisturized my hair and makes it feel great.  Before trying this, i had no hope that i would ever be able to moisturize my hair, i just kind of accepted that i&#x27;d always have really terrible hair.  I tried all sorts of other shampoos and home remedies, i tried cutting off all my hair lots of times and letting it grow back again.  None of those things helped.  But this...great stuff.  The whole myth about mane n tail making your hair grow faster isn&#x27;t true, at least in my experience, but it is gonna make your hair a lot nicer so you don&#x27;t have to cut it all off all the time.</li>
            <li> I love the moisture it gives my hair an soft! Way better than the original shampoo an conditioner love it!</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky. I love this product. Some people say it helps your hair grow, I haven&#x27;t seen that yet but it leaves my hair very clean.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am growing my hair out... since high school 1978. My hair is thicker, somewhat dry and a bit wavy as it grows longer. I switched to Mane &#x27;n Tail about 5 weeks ago and I noticed a difference in volume after the very first use. I use MnT 4 to 5 times a week, switching it up with John Frieda&#x27;s Go Blonder or just a water rinse. Very happy with the results. It&#x27;s hard to say if my hair is growing faster (it&#x27;s now about 7 inches long since I started in March), but it does seem fuller and healthier with practically no damaged ends (though most of the time I towel dry and comb my hair rather than blow dry it). I like that MnT has little scent and makes my hair easier to comb. I recommend this absolutely for anyone that wants to add volume to his or her long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 20 days now and have used it 10 times. What I can say is NO, I have not noticed a &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; rapid hair growth BUT, my hair is thin and needs washing everyday..... or it just looks like a grease ball. I&#x27;ve noticed however that I do not need to wash my hair everyday with this! The next day my hair still feels clean. I love that. So for that reason alone, I like it. It is Soft and has a nice shine.....I would not say soft-ER or shiny-ER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line. In my experience, good for thin, greasier hair.</li>
            <li> I love his shampoo but being that my hair is very thick it is kind of hard to massage through my hair. Great product though, we buy this product as our main shampoo in our home.</li>
            <li> Great value. Hardly any scent. My hair has a very &#x27;clean&#x27; feel--not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use chemicals like dove shampoo or herbal They itch my scalp. this shampoo relaxes my hair makes my hair stand up while washing . Shampoos that don&#x27;t work makes my hair flat while washing in the shower Hope this review was helpful :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see or feel a difference.</li>
            <li> It all started when I realized how desperate I was to grow my hair longer and to thicken it up, I searched online and even went to Youtube to get suggestions on how to improve the growth and thickness of my hair, I was watching all kinds of video when finally I came across this Mane n Tail shampoo that everyone raved about, it didn&#x27;t stop there, i was watching the reviews and decided to try it, I purchased the shampoo and conditioner along with it, i&#x27;ve been using the conditioner way before I descovered the shampoo and decided to use it together, I washed my hair and I was horrified, my hair was shedding soooo bad, i almost cried and I thought about it and said I wasn&#x27;t going to give up so I tried it for the second time and it did it again, so I said to myself that enough is enough my bottle is still full but I will still be using the conditioner from time to time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine but it leaves my hair feeling a bit dry and definitely not as smooth as I&#x27;d like despite being a &amp;#34;deep conditioning&amp;#34; formula.  I think it is a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> Just my two cents....I bought these products at Walmart based upon advice I received from reviews on here.  I was looking for something very moisturizing.  Both of these products are blue.  This is only an issue if you have hair that is a certain color with certain tones that conflict with blue.  I am a bleached blonde with warm tones added to my hair, and this product had a strange reaction with my color.  Also, I didn&#x27;t like the way the shampoo or conditioner felt.  They tangled my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I also purchased the \\&quot;original\\&quot; conditioner (they were out of the shampoo), and I put it on my hair after the shower.  I really like it.  It is a yellow color, and smoothed and softened my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is long and usually the hair on my top of head is frizz and looks unhealthy. But after only 1 use from yesterday, my hair is much less frizzy than before. The smell also lasts pretty long and not bad. I like it and will wait to see what it will do to my hair in the future.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as I  think it&#x27;ll be</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many great things about this product and finally decided to try it. I have very fine, but thick hair that had become somewhat damaged and dryed out over time due to using drugstore box color. My hair was in a SERIOUS rut, not only was it dry, but it was also thinning out  and large clumps of hair were coming out every time I was showering, especially over the past couple of months ( I&#x27;m only 24 years old! I was truly devastated over it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think in combination with life stress, my diet and the previous hair products I was using it was really starting to take a toll on my hair (I&#x27;ve used Wen, Biosilk, Redken, Loreal Paris, Pantene Pro V, Garnier, and Aveeno shampoos to no avail). So, I started to take Herbal Crest Hair Revive vitamins and use this shampoo/conditioner. I can truly see a difference in the health of my hair and scalp. I believe both the vitamins and this Mane n&#x27; Tail shampoo and conditioner are working together, and seperatly to cause the improvement. After using this product for the first time my hair had more shine, body, and didn&#x27;t feel as heavy and weighed down. Not to mention a lot more managable. I&#x27;ve used it about four or five times now and I&#x27;m truly impressed at how great and healthy my hair is starting to look. I&#x27;ve also noticed new hair regrowth where it was previously thinning. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with Mane n&#x27; Tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/13/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still really like this shampoo and conditioner, but I noticed like another reviwer said, that sometimes my hair would still feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; after and like it left some oil buildup. It is probably because your hair and scalp can adjust to whatever you may be using over an extended period of time. To fix this problem I simply rotate this product with a clarifying shampoo and it is still working great, my hair is getting so long with very minimal breakage :)</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because it did what the title implies my hair and scalp are not nearly as dry as they were before (living in a desert climate) but with almost three feet of hair to brush out the knots that this product leaves behind even after conditioning make getting ready in the morning very time consuming. When the bottles run out I will be returning to my previous shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo always!!</li>
            <li> Im starting to try my new mane n tale shampoo and conditioner! the reviews Ive seen are so great, so ill try it more often and write a difference in 3  months</li>
