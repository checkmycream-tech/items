            <li>Loved this!</li>
            <li>It dries a bit slower, so its great for beginners.</li>
            <li>which is great.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price</li>
            <li>The powder smells good, but is a bit runny.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good though.</li>
            <li>so its good</li>
            <li>This is a nice, affordable acrylic powder and monomer with a good amount to start with as a beginner.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love üòç it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It even came with a cute pair of rose earrings!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>And, the free earrings were cute!</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li>Filled to the top, sealed, and works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I was torn because the nail salons use better products but none of the technicians know how to manicure my nails that curve.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get much better than this</li>
            <li>Love it and is easy for a novice like me to use.</li>
            <li>Overall very good product.</li>
            <li>This is definetly salon quality, I enjoy this product a lot &amp; if I could give it more then 5 stars I would.</li>
            <li>I think it will work out just fine.</li>
            <li>also, the jar is huge for being 4oz.</li>
            <li>The application is smooth if you apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>Honestly I am totally blown away at how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li>I have done my own nails off and on for years only going to the so called professionals on occasions.  </li>
            <li>Though, I have been doing my own nails off and on for upwards of about 25 years and knowing how to apply the materials, when I used this product the first time my nails lifted the next day.  </li>
            <li>Good strength and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry also easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely use this brand from now on.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I purchased this product after reading the reviews and now realize that those who may have received better results may not have had long nails or and/or nails that curve.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened it it was wrapped in so much bubble wrapping</li>
            <li>The jar is filled to the top and this will last me a long time, thank you(-:</li>
            <li>As a nail tech and using several different monomer/polymers this one is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t lose to much</li>
            <li>Better than others I used in the past.</li>
            <li>That stated, I am writing this review after using this product twice with great disappointment.  </li>
            <li>i havent used it yet but the acrylic powder was all over the place because the top was broken.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a professional, it may be hard to get the hang of at first, but if you search the proper techniques its a breeze and the product is high quality.</li>
            <li>I quickly thought perhaps I may have done something wrong such as using a bit too much primer or something.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have decided to order  product from another brand after reading the review of customer who has used that  particular for 25 plus years while also noting dissatisfaction with this product and many others that I have also found to be a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product for anyone who has long nails that curve!</li>
            <li> So, I decided to redo my nails this time ensuring that I followed the processes that I have used for years and again my nails lifted the very next day and as a result, I have had to glue the lifted nails down.  </li>

            <li> Came way sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Somewhat flexible and doesn&#x27;t break as easily as other brands.</li>
            <li> and I was so greatful it didn&#x27;t spill or anything because it was sealed so tightly.</li>
            <li> but there was NO free earrings......</li>
            <li> This product is a poor quality product for long nails and/or nails that curve because the product will lift!  </li>
            <li> I received this product from the merchant in a timely manner however this product sucks!  </li>
            <li> How pathetic that not only did I have glue my nails down</li>
            <li> So I have nothing bad to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> but how pathetic that I have to carry and use glue at all!  </li>

            <li> Love it! If you&#x27;re not a professional, it may be hard to get the hang of at first, but if you search the proper techniques its a breeze and the product is high quality. Will definitely buy again when i&#x27;m out</li>
            <li> Loved this! I received it within 1 week of purchase. The powder smells good, but is a bit runny. It dries a bit slower, so its great for beginners. also, the jar is huge for being 4oz. I would recommend this.</li>

            <li> Great product! Came fast. Filled to the top, sealed, and works amazingly. Good strength and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry also easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t smell good though. But it smells as you would expect an acrylic monomer to smell. Overall very good product.</li>

            <li> Have not used the product yet.  Only problem was when I received it the monomer liquid was leaking . Didn&#x27;t lose to much so I wasn&#x27;t worried about sending it back.  It was delivered faster than expected.  So I have nothing bad to say about this product.  I think it will work out just fine.</li>
            <li> Works so well! I love it and will definitely use this brand from now on. And, the free earrings were cute!</li>
