            <li>The one thing that I do not like about this spray is that the nozzle gets clogged very easily.  </li>

            <li>Fantastic purchase!</li>
            <li>:) Will continue to order Tri Aerogel from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and for a better price.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my hairdresser introduced me to it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using this spray.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.....</li>
            <li>LOVE it...</li>
            <li>LOVE it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reordered and both product works as well as always:)</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Best hairspray on the market, especially for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great hold but leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping</li>
            <li>and I like the volume it gives fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Extraordinary lift and hold!  </li>
            <li>best spray for limp hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and hope that it is always available.  </li>
            <li>It is a fantastic styling spray.  </li>
            <li>I also use on my hair when it is damp, sort of like a spray gel (when I wear my hair curly as opposed to blowing it out smooth).  </li>
            <li>Love the product but with high humidity I have to use more</li>
            <li>My hair stylist calls it ideal spray for non-professionals because it can made bad hair look good!</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic, especially for fine hair!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product, as a professional and for my own use, for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>It made me wonder if they had changed the formula or it was not the true product.</li>
            <li>Anytime I run out and pick something else as a quick replacement, I regret it.</li>
            <li>Best I have found for fine, thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li>This hairspray works great for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>It is very good to give body to thin or fine hair and it keeps your hair in place softly, rather than making your hair feel so starched.  </li>
            <li>Been using for years - it is light and natural</li>
            <li>I started using the 2nd can and had a better result.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this stuff, up until this bad experience, was the best I&#x27;d ever found.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Works very well with minimum of spray.</li>
            <li>I did try 2 other top named &amp; reviewed brands and they stunk.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;two-for&amp;#34; price was a small savings, but amy savings is good in these not-so-great times, financially.</li>
            <li>I love Tri Aerogel, it holds my hair without being stiff.</li>
            <li>Very soft feeling but keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Effective on my thick hair as both a hairspray and styling product!  </li>
            <li>Once applied, you have about 30 seconds to complete the style and then it holds in place for hours.  </li>
            <li>and now that I don&#x27;t get a discount buying it direct, I order on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinner hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, but does hold!!</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, thin and fine.</li>
            <li>A little expensive but good product</li>

            <li> My hair is straight, thin and fine.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but good product</li>
            <li> and you only use half as much as a normal spray.</li>
            <li> These will last a long time</li>
            <li> Holds even the finest hair all day long.</li>
            <li> and when I run out and am in a situation where I have to use other products I always come back to my Aerogel.</li>
            <li> I spray it on before I blow dry, style my hair, dry and comb.  </li>
            <li> Does not make my hair dry</li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> You only need a little b/c it holds so well;  therefore, the can lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> It left my hair dull and flat looking, and didn&#x27;t hold the same as all previous cans I&#x27;d gone through.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised and what I expected.</li>
            <li> It takes so little so the cam lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not a fragrance person for any product, but what little fragrance it has, it works with my allergies.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out and broke it off.</li>
            <li> and it stays in place all day without looking or feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble in past finding it</li>
            <li> Its super annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and have given it rave reviews in the past.</li>
            <li> We learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in new formula.</li>
            <li> and it sprays in some crazy direction because the dried up product is clumpled up on the outer part of the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> you have thin hair or just need your hair to stst all day</li>
            <li> Strands of my hair broke off and fell out like crazy.</li>
            <li> With this order of the product came disappointment.</li>
            <li> You used it sparingly and it holds like mad.  </li>
            <li> All this hairspray did for me was make my hair a terrible, sticky mess!!</li>
            <li> When the humidity isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> this was a one time bad deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to think I have to start looking for a replacement hairspray.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in new formula. It is as said on label a finishing spray. No room for styling. Instantly frozen in Place.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, as a professional and for my own use, for over 10 years. The &amp;#34;two-for&amp;#34; price was a small savings, but amy savings is good in these not-so-great times, financially.</li>

            <li> Didnt work for me at all!! My hair is straight, thin and fine. All this hairspray did for me was make my hair a terrible, sticky mess!! Dried my hair out and broke it off. Strands of my hair broke off and fell out like crazy. Do not waste your money!</li>

            <li> Love the product but with high humidity I have to use more and I feel like it leaves a film look on my hair.  When the humidity isn&#x27;t too bad it&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Why isn&#x27;t it sold in stores in Oregon?</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised and what I expected.</li>
            <li> Best I have found for fine, thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product  for over 20 years.  It is a fantastic styling spray.  Once applied, you have about 30 seconds to complete the style and then it holds in place for hours.  Love it</li>
            <li> Great hairspray, and cheaper to buy online.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this spray.  It takes so little so the cam lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years and this is the only hairspray to hold my hair and give it lift.  I have fine, thinner hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, but does hold!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray ever. Only a&lt;br /&gt;Title needed for all day hold.</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome.. Does not make my hair dry and you only use half as much as a normal spray.</li>
            <li> Awesome versatile styling product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years!  Effective on my thick hair as both a hairspray and styling product!  Use it once - you&#x27;ll never go back!  Extraordinary lift and hold!  Recommended it to my stylist, and she herself won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Holds even the finest hair all day long.</li>
            <li> The aero gel is awesome. Thank you</li>
            <li> Beats hairspray and goopy gels.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years -</li>
            <li> Best hair spray I have ever used.  Very soft feeling but keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.....LOVE it...LOVE it</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!  I have been trying different products for quite a while, and this holds without stiffness.</li>
            <li> I ordered the styling spray and received the finishing spray.</li>
            <li> Works very well with minimum of spray.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of things I like about this product.  It has great hold, but somehow does not feel crunchy or crispy in my hair. I also use on my hair when it is damp, sort of like a spray gel (when I wear my hair curly as opposed to blowing it out smooth).  The one thing that I do not like about this spray is that the nozzle gets clogged very easily.  Every time I use it, (every. single. time.) it is clogged from the last time time I used it.  I go to use it and it sprays in some crazy direction because the dried up product is clumpled up on the outer part of the nozzle.  Its super annoying. For that reason, I will not get it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray there is! I used to be a hairstylist and now that I don&#x27;t get a discount buying it direct, I order on Amazon. Anytime I run out and pick something else as a quick replacement, I regret it. Love the 2 pack!</li>
            <li> Good price and a good product.</li>
            <li> I love Tri Aerogel, it holds my hair without being stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and have given it rave reviews in the past. With this order of the product came disappointment. One of the cans was not from a good batch or had suffered some sort of degradation. It left my hair dull and flat looking, and didn&#x27;t hold the same as all previous cans I&#x27;d gone through. It made me wonder if they had changed the formula or it was not the true product. I threw it out after trying it twice.  I started using the 2nd can and had a better result. I am going to re-order the product with the hope this was a one time bad deal. I&#x27;d hate to think I have to start looking for a replacement hairspray. I did try 2 other top named &amp; reviewed brands and they stunk. I have fine hair and this stuff, up until this bad experience, was the best I&#x27;d ever found.  ***I&#x27;ve reordered and both product works as well as always:)</li>
            <li> Great stuff, does what they say it will.  I use it in the morning and I am done. It isn&#x27;t perfumed either.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and I like the volume it gives fine hair.  It could be improved so that it does not leave residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best history ever. It holds your hair great and it does not leave sticky residue on your floor.</li>
            <li> THE BEST!!  HOLDS WONDERFULLY AND IS EASY TO BRUSH OUT.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever - smells nice, not sticky, great hold!  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping and I&#x27;m always pleased with this hairspray!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is great if you get working cans. My wife now has a second can that has no pressure. Be ver weary buying from these people and check all your cans if you&#x27;re like us and buy for a couple of months ahead of time and after there is any chance of doing a return. We learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray in the world! I always order from here.if you have thin hair or just need your hair to stst all day this is the stuff.I could be in a wind storm snd my hair would stay perfect.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is the best hairspray I have ever used.  You used it sparingly and it holds like mad.  My hair stylist calls it ideal spray for non-professionals because it can made bad hair look good!</li>
            <li> I love this.  I have been using it for several years. It is very good to give body to thin or fine hair and it keeps your hair in place softly, rather than making your hair feel so starched.  Also, a little goes a long way. It is more expensive but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent but it hasn&#x27;t arrived.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever ... not sticky, but holds hair really well.</li>
