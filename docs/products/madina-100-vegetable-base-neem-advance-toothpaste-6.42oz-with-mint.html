            <li>The minty toothpaste is green, which is fine with me.</li>

            <li> /&gt;After trying the second tube, I found that it makes my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> It is hard to find the right toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Have to squeeze the tube up and down a lot to get the paste out with the blue liquid mixed in.  </li>
            <li> is comparable to others in taste but perhaps a little more expensive</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is not organic, filled with fluoride and expensive, yet people still buy it because it says \\&quot;natural\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> The idea of brushing my pearly whites with brown toothpaste was unappealing to me and one of the main reasons I tried this brand.</li>
            <li> I received one with an expired due date.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the concentration of actual Neem in this product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll see what the dentist says in a few months.....</li>
            <li> The fact that this toothpaste is fluoride-free is a plus, since our water is already heavily fluoridated, and the label states that it&#x27;s vegetable-based.  </li>
            <li> Hesrd very little about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> not sure this is the one.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this quality without flouride</li>
            <li> Also, even after kneading the tube, green liquid drips out when you go to put the toothpaste on your brush, which looks really unappealing.</li>
            <li> I would have given this toothpaste five stars, but the toothpaste would thicken up every now and then and would be difficult to squeeze onto the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I use a toothpick to loosen up the toothpaste if it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze from the tube.  </li>
            <li> Packaging says  100 % vegetable base,</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  Make sure the top is replaced, turns to cement quickly.  Freshens breath and tastes fine. I wish they would make a travel size.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste feels great on my teeth and my gums look better &amp; less bleeding. I have that &amp;#34;Dental Office Feel&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy Again!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t always floss this is a great tooth paste I get very good check ups and it contains no floride. I won&#x27;t use anything else since I discovered this product. Dr. Oz even recommends this prodect.</li>
            <li> I always use neem toothpaste - because of the neem ingredient.  However, this brand does not leave my teeth with that clean feeling that other brands provide.  Difference is probably in the ingredient list, but I don&#x27;t have two packages together to determine that.  I won&#x27;t order this particular brand again, but will definitely keep using neem toothpastes.  Karen</li>
            <li> If you are vegetarian as I am or if you are concerned about Fluoride (as I am), this is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find the right toothpaste. I absolutely avoid fluoride at all costs. It is a toxic substance to the body. I recently used a toothpaste from Trader Joe&#x27;s (Propylis and Myrrh?) which was fluoride free, $2.89 but it didn&#x27;t give my mouth the clean feeling this toothpaste does. When I use this I feel refreshed, Neem is so refreshing like a minty flavor. It is not organic, but I am ok with that... Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is not organic, filled with fluoride and expensive, yet people still buy it because it says \\&quot;natural\\&quot;! This toothpaste is about $2-3 at your local health food store, 6.42 oz and a Great buy for the whole family, my 6 year old likes it too!</li>
            <li> This is great fluoride free toothpaste. I have tried different neem toothpastes, it is pretty good. I wish it was organic and without coloring, but it is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I received one with an expired due date.  I didn&#x27;t dare order a replacement because I didn&#x27;t want to go through the same hassle.</li>
            <li> I would have given this toothpaste five stars, but the toothpaste would thicken up every now and then and would be difficult to squeeze onto the toothbrush.  A hole developed in the side of the toothpaste tube because of this.  I use a toothpick to loosen up the toothpaste if it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze from the tube.  I&#x27;ll see what the dentist says in a few months.....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use flouride toothpaste. So Neem is perfect for me. Cleans my teeth and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Some Very Good Toothpaste !!</li>
            <li> I had almost NO plaque buildup this visit after over a year.  I used to have cleanings every 6 months.  No morning breath either.  I swear by this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I saw on Dr. Oz that it is supposed to help your teeth.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Neem toothpaste kills bacteria in your mouth and I just love it!!  Hard to find this quality without flouride added.  Love Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the concentration of actual Neem in this product. Wish I could find out. If you are buying this product because you want something from nature..not sure this is the one. It has Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) is a synthetic detergent (cleaning agent). It is used in industrial products. It taste fine but I wish I would of read all the reviews because I don&#x27;t want my toothpaste to have  the SLS in it. I am looking for a toothpaste without SLS and fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using my new Neem toothpaste for 2 weeks. I started using it the day after I got my teeth cleaned by my dentist. My gums don&#x27;t bleed when I floss anymore and I love the cool, refreshing mint taste that lasts a long time. The minty toothpaste is green, which is fine with me. Some of the other Neem toothpastes I read about on Amazon were brown. Yuck. The idea of brushing my pearly whites with brown toothpaste was unappealing to me and one of the main reasons I tried this brand. I&#x27;ll definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Useful and well done. So popular in India. Glad that it is here. Dental health is SO important. Tasty too.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan.  The mint flavor is just odd, not even sure how to describe it. Also, even after kneading the tube, green liquid drips out when you go to put the toothpaste on your brush, which looks really unappealing.</li>
            <li> I like this product and will reorder when I finish it.  It has a good taste and seems to cut down on plaque.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and leaves my teeth feeling cleaner for a longer period of time.  My next dental check will tell me if it also reduces plaque as much as is claimed by Ayurvedic medicine practitioners.</li>
            <li> According to my dentist, although I am diligent with oral care, I needed more. So when I heard about Neem  Oil I decided to buy the toothpaste and my teeth have the feel of a professional cleaning. I will know more when I go to have checkup in a May.</li>
            <li> IT.S OK. Didn,t help my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Neem Advanced Toothpaste.  Packaging says  100 % vegetable base, one of the key ingredients is Sodium Lauryl Sulphate  (SLS) is a synthetic detergent (cleaning agent) and surfactant (which means it makes bubbles). It is used in industrial products such as a degreaser.</li>
            <li> I got this after watching an episode of Dr Oz about neem on TV. I like the taste of the toothpaste. It is very minty and not at all strange. My son is 6 and he steals it from me all the time, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> Dentist says it improves health of gums&lt;br /&gt;toothpaste is comparable to others in taste but perhaps a little more expensive</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find the healthiest choice for my teeth! New to Ayurveda, this is the choice for Pitta!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but the packaging is awful and frustrating.  The toothpaste hardens inside the tube which causes it to rupture in various places</li>
            <li> I love this neem toothpaste.  My teeth feel clean and look bright.  I had developed some skin problems from fluoride, and my dermatologist suggested switching to fluoride free toothpaste.  This one works great for me.</li>
            <li> The first tube of toothpaste was pure liquid in the tube and I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the second tube, I found that it makes my teeth sensitive and I had to stop using it for a while.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for 2 years and have had no issues with my teeth, they seem whiter and cuts through the plaque.</li>
            <li> Hesrd very little about this toothpaste. Was looking for a fluoride free toothpaste. It tastes great, cleans your teeth really well and has an anti-bacteria in it. Cost is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I learned about the benefits of neem leaves from watching the Dr. Oz show on TV, where a guest mentioned that this toothpaste helps keep her teeth and gums in great shape despite her lack of enthusiasm for flossing, and I decided to buy a tube of this toothpaste to see for myself how well it works.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my gums yet, but then I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste has a pleasantly minty (not overpowering) taste and only a little bit is needed as it foams up really a lot.  The fact that this toothpaste is fluoride-free is a plus, since our water is already heavily fluoridated, and the label states that it&#x27;s vegetable-based.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and plan to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> great non flouride toothpaste. Glad that its made form all natural ingredients. Try to live a healthy lifestyle this is a product you must have in your bathroom</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so especially clean with this tooth paste - love the taste too  I&#x27;m sold on this product</li>
            <li> Formula doesn&#x27;t mix well.  Squeezes out just the blue spearment liquid without the paste.  Have to squeeze the tube up and down a lot to get the paste out with the blue liquid mixed in.  It also leaks from the cap a lot.</li>
    </ol>
