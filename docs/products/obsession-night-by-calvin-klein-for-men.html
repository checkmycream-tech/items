            <li>were very good my products, this again could buy more, provided the committee recommends ..</li>

            <li>good aroma and i like this</li>
            <li>Great price, nice smell</li>
            <li>good fragrance, came in time stated</li>
            <li>I have always loved Obsession.</li>
            <li>Perhaps what impressed me the most is that it smelled very unique.</li>
            <li>Great price, it is x3 more in stores.</li>
            <li>so I am very glad that it&#x27;s still on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M VERY PLEASED WITH THIS.</li>
            <li>Very elegant.</li>
            <li>It is very sexy.</li>
            <li>I am very glad to have it.</li>
            <li>mild but very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this scent!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell, great price, use it for all occasions....</li>
            <li>It has it&#x27;s own scent, which I find has a hint of coconut smell, although I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any coconut in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not as good as Obsession.</li>
            <li>It used to be a nice fragrance for men.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it may be best to go to your trusted Nordstrom&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>nice perfum for a nice price</li>
            <li>, you can use it everytime and everywhere, I recommend it 100% for all we can a nice fragance</li>
            <li>I love it, purchased it as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my fiance and he loved it also.  </li>
            <li>Nice perfume.</li>
            <li>I had never tried this men&#x27;s cologne before since I use Obsession for Men, but I liked it for a change of pace.  </li>
            <li>so he uses strong cologne to keep him from smelling good</li>
            <li>It a good buy but aroma is not as strong as I would like it.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying Obsession Night again,, Great for any man, and a super gift for the Holidays, It stays on and lasts all day,</li>
            <li>Great Product &amp; super speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>It is certainly not it&#x27;s evil twin &amp;#34;Dark Obsession&amp;#34;, which is rather nice.</li>
            <li>but its liked by many women.</li>
            <li>I liked this ok but the smell does not linger.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too strong and would gag a maggot!</li>
            <li>Well it didn&#x27;t disappoint, however the scent isn&#x27;t that strong!</li>
            <li>Everyone has commented this does not smell good - need to stick with the original Obsession and avoid the Night</li>
            <li>This is my favorite obsession , it can be worn anytime and is not overpowering , and the price is right!!!</li>
            <li>it is very light which is what I want.</li>
            <li>If it were a pleasant and attractive scent - the fact that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t last would be a &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like it much better.</li>
            <li>Mine dislikes most cologne, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original Obsession still gets my top votes, and has not been unseated as my EDT of choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i can now get it through amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I just love the scent of Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession Night.</li>
            <li>What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li>More of a musk smell, still enjoyable by the ladys.  </li>
            <li>i think the perfum is so better</li>
            <li>will be getting more</li>
            <li>Gift it to your dad,your son, and your boss?&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed wearing.</li>
            <li>I have found you have been safe with any of C.K. colognes.  </li>
            <li>This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne and when he ran out he was bummed he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I my husband</li>
            <li>A more subdued aroma to it.</li>
            <li>women DO notice it and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the newer Obsession fragrances that are on store shelves.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite colognes now ... not overpowering ...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure, but took the risk and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>There werent many colognes that smelled like this</li>
            <li>If you want people smelling you as you walk by then you may need to spray more of this.</li>
            <li>Love the scent of Obsession.</li>
            <li>I love to smell this cologne on my husband</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>, I have quite a big inventory for own use, my gf likes it too, the price was very good and its a big bottle (4.0 ounces) great product, I will keep buying it, for sure!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but is not as musky as the original...</li>
            <li>WHO IS 50, AND HE LOVED IT, THANKS! :)</li>
            <li>I love Calvin Klein Product,and was looking for this one for very long time it is not one of his best ,but I still like it.</li>
            <li>This one had my full interest since I&#x27;ve always liked the Calvin Klein line of fragrances.</li>
            <li>but on me it has a dill smell, after a couple minutes that smell dies off and it smell pretty good</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with shipping and product!</li>
            <li>It is a very special eau de toilette for me.</li>
            <li>It makes any young man happy.</li>
            <li>The aroma is ideal for the night but short.</li>
            <li>It will make your loved ones wonder if you have developed an incontinence issue in your life and there is not a snowballs chance in hell you will ever be able to attract or retain a love interest wearing this.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell that lasts.</li>
            <li>so so cool i love it</li>
            <li>this one smells super!</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic on my husband, been buying it since it came out.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t mix well with my pH, and that is important with cologne..</li>
            <li>I even find myself attractive just smelling me when I sidle up sporting the latter version.</li>
            <li>i have only used Obsession then i seen Obession Night tryed it smells great</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and very sensual.  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough great things about this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this new scent.</li>
            <li>You can smell a lot of the classic \\&quot;Obsession\\&quot; fragrance in the background of this one, but the overall scent has been upgraded to smell more modern and it has some nice light smelling notes that make it a great summer alternative to the heavier original Obsession.</li>
            <li>it is a very good dark essence to it.</li>
            <li>I will start by saying this is a quite unique scent for me.</li>
            <li>I always buy the original Obession for men.</li>
            <li>never heard of this one before, so wanted to try it since the original is one of my all time favs.</li>
            <li>I know, Four people have made a purchase for their significant others.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a unique scent that will serve you well.</li>
            <li>I have the original and wanted to try this one for special evening occasions.</li>
            <li>and I will use it for special and unique nights...</li>
            <li>This is the best... hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with the price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>He uses it daily so thats a good factor</li>
            <li>Light but powerful</li>
            <li>SMELL GOOD AND LAST FOR A WHILE.</li>
            <li>Full sized bottle, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>and it does fade rather quickly</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS FOR ME IM 28, SMELLS MORE FOR LIKE AN OLDER GENTLEMEN</li>
            <li>I think Night is a more masculine scent than the original.  </li>
            <li>I gave this version a chance for daily use, I&#x27;ve never used the normal obession version but let me say that Im quite happy with the scent</li>
            <li>smelled real good last long</li>
            <li>I also got a bottle of Dark Obsession and liked it much better than this one, so you might look into that one too.</li>
            <li>first time using!</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable and at the time of this review, the free shipping is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s MORE femenine than masculine....  </li>
            <li>Its got a very unique masculine smell to it.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband who loves the original Obsession, me not so much</li>
            <li>and I was right about this product.</li>
            <li>One or two sprays in the right area should do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good everyday scent and for special occasion.</li>
            <li>I have used Obsession Night in the past and was always complimented of how great it smells.  </li>
            <li>I where pretty much around the house on weekends when I&#x27;m not doing anything special.</li>
            <li>What I ended up with was a dry smelling cologne (think nicely scented leaves in the fall).</li>
            <li>This product was delivered in a quick manner and packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The longevity and \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; are below average and their is nothing extraordinary about the bottle or packaging (to be honest, Night is bottled/packaged cheaper than the original), although the darker bottle will provide appeal to some.  </li>
            <li>tried this product before and its essence is very different from the purchased as having more alcohol than scent.</li>
            <li>Both great long lasting scents.</li>
            <li>My female friends love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I did not smell it first.</li>
            <li>In its favor, if there is one, it smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; - very similar to many soap bases.</li>
            <li>As it stands, take my advice - do not even consider buying this w/o testing it first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Smells better than the regular Obsession.  </li>
            <li>Might smell different on you though, give it a try at the store first to make sure.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a younger cousin or my pre-teen Son that would alleve me of this horrid cologne!</li>
            <li>I like the smell as it gives a light smell comparing the other perfumes with strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent however does not last very long vs original Obsession.</li>
            <li>Well, the first time I sprayed this one, I really didn&#x27;t know what to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The name pretty much gives away when you should wear it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell did not last as a strong aroma throughout the night.</li>
            <li>I really like this spray</li>
            <li>very manly smell.</li>
            <li>.. mixes really well with my pH</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>There is no way that this is real calvin klein.</li>
            <li>I was really dissapointed in the scent, not at all what i was expecting/hoping for.  </li>
            <li>The product got here in a timely manner, wrapped/packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cologne...</li>
            <li>I really have no idea what Obsession Nights scent was.</li>
            <li>Very manly.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapppointed in this product.</li>
            <li>this one seems to be extra nice, I&#x27;m especially please with the price if you bought this in a retail store it would cost $70.00</li>
            <li>This very pleasing cologne is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Just one quick spray to the bare chest does the trick.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I like to be unique and different.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it when there are other, better colognes out there.</li>
            <li>In my opinion (that and a $1.25 will get you a cup of coffee in some places), the only comparison to the original Obsession is that finishing spicy/musk notes.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle I bought from Amazon and it comes in the original packing.</li>
            <li>For a different and special occasion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less musky and a bit more spicy.</li>
            <li>It has a bold scent that will last for hours.</li>
            <li>It last for the entire day and my girlfriend love it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Part of being a well groomed man is not only to be stylish and dress well; but to smell good also, try this cologne, it will take your game to the next level.</li>
            <li>It is a masculine scent without being as choking and overpowering as something more musky like some other cologne lines out there.</li>
            <li>But this night version just doesn&#x27;t live up to the reputation of its older brother.</li>
            <li>fresh scent that you could use daily ...</li>
            <li>I used Obsession for years in the 90s, then switched to Givenchy PI, but decided this year to look for some new scents.</li>
            <li>New Product</li>
            <li>They might as well give it a new name, but i suspect the name obsession on the bottle is what sells it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But any fragrance smell different on different people, so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t fit my chemistry.</li>
            <li>Not for a very young man.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a bit stronger than the original but not overwhelmingly powerful.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not too far off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a slight bit sweet, just enough, not too much.  </li>
            <li>nothing like i expected, thought it would be a twist on the original, not a totally different fragrance.</li>
            <li>I took a gamble on this due to the fact that I&#x27;ve never smelled it before and many other reviewers said it was for &amp;#34;older men.&amp;#34; Being in my early twenties, I wanted to have a scent that wasn&#x27;t adolescent nor elderly.</li>
            <li>However if you want a subtle, manly, sexy smell then this is for you.</li>
            <li>Although its not bad, it is nowhere near the scent of plain ole</li>
            <li>I had read reviews on Obsession Night, I normally wouldn&#x27;t order a fragrance without smelling it, However, I&#x27;m a big Calvin Klein fan</li>
            <li>Guys... If you are up for something new, something different - Obsession Night might be your thing...</li>
            <li>Others say the same and not a soul I know says it smells like an old fart.</li>
            <li>I will again in the near future.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say it was a little more subdued; not too feminine, not long lasting, but not at all offensive like some other CK fragrances.</li>
            <li>This just resolidified my &amp;#34; Why not to blind buy&amp;#34; Now CK Dark Obsession is such a great smelling colone chocolatey,soft,powdery,spicey.</li>
            <li>I really like Dark Obsession for my husband</li>
            <li>Long lasting, masculine smell to it!</li>
            <li>This could be a good or a bad thing depending on what type of person you are.</li>

            <li> good aroma and i like this</li>
            <li> Great price, nice smell</li>
            <li> good fragrance, came in time stated</li>
            <li> I have always loved Obsession.</li>
            <li> Perhaps what impressed me the most is that it smelled very unique.</li>
            <li> Great price, it is x3 more in stores.</li>
            <li> so I am very glad that it&#x27;s still on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY PLEASED WITH THIS.</li>
            <li> Very elegant.</li>
            <li> It is very sexy.</li>
            <li> I am very glad to have it.</li>
            <li> mild but very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent!  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell, great price, use it for all occasions....</li>
            <li> It has it&#x27;s own scent, which I find has a hint of coconut smell, although I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any coconut in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not as good as Obsession.</li>
            <li> It used to be a nice fragrance for men.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it may be best to go to your trusted Nordstrom&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> nice perfum for a nice price</li>
            <li> , you can use it everytime and everywhere, I recommend it 100% for all we can a nice fragance</li>
            <li> I love it, purchased it as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my fiance and he loved it also.  </li>
            <li> Nice perfume.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this men&#x27;s cologne before since I use Obsession for Men, but I liked it for a change of pace.  </li>
            <li> so he uses strong cologne to keep him from smelling good</li>
            <li> It a good buy but aroma is not as strong as I would like it.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying Obsession Night again,, Great for any man, and a super gift for the Holidays, It stays on and lasts all day,</li>
            <li> Great Product &amp; super speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> It is certainly not it&#x27;s evil twin &amp;#34;Dark Obsession&amp;#34;, which is rather nice.</li>
            <li> but its liked by many women.</li>
            <li> I liked this ok but the smell does not linger.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too strong and would gag a maggot!</li>
            <li> Well it didn&#x27;t disappoint, however the scent isn&#x27;t that strong!</li>
            <li> Everyone has commented this does not smell good - need to stick with the original Obsession and avoid the Night</li>
            <li> This is my favorite obsession , it can be worn anytime and is not overpowering , and the price is right!!!</li>
            <li> it is very light which is what I want.</li>
            <li> If it were a pleasant and attractive scent - the fact that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t last would be a &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like it much better.</li>
            <li> Mine dislikes most cologne, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original Obsession still gets my top votes, and has not been unseated as my EDT of choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i can now get it through amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I just love the scent of Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession Night.</li>
            <li> What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li> More of a musk smell, still enjoyable by the ladys.  </li>
            <li> i think the perfum is so better</li>
            <li> will be getting more</li>
            <li> Gift it to your dad,your son, and your boss?&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed wearing.</li>
            <li> I have found you have been safe with any of C.K. colognes.  </li>
            <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne and when he ran out he was bummed he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I my husband</li>
            <li> A more subdued aroma to it.</li>
            <li> women DO notice it and love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the newer Obsession fragrances that are on store shelves.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite colognes now ... not overpowering ...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure, but took the risk and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> There werent many colognes that smelled like this</li>
            <li> If you want people smelling you as you walk by then you may need to spray more of this.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of Obsession.</li>
            <li> I love to smell this cologne on my husband</li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> , I have quite a big inventory for own use, my gf likes it too, the price was very good and its a big bottle (4.0 ounces) great product, I will keep buying it, for sure!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but is not as musky as the original...</li>
            <li> WHO IS 50, AND HE LOVED IT, THANKS! :)</li>
            <li> I love Calvin Klein Product,and was looking for this one for very long time it is not one of his best ,but I still like it.</li>
            <li> This one had my full interest since I&#x27;ve always liked the Calvin Klein line of fragrances.</li>
            <li> but on me it has a dill smell, after a couple minutes that smell dies off and it smell pretty good</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with shipping and product!</li>
            <li> It is a very special eau de toilette for me.</li>
            <li> It makes any young man happy.</li>
            <li> The aroma is ideal for the night but short.</li>
            <li> It will make your loved ones wonder if you have developed an incontinence issue in your life and there is not a snowballs chance in hell you will ever be able to attract or retain a love interest wearing this.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell that lasts.</li>
            <li> so so cool i love it</li>
            <li> this one smells super!</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic on my husband, been buying it since it came out.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t mix well with my pH, and that is important with cologne..</li>
            <li> I even find myself attractive just smelling me when I sidle up sporting the latter version.</li>
            <li> i have only used Obsession then i seen Obession Night tryed it smells great</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and very sensual.  </li>
            <li> Cannot say enough great things about this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this new scent.</li>
            <li> You can smell a lot of the classic \\&quot;Obsession\\&quot; fragrance in the background of this one, but the overall scent has been upgraded to smell more modern and it has some nice light smelling notes that make it a great summer alternative to the heavier original Obsession.</li>
            <li> it is a very good dark essence to it.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying this is a quite unique scent for me.</li>
            <li> I always buy the original Obession for men.</li>
            <li> never heard of this one before, so wanted to try it since the original is one of my all time favs.</li>
            <li> I know, Four people have made a purchase for their significant others.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a unique scent that will serve you well.</li>
            <li> I have the original and wanted to try this one for special evening occasions.</li>
            <li> and I will use it for special and unique nights...</li>
            <li> This is the best... hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with the price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> He uses it daily so thats a good factor</li>
            <li> Light but powerful</li>
            <li> SMELL GOOD AND LAST FOR A WHILE.</li>
            <li> Full sized bottle, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> and it does fade rather quickly</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR ME IM 28, SMELLS MORE FOR LIKE AN OLDER GENTLEMEN</li>
            <li> I think Night is a more masculine scent than the original.  </li>
            <li> I gave this version a chance for daily use, I&#x27;ve never used the normal obession version but let me say that Im quite happy with the scent</li>
            <li> smelled real good last long</li>
            <li> I also got a bottle of Dark Obsession and liked it much better than this one, so you might look into that one too.</li>
            <li> first time using!</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable and at the time of this review, the free shipping is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s MORE femenine than masculine....  </li>
            <li> Its got a very unique masculine smell to it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband who loves the original Obsession, me not so much</li>
            <li> and I was right about this product.</li>
            <li> One or two sprays in the right area should do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good everyday scent and for special occasion.</li>
            <li> I have used Obsession Night in the past and was always complimented of how great it smells.  </li>
            <li> I where pretty much around the house on weekends when I&#x27;m not doing anything special.</li>
            <li> What I ended up with was a dry smelling cologne (think nicely scented leaves in the fall).</li>
            <li> This product was delivered in a quick manner and packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> The longevity and \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; are below average and their is nothing extraordinary about the bottle or packaging (to be honest, Night is bottled/packaged cheaper than the original), although the darker bottle will provide appeal to some.  </li>
            <li> tried this product before and its essence is very different from the purchased as having more alcohol than scent.</li>
            <li> Both great long lasting scents.</li>
            <li> My female friends love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I did not smell it first.</li>
            <li> In its favor, if there is one, it smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; - very similar to many soap bases.</li>
            <li> As it stands, take my advice - do not even consider buying this w/o testing it first.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Smells better than the regular Obsession.  </li>
            <li> Might smell different on you though, give it a try at the store first to make sure.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a younger cousin or my pre-teen Son that would alleve me of this horrid cologne!</li>
            <li> I like the smell as it gives a light smell comparing the other perfumes with strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent however does not last very long vs original Obsession.</li>
            <li> Well, the first time I sprayed this one, I really didn&#x27;t know what to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The name pretty much gives away when you should wear it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell did not last as a strong aroma throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray</li>
            <li> very manly smell.</li>
            <li> .. mixes really well with my pH</li>
            <li> thanks you</li>
            <li> There is no way that this is real calvin klein.</li>
            <li> I was really dissapointed in the scent, not at all what i was expecting/hoping for.  </li>
            <li> The product got here in a timely manner, wrapped/packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cologne...</li>
            <li> I really have no idea what Obsession Nights scent was.</li>
            <li> Very manly.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapppointed in this product.</li>
            <li> this one seems to be extra nice, I&#x27;m especially please with the price if you bought this in a retail store it would cost $70.00</li>
            <li> This very pleasing cologne is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Just one quick spray to the bare chest does the trick.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I like to be unique and different.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend it when there are other, better colognes out there.</li>
            <li> In my opinion (that and a $1.25 will get you a cup of coffee in some places), the only comparison to the original Obsession is that finishing spicy/musk notes.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle I bought from Amazon and it comes in the original packing.</li>
            <li> For a different and special occasion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less musky and a bit more spicy.</li>
            <li> It has a bold scent that will last for hours.</li>
            <li> It last for the entire day and my girlfriend love it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Part of being a well groomed man is not only to be stylish and dress well; but to smell good also, try this cologne, it will take your game to the next level.</li>
            <li> It is a masculine scent without being as choking and overpowering as something more musky like some other cologne lines out there.</li>
            <li> But this night version just doesn&#x27;t live up to the reputation of its older brother.</li>
            <li> fresh scent that you could use daily ...</li>
            <li> I used Obsession for years in the 90s, then switched to Givenchy PI, but decided this year to look for some new scents.</li>
            <li> New Product</li>
            <li> They might as well give it a new name, but i suspect the name obsession on the bottle is what sells it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But any fragrance smell different on different people, so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t fit my chemistry.</li>
            <li> Not for a very young man.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a bit stronger than the original but not overwhelmingly powerful.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s not too far off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a slight bit sweet, just enough, not too much.  </li>
            <li> nothing like i expected, thought it would be a twist on the original, not a totally different fragrance.</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on this due to the fact that I&#x27;ve never smelled it before and many other reviewers said it was for &amp;#34;older men.&amp;#34; Being in my early twenties, I wanted to have a scent that wasn&#x27;t adolescent nor elderly.</li>
            <li> However if you want a subtle, manly, sexy smell then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Although its not bad, it is nowhere near the scent of plain ole</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on Obsession Night, I normally wouldn&#x27;t order a fragrance without smelling it, However, I&#x27;m a big Calvin Klein fan</li>
            <li> Guys... If you are up for something new, something different - Obsession Night might be your thing...</li>
            <li> Others say the same and not a soul I know says it smells like an old fart.</li>
            <li> I will again in the near future.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d say it was a little more subdued; not too feminine, not long lasting, but not at all offensive like some other CK fragrances.</li>
            <li> This just resolidified my &amp;#34; Why not to blind buy&amp;#34; Now CK Dark Obsession is such a great smelling colone chocolatey,soft,powdery,spicey.</li>
            <li> I really like Dark Obsession for my husband</li>
            <li> Long lasting, masculine smell to it!</li>
            <li> This could be a good or a bad thing depending on what type of person you are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the exact smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the exact smell</li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong, a little more subtle than Original Obsession,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It starts out with a fruit smell to it, but before too long it moves into a warmer musky area.</li>
            <li> Odor stays for long hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually go by what others say about any cologne, but I went on their reviews, and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It has very faint lighter, almost floral scents to help mellow out the stronger, more earthy ones.  </li>
            <li> So I had to try this brand, because I was curious</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for musky smells</li>
            <li> I say it stinks pretty, the next person may not like it!  ??</li>
            <li> It is a lot stronger, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using this for past 5 years and now after my last purchase it went off production!!</li>
            <li> but the flavor is very low, is around the 3 hours and no more..</li>
            <li> Bought this online, trusting that i would like the scent as well as i have my other two Obsession purchases.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are detecting in this scent, but floral is not how I would describe any &amp;#34;note&amp;#34; this puppy hits.  </li>
            <li> Remember that this varies with each person according to the pH of the skin and other features.</li>
            <li> It has to be an imitation (knock off).</li>
            <li> I also bought the Dark cologne.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> All I know is I washed it off after about an hour being on my skin and reapplied my Dark Obsession.</li>
            <li> I have a slight allergy to musk, but had seen where this has vanilla in it.</li>
            <li> , You will not go wrong with this fragrance or the price, I received it within 3 days of purchasing, and I put it on right away, I have been receiving compliments at least twice a day, Woman are continuously asking me what are you wearing?</li>
            <li> It is a little musky smelling and not too over powering.</li>
            <li> disliked</li>
            <li> anywho, I bought this and have been wearing it nearly everyday</li>
            <li> I have bought fragrences online via Macys and never had any trouble returning them.</li>
            <li> This garbage is just plain stinky.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Calvin Klein Obsession products before, but this product seems particularly weak.  </li>
            <li> Vanilla usually offsets the musk for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure how you review a cologne?  </li>
            <li> I usually use it for late nights going out with buddies at the clubs/</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the frig it smelt like,but it was HORREEBLE !</li>
            <li> It begins with a subtle spice and then finishes with notes of musk and vanilla.  </li>
            <li> I were to try and describe it, and I&#x27;m not good at it</li>
            <li> Hard to find!  </li>
            <li> When I received this product, the box was damp and dented and broken.</li>
            <li> The product has to be fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I threw away the box.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel shy to order from this shipper...</li>
            <li> This is a fake or duplicate manufactured in bad taste.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not too crazy about it!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a musky/woodsy/insect repellent smell</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the Night.</li>
            <li> Had to be one of the worst smelling colone that my nose has come across.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not sure this is the real thing.  I have purchased other Calvin Klein Obsession products before, but this product seems particularly weak.  The scent only lasts about an hour before you have to reapply – makes me think this is a knock-off of some sort.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Have always been a fan of Obession and after the purchase of this would definetely purchase again and recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic on my husband, been buying it since it came out.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband who loves the original Obsession, me not so much but...this one smells super! I Recommend!</li>
            <li> It is a well balanced scent.  It has very faint lighter, almost floral scents to help mellow out the stronger, more earthy ones.  It is a masculine scent without being as choking and overpowering as something more musky like some other cologne lines out there.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Obsession For Men so I tried this but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the exact smell but it&#x27;s a musky/woodsy/insect repellent smell and it&#x27;s not getting any compliments from the ladies. Oh well.</li>
            <li> smelled real good last long</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with shipping and product! Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this item about a month ago and for rediculous price. I really like this spray it is a very good dark essence to it. very manly smell.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with the price and fast delivery. I bought this as a gift was would recommend the product and company.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product  This Product is the same as i hope. i am very happy with the product I will  recommend it.</li>
            <li> My friend wanted this so I decided to buy it for his birthday.  He loves the product.  It has a wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> He probado este producto antes y su escencia es muy diferente a la comprada. como si tuviera m&amp;aacute;s alcohol que perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product before and its essence is very different from the purchased as having more alcohol than scent. disliked</li>
            <li> I like this cologne. It is a little musky smelling and not too over powering. I also bought the Dark cologne. I like it much better. They are both good colognes. Amazon does a great job in the purchase and delivery department.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying this is a quite unique scent for me. I used Obsession for years in the 90s, then switched to Givenchy PI, but decided this year to look for some new scents. This one had my full interest since I&#x27;ve always liked the Calvin Klein line of fragrances. Well, the first time I sprayed this one, I really didn&#x27;t know what to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out with a fruit smell to it, but before too long it moves into a warmer musky area. I reviewed another scent recently that was musky. I have a slight allergy to musk, but had seen where this has vanilla in it. Vanilla usually offsets the musk for me. That was the case with this one, but it seems the musk also offset the vanilla. What I ended up with was a dry smelling cologne (think nicely scented leaves in the fall). It&#x27;s not going to become a regular scent for me to use though. My wife was middle of the road with it. Which is how I felt too, but I would still rate it a 4. At least it&#x27;s not offensive. I also got a bottle of Dark Obsession and liked it much better than this one, so you might look into that one too. This Night does have good longevity. I could still smell it on my skin (from one spray) after 10 hours.</li>
            <li> I gave this version a chance for daily use, I&#x27;ve never used the normal obession version but let me say that Im quite happy with the scent, I have quite a big inventory for own use, my gf likes it too, the price was very good and its a big bottle (4.0 ounces) great product, I will keep buying it, for sure!</li>
            <li> My signature cologne is Obsession.. mixes really well with my pH.. I saw this, and said, &amp;#34;Cool, will have to try it&amp;#34;.. It smells nice, but is not as musky as the original...Also doesn&#x27;t mix well with my pH, and that is important with cologne..</li>
            <li> This garbage is just plain stinky. I would wear it elk hunting, but that is all it is good for. There is a pungency reminiscent of urine with this cologne. It will make your loved ones wonder if you have developed an incontinence issue in your life and there is not a snowballs chance in hell you will ever be able to attract or retain a love interest wearing this. It is certainly not it&#x27;s evil twin &amp;#34;Dark Obsession&amp;#34;, which is rather nice. I even find myself attractive just smelling me when I sidle up sporting the latter version.</li>
            <li> Perfect timing. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great price, great product. Odor stays for long hours. I have received several compliments.</li>
            <li> Great item I bought for my brother in law he loved it good size for the price and smells great</li>
            <li> The cologne was a great deal, but it also came with aftershave which I did not notice when I purchased it. If you want to buy cologne or perfume, go to the department stores, find what you like, and then order it on Amazon. You will save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Not sure how you review a cologne?  I guess one could ask the spouse if they like the way it smells?  Mine dislikes most cologne, so I quit asking.  I say it stinks pretty, the next person may not like it!  ??</li>
            <li> Would not buy again - my wife does not like it!</li>
            <li> When my Obsession started to run low, I thought I&#x27;d give Night a try. Although its not bad, it is nowhere near the scent of plain ole Obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to try and describe it, and I&#x27;m not good at it, I&#x27;d say it was a little more subdued; not too feminine, not long lasting, but not at all offensive like some other CK fragrances. It has it&#x27;s own scent, which I find has a hint of coconut smell, although I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any coconut in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I&#x27;ll rebut when it runs out, but I like it enough to wear it. gF likes it as well. I also tried Eternity by CK. I don&#x27;t like it all, and won&#x27;t wear it. GF thinks it smells like big spray. She&#x27;s not too far off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But any fragrance smell different on different people, so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t fit my chemistry. It is a lot stronger, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Obsession still gets my top votes, and has not been unseated as my EDT of choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obsession night for different occasions for years and like it.  I&#x27;m glad i can now get it through amazon.  Makes it a lot easier to replace when I run out.</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on this due to the fact that I&#x27;ve never smelled it before and many other reviewers said it was for &amp;#34;older men.&amp;#34; Being in my early twenties, I wanted to have a scent that wasn&#x27;t adolescent nor elderly. Furthermore, I like to be unique and different. Not everyone should smell like adidas or whatnot. anywho, I bought this and have been wearing it nearly everyday and I love it. Others say the same and not a soul I know says it smells like an old fart. Thank you Calvin Klein for making me smell like a man.</li>
            <li> excellent product, has affordable, good presentation, I would not hesitate to recommend the purchase of this product to anyone who likes good fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is the best... hard to find.  Hope it never goes away!</li>
            <li> Smells Great!  New Product first time using! Part of being a well groomed man is not only to be stylish and dress well; but to smell good also, try this cologne, it will take your game to the next level.</li>
            <li> I choose 5 stars, because it did get my expectation. The item arrived on time and was exactily what I was waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like with Amazon I don&#x27;t have a complain. You&#x27;re doing a great job.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Have been using this for past 5 years and now after my last purchase it went off production!! Very nice smell</li>
            <li> I just love the scent of Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession Night. It has a bold scent that will last for hours. My father is a cancer nurse and is always running around for 14 hours a day so he uses strong cologne to keep him from smelling good (he sweats a lot). So after getting him Obsession for Christmas, I decided to get him Obsession Night for Fathers Day. Both great long lasting scents.</li>
            <li> I am always getting compliments from women when I wear Obsession for Men. But this night version just doesn&#x27;t live up to the reputation of its older brother. Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> so so cool i love it thanks you alot i love shopping onlice because i get the best things ever</li>
            <li> good price. I will again in the near future.</li>
            <li> My female friends love the scent.  What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li> More of a musk smell, still enjoyable by the ladys.  I would recommend.  Great price, it is x3 more in stores.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great cologne</li>
            <li> good perfum, bou i think the perfum is so better but the flavor is very low, is around the 3 hours and no more..</li>
            <li> it is very light which is what I want. it stays almost the entire 8 hours i spend at work</li>
            <li> I have Obsession so I thought I would give this one a try. It&#x27;s ok but not as good as Obsession. I where pretty much around the house on weekends when I&#x27;m not doing anything special.</li>
            <li> Great product, service and on time.I definitely recommend it. I like the fragrance and the package was perfect. I do like it.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!!!! There is no substitute for a woman loving the her man smells!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite obsession , it can be worn anytime and is not overpowering , and the price is right!!!</li>
            <li> i have only used Obsession then i seen Obession Night tryed it smells great will be getting more</li>
            <li> good aroma and i like this i love&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> There is no way that this is real calvin klein. It has to be an imitation (knock off). The scent only lasts maybe 30 minutes after you spray it on. after a couple of months i find myself spraying 10-12 mists just to get some scent. The product has to be fake.</li>
            <li> So-So scent.  It used to be a nice fragrance for men.  I can&#x27;t recommend it when there are other, better colognes out there.</li>
            <li> It a good buy but aroma is not as strong as I would like it.  Otherwise it may be best to go to your trusted Nordstrom&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> I wear this cologne since years ago, and Amazon has it for a great price and definitely excellent quality. It last for the entire day and my girlfriend love it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of Amazon reputation. This is a fake or duplicate manufactured in bad taste. Unfortunately I threw away the box. Otherwise the product will be returned.</li>
            <li> Great price, nice smell but I&#x27;m not too crazy about it! What i like is that its a big bottle so it lasts my husband a while. He uses it daily so thats a good factor</li>
            <li> Bought this online, trusting that i would like the scent as well as i have my other two Obsession purchases. I knew in advance that this product would not be returnable, but again, i trusted the brand.  I was really dissapointed in the scent, not at all what i was expecting/hoping for.  The product got here in a timely manner, wrapped/packaged very well.  Guess i am dissapointed in the no return policy.  I have bought fragrences online via Macys and never had any trouble returning them. Lesson learned</li>
            <li> It smells very nice. Very good gift. It makes any young man happy. An excellent choice. Gift it to your dad,your son, and your boss?&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I always buy the original Obession for men. So I had to try this brand, because I was curious and I was right about this product. It is a great smelling colon for men. I enjoyed wearing. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne... I read a previous remark \\&quot;its for older men\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know what the hell that means?&lt;br /&gt;anyway it&#x27;s great like all of Calvins Cologne.  I have found you have been safe with any of C.K. colognes.  I have never found a Cologne by Calvin Klein I didn&#x27;t like... this one seems to be extra nice, I&#x27;m especially please with the price if you bought this in a retail store it would cost $70.00</li>
            <li> I really like Dark Obsession for my husband so I thought I would get him some Night as a gift.  I did not smell it first. My mistake.  I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are detecting in this scent, but floral is not how I would describe any &amp;#34;note&amp;#34; this puppy hits.  In its favor, if there is one, it smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; - very similar to many soap bases. If it were a pleasant and attractive scent - the fact that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t last would be a &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34;.  As it stands, take my advice - do not even consider buying this w/o testing it first.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell, great price, use it for all occasions....thinking of buying another one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Light but powerful and it does fade rather quickly but its liked by many women.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent!  My husband does as well.</li>
            <li> Another one of my personal colection smells so goooooooood</li>
            <li> Hard to find!  The best!</li>
            <li> This great product smells awesome. The scent last well into the day. Great buy! Full sized bottle, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular Obsession for men for 20 years, thought I&#x27;d try this, it&#x27;s too strong and would gag a maggot!</li>
            <li> Guys... If you are up for something new, something different - Obsession Night might be your thing... It begins with a subtle spice and then finishes with notes of musk and vanilla.  In my opinion (that and a $1.25 will get you a cup of coffee in some places), the only comparison to the original Obsession is that finishing spicy/musk notes.  I think Night is a more masculine scent than the original.  You be the judge.  The price is very affordable and at the time of this review, the free shipping is a bonus.  The longevity and \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; are below average and their is nothing extraordinary about the bottle or packaging (to be honest, Night is bottled/packaged cheaper than the original), although the darker bottle will provide appeal to some.  If you are a collector and want something different/new/unique, pick it up.  How &#x27;bout 4.1 stars out of 5.. Never settle in life...</li>
            <li> This fragrance SHOULD BE MARKETED AS UNISEX.. It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the exact smell but it&#x27;s MORE femenine than masculine....  and I AM not getting any compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find so I am very glad that it&#x27;s still on Amazon. This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne and when he ran out he was bummed he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I bought this for him for Christmas and he was very happy. I love the sent myself, it&#x27;s not overpowering and very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Smells better than the regular Obsession.  It&#x27;s less musky and a bit more spicy. It has a strong smell that lasts.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and of course, my wife likes it. I have been using it regularly and not only during occasions.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR ME IM 28, SMELLS MORE FOR LIKE AN OLDER GENTLEMEN SO I GAVE IT TO MY DAD WHO IS 50, AND HE LOVED IT, THANKS! :)</li>
            <li> nice perfum for a nice price, you can use it everytime and everywhere, I recommend it 100% for all we can a nice fragance</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I thought it would be good to try it! Well it didn&#x27;t disappoint, however the scent isn&#x27;t that strong!</li>
            <li> I love Calvin Klein Product,and was looking for this one for very long time it is not one of his best ,but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this one, never smelled it before.  I am so glad that I my husband and I both like it.</li>
            <li> I liked this ok but the smell does not linger.  I still like the org. Obession.  Try CK  Encounter.  You will like.</li>
            <li> I love it, purchased it as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my fiance and he loved it also.  It smells so nice and very sensual.  I am definitely &amp;#34;OBSESSED&amp;#34; with it. Def recommend!!</li>
            <li> You can smell a lot of the classic \\&quot;Obsession\\&quot; fragrance in the background of this one, but the overall scent has been upgraded to smell more modern and it has some nice light smelling notes that make it a great summer alternative to the heavier original Obsession.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly different fragrance to it than the regular Obsession. A more subdued aroma to it. I sometimes wear it during the day when I go to to work and women DO notice it and love it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the frig it smelt like,but it was HORREEBLE ! I purchased it TJ Max for $30.00 Had to be one of the worst smelling colone that my nose has come across. This just resolidified my &amp;#34; Why not to blind buy&amp;#34; Now CK Dark Obsession is such a great smelling colone chocolatey,soft,powdery,spicey. The two are solar systems apart. I really have no idea what Obsession Nights scent was. All I know is I washed it off after about an hour being on my skin and reapplied my Dark Obsession. Very disappointed in the Night.</li>
            <li> Obsession Night by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray is a very good product at a very great price.</li>
            <li> It is a product of excellent quality and price was axactamente what you buy good expectation the aroma of the product is ideal for my</li>
            <li> good fragrance, came in time stated</li>
            <li> Have used it for years. Very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price, but the fragrance is not!</li>
            <li> Great smell for a great price. I don&#x27;t usually go by what others say about any cologne, but I went on their reviews, and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get this fragrance in the department stores - had to buy it online. It&#x27;s better than the newer Obsession fragrances that are on store shelves.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I am always complimented on the way i smell. Just one quick spray to the bare chest does the trick.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for the price. Long lasting, masculine smell to it! came in on time. It was a gift and he was satisfy with the smell.</li>
            <li> Good value ... smells very nice ... one of my favorite colognes now ... not overpowering ... fresh scent that you could use daily ... I use weekly</li>
            <li> never heard of this one before, so wanted to try it since the original is one of my all time favs. nothing like i expected, thought it would be a twist on the original, not a totally different fragrance. They might as well give it a new name, but i suspect the name obsession on the bottle is what sells it. this reminds me of the nonscented incense sticks (punks) that you buy at the firecracker stand, they dont have a fragrance, but they do have a smell to them, burning sawdust/woodchips, thats it !!  I guess some people might like that. I dont.</li>
            <li> I have the original and wanted to try this one for special evening occasions. Very pleased with this new scent. It seems to be a bit stronger than the original but not overwhelmingly powerful. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> were very good my products, this again could buy more, provided the committee recommends .. the quality is awesome .. thank you very much</li>
            <li> JUST GOT IT. NEVER TRIED IT BEFORE. GREAT BUY.. I&#x27;M VERY PLEASED WITH THIS. SMELL GOOD AND LAST FOR A WHILE. (4-5 HRS)</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on Obsession Night, I normally wouldn&#x27;t order a fragrance without smelling it, However, I&#x27;m a big Calvin Klein fan, You will not go wrong with this fragrance or the price, I received it within 3 days of purchasing, and I put it on right away, I have been receiving compliments at least twice a day, Woman are continuously asking me what are you wearing? I tell them and the next thing I know, Four people have made a purchase for their significant others. I will be buying Obsession Night again,, Great for any man, and a super gift for the Holidays, It stays on and lasts all day, Can&#x27;t go wrong, a little more subtle than Original Obsession, Nice refreshing undertones  and judging by my friends responce&#x27;s a must for any mans fragrance collection!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazon recommended this when I bought the regular Obsession for men.  I wasn&#x27;t sure, but took the risk and am so glad I did.  It has a very nice smell.  Just a slight bit sweet, just enough, not too much.  I&#x27;m not much for musky smells and this is great. My husband likes it too, which of course is a plus.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume. I like it. Its got a very unique masculine smell to it. not fruity at all. totally recommended for all.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction, item as described, quick turnaround and great packaging.  I had never tried this men&#x27;s cologne before since I use Obsession for Men, but I liked it for a change of pace.  Not overpowering in scent.</li>
            <li> I know some folks who like it a lot but on me it has a dill smell, after a couple minutes that smell dies off and it smell pretty good but the dill effect lingers in my mind. Might smell different on you though, give it a try at the store first to make sure.</li>
            <li> I have known about Obsession night by CK for some time and have always planned on buying it. Once i finally made the move and bought it i have not regretted it. This is definitely a unique scent that will serve you well. The name pretty much gives away when you should wear it. I usually use it for late nights going out with buddies at the clubs/lounges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the smell as somewhat seductive. Very elegant. Very manly. It smells of suede, and nutmeg, maybe vanilla. It is very sexy. Perhaps what impressed me the most is that it smelled very unique. There werent many colognes that smelled like this that i could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell did not last as a strong aroma throughout the night. However if someone did give you a hug or kiss they definitely could still smell it. This could be a good or a bad thing depending on what type of person you are. If you want people smelling you as you walk by then you may need to spray more of this. However if you want a subtle, manly, sexy smell then this is for you. One or two sprays in the right area should do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something different in men&#x27;s cologne, look no further. This very pleasing cologne is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of Obsession. It&#x27;s not overpowering but stays around. A good everyday scent and for special occasion. Not for a very young man.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough great things about this purchase.  Arrived in perfect condition, and doesn&#x27;t appear to be a knock-off.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the smell as it gives a light smell comparing the other perfumes with strong smell.  This is my second bottle I bought from Amazon and it comes in the original packing.</li>
            <li> Everyone has commented this does not smell good - need to stick with the original Obsession and avoid the Night</li>
            <li> Great Product &amp; super speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I love to smell this cologne on my husband</li>
            <li> I have always loved Obsession. I don&#x27;t understand what happened with this scent. I decided to take a chance and I am displeased with the smell. In fact, I said well maybe I was going through something so let me just try and wear it again to see if I would change my mind. You guessed it, nope. I wish I could return it but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a younger cousin or my pre-teen Son that would alleve me of this horrid cologne!</li>
            <li> mild but very pleasant.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the box was damp and dented and broken. When I opened up the product i saw that the cologne was cracked and leaking everywhere. Once i taped up the bottle I really only got 1 ounce out of it. I was very dissapppointed in this product.</li>
            <li> excellent product, has affordable, good presentation, I would not hesitate to recommend the purchase of this product to anyone who likes good fragrances.</li>
            <li> Nice scent however does not last very long vs original Obsession.</li>
            <li> I have used Obsession Night in the past and was always complimented of how great it smells.  This product was delivered in a quick manner and packaged very well.  It is extremeley a great price for the amount of cologne you&#x27;re getting.  Don&#x27;t feel shy to order from this shipper...</li>
            <li> The aroma is ideal for the night but short. Remember that this varies with each person according to the pH of the skin and other features.</li>
            <li> For a different and special occasion. It is a very special eau de toilette for me. I really love it and I will use it for special and unique nights...I am very glad to have it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t my favorite scent. My wife didn&#x27;t like it and it mysteriously disappeared; I didn&#x27;t ask.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my Calvin Klein - Euphoria which we both like a lot.</li>
