            <li>Something like their bright auburn.  </li>
            <li>I have always had good luck with this product</li>
            <li>Blends well and looks good with darker hair tones.</li>
            <li>The conditioner seems really good as well.</li>
            <li>Good choice for a semi permanent color.</li>

            <li>I love this hair color!</li>
            <li>I love it and will use it again!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and my hair does not feel as if I have been dying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can do this on my own or</li>
            <li>Absolutely thrilled with this</li>
            <li>Instead, it came out rather a brighter orange than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>She, of course, is absolutely thrilled with it</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a separate sample included to perform the recommended test.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Application was very easy, however.</li>
            <li>The color is bright and the coconut oil does help smooth frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The best thing about Clairol Natural Instincts and this product is how it smoothens the hair afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I fumbled a bit with the application, but I think that was more my own inexperience rather than an issue with the product itself.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is really nice and her hair just smelled like the conditioner afterwards, not like the strong peroxide/chemical smell that used to be the norm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is something I have used many times before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very beautiful red color and covered gray hair better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I have my husband spot-check to make sure I don&#x27;t miss any of the baby-fine hairs along the hairline</li>
            <li>I love the coconut oil conditioner included.  </li>
            <li>most gray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it to be bright and colorful with depth.</li>
            <li>and I plan to order more.</li>
            <li>If you like bright and fun reds, this might be the color for you.</li>
            <li>Well, most of it.</li>
            <li>The top of her hair was redder than the backs and sides, her hair is more than shoulder length.</li>
            <li>application process itself was ok.</li>
            <li>color red is probably best suited for those with darker color brown hair and not a lot of gray.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>What I really like is how great this made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My hair felt luxuriously healthy.</li>
            <li>It has shine and really looks great.</li>
            <li>It is very colorful!</li>
            <li>hair is light brown, very fine, and in a pixie cut.  </li>
            <li>Works quickly, all you do have to do is rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more vibrant and bright than the photo on the package.  </li>
            <li>Clairol Natural Instincts Crema Keratina Hair Color is a very nice product to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to mix?&lt;br /&gt;Sort</li>
            <li>During the rinse phase, it came off okay, but I had to use some soap to really clean forehead and ears.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine, but</li>
            <li>#3?&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner worked fine, leaving hair feeling silky and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a little drippy during application but the results are awesome!</li>
            <li>The important thing is the results and overall my wife was happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant to put on really light hair, though,</li>
            <li>dye turned my light brown hair brassy and orange.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend anyone with light brown hair to use it unless they want orange.</li>
            <li>I am happy to see that this Medium Red /Raspberry</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous haircolor.</li>
            <li>but not least, the way my hair feels after using this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is a lot of fun if you want to change your hair color on a temporary basis!  </li>
            <li>Just be aware the more gray you try to cover, the redder it will be there.</li>
            <li>and she loved the light red color it applies.</li>
            <li>hair is in the medium/dark brown range, so i wasn&#x27;t sure how much of an effect i would get.</li>
            <li>say it actually looked really good. . .</li>
            <li>just look cool).</li>
            <li>just look cool).</li>
            <li>At this point I was not feeling good about the final color, and I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, this seems to be true of all dyes I have tried, so I can&#x27;t knock a star off for that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s faded a lot and isn&#x27;t so bright any more, but two and a half months after using the dye, she has noticeable roots.  </li>
            <li>The colors come out rich and vibrant, and hold up fairly well, though you have to make a conscious effort not to overwash your hair, even with dye friendly shampoos.</li>
            <li>This is perfect to use all the time and especially if you have used a stronger colorant that has left your hair damaged.</li>
            <li>If you care more than i do (i just wanted something interesting), definitely do the strand</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the hair which is important if you are like me and color your hair often.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I really like how easy to use this was.</li>
            <li>The raspberry red color was very vibrant at first and looked great.</li>
            <li>This is a very good red, a true red and not auburn.</li>
            <li>I have tried three of these brands and this has to be my favorite color so far!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It seemingly never stops washing out the first time you rinse your hair!</li>
            <li>Natural Instincts hair colors are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to use this on top of prior red coloring.</li>
            <li>but I am not crazy about the idea of her using a permanent dye.  </li>
            <li>Stays right where I put it.</li>
            <li>This is the hair dye I am using right now in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I blame myself, as my hair is a dark blonde and this color works best on darker hair for that raspberry effect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad or overly bright red, just a little redder on top than the rest.</li>
            <li>But like I said, certainly if you are into more natural hair colors or products then yes, you will probably like this brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So while we were happy with the outcome and the ease of use, I can only give this product 4 stars because the final color was not what is represented on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>new version (Crema Keratina) takes 20 minutes instead of the 10 minutes with the original version.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time colorer, I recommend this.</li>
            <li>This is a shade I would love to use in winter for it to last longer!</li>
            <li>This color is temporary so it will wash out after about a month, or 28 washings, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the results overall.  </li>
            <li>Using this line of products was my first time coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly, I could have put some Vaseline around the edges of my hairline to ensure there was no leek over, but I didn&#x27;t and still got a bunch of color on my skin.</li>
            <li>We followed the package directions exactly for mixing and applying the colorant.  </li>
            <li>Turned out exactly as color chart showed.</li>
            <li>Now, the raspberry color actually gives my hair a sheen that makes it appear to be more</li>
            <li>My hair was is curly and needs lots of conditioner and deep conditions to stay healthy.</li>
            <li>color looks pretty close to what it looks like on the box</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear and easy to understand, and anyone who&#x27;s ever colored their hair will pretty much know the drill with this one as well.</li>
            <li>I did use a damp paper towel to remove as much coloring from her skin as I could right after the application, so that probably helped.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely silky smooth and so soft even to the ends.</li>
            <li>When I had the chance to try Clairol Natural Instincts in Medium Red, I knew my daughter would be thrilled.  </li>
            <li>And since I have short hair, it will be easy to re-color to another shade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair will feel super soft after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: For best results when covering white/gray hair, leave the product on for AT LEAST an hour (as long as you don&#x27;t feel any burning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result is a shade or two oranger than the box suggests, especially on the fine hairs at my temples.</li>
            <li>It covered her gray hair, and gave a nice little shine</li>
            <li>They are gentle and my hair feels softer after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;OVERALL: Having it so the colors mix easier would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>, I give this a 5-star.d be appreciated.</li>
            <li>She saw this and thought it could color the gray, and do the same light tint.</li>
            <li>Like all red shades it faded pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and left my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t turn my hair an orangey color, and still have a deep, rich reddish brown color like I hoped for.</li>
            <li>I mostly have very curly, dark hair.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found a red bright enough to stand out!</li>
            <li>Even my dogs didn&#x27;t mind hanging around me during the wait time and that is highly unusual because, normally, when I have dye in my hair, they tend to stay away.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found my new at home hair dye!  </li>
            <li>Color looks slightly pink in the bottle and looks the same way on the hair once done but still blends nicely with darker tones.</li>
            <li>It produces a decent color.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice anything different than with the original version of Natural Instincts brand.</li>
            <li>This is a vibrant but not crazy red.</li>
            <li>This dye is just as easy to use as any other.</li>
            <li>you will not see red per se, just a shine of red under certain lighting, but depending on how the light shifts you&#x27;ll get continual highlights of it</li>
            <li>Still, my hair holds color really well despite this weird detail and so far, three weeks in, this is still a great color.</li>
            <li>so if you have  more than a few grays here</li>
            <li>hair color follows all the normal directions:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a fun, overall burgundy tint to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally color my hair every 2 months, so I jumped at the chance to try this.</li>
            <li>This color is brighter than i normally use, but it works well now that it is spring.</li>
            <li>and he asked me if I was using a new type of dye.</li>
            <li>and it works giving a rich vibrant deep red color.</li>
            <li>but it looks natural and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I still had an old shirt and old towel on my shoulders just in case, but no drip through the whole thing&lt;</li>
            <li>Apparently it colored the gray hair a bit more than her dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li>The color is vibrant and my hair is soft after dying.</li>
            <li>If you care deeply about exactly what color your hair ends up, you should probably be going to a stylist, not buying dye and applying it yourself.</li>
            <li>, you might want to cover your pillow with a towel the first night or two after dying (and possible the night after each weekly conditioning with the included product), as there is some residue that&#x27;ll transfer onto the pillowcase.</li>
            <li>My hair did not come out the rich, deep red on the box.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Caution - this color is VERY RED (which is exactly what i wanted)</li>
            <li>This is my first attempt at coloring the white strands around my temples.</li>
            <li>it is usually an indication to me that it is not going to be able to do that job as was the case here.  </li>
            <li>first night by following the directions and rinsing till water ran clear, then</li>
            <li>I am naturally a brunette that has gray hair as well.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous to use this shade since it was such a change</li>
            <li>Ha, this 82 year old guy is getting comments galore here.  </li>
            <li>in my case I had my 11yr old daughter help me.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old has been asking to color her hair for months</li>
            <li>Just something to consider if you plan to use this product; you may have red hair for much longer than 30 days.er if you plan to use this product; you may have red hair for much longer than 30 days.</li>
            <li>We eventually bought a professional hair color stripper to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, there was no odor from the dye since it is ammonia-free, and my hair is still soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Creme hair color turned these strands completely red--no brassy orange, here.</li>
            <li>By the time she was done and had it dried, it was a bit more red than she thought.</li>
            <li>Her hair feels very soft and I appreciate that her color will gradually revert back to normal just in time for her to start looking for a summer</li>
            <li>kit is very easy to use and takes less time than my other kits I have been using for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>Usually a medium red dye gives her back a  nice auburn color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though only people who might not be satisfied are those with heavy gray, semi-permanent isn&#x27;t enough to cover those.</li>
            <li>As with most red dyes I&#x27;ve used, it bled out for a few washings after the initial rinse.</li>
            <li>I normally use a different brand, but was offered this to try.</li>
            <li>When I usually dye my hair red, I want a very fire engine red and because my hair is naturally brown, I need a strong product to make it very red.</li>
            <li>Styling my hair was a breeze and the next morning I wasn&#x27;t the least bit worried that someone would be able to smell the residue of hair dye chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is designed not to be too harsh on your hair, and that it adds a bit of fun pop to hair that&#x27;s already fairly dark and kind of hard to color.</li>
            <li>Even when the water is clear with each one, somehow come next time</li>
            <li>It is a lot healthier than the hair colors of old, and &amp;#34;demi permanent&amp;#34; (which apparently means it will last about 28 washings)</li>
            <li>so you will go back to your natural color eventually.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it quite as much as my regular color, even on my rather grown out roots and natural color there.</li>
            <li>The final color is much brighter than I expected and would never be mistaken for a natural color.  </li>
            <li>This product is geared I believe those who have preexisting red hair either by dye or naturally.  </li>
            <li>appreciate that the dye wasn&#x27;t terribly hard to clean off of my skin (a family member who assisted me slathered it all over my neck and forehead</li>
            <li>When I was younger I would use type 3 red hair dyes and my hair would fade (which is normal with red hair dye) and the dye would leave my hair brittle.</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to do and the product is thick enough that we didn&#x27;t have any drips to deal with.  </li>
            <li>and I always have trouble finding the right red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was actually worried that this product might burn due to the dryness of my scalp, however, I was amazed at how gentle this was.</li>
            <li>Is a rich yet subtle raspberry/red color.</li>

            <li>I have a small streak of white in my bangs that looks a little more orangy.  </li>

            <li> What I really like is how great this made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My hair felt luxuriously healthy.</li>
            <li> It has shine and really looks great.</li>
            <li> It is very colorful!</li>
            <li> hair is light brown, very fine, and in a pixie cut.  </li>
            <li> Works quickly, all you do have to do is rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more vibrant and bright than the photo on the package.  </li>
            <li> Clairol Natural Instincts Crema Keratina Hair Color is a very nice product to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to mix?&lt;br /&gt;Sort</li>
            <li> During the rinse phase, it came off okay, but I had to use some soap to really clean forehead and ears.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> and it was fine, but</li>
            <li> #3?&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner worked fine, leaving hair feeling silky and</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a little drippy during application but the results are awesome!</li>
            <li> The important thing is the results and overall my wife was happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not meant to put on really light hair, though,</li>
            <li> dye turned my light brown hair brassy and orange.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone with light brown hair to use it unless they want orange.</li>
            <li> I am happy to see that this Medium Red /Raspberry</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous haircolor.</li>
            <li> but not least, the way my hair feels after using this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is a lot of fun if you want to change your hair color on a temporary basis!  </li>
            <li> Just be aware the more gray you try to cover, the redder it will be there.</li>
            <li> and she loved the light red color it applies.</li>
            <li> hair is in the medium/dark brown range, so i wasn&#x27;t sure how much of an effect i would get.</li>
            <li> say it actually looked really good. . .</li>
            <li> just look cool).</li>
            <li> just look cool).</li>
            <li> At this point I was not feeling good about the final color, and I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, this seems to be true of all dyes I have tried, so I can&#x27;t knock a star off for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faded a lot and isn&#x27;t so bright any more, but two and a half months after using the dye, she has noticeable roots.  </li>
            <li> The colors come out rich and vibrant, and hold up fairly well, though you have to make a conscious effort not to overwash your hair, even with dye friendly shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is perfect to use all the time and especially if you have used a stronger colorant that has left your hair damaged.</li>
            <li> If you care more than i do (i just wanted something interesting), definitely do the strand</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the hair which is important if you are like me and color your hair often.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> I really like how easy to use this was.</li>
            <li> The raspberry red color was very vibrant at first and looked great.</li>
            <li> This is a very good red, a true red and not auburn.</li>
            <li> I have tried three of these brands and this has to be my favorite color so far!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It seemingly never stops washing out the first time you rinse your hair!</li>
            <li> Natural Instincts hair colors are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to use this on top of prior red coloring.</li>
            <li> but I am not crazy about the idea of her using a permanent dye.  </li>
            <li> Stays right where I put it.</li>
            <li> This is the hair dye I am using right now in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I blame myself, as my hair is a dark blonde and this color works best on darker hair for that raspberry effect.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad or overly bright red, just a little redder on top than the rest.</li>
            <li> But like I said, certainly if you are into more natural hair colors or products then yes, you will probably like this brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So while we were happy with the outcome and the ease of use, I can only give this product 4 stars because the final color was not what is represented on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> new version (Crema Keratina) takes 20 minutes instead of the 10 minutes with the original version.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time colorer, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a shade I would love to use in winter for it to last longer!</li>
            <li> This color is temporary so it will wash out after about a month, or 28 washings, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the results overall.  </li>
            <li> Using this line of products was my first time coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> exactly, I could have put some Vaseline around the edges of my hairline to ensure there was no leek over, but I didn&#x27;t and still got a bunch of color on my skin.</li>
            <li> We followed the package directions exactly for mixing and applying the colorant.  </li>
            <li> Turned out exactly as color chart showed.</li>
            <li> Now, the raspberry color actually gives my hair a sheen that makes it appear to be more</li>
            <li> My hair was is curly and needs lots of conditioner and deep conditions to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> color looks pretty close to what it looks like on the box</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and easy to understand, and anyone who&#x27;s ever colored their hair will pretty much know the drill with this one as well.</li>
            <li> I did use a damp paper towel to remove as much coloring from her skin as I could right after the application, so that probably helped.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely silky smooth and so soft even to the ends.</li>
            <li> When I had the chance to try Clairol Natural Instincts in Medium Red, I knew my daughter would be thrilled.  </li>
            <li> And since I have short hair, it will be easy to re-color to another shade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair will feel super soft after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : For best results when covering white/gray hair, leave the product on for AT LEAST an hour (as long as you don&#x27;t feel any burning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result is a shade or two oranger than the box suggests, especially on the fine hairs at my temples.</li>
            <li> It covered her gray hair, and gave a nice little shine</li>
            <li> They are gentle and my hair feels softer after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OVERALL: Having it so the colors mix easier would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> , I give this a 5-star.d be appreciated.</li>
            <li> She saw this and thought it could color the gray, and do the same light tint.</li>
            <li> Like all red shades it faded pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and left my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t turn my hair an orangey color, and still have a deep, rich reddish brown color like I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I mostly have very curly, dark hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a red bright enough to stand out!</li>
            <li> Even my dogs didn&#x27;t mind hanging around me during the wait time and that is highly unusual because, normally, when I have dye in my hair, they tend to stay away.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found my new at home hair dye!  </li>
            <li> Color looks slightly pink in the bottle and looks the same way on the hair once done but still blends nicely with darker tones.</li>
            <li> It produces a decent color.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice anything different than with the original version of Natural Instincts brand.</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant but not crazy red.</li>
            <li> This dye is just as easy to use as any other.</li>
            <li> you will not see red per se, just a shine of red under certain lighting, but depending on how the light shifts you&#x27;ll get continual highlights of it</li>
            <li> Still, my hair holds color really well despite this weird detail and so far, three weeks in, this is still a great color.</li>
            <li> so if you have  more than a few grays here</li>
            <li> hair color follows all the normal directions:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a fun, overall burgundy tint to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally color my hair every 2 months, so I jumped at the chance to try this.</li>
            <li> This color is brighter than i normally use, but it works well now that it is spring.</li>
            <li> and he asked me if I was using a new type of dye.</li>
            <li> and it works giving a rich vibrant deep red color.</li>
            <li> but it looks natural and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I still had an old shirt and old towel on my shoulders just in case, but no drip through the whole thing&lt;</li>
            <li> Apparently it colored the gray hair a bit more than her dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> The color is vibrant and my hair is soft after dying.</li>
            <li> If you care deeply about exactly what color your hair ends up, you should probably be going to a stylist, not buying dye and applying it yourself.</li>
            <li> , you might want to cover your pillow with a towel the first night or two after dying (and possible the night after each weekly conditioning with the included product), as there is some residue that&#x27;ll transfer onto the pillowcase.</li>
            <li> My hair did not come out the rich, deep red on the box.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Caution - this color is VERY RED (which is exactly what i wanted)</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at coloring the white strands around my temples.</li>
            <li> it is usually an indication to me that it is not going to be able to do that job as was the case here.  </li>
            <li> first night by following the directions and rinsing till water ran clear, then</li>
            <li> I am naturally a brunette that has gray hair as well.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous to use this shade since it was such a change</li>
            <li> Ha, this 82 year old guy is getting comments galore here.  </li>
            <li> in my case I had my 11yr old daughter help me.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old has been asking to color her hair for months</li>
            <li> Just something to consider if you plan to use this product; you may have red hair for much longer than 30 days.er if you plan to use this product; you may have red hair for much longer than 30 days.</li>
            <li> We eventually bought a professional hair color stripper to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, there was no odor from the dye since it is ammonia-free, and my hair is still soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Creme hair color turned these strands completely red--no brassy orange, here.</li>
            <li> By the time she was done and had it dried, it was a bit more red than she thought.</li>
            <li> Her hair feels very soft and I appreciate that her color will gradually revert back to normal just in time for her to start looking for a summer</li>
            <li> kit is very easy to use and takes less time than my other kits I have been using for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> Usually a medium red dye gives her back a  nice auburn color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though only people who might not be satisfied are those with heavy gray, semi-permanent isn&#x27;t enough to cover those.</li>
            <li> As with most red dyes I&#x27;ve used, it bled out for a few washings after the initial rinse.</li>
            <li> I normally use a different brand, but was offered this to try.</li>
            <li> When I usually dye my hair red, I want a very fire engine red and because my hair is naturally brown, I need a strong product to make it very red.</li>
            <li> Styling my hair was a breeze and the next morning I wasn&#x27;t the least bit worried that someone would be able to smell the residue of hair dye chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is designed not to be too harsh on your hair, and that it adds a bit of fun pop to hair that&#x27;s already fairly dark and kind of hard to color.</li>
            <li> Even when the water is clear with each one, somehow come next time</li>
            <li> It is a lot healthier than the hair colors of old, and &amp;#34;demi permanent&amp;#34; (which apparently means it will last about 28 washings)</li>
            <li> so you will go back to your natural color eventually.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it quite as much as my regular color, even on my rather grown out roots and natural color there.</li>
            <li> The final color is much brighter than I expected and would never be mistaken for a natural color.  </li>
            <li> This product is geared I believe those who have preexisting red hair either by dye or naturally.  </li>
            <li> appreciate that the dye wasn&#x27;t terribly hard to clean off of my skin (a family member who assisted me slathered it all over my neck and forehead</li>
            <li> When I was younger I would use type 3 red hair dyes and my hair would fade (which is normal with red hair dye) and the dye would leave my hair brittle.</li>
            <li> It was easy enough to do and the product is thick enough that we didn&#x27;t have any drips to deal with.  </li>
            <li> and I always have trouble finding the right red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was actually worried that this product might burn due to the dryness of my scalp, however, I was amazed at how gentle this was.</li>
            <li> Is a rich yet subtle raspberry/red color.</li>
            <li> daughter has naturally auburn hair and has been using red hair color for some time to cover the creeping grey.</li>
            <li> I have a small streak of white in my bangs that looks a little more orangy.  </li>
            <li> Hair does not feel damaged or extra dry afterwards and color looks fairly natural (except florescent/neon highlights. .</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel damaged or extra dry afterwards and color looks fairly natural (except florescent/neon highlights. .</li>
            <li> Next time I buy this product, and there will absolutely be a next time, I&#x27;ll buy a shade slightly darker than I would normally choose and see if that gives me the results I had hoped for this time.</li>
            <li> The colorant is thick so it doesn&#x27;t splatter when I put it on, clean up is minimal.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was leery about becoming &amp;#34;married to the bottle&amp;#34; and my hair turning into a birds nest from the chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The girl who cuts her hair said because her hair is on the lighter side and isn&#x27;t usually dyed, it really soaked in the color.  </li>
            <li> Since I just applied it this week I don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Red Medium RR5 colored my hair well and the grey hair had almost a florescent highlight effect.</li>
            <li> but since I started going grey, I have wanted to go red.</li>
            <li> This stretched my curls out (so I didn&#x27;t have to take extra time to detangle them), but it left my hair looking dry.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, with no drips, so it is a little less messy.</li>
            <li> and if it is similar to my usual color, I think I have found a new brand.</li>
            <li> She had some left, and actually applied it to the back hoping it would even it out a little, but it doesn&#x27;t look like it did any</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t color your hair much, it&#x27;s going to feel clumsy anyway.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that I normally color a dark burgundy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the least harsh dye brands I&#x27;ve tried , it did leave my hair soft and very glossy.</li>
            <li> The concern for which I&#x27;m dinging it a star is that grey hair is dyed to look like copper wire with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can see why it would be a bit overdone if it were put onto grey.</li>
            <li> Coloring grey hair?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as I continue to dye my hair.</li>
            <li> warning: if you&#x27;re looking to cover grey, you need a product specifically for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always done 20 minutes anyway so that the color last longer as I usually use red and red fades faster.</li>
            <li> but the other shades washed out faster only because I shower twice a day in summer.</li>
            <li> have some concerns because my forehead is still a little red and just a tiny bit tingly the day after</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t smell as awful as some other brands when it is in use and rinses out easily at the end.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s specifically designed for dark hair and will blend away greys and give hair an extra color boost.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see why a guy like me couldn&#x27;t use this, and the result is red highlights in my dark brown hair and even beard.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot and since there were no definite negative aspects (only minor inconveniences)</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and since there were no definite negative aspects (only minor inconveniences)</li>
            <li> Once that was done, she dried her hair as usual and WOW, it is RED.  </li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m going to dye my hair red and red fades regardless of the type of dye you use, you might as well use a less harsh form of dye.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it was less damaging than other brands in the same price range.</li>
            <li> The dye was not very creamy.</li>
            <li> Clairol Natural Instincts Crema Keratina Hair Color goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as the hair colorings of years past did.</li>
            <li> It is not a permanent dye so you can experiment and if it is too red for you a few washes will tone it down.</li>
            <li> This could have been my poor application skills or the fact that I really got down into the roots when coloring making it</li>
            <li> She said she has used red color in the past a couple times, it just kinda gave it a slight red tint, maybe a few highlights type of thing.</li>
            <li> The process was just like any other hair color solution; mix, apply, and wait.</li>
            <li> Other products I have used were a gel formula and were easier to use.</li>
            <li> Next time I use this color I will follow through for the full 20 minutes because I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Having both hands free versus trying to video tape makes it easier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Application easy?&lt;br /&gt;Not too bad, with a mirror</li>
            <li> My pillowcase is dark, so i couldn&#x27;t tell if there was any color transfer, but the perfume from the conditioner was stronger on my pillowcase in the morning than it was they day before in the shower.</li>
            <li> If you have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I have medium dark hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a reddish boost in color, but now I&#x27;m going to have to dye it dark to get rid of the orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really thick medium length hair so next time I will do two boxes.  </li>
            <li> basic dying process&lt;br /&gt;-Dye is thick and doesn&#x27;t run through/off your hair</li>
            <li> I think I just let the dry drip past the protective line of conditioner and dyed my head a bit.  </li>
            <li> She has really dark brown hair, almost black.</li>
            <li> It is not as messy as other coloring products.</li>
            <li> In the box you get the typical bottle and formula, blend them together, shake and apply.</li>
            <li> While this color was leak-proof as stated during the coloring process, it did add some slight orange to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is an ample supply (half a bottle did my below shoulder length hair).  </li>
            <li> It took over 5 minutes of rinsing and when I dried it off, my towel turned orange.</li>
            <li> I tend to stick to my brand because others I have tried have dried out my hair and made it feel brittle.</li>
            <li> That is how unlike the usual heavy chemical smell this product has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far after dying my hair religiously for the past seven months, I have not been disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The smell went away after a few washes, as usual with a boxed dye.</li>
            <li> Am only sorry i didn&#x27;t order two boxes.</li>
            <li> Also, there was only a faint smell that I hardly noticed</li>
            <li> The toothpaste tube #1 is a bit hard to squeeze into bottle #2, but I eventually got it.</li>
            <li> Reds are hard to keep no matter what brand you use.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t wash my hair with shampoo for at least 3 days after coloring).  </li>

            <li> Natural Instincts hair colors are my favorite. They are gentle and my hair feels softer after use. This is perfect to use all the time and especially if you have used a stronger colorant that has left your hair damaged. I usually alternate permanent color with semi-permanent.&lt;br /&gt;This new version (Crema Keratina) takes 20 minutes instead of the 10 minutes with the original version. I&#x27;ve always done 20 minutes anyway so that the color last longer as I usually use red and red fades faster. This is a very good red, a true red and not auburn. It isn&#x27;t brassy but it is very red. The colorant is thick so it doesn&#x27;t splatter when I put it on, clean up is minimal. I have always had good luck with this product, it is practically error-proof. If you are a first time colorer, I recommend this. Though only people who might not be satisfied are those with heavy gray, semi-permanent isn&#x27;t enough to cover those.</li>
            <li> I love this hair color! It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t smell as awful as some other brands when it is in use and rinses out easily at the end. The color is bright and the coconut oil does help smooth frizzy hair. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> this is something I have used many times before. It is very gentle on the hair which is important if you are like me and color your hair often. It is not as messy as other coloring products. Stays right where I put it. and it works giving a rich vibrant deep red color. on me this color lasts about six weeks</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant but not crazy red. (Of course your results will vary.) This is one of the least harsh dye brands I&#x27;ve tried , it did leave my hair soft and very glossy. It is very easy to apply. It is not a permanent dye so you can experiment and if it is too red for you a few washes will tone it down. It is not great at covering grays so if you have  more than a few grays here and there I don&#x27;t recommend it. Otherwise great.</li>
            <li> This is the hair dye I am using right now in my hair.  I have tried three of these brands and this has to be my favorite color so far! It is very colorful! I am naturally a brunette that has gray hair as well. This covers up the gray and has not washed out the color to show the gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is very easy to use and takes less time than my other kits I have been using for over 30 years. I was really nervous to use this shade since it was such a change but it looks natural and vibrant. Since I just applied it this week I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but the other shades washed out faster only because I shower twice a day in summer. This is a shade I would love to use in winter for it to last longer! If you have green eyes, this really brings them out. Give it a try, it is washes out so you will go back to your natural color eventually.</li>
            <li> Blends well and looks good with darker hair tones. Is a rich yet subtle raspberry/red color. Color looks slightly pink in the bottle and looks the same way on the hair once done but still blends nicely with darker tones. It&#x27;s specifically designed for dark hair and will blend away greys and give hair an extra color boost. In the box you get the typical bottle and formula, blend them together, shake and apply. Works quickly, all you do have to do is rinse with warm water. Also contains a color-treat conditioner with aloe and coconut oil. Plus a set of gloves. I like the fact it&#x27;s ammonia-free, doesn&#x27;t stink and has keratin for to protect the hair while coloring. If you&#x27;re looking to try something different and want to add a reddish/raspberry tint to your hair I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best thing about Clairol Natural Instincts and this product is how it smoothens the hair afterwards.  The hair feels conditioned. While this color was leak-proof as stated during the coloring process, it did add some slight orange to my hair.  I blame myself, as my hair is a dark blonde and this color works best on darker hair for that raspberry effect.  I have a small streak of white in my bangs that looks a little more orangy.  I hope to have photos up later</li>
            <li> Ha, this 82 year old guy is getting comments galore here.  I didn&#x27;t see why a guy like me couldn&#x27;t use this, and the result is red highlights in my dark brown hair and even beard.  Well, I&#x27;m pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use. It&#x27;s a very beautiful red color and covered gray hair better than I thought it would. The gray just looks like highlights now. Very pretty. I have often wanted to dye my hair red but didn&#x27;t want to commit to it so held off. This color is temporary so it will wash out after about a month, or 28 washings, whichever comes first. It was easy to use and left my hair feeling very soft. I am very happy with the products and love the color.</li>
            <li> Mix, shake, apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse, condition, rinse, done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in the medium/dark brown range, so i wasn&#x27;t sure how much of an effect i would get. I didn&#x27;t do a strand test, but just left the dye on for twenty minutes. The result is a shade or two oranger than the box suggests, especially on the fine hairs at my temples. If you care deeply about exactly what color your hair ends up, you should probably be going to a stylist, not buying dye and applying it yourself. If you care more than i do (i just wanted something interesting), definitely do the strand test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you might want to cover your pillow with a towel the first night or two after dying (and possible the night after each weekly conditioning with the included product), as there is some residue that&#x27;ll transfer onto the pillowcase. My pillowcase is dark, so i couldn&#x27;t tell if there was any color transfer, but the perfume from the conditioner was stronger on my pillowcase in the morning than it was they day before in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the easiest to use dye I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  It smell pleasant.  It is an ample supply (half a bottle did my below shoulder length hair).  It produces a decent color.  If you have dark brown hair like I do you will not see red per se, just a shine of red under certain lighting, but depending on how the light shifts you&#x27;ll get continual highlights of it and I&#x27;m pleased with the results overall.  The concern for which I&#x27;m dinging it a star is that grey hair is dyed to look like copper wire with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some concerns because my forehead is still a little red and just a tiny bit tingly the day after -- it gave me no problems while I was dying my hair.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a point of concern, especially since I did the allergy test and it was fine, but I&#x27;ll post back if it is a concern.  I think I just let the dry drip past the protective line of conditioner and dyed my head a bit.  Oops.</li>
            <li> I really like how easy to use this was. The color was also close to what I thought it would be. It&#x27;s really a great price for salon color! I love it and will use it again!</li>
            <li> I like that this is designed not to be too harsh on your hair, and that it adds a bit of fun pop to hair that&#x27;s already fairly dark and kind of hard to color. It&#x27;s not meant to put on really light hair, though, so I can see why it would be a bit overdone if it were put onto grey. I fumbled a bit with the application, but I think that was more my own inexperience rather than an issue with the product itself. If you don&#x27;t color your hair much, it&#x27;s going to feel clumsy anyway. The conditioner seems really good as well.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2130398e38b195556106e5ce113cb5b4]] Using this line of products was my first time coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to mix?&lt;br /&gt;Sort of. The toothpaste tube #1 is a bit hard to squeeze into bottle #2, but I eventually got it. Having both hands free versus trying to video tape makes it easier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Application easy?&lt;br /&gt;Not too bad, with a mirror I can do this on my own or in my case I had my 11yr old daughter help me. Either way, the applicator bottle #2 works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ No drip?&lt;br /&gt;Correct. I still had an old shirt and old towel on my shoulders just in case, but no drip through the whole thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Staining skin?&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly, I could have put some Vaseline around the edges of my hairline to ensure there was no leek over, but I didn&#x27;t and still got a bunch of color on my skin. During the rinse phase, it came off okay, but I had to use some soap to really clean forehead and ears. Even without \\&quot;rubbing the coloring into my scalp\\&quot;, my scalp was colored. It took three washes with soap and scrubbing my scalp before my scalp didn&#x27;t look colored any longer. This could have been my poor application skills or the fact that I really got down into the roots when coloring making it unavoidable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Coloring grey hair?&lt;br /&gt;The Red Medium RR5 colored my hair well and the grey hair had almost a florescent highlight effect. My brown hair is darker and there are red highlights throughout too. I&#x27;ve had co-workers at work say it actually looked really good. . . and I don&#x27;t think they were just being nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Conditional bottle #3?&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner worked fine, leaving hair feeling silky and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ After initial coloring?&lt;br /&gt;That first night by following the directions and rinsing till water ran clear, then conditioning it worked well. I did not have any color bleed over onto my pillow before I could shampoo my hair the next day after my workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Having it so the colors mix easier would be appreciated. Hair does not feel damaged or extra dry afterwards and color looks fairly natural (except florescent/neon highlights. . .those just look cool). I like it a lot and since there were no definite negative aspects (only minor inconveniences), I give this a 5-star.d be appreciated.

            <li> I was pleased to be able to use this on top of prior red coloring. It didn&#x27;t turn my hair an orangey color, and still have a deep, rich reddish brown color like I hoped for. I don&#x27;t like it quite as much as my regular color, even on my rather grown out roots and natural color there. Application was very easy, however. As with most red dyes I&#x27;ve used, it bled out for a few washings after the initial rinse. Even when the water is clear with each one, somehow come next time there will be a rush of red at the start of washing my hair. Still, my hair holds color really well despite this weird detail and so far, three weeks in, this is still a great color.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found my new at home hair dye!  I adored the color on the box and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I have my husband spot-check to make sure I don&#x27;t miss any of the baby-fine hairs along the hairline and he asked me if I was using a new type of dye. I said yes and asked him how could he tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this product is the least offensive of any of the at home hair dye products I have ever tried!  Even my dogs didn&#x27;t mind hanging around me during the wait time and that is highly unusual because, normally, when I have dye in my hair, they tend to stay away.  But this time one of them actually came up to me and gave me kisses on my face.  That is how unlike the usual heavy chemical smell this product has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the way my hair feels after using this product is amazing.  It is absolutely silky smooth and so soft even to the ends. Styling my hair was a breeze and the next morning I wasn&#x27;t the least bit worried that someone would be able to smell the residue of hair dye chemicals.  Absolutely thrilled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only 4 stars?  My hair did not come out the rich, deep red on the box.  I have medium dark hair so it should have come somewhere close to the spectrum on the box.  Instead, it came out rather a brighter orange than I would have liked.  Something like their bright auburn.  Next time I buy this product, and there will absolutely be a next time, I&#x27;ll buy a shade slightly darker than I would normally choose and see if that gives me the results I had hoped for this time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair but since I started going grey, I have wanted to go red. When I was younger I would use type 3 red hair dyes and my hair would fade (which is normal with red hair dye) and the dye would leave my hair brittle. Needless to say I was leery about becoming &amp;#34;married to the bottle&amp;#34; and my hair turning into a birds nest from the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go with a type 2 dye and give it a whirl. So far after dying my hair religiously for the past seven months, I have not been disappointed with this product. The color remains vibrant even when it fades and I typically redye my hair every three weeks because of roots. The smell is amazing and my hair does not feel as if I have been dying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure if I&#x27;m going to dye my hair red and red fades regardless of the type of dye you use, you might as well use a less harsh form of dye. I will continue to use this product as long as I continue to dye my hair.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old has been asking to color her hair for months but I am not crazy about the idea of her using a permanent dye.  When I had the chance to try Clairol Natural Instincts in Medium Red, I knew my daughter would be thrilled.  She couldn&#x27;t wait to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair is light brown, very fine, and in a pixie cut.  We followed the package directions exactly for mixing and applying the colorant.  It was easy enough to do and the product is thick enough that we didn&#x27;t have any drips to deal with.  After I applied the product to her hair, we set a timer for 20 minutes.  After that time, she rinsed it well in the shower and used the included conditioner.  Once that was done, she dried her hair as usual and WOW, it is RED.  The final color is much brighter than I expected and would never be mistaken for a natural color.  It is definitely more vibrant and bright than the photo on the package.  She, of course, is absolutely thrilled with it and it does look quite adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though we got some of the product on her skin, especially around her ears and the back of her neck, it didn&#x27;t stain.  I did use a damp paper towel to remove as much coloring from her skin as I could right after the application, so that probably helped.  Her scalp is also not stained.  Her hair feels very soft and I appreciate that her color will gradually revert back to normal just in time for her to start looking for a summer job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while we were happy with the outcome and the ease of use, I can only give this product 4 stars because the final color was not what is represented on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/1/2015:  My daughter&#x27;s hair is still red.  It&#x27;s faded a lot and isn&#x27;t so bright any more, but two and a half months after using the dye, she has noticeable roots.  She shampoos her hair every day.  The girl who cuts her hair said because her hair is on the lighter side and isn&#x27;t usually dyed, it really soaked in the color.  Just something to consider if you plan to use this product; you may have red hair for much longer than 30 days.er if you plan to use this product; you may have red hair for much longer than 30 days.</li>
            <li> We applied this to my wife&#x27;s hair. The process was just like any other hair color solution; mix, apply, and wait. The important thing is the results and overall my wife was happy. It covered her gray hair, and gave a nice little shine and she loved the light red color it applies. She would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Clairol Natural Instincts Crema Keratina Hair Color is a very nice product to use. I like the no-drip foam application and especially the no ammonia formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair color follows all the normal directions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t wash your hair before coloring.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use care after coloring, no perming.&lt;br /&gt;3. Continue to use the included conditioner after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has naturally auburn hair and has been using red hair color for some time to cover the creeping grey. Usually a medium red dye gives her back a  nice auburn color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not this one! Her hair turned a very fake looking cherry red! It was awful. Not at ALL what I would call a &amp;#34;medium red&amp;#34; as advertised on the box. We hoped that the color would fade out a little with a few days of shampooing, but the horrible cartoon red color stayed. We eventually bought a professional hair color stripper to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of fun if you want to change your hair color on a temporary basis!  It lasts about 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just s warning: if you&#x27;re looking to cover grey, you need a product specifically for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little drippy during application but the results are awesome!</li>
            <li> Good choice for a semi permanent color. The raspberry red color was very vibrant at first and looked great. Like all red shades it faded pretty quickly. Reds are hard to keep no matter what brand you use. I don&#x27;t feel like it was less damaging than other brands in the same price range. It is easy to apply, with no drips, so it is a little less messy. The keratin doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. I don&#x27;t notice anything different than with the original version of Natural Instincts brand.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Easy to apply.  I have really thick medium length hair so next time I will do two boxes.  Washes out in about 24 washes (depending on harshness of shampoo, I wouldn&#x27;t wash my hair with shampoo for at least 3 days after coloring).  I love the coconut oil conditioner included.  The color came out even but will only be as even as you apply!  Covered most gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a red bright enough to stand out! I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair shades of reds for over 10 years and I always have trouble finding the right red. I like it to be bright and colorful with depth. This definitely was the look I wanted and I plan to order more. If you like bright and fun reds, this might be the color for you.</li>
            <li> Great product. No Smell or drip. Turned out exactly as color chart showed. Looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution - this color is VERY RED (which is exactly what i wanted)</li>
            <li> My lady used this product. She has really dark brown hair, almost black. Well, most of it. It&#x27;s going a lil bit gray, being over 50. She said she has used red color in the past a couple times, it just kinda gave it a slight red tint, maybe a few highlights type of thing. She saw this and thought it could color the gray, and do the same light tint. It is a lot healthier than the hair colors of old, and &amp;#34;demi permanent&amp;#34; (which apparently means it will last about 28 washings) so we gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said it wasn&#x27;t difficult to put in, and the smell wasn&#x27;t bad at all. After 20 minutes a rinse and then the conditioner. By the time she was done and had it dried, it was a bit more red than she thought. The top of her hair was redder than the backs and sides, her hair is more than shoulder length. Apparently it colored the gray hair a bit more than her dark brown hair.  She had some left, and actually applied it to the back hoping it would even it out a little, but it doesn&#x27;t look like it did any different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad or overly bright red, just a little redder on top than the rest. Not that big a deal the way women have 2-4 shades in their hair these days, and roots of a different color seem to be a trend instead of the mark of shame as in olden days. The conditioner is really nice and her hair just smelled like the conditioner afterwards, not like the strong peroxide/chemical smell that used to be the norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product. Just be aware the more gray you try to cover, the redder it will be there.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work out well for me and I was unhappy with the final color. On the plus side, there was no odor from the dye since it is ammonia-free, and my hair is still soft and silky. And since I have short hair, it will be easy to re-color to another shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process itself was ok. The dye was not very creamy. It was a thin liquid and messy to apply. Other products I have used were a gel formula and were easier to use. The dye was also difficult to rinse out. It took over 5 minutes of rinsing and when I dried it off, my towel turned orange. At this point I was not feeling good about the final color, and I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye turned my light brown hair brassy and orange. Halloween orange. Nothing like the medium red tone pictured on the box. I was hoping for a reddish boost in color, but now I&#x27;m going to have to dye it dark to get rid of the orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color red is probably best suited for those with darker color brown hair and not a lot of gray. I would not recommend anyone with light brown hair to use it unless they want orange. The color on the panel of the box is not even close.</li>
            <li> I mostly have very curly, dark hair.This is my first attempt at coloring the white strands around my temples. I am happy to see that this Medium Red /Raspberry Creme hair color turned these strands completely red--no brassy orange, here. I also noticed a fun, overall burgundy tint to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the dying proces easier, I washed and set my hair on rollers (two days earlier) without using any hair products. This stretched my curls out (so I didn&#x27;t have to take extra time to detangle them), but it left my hair looking dry. Now, the raspberry color actually gives my hair a sheen that makes it appear to be more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually worried that this product might burn due to the dryness of my scalp, however, I was amazed at how gentle this was. Also, there was only a faint smell that I hardly noticed--I didn&#x27;t need to ventilate my bathroom during or after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that the dye wasn&#x27;t terribly hard to clean off of my skin (a family member who assisted me slathered it all over my neck and forehead--I didn&#x27;t immediately find out, so it sat there for some time). However, the dye isn&#x27;t as forgiving about staining fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: For best results when covering white/gray hair, leave the product on for AT LEAST an hour (as long as you don&#x27;t feel any burning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the directions emphasize doing a skin allergy test at least 48 hours before, I don&#x27;t see how this can be done without compromising the rest of the product. You are blending two chemicals to create a reaction--then told to immediately apply it. One can assume that this mixture degrades over time. It would be nice to have a separate sample included to perform the recommended test.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Am only sorry i didn&#x27;t order two boxes. The hair dye goes on thick so it stays where you put it without runs. The color is vibrant and my hair is soft after dying. I did get scared halfway through and leave the dye on for only 12 minutes instead of the recommended 20. However, I still feel I got the desired affect I was after. Next time I use this color I will follow through for the full 20 minutes because I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous haircolor. I normally use a different brand, but was offered this to try. I normally color my hair every 2 months, so I jumped at the chance to try this. I have dark brown hair that I normally color a dark burgundy. This color is brighter than i normally use, but it works well now that it is spring. What I really like is how great this made my hair feel. My hair was is curly and needs lots of conditioner and deep conditions to stay healthy. I tend to stick to my brand because others I have tried have dried out my hair and made it feel brittle. This did not. My hair felt luxuriously healthy. It has shine and really looks great. This dye is just as easy to use as any other. You will have to mix, then apply and let sit for 20 minutes. The smell went away after a few washes, as usual with a boxed dye. I wish that could be improved upon because I try to only wash my hair once per week. Since I hate the smell, I always wash my hair daily till I&#x27;m rid of the chemical odor. But, this seems to be true of all dyes I have tried, so I can&#x27;t knock a star off for that. I think I&#x27;m going to try the burgundy color next time and if it is similar to my usual color, I think I have found a new brand.</li>
            <li> This product is geared I believe those who have preexisting red hair either by dye or naturally.  When I usually dye my hair red, I want a very fire engine red and because my hair is naturally brown, I need a strong product to make it very red. Any time a product says keratin or henna it is usually an indication to me that it is not going to be able to do that job as was the case here.  But like I said, certainly if you are into more natural hair colors or products then yes, you will probably like this brand.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very basic dying process&lt;br /&gt;-Dye is thick and doesn&#x27;t run through/off your hair&lt;br /&gt;-The color looks pretty close to what it looks like on the box&lt;br /&gt;-Your hair will feel super soft after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It seemingly never stops washing out the first time you rinse your hair! Just be patient and don&#x27;t go overboard in the shower on the first day.</li>
            <li> Clairol Natural Instincts Crema Keratina Hair Color goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as the hair colorings of years past did. The colors come out rich and vibrant, and hold up fairly well, though you have to make a conscious effort not to overwash your hair, even with dye friendly shampoos. The instructions are clear and easy to understand, and anyone who&#x27;s ever colored their hair will pretty much know the drill with this one as well.</li>
