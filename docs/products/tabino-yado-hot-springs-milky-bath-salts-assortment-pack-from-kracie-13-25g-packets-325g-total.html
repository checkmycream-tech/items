            <li>Super relaxing.  </li>
            <li>Why aren&#x27;t more Japanese products available in America?!</li>
            <li>so ANY flowery smell is too much for me).&lt;br /&gt;The milky bath was a pleasant experience and it left my skin soft and body more relaxed.</li>

            <li>I want to try other scents sometime too, especially the ones for beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive to smells though, so some of the packets that contained flower fragrance were not to my liking (I am migraine prone</li>
            <li>They provide extra relaxation in the bath and are in measured packet to make it easy.  </li>

            <li>They use ingredients from Onsens (the Japanese word for Mineral Hot Springs).</li>
            <li>The colors are vivid and yet they won&#x27;t stain your tub.</li>
            <li>but I love that they don&#x27;t dry out my skin like other products.</li>
            <li>like the milky but prefer the clear.</li>
            <li>I was sad that I may not be able to enjoy these after returning to the USA but low and behold AMAZON</li>
            <li>An amazing product especially for those rough,stressful,tired and exhausting days.</li>
            <li>I lived in Japan for 11 years and always used these Milky Bath Salts (as well as the Clear Bath Salts by this same company).</li>
