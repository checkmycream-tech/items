            <li>and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>BUT SOMETIMES DOES FEEL GOOD.</li>
            <li>Better than finger nails!  </li>
            <li>Feels amazing on scalp and beard.  </li>
            <li>Works really nice if you have shorthair</li>
            <li>I was given the oppertunity to try these at a promotional rate in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Gave tbe extras to my grandchildren &amp; they love washing their own under Mom watchful eye (2 &amp; 4)</li>
            <li>I found the Fuller Brush brand of shampoo/massager brush worked better for my purpose.</li>
            <li>and I find this is lovely for doing that.</li>
            <li>Glad to have these .</li>
            <li>The 3pk size allows me to be able to take these on my travel experiences as well.</li>
            <li>I like that more than one came in the pack</li>
            <li>I use it with a clarifying shampoo and a bit of tea tree oil and lavender oil and it does an excellent job and leaves my scalp feeling clean and refreshed, but not irritated or dry at all.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the old Goody massager, but is much better than I had feared .</li>
            <li>They work just fine.</li>
            <li>But honestly it&#x27;s like having that special professional touch in your own home.</li>
            <li>These are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice, don&#x27;t feel like it does much though.</li>
            <li>cheap prices makes this thing 100% worth it!</li>
            <li>light weight , but not a bad product</li>
            <li>They massage your scalp and make your hair feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>It makes them more gentle on the scalp and as a detangler.  </li>
            <li>Quick turnaround.</li>
            <li>plastic not as strong as old ones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better quality at retail stores for about the same price.</li>
            <li>Yes, Yes, Yes - this Scalp Messager is not sold in the stores any more not the big store.  </li>
            <li>so when I say the exact one here on Amazon I had to order these plus everyone wanted to know where I got them from -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued when I first came across these.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something to really get the build up off my scalp</li>
            <li>so I am very upset about the thinning hair, and have been massaging my scalp</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
            <li>arrive fast , very practical because of the size.</li>
            <li>These used to be made by Goody, and were much sturdier.  </li>
            <li>These are more flexible than other shampoo brushes I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would help me to keep my scalp clean and massage it at the same time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a fancy high quality piece</li>
            <li>A BODY BRUSH TYPE THING { NORMALLY USE A LOOFAH}</li>
            <li>I love this, since my strokes I had trouble washing my hair/scalp.</li>
            <li>The prong diameter and spacing is not good for getting a nice massage/lather while I wash my hair...</li>
            <li>This is just what I wanted as they are not stiff and are well made.</li>
            <li>Am surprised that a lot of reviewers had an issue with the bristles falling out..  </li>
            <li>Like everything, they are thinner lighter and smaller than the previous one I had, but it works fine.  </li>
            <li>plastic bristles... although they feel cheap, allow hair to run smoothly past them.</li>
            <li>Its gentle yet firm enough to really get in there!</li>

            <li> Its gentle yet firm enough to really get in there!</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft and will not work very well in my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> These are likely not to last as long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long enough nail</li>
            <li> If you have long hair you should to buy a different one withlonger bristles</li>
            <li> (I have always long hair).  </li>
            <li> He was SO disappointed he couldn&#x27;t keep it when I left that I had to buy him his own.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> Obviously I threw the pink one out but still got three for the price of 1 from their competitors!!</li>
            <li> part should be a little wider/ bigger.</li>
            <li> its flexible, a little too flexible, next time I would try to find a stiffer version.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it was much of a waste of money since it was only a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> other products with rubberized bristles pull on hair, unlike this.</li>
            <li> Since these are the ones my husband likes, and not available in stores, they&#x27;ll have to do.</li>
            <li> Stiff plastic yet</li>
            <li> They have the short hard bristles one which pulls the hair, not happy with that</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS A LITTLE HARD</li>
            <li> I was looking for scalp massage brushes like I used to buy at drug stores that were very stiff and also helped to detangle hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, course hair, but these worked without any issues.</li>
            <li> Not good for drains.</li>
            <li> This is an essential tool for grooming for thick, thick hair especially in a dusty climate.</li>
            <li> Teeth are too weak.</li>
            <li> The plastic is so thin and the prongs are weak.</li>
            <li> Amazon should remove this poor quality from inventory.</li>
            <li> well I don&#x27;t like to kiss and tell - my secret.</li>
            <li> and it is uncomfortable to massage my head with shampoo.</li>
            <li> The terrible quality makes me angry with Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Horrible item.</li>

            <li> These are cheaply made.  I&#x27;ve seen better quality at retail stores for about the same price.</li>
            <li> works great! concave shape, allows to shape to your scalp! plastic bristles... although they feel cheap, allow hair to run smoothly past them. other products with rubberized bristles pull on hair, unlike this. cheap prices makes this thing 100% worth it!</li>
            <li> Prefect for washing your hair--long or short.  They massage your scalp and make your hair feel really clean.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought it would be, and that is a good thing. I don&#x27;t have long enough nail and it is uncomfortable to massage my head with shampoo. This helps great!</li>
            <li> These are terrific.  Kept one for myself and use it in the shower to scrub my scalp.  Feels wonderful!  Better than finger nails!  Gave the others to friends who use it as head scratchers and hair/beard brushes.  When visiting my great-grandson, age 2-1/2, he latched onto it as a back scratcher.  He was SO disappointed he couldn&#x27;t keep it when I left that I had to buy him his own.  Am surprised that a lot of reviewers had an issue with the bristles falling out..  Have not had that problem at all.  Use it all the time, and it&#x27;s in great shape.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft and will not work very well in my long, thick hair. I was looking for scalp massage brushes like I used to buy at drug stores that were very stiff and also helped to detangle hair. I found the Fuller Brush brand of shampoo/massager brush worked better for my purpose.</li>
            <li> MIGHT WORK WITH VERY SHORT HAIR OR IF YOU ARE A GUY.  DIDNT WORK FOR ME WITH SHOULDER LENGTH HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED IT AS A BODY BRUSH TYPE THING { NORMALLY USE A LOOFAH} BUT IT IS A LITTLE HARD FOR THAT TOO, BUT SOMETIMES DOES FEEL GOOD.</li>
            <li> Teeth are too weak. Used one brush only 3 times before one-fourth of the brush teeth fell out. Not good for drains. Horrible item. Amazon should remove this poor quality from inventory. The terrible quality makes me angry with Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted as they are not stiff and are well made.</li>
            <li> light weight , but not a bad product</li>
            <li> I love this, since my strokes I had trouble washing my hair/scalp. I even cut my hair short (I have always long hair).  Gave tbe extras to my grandchildren &amp; they love washing their own under Mom watchful eye (2 &amp; 4)</li>
            <li> plastic not as strong as old ones</li>
            <li> Yes, Yes, Yes - this Scalp Messager is not sold in the stores any more not the big store.  They have the short hard bristles one which pulls the hair, not happy with that so when I say the exact one here on Amazon I had to order these plus everyone wanted to know where I got them from - well I don&#x27;t like to kiss and tell - my secret.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Quick turnaround.</li>
            <li> Like everything, they are thinner lighter and smaller than the previous one I had, but it works fine.  The seller exceeded my expectations in getting the product to me in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> They work just fine. Only reason I give 4 starts and not 5 is because I feel the handle part should be a little wider/ bigger.</li>
            <li> Not buying again. Feels nice, don&#x27;t feel like it does much though. I don&#x27;t feel like it was much of a waste of money since it was only a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was hoping for... The plastic is so thin and the prongs are weak. The prong diameter and spacing is not good for getting a nice massage/lather while I wash my hair... Decided to use them when bathing my dog instead of for myself.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with build up and this is great! I have been having problems with thinning hair so I wanted something to really get the build up off my scalp and I find this is lovely for doing that. I have very long hair and it hasn&#x27;t gotten in the way of that. I am a female so I am very upset about the thinning hair, and have been massaging my scalp and I use one of my others to massage my scalp outside of the shower just to keep the blood flowing. It&#x27;s very relaxing. I use it with a clarifying shampoo and a bit of tea tree oil and lavender oil and it does an excellent job and leaves my scalp feeling clean and refreshed, but not irritated or dry at all.</li>
            <li> Great price for an assortment of scalp brushes.  They work well and are just form enough.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on scalp and beard.  One of the 3 pack (which I leave in the shower) is already losing its bristles after only a month or so.  Stiff plastic yet its flexible, a little too flexible, next time I would try to find a stiffer version.</li>
            <li> arrive fast , very practical because of the size. I have at home, purse,car. I do recommend</li>
            <li> These are more flexible than other shampoo brushes I&#x27;ve had.  It makes them more gentle on the scalp and as a detangler.  This is an essential tool for grooming for thick, thick hair especially in a dusty climate.</li>
            <li> These used to be made by Goody, and were much sturdier.  These are likely not to last as long.  Since these are the ones my husband likes, and not available in stores, they&#x27;ll have to do.</li>
            <li> What can I say!  These are just regular shampoo massage brushes in a pack of 4.  Obviously I threw the pink one out but still got three for the price of 1 from their competitors!!</li>
            <li> Works really nice if you have shorthair it&#x27;s not a fancy high quality piece but it gets the job done and will likely last forever&lt;br /&gt;.  If you have long hair you should to buy a different one withlonger bristles</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old Goody massager, but is much better than I had feared . My spouse and I have used shampoo brushes for 50 years . Glad to have these .</li>
            <li> These are the best! I was looking for something that would help me to keep my scalp clean and massage it at the same time. I have really thick, course hair, but these worked without any issues. The 3pk size allows me to be able to take these on my travel experiences as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! My only beef is that the teeth have started to fall out, after about three months of use. It&#x27;s not a big deal -- you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I was given the oppertunity to try these at a promotional rate in exchange for an honest review. I was intrigued when I first came across these. I never have tried anything like it before. But honestly it&#x27;s like having that special professional touch in your own home. I can never work the lather or get to my scalp like the shampoo girls at the salon. this tool comes in at a close second! Its gentle yet firm enough to really get in there! I like that more than one came in the pack so now everyone in my house gets their own!</li>
