            <li> Clear crystal hairpins are very nice. VERY reasonable!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my upcoming wedding and was pleasantly surprised at the great quality and how very pretty the pins were. When I went in for my trial run of hair and makeup, my stylist loved these and how they looked in my dark brown hair.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase these for any special occasion/up-do.</li>
            <li> The hair pins arrived quicker than expected, but I got a note from the owner in China. She said because of a typhoon I might get them late so let her know if I needed to return them.  They arrived in plenty of time for my son&#x27;s wedding. I wear my hair up and love these pins. I would recommend this company. I got them much earlier than I expected. I would not have returned them even if they came too late for the wedding. I will wear them for other occasions.</li>
            <li> These lovely hair pins look very well made and are heavy duty. I wouldn&#x27;t trade them for the world. Super fast shipping. An excellent seller.</li>
            <li> The pins arrived a week before the estimated  delivery date began and were beautiful and none broken.  They were exactly what I was looking for to add a little sparkle to my updo for my daughter&#x27;s wedding.  Excellent value. Superior Quality.</li>

            <li> These are very pretty accessories and larger than they look. They can catch in you hair, so beware of repositioning after insertion.</li>
            <li> These pins are gorgeous.  I truly love the way they look.  These are bigger than I thought and I also loved the quick delivery</li>
            <li> I purchased these as an embellishment for my hair for my grandson&#x27;s wedding.  When they arrived I was very pleasantly surprised.  The quality was great, they are well made and oh so attractive.  I have gotten so many compliments on them and my hairdresser said she had never seen any pins of this quality for such a reasonable price.  Way to go,  I can&#x27;t wait for another occasion to come up so I can wear them again.</li>
            <li> Sparkly hair pins are exactly as pictured and arrived as promised. Having the rhinestone perched at the end made it difficult for me t o use these without hiding half of the stone, but my daughter-in-law uses them beautifully.</li>
            <li> These are BEAUTIFUL.  Lots of shine and sparkle, not cheap looking at all.  Highly recommend for that extra touch.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. The jewels broke off easily. Will not purchase in future.</li>
            <li> They are a little bigger than expected, but look amazing. Very shiny and pretty. The shipping was very fast and hassle free!</li>
            <li> The pins are exactly what I expected. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I was extremely satisfied. ! I purchased these hair pins for the ladies in my wedding and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Very elegant and sturdy!</li>
            <li> such a great buy :D I would buy again, but I still have mine (hold up well)</li>
            <li> They are more decoration that you can put over the already put in place hairdo. Look nice.</li>
            <li> I bought these pins last minute for my wedding and they arrived way before the estimated delivery date and they are beautiful. Much much bigger than I had expected. By the time they had arrived I had already decided to go another route for my accessories so I didn&#x27;t end up wearing these for my wedding. BUT they are still gorgeous and now I need to find another place to let them shine.</li>
            <li> I received these hair pins in an expedient amount of time. The seller was quite responsive and the pins are just as they appear. They are best for people with rather thick hair, and are relatively big. So, if you are looking for some fun bling in your hair for a special occasion, these are good ones to get.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful, although some of the crystals fall out easily so handle with care.</li>
            <li> Love these. Looks great in any hairdo but especially an updo.</li>
