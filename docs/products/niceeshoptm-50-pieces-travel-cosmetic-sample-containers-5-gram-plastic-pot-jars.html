            <li>size and good quality</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not the best quality, but they&#x27;re not bad quality either.</li>
            <li>Perfect container for elementary school students to use for their homemade lip balm.</li>
            <li>my daughter makes lip balm with her friends for fun and these are perfect</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the perfect size, and I&#x27;m never afraid of any leaks with these.</li>
            <li>and they think these containers are very cute.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>They hold 1.5 teaspoons of contents to the very top (a stack of 7 quarters)&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The one inch circle punch fit perfect for the top of these.</li>
            <li>They do not leak, which I love!</li>
            <li>I love these for my Rodan + Fields Skincare business!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>These are perfect for what I purchased them for and so far all the lids fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li>They keep my products safe and fresh, and the price is perfect for FIFTY OF THESE!!</li>
            <li>If you are making your own product to put in these containers</li>
            <li>The lid screws on nicely</li>
            <li>They are made of a sturdy, plastic, and I&#x27;ve not had any to not thread nicely.  </li>
            <li>Better quality are considerably more money, and you are certainly welcome to seek them out.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Rude</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my daughter and myself to make our own lip balms.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product and more than met what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Excellent small jars - perfect for my homemade under-eye cream.</li>
            <li>Good size, easy to work with.</li>
            <li>these have a great look &amp; are a nice sample size, bur, the top could screw on more securely, however.</li>
            <li>they seem to be just fine, and everyone at the party loved them (even the boys took one home... for mom).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll certainly be more effective than having them get tangled together.  </li>
            <li>great fit and comfortable</li>
            <li>Lids fit great and secure</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for a great price.</li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t use these for any of my balms or sample cosmetics as they feel so very cheap</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for what I was looking for, essential oil infused lotion samples.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE A HOME BUSINESS SELLING ARBONNE BOTANICAL BASED SKINCARE.These are perfect for samples.of creams and such.</li>
            <li>The caps fit the bottoms and served the purpose for which they were purchased!</li>
            <li>Make sure you look closely at the measurements.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to buy these because they were smaller than I wanted, but they ended up being perfect.</li>
            <li>I love the concept</li>
            <li>a non cosmetic pot jar expert, I placed my confidence in this seller and was extremely pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I punched out cute Hello Kitty pictures and used them as party favors.</li>
            <li>and they turned out fantastic!</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Boiling it will make it expand and the tops will no longer fit!</li>
            <li>This is probably better for powders and glitter than liquids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so perfect for things like lipgloss or lipstick because it can contain the entire thing.</li>
            <li>never had any leakage or problems, and have used many</li>
            <li>love this size.</li>
            <li>either way i will fing use for them over all i love them</li>
            <li>but ok containers</li>
            <li>Simple but perfect!</li>
            <li>Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Just ok some units cracked</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you count all tops and bottoms before using them.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of foil samples of beauty products like foundation, primer, BB Cream, etc and most of the time, I can get two and sometimes three uses out of a foil packet.</li>
            <li>These containers also allow for a more sanitary storage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I have to say they are ok...</li>
            <li>I guess they are just ok....</li>
            <li>, good quality works exactly like I need it to.</li>
            <li>All 50 arrived in perfect condition and they screw closed very securely.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for storing many cosmetics conveniently, especially if you are into mixing your own colors and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>They seal well and look nice and they shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>You can get easily about 4 uses on the hands, and even more if you are sparing.</li>
            <li>The products looked great in them and looked very professional.</li>
            <li>They looked nice, and were shipped quickly, but we had to go through and try each top with each jar to figure out which one fit...</li>
            <li>Loved them but they were too large for my mailing boxes.</li>
            <li>So far all of the lids have worked great and are easy to screw on and off.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for seed beads and other jewelry making supplies.</li>
            <li>These containers are perfect for home crafted lip balms, eyeshadows, and other cosmetic uses.  </li>
            <li>The girls got a few each and loved them so I am happy with them and the price.</li>
            <li>and i strongly suggest anyone meaning to use these for any type of cream think twice before purchasing.</li>
            <li>My friend that I ordered this for was very well pleased and happy she has all ready started using them and putting product in them.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered these they were packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size to offer enough product to give potential customers a good idea of how well it works.</li>
            <li>On medium high heat, stir for one minute, or until fully melted, then pour into containers like this one, let cool, and you just made your own non&#x27;toxic lip gloss!</li>
            <li>Delivered fast exactly as described great price.</li>
            <li>they are light weight and easy to send out.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to make lip gloss and they are fine for that.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased these containers I thought they would be larger, however I discovered they are perfect for sample sizes.  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased by how quickly I received my order.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and use these to depot my lipstick - a New Tube of Lipstick fits perfectly!</li>
            <li>These little pots are great for samples of my body scrubs!</li>
            <li>These are the perfect little containers for diy lip balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been making my own lipglosses, and these little jars are great.  </li>
            <li>my inch round lables are a perfect fit for the container tops.</li>
            <li>Cheap, intact, lids all seem to fit.</li>
            <li>These are cheap.  </li>
            <li>One batch filled 25.</li>
            <li>but overall they worked great for my homemade lip balm.</li>
            <li>Overall great for me, just depends on what you want it for.</li>
            <li>The girls liked how the containers made their homemade lip gloss look like &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; from a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, at 30 cents each, happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li>Simple and attractive.</li>
            <li>Precisely what I needed for making lip balm for gift baskets.  </li>
            <li>These are a bit cheap looking and feeling....</li>
            <li>If the price was lower or there was something special or extraordinary about these, they would have received more stars.</li>
            <li>I got a primer sample that yielded three uses, after the first use I squirted the rest into one of these and was able to have it easily packaged in one of these for the remaining two uses.</li>
            <li>Makes them last longer after you use the product and more convenient too!!</li>
            <li>and if they crack then will end up giving them to some who can use them as i very rarely use eye shadow</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for samples for my small business.  </li>
            <li>I can fit one pair of earrings in each, the lids screw on which means no losing any contents, and the best part is that the containerers are clear so I can see what earrings are in them without havng to open boxes to find what I want.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canisters are small, but perfect for my purposes!&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>Some of the lids were cracked but other than that, good purchase and price :)</li>
            <li>The clear tops are awesome, MUCH better than the black top ones, I wanted 3 gram containers, but am glad these were the only ones available, as it has been very useful.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty cheap looking and feeling, but you can expect that when they ARE so cheap.</li>
            <li>Great also for pink sparkle lip balm as a party favor for a girls bday party .</li>
            <li>The youngsters delighted in choosing their personal blend of organic products.</li>
            <li>Good product, overall, but</li>
            <li>They are smaller than I wanted but they are sturdy and good quality and served their purpose well.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find these to be of much use for travel, but they were able to meet my intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Overall, these were a good value.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the lids don&#x27;t fit on just right, but they do all close, and for the price</li>
            <li>These are perfect to give out very small samples--especially liquids--</li>
            <li>there are other great uses</li>
            <li>The containers are fairly flimsy and feel cheap but work perfectly fine as cheap sample containers for small amounts of product.</li>
            <li>the idea is that whatever you put in it will be used up quickly.</li>
            <li>and I the product is adequate for what I need</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Quickly got a refund and reordered again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the exact size to fit 5 nickels in</li>
            <li>I filled them with hot lotion that cooled off in them and then put the lids on.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for helping with my new business</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>the right size for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;They came quickly too.  </li>
            <li>These are great little containers.</li>
            <li>great size for giving little samples to people.</li>
            <li>Great little containers.</li>
            <li>Some of the containers are chipped, but for the amount you&#x27;re getting, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and I can put enough in them for my customers to have a nice sized sample and</li>
            <li>It holds (for me) a weekend worth of hair, face, etc.</li>
            <li>the complete ones are ok though just keep it in mind</li>
            <li>just right size if you do crafts.</li>
            <li>They were the right size and as advertised.</li>
            <li>Gram capacity looks about right</li>
            <li>Some of the lids don&#x27;t close right.</li>
            <li>takes long to get it, but great packagin and complete product</li>
            <li>These are great for holding small parts, beads, coins or whatever you can think of.</li>
            <li>I bought these little jars to put facial product samples in for my business and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality  product for small amounts of lip balms or salves.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>These containers are practical for my sample product and I like them very much.  </li>
            <li>They shut tight, and they are beautiful and clear.</li>
            <li>Good little size.</li>
            <li>A little lighter in weight than others, by 0.4 gm, but definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>brand new, clean, and just as described.</li>
            <li>Love these tiny containers.  </li>
            <li>I will only order these from Beauticom, because I know for sure what I&#x27;m getting from them.</li>
            <li>Guess I should have looked at the size closer first.</li>
            <li>Planning on using for many different items.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to depot my NYX jumbo shadow pencils.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these for my skin care samples, they were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was able to use every last one of them w/o a problem.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely recommend these :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommened as a jewely storing device!!</li>
            <li>They are so tiny and so cute.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m using these to store many of my small beads so they will work ok.  </li>
            <li>The lids stay in place though it is cheaply made and sometimes it takes a moment to get the lid lined up completely.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I thought they&#x27;d be and are serving my purpose.</li>
            <li>These containers are exactly what I need for samples of my products.  </li>
            <li>Made very well!</li>
            <li>I use these to make samples of products for customers, and they work really well!</li>
            <li>They are pretty sturdy and seem well made.</li>
            <li>Love those, use them for my left over lipsticks so that I can throw away the applicators.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I have filled with water and with oil, and they haven&#x27;t leaked (so far, 1 day, on their side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>These containers were exactly what I needed for my hair samples.  </li>
            <li>They are not completely leak proof but were suitable for my needs.</li>
            <li>I use them for my pills everyday and they are a good size</li>
            <li>High quality product, and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The lids fit tightly and don&#x27;t come off, so they&#x27;re safe to carry in a pocket or purse.  </li>
            <li>This product seals tightly and is perfect for small quantities that need to stay fresh and sealed.  </li>
            <li>All containers have lids that seal and open easily.</li>
            <li>I got the jars quickly and professionally packed, however, they do not hold up to carrier oils and all crack.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t open and close easy.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what i expected, I love them.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected. :)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested them with liquid to see how well the lid seals things in but for my solid lip gloss, they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>These are a great sample size but the clear lids make them look less professional.</li>
            <li>These are nice little containers for lip gloss, sample face creams and hand lotions.</li>
            <li>Nice little lip gloss containers.</li>
            <li>Great for samples, travel and just a little for your daily purse.</li>
            <li>All of the containers were in great shape, nothing broken or scratched.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect much from them, but they don&#x27;t cost much, so you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>These work very well for my application.</li>
            <li>I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li>these are really tiny!&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>I would absolutely purchase this again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>so much cleaner and neater</li>
            <li>None were broken, all the lids screwed on correctly, happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again</li>
            <li>The lids stay on and seal well, and they are very durable.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>Got mu product extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.  </li>
            <li>Quite a bit smaller than I was anticipating, but still nice containers for smaller beads.</li>
            <li>Again, a little on the small side for lip gloss, they&#x27;d be a perfect size for handmade mineral eye shadows.</li>
            <li>It looked like a busted open original package was patched up with a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>They are smaller than regular lip balm pots which makes it nice for gifts, because it takes less balm to make more items.</li>
            <li>They are about as big around as a quarter and are great for putting small items in.</li>
            <li>But if you need to clean one out (I needed to adjust my recipe &amp; therefore boil the wax out/off of them to reuse, as only boiling water will remove wax residue...)</li>
            <li>They one inch round labels fit perfectly on top to label what it is for potential customers</li>
            <li>All non-toxic ingredients: In a double boiler, or a pot with a stainless steel bowl on top of pot, (that makes a double bolier).</li>
            <li>With water in pot bottom pot, add in top bowl, Prue Castor Oil, (1/2 tsp), and Prue Shea Butter, (1/2 tsp), and one half of any color YOU choose, Non-Toxic Crayola crayon.</li>
            <li>Love these little containers.  </li>
            <li>I really love these little containers.</li>
            <li>Items arrived very quickly and were just as I expected!</li>
            <li>Lip wands, (100 Count Disposable Lip Gloss Wands Applicators Thin Black Handle Flocked ) go great with your lip gloss!!!!</li>
            <li>The photograph makes them look a bit more stylized than they are -- these are simple thin-walled hard plastic jars with a screw top lid of the same material.</li>
            <li>Small- made for great stocking stuffers for male and female coworkers</li>
            <li>so my customers and friends can try before they buy the new line .</li>
            <li>I ordered some previously on ebay and loved the other ones...</li>
            <li>I am only comfortable using these for my salve because it is fairly solid at room temperature.</li>
            <li>The lids screw on easily, and tightly.  </li>
            <li>Tops screw on and off easily, but tight well.</li>
            <li>Serve their purpose :) I use for small product samples.</li>
            <li>were purchased through the seller eRiver so maybe a different seller provides a higher quality item.)</li>
            <li>The plastic is thick and strong!</li>
            <li>Not too big, not too small and clear which I love!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that I closed the container tightly</li>
            <li>About half of these don&#x27;t fit together.</li>
            <li>I own a small business that makes body butters and bodes scrubs, and I use these jars as sample jars for potential customers.</li>
            <li>But the lids fit well and screw on tightly.</li>
            <li>Not great if your product is super light sensitive,</li>
            <li>They are a little cheap feeling</li>
            <li>They were fine just smaller than expected not recommended for bho  unless u want</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s clear so people can see what they are getting.  </li>
            <li>51.&lt;br /&gt;Crystal clear as promised.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>Arrived early, just as it says ..</li>
            <li>bought them to make lip balm with my 9 year old niece and wound up</li>
            <li>So far no issues with them.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, however some of the lids do not screw completely shut.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re tiny, yes, but big enough to fit an entire tube of lipstick, so I don&#x27;t have to do any guess work with where to cut off the stick and what not.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a minor issue really</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Please make sure you are turning it closed tightly</li>
            <li>The ONLY negative thing to say is that the jars are not the most efficient with retaining liquid.</li>
            <li>but when you add it up in the long run, the cost is just too high.</li>
            <li>Tiny clear plastic containers.</li>
            <li>Nothing big that affected my satisfaction with the actual product, but when I purchase something brand new</li>
            <li>I love them for samples, however not good for liquids!</li>
            <li>So many little carefully individually wrapped little acrylic containers...</li>
            <li>packaging was simple, but as there wasn&#x27;t any apparent damage, sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Small enough to put in pockets and just the right size to use as &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; for family members.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;They are quality containers with a good screw on lid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> size and good quality</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not the best quality, but they&#x27;re not bad quality either.</li>
            <li> Perfect container for elementary school students to use for their homemade lip balm.</li>
            <li> my daughter makes lip balm with her friends for fun and these are perfect</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the perfect size, and I&#x27;m never afraid of any leaks with these.</li>
            <li> and they think these containers are very cute.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> They hold 1.5 teaspoons of contents to the very top (a stack of 7 quarters)&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The one inch circle punch fit perfect for the top of these.</li>
            <li> They do not leak, which I love!</li>
            <li> I love these for my Rodan + Fields Skincare business!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for what I purchased them for and so far all the lids fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li> They keep my products safe and fresh, and the price is perfect for FIFTY OF THESE!!</li>
            <li> If you are making your own product to put in these containers</li>
            <li> The lid screws on nicely</li>
            <li> They are made of a sturdy, plastic, and I&#x27;ve not had any to not thread nicely.  </li>
            <li> Better quality are considerably more money, and you are certainly welcome to seek them out.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Rude</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter and myself to make our own lip balms.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good product and more than met what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Excellent small jars - perfect for my homemade under-eye cream.</li>
            <li> Good size, easy to work with.</li>
            <li> these have a great look &amp; are a nice sample size, bur, the top could screw on more securely, however.</li>
            <li> they seem to be just fine, and everyone at the party loved them (even the boys took one home... for mom).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll certainly be more effective than having them get tangled together.  </li>
            <li> great fit and comfortable</li>
            <li> Lids fit great and secure</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for a great price.</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t use these for any of my balms or sample cosmetics as they feel so very cheap</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for what I was looking for, essential oil infused lotion samples.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE A HOME BUSINESS SELLING ARBONNE BOTANICAL BASED SKINCARE.These are perfect for samples.of creams and such.</li>
            <li> The caps fit the bottoms and served the purpose for which they were purchased!</li>
            <li> Make sure you look closely at the measurements.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to buy these because they were smaller than I wanted, but they ended up being perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the concept</li>
            <li> a non cosmetic pot jar expert, I placed my confidence in this seller and was extremely pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I punched out cute Hello Kitty pictures and used them as party favors.</li>
            <li> and they turned out fantastic!</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Boiling it will make it expand and the tops will no longer fit!</li>
            <li> This is probably better for powders and glitter than liquids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so perfect for things like lipgloss or lipstick because it can contain the entire thing.</li>
            <li> never had any leakage or problems, and have used many</li>
            <li> love this size.</li>
            <li> either way i will fing use for them over all i love them</li>
            <li> but ok containers</li>
            <li> Simple but perfect!</li>
            <li> Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Just ok some units cracked</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you count all tops and bottoms before using them.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of foil samples of beauty products like foundation, primer, BB Cream, etc and most of the time, I can get two and sometimes three uses out of a foil packet.</li>
            <li> These containers also allow for a more sanitary storage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I have to say they are ok...</li>
            <li> I guess they are just ok....</li>
            <li> , good quality works exactly like I need it to.</li>
            <li> All 50 arrived in perfect condition and they screw closed very securely.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for storing many cosmetics conveniently, especially if you are into mixing your own colors and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> They seal well and look nice and they shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> You can get easily about 4 uses on the hands, and even more if you are sparing.</li>
            <li> The products looked great in them and looked very professional.</li>
            <li> They looked nice, and were shipped quickly, but we had to go through and try each top with each jar to figure out which one fit...</li>
            <li> Loved them but they were too large for my mailing boxes.</li>
            <li> So far all of the lids have worked great and are easy to screw on and off.  </li>

            <li> I purchased these to make lip gloss and they are fine for that.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased these containers I thought they would be larger, however I discovered they are perfect for sample sizes.  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased by how quickly I received my order.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and use these to depot my lipstick - a New Tube of Lipstick fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> These little pots are great for samples of my body scrubs!</li>
            <li> These are the perfect little containers for diy lip balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own lipglosses, and these little jars are great.  </li>
            <li> my inch round lables are a perfect fit for the container tops.</li>
            <li> Cheap, intact, lids all seem to fit.</li>
            <li> These are cheap.  </li>
            <li> One batch filled 25.</li>
            <li> but overall they worked great for my homemade lip balm.</li>
            <li> Overall great for me, just depends on what you want it for.</li>
            <li> The girls liked how the containers made their homemade lip gloss look like &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; from a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, at 30 cents each, happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> Simple and attractive.</li>
            <li> Precisely what I needed for making lip balm for gift baskets.  </li>
            <li> These are a bit cheap looking and feeling....</li>
            <li> If the price was lower or there was something special or extraordinary about these, they would have received more stars.</li>
            <li> I got a primer sample that yielded three uses, after the first use I squirted the rest into one of these and was able to have it easily packaged in one of these for the remaining two uses.</li>
            <li> Makes them last longer after you use the product and more convenient too!!</li>
            <li> and if they crack then will end up giving them to some who can use them as i very rarely use eye shadow</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect for samples for my small business.  </li>
            <li> I can fit one pair of earrings in each, the lids screw on which means no losing any contents, and the best part is that the containerers are clear so I can see what earrings are in them without havng to open boxes to find what I want.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canisters are small, but perfect for my purposes!&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> Some of the lids were cracked but other than that, good purchase and price :)</li>
            <li> The clear tops are awesome, MUCH better than the black top ones, I wanted 3 gram containers, but am glad these were the only ones available, as it has been very useful.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty cheap looking and feeling, but you can expect that when they ARE so cheap.</li>
            <li> Great also for pink sparkle lip balm as a party favor for a girls bday party .</li>
            <li> The youngsters delighted in choosing their personal blend of organic products.</li>
            <li> Good product, overall, but</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I wanted but they are sturdy and good quality and served their purpose well.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find these to be of much use for travel, but they were able to meet my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Overall, these were a good value.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the lids don&#x27;t fit on just right, but they do all close, and for the price</li>
            <li> These are perfect to give out very small samples--especially liquids--</li>
            <li> there are other great uses</li>
            <li> The containers are fairly flimsy and feel cheap but work perfectly fine as cheap sample containers for small amounts of product.</li>
            <li> the idea is that whatever you put in it will be used up quickly.</li>
            <li> and I the product is adequate for what I need</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Quickly got a refund and reordered again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the exact size to fit 5 nickels in</li>
            <li> I filled them with hot lotion that cooled off in them and then put the lids on.  </li>
            <li> Love this product for helping with my new business</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> the right size for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;They came quickly too.  </li>
            <li> These are great little containers.</li>
            <li> great size for giving little samples to people.</li>
            <li> Great little containers.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers are chipped, but for the amount you&#x27;re getting, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and I can put enough in them for my customers to have a nice sized sample and</li>
            <li> It holds (for me) a weekend worth of hair, face, etc.</li>
            <li> the complete ones are ok though just keep it in mind</li>
            <li> just right size if you do crafts.</li>
            <li> They were the right size and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Gram capacity looks about right</li>
            <li> Some of the lids don&#x27;t close right.</li>
            <li> takes long to get it, but great packagin and complete product</li>
            <li> These are great for holding small parts, beads, coins or whatever you can think of.</li>
            <li> I bought these little jars to put facial product samples in for my business and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality  product for small amounts of lip balms or salves.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> These containers are practical for my sample product and I like them very much.  </li>
            <li> They shut tight, and they are beautiful and clear.</li>
            <li> Good little size.</li>
            <li> A little lighter in weight than others, by 0.4 gm, but definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> brand new, clean, and just as described.</li>
            <li> Love these tiny containers.  </li>
            <li> I will only order these from Beauticom, because I know for sure what I&#x27;m getting from them.</li>
            <li> Guess I should have looked at the size closer first.</li>
            <li> Planning on using for many different items.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to depot my NYX jumbo shadow pencils.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these for my skin care samples, they were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was able to use every last one of them w/o a problem.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely recommend these :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommened as a jewely storing device!!</li>
            <li> They are so tiny and so cute.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using these to store many of my small beads so they will work ok.  </li>
            <li> The lids stay in place though it is cheaply made and sometimes it takes a moment to get the lid lined up completely.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I thought they&#x27;d be and are serving my purpose.</li>
            <li> These containers are exactly what I need for samples of my products.  </li>
            <li> Made very well!</li>
            <li> I use these to make samples of products for customers, and they work really well!</li>
            <li> They are pretty sturdy and seem well made.</li>
            <li> Love those, use them for my left over lipsticks so that I can throw away the applicators.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I have filled with water and with oil, and they haven&#x27;t leaked (so far, 1 day, on their side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> These containers were exactly what I needed for my hair samples.  </li>
            <li> They are not completely leak proof but were suitable for my needs.</li>
            <li> I use them for my pills everyday and they are a good size</li>
            <li> High quality product, and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The lids fit tightly and don&#x27;t come off, so they&#x27;re safe to carry in a pocket or purse.  </li>
            <li> This product seals tightly and is perfect for small quantities that need to stay fresh and sealed.  </li>
            <li> All containers have lids that seal and open easily.</li>
            <li> I got the jars quickly and professionally packed, however, they do not hold up to carrier oils and all crack.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t open and close easy.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what i expected, I love them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested them with liquid to see how well the lid seals things in but for my solid lip gloss, they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> These are a great sample size but the clear lids make them look less professional.</li>
            <li> These are nice little containers for lip gloss, sample face creams and hand lotions.</li>
            <li> Nice little lip gloss containers.</li>
            <li> Great for samples, travel and just a little for your daily purse.</li>
            <li> All of the containers were in great shape, nothing broken or scratched.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much from them, but they don&#x27;t cost much, so you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> These work very well for my application.</li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li> these are really tiny!&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> I would absolutely purchase this again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> so much cleaner and neater</li>
            <li> None were broken, all the lids screwed on correctly, happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again</li>
            <li> The lids stay on and seal well, and they are very durable.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> Got mu product extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too.  </li>
            <li> Quite a bit smaller than I was anticipating, but still nice containers for smaller beads.</li>
            <li> Again, a little on the small side for lip gloss, they&#x27;d be a perfect size for handmade mineral eye shadows.</li>
            <li> It looked like a busted open original package was patched up with a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than regular lip balm pots which makes it nice for gifts, because it takes less balm to make more items.</li>
            <li> They are about as big around as a quarter and are great for putting small items in.</li>
            <li> But if you need to clean one out (I needed to adjust my recipe &amp; therefore boil the wax out/off of them to reuse, as only boiling water will remove wax residue...)</li>
            <li> They one inch round labels fit perfectly on top to label what it is for potential customers</li>
            <li> All non-toxic ingredients: In a double boiler, or a pot with a stainless steel bowl on top of pot, (that makes a double bolier).</li>
            <li> With water in pot bottom pot, add in top bowl, Prue Castor Oil, (1/2 tsp), and Prue Shea Butter, (1/2 tsp), and one half of any color YOU choose, Non-Toxic Crayola crayon.</li>
            <li> Love these little containers.  </li>
            <li> I really love these little containers.</li>
            <li> Items arrived very quickly and were just as I expected!</li>
            <li> Lip wands, (100 Count Disposable Lip Gloss Wands Applicators Thin Black Handle Flocked ) go great with your lip gloss!!!!</li>
            <li> The photograph makes them look a bit more stylized than they are -- these are simple thin-walled hard plastic jars with a screw top lid of the same material.</li>
            <li> Small- made for great stocking stuffers for male and female coworkers</li>
            <li> so my customers and friends can try before they buy the new line .</li>
            <li> I ordered some previously on ebay and loved the other ones...</li>
            <li> I am only comfortable using these for my salve because it is fairly solid at room temperature.</li>
            <li> The lids screw on easily, and tightly.  </li>
            <li> Tops screw on and off easily, but tight well.</li>
            <li> Serve their purpose :) I use for small product samples.</li>
            <li> were purchased through the seller eRiver so maybe a different seller provides a higher quality item.)</li>
            <li> The plastic is thick and strong!</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small and clear which I love!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that I closed the container tightly</li>
            <li> About half of these don&#x27;t fit together.</li>
            <li> I own a small business that makes body butters and bodes scrubs, and I use these jars as sample jars for potential customers.</li>
            <li> But the lids fit well and screw on tightly.</li>
            <li> Not great if your product is super light sensitive,</li>
            <li> They are a little cheap feeling</li>
            <li> They were fine just smaller than expected not recommended for bho  unless u want</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s clear so people can see what they are getting.  </li>
            <li> 51.&lt;br /&gt;Crystal clear as promised.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> Arrived early, just as it says ..</li>
            <li> bought them to make lip balm with my 9 year old niece and wound up</li>
            <li> So far no issues with them.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, however some of the lids do not screw completely shut.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re tiny, yes, but big enough to fit an entire tube of lipstick, so I don&#x27;t have to do any guess work with where to cut off the stick and what not.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor issue really</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Please make sure you are turning it closed tightly</li>
            <li> The ONLY negative thing to say is that the jars are not the most efficient with retaining liquid.</li>
            <li> but when you add it up in the long run, the cost is just too high.</li>
            <li> Tiny clear plastic containers.</li>
            <li> Nothing big that affected my satisfaction with the actual product, but when I purchase something brand new</li>
            <li> I love them for samples, however not good for liquids!</li>
            <li> So many little carefully individually wrapped little acrylic containers...</li>
            <li> packaging was simple, but as there wasn&#x27;t any apparent damage, sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small enough to put in pockets and just the right size to use as &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; for family members.</li>
            <li> The only complaint we have is that sometimes the lid does not screw on quite right - but it is really not that big of a problems for us.</li>
            <li> I will also remember them if I need similar containers for dry materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The containers are smaller than what I expected, but the job got done.</li>
            <li> The size is about what I expected, but the problem is that about five of the fifty I received were stuck and I couldn&#x27;t open them.</li>
            <li> Some minor surface imperfections (scratches) as you would expect with this type of material.  </li>
            <li> These were way smaller than I expected, but that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected but will work.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and use these little plastic jars for leaving my clients with a lip touchup for later in the day, and it serves my purpose perfectly, as I only expect them to last for a single use.  </li>
            <li> , the only reason scored 4 out of 5 is I ended up with multiple extra lids for the jars not sure why they were in my package</li>
            <li> Several of the pots have misstamped lids and/or rims, and a couple have edges way too sharp for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are a few concerns I have, and I&#x27;ll probably go for a different product in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that they come bagged with some of the lids attached and some loose</li>
            <li> This time they were packaged in a loose bag.</li>
            <li> , it just makes it difficult when you&#x27;re trying to fill them with lip gloss quickly</li>
            <li> These are a little bit smaller than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Product is a little smaller than advertised.  </li>
            <li> They are a little smaller</li>
            <li> We made a lip balm at my daughter&#x27;s bday party, and this little tub was the cheapest I could find on short notice.</li>
            <li> My only gripe was the packaging was a little overkill.</li>
            <li> Not really nice looking as they are marked up as would happen if the plastic was just throwned togethet in a box.</li>
            <li> Came as expected.</li>
            <li> of the jar lids seem a bit off center.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but the edges of the lids and the containers both had plastic flanges that have to be filed or broken off.</li>
            <li> They are just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Also, rough cut edges on lids.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for samples of my pink zebra sprinkles for party in the go...perfect</li>
            <li> but they were just as expected.</li>
            <li> These arrived unbroken, and packaged in sets of 10, and are as expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the caps like some of the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> I order this so other nursing students</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had problems like some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had issues with the leaking like the other reviews, but I haven&#x27;t given them a chance to melt by leaving them in a car, etc.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with postage due and pickup required at USPS station 17 miles away.  </li>
            <li> There were a few pots that were missing the bottoms, only having lids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are about half the size if what I expected for an eyeshadow container.</li>
            <li> half gram&lt;br /&gt;containers other than that</li>
            <li> I recycled what didn&#x27;t work (not worth the fuss).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any leaks, and since I&#x27;m not selling my product the random lid not closing all the way isn&#x27;t too much of an issue for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> These were actually a bit small for what I intended them for but they do the job!</li>
            <li> A few of the lids I had to screw on a few times and they are a little loose</li>
            <li> It did leak the less viscous (watery) materials.</li>
            <li> They close tightly, so there is no worry of leakage.</li>
            <li> and they work they are tight.</li>
            <li> They have a textured rim so it seals tightly and won&#x27;t spill.</li>
            <li> There was a lot of them that was very hard to get open because they were stuck or screwed on to tightly</li>
            <li> so we put a little Vicks under our noses.</li>
            <li> then you will eventually be determining that these are a little costly for what they are.</li>
            <li> I made grapefruit mint scrub and put it in these little containers for gifts.</li>
            <li> Then I thought about putting them into little jars instead, and found these.</li>
            <li> I used a medicine syringe to add the liquid lip gloss to these because a spoon was a little messy.</li>
            <li> A few a little won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have been using them to put in the dried herbs</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with cracked or missing lids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now thinking about using the extra containers to store my thin chains and pendants too.  </li>
            <li> So some got wasted...</li>
            <li> I received only one broken one.</li>
            <li> some of them would not fit on any jar; quite a few even cracked.</li>
            <li> And several are broken.</li>
            <li> A few were cracked, don&#x27;t try putting liquid in or anything that&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> a few of them had small cracks, or slight damage that wouldn&#x27;t usually matter, but we were storing lotion in them, so we didn&#x27;t want it to spoil.....</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because of the 50 containers, about 10 of them were extremely difficult to open because they were not threaded properly...slowed things down for me.  </li>
            <li> (I usually need a few for each gloss that I make), and then close them up and go.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, we encounter smells that are a little difficult to handle</li>
            <li> Bought these to make cosmetic bag size raw shea butter containers.  </li>
            <li> They close very tight and don&#x27;t spill.</li>
            <li> There was at least one pot that was broken and wouldn&#x27;t open.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest is the sellers check each one before shipping as two of them are missing caps so their useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is supposed to go in these but primer and foundation leaked all over the place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also use these when I break a shadow or lipsticks, or when I need to take a small sample with me.</li>
            <li> I grew this past year to include in recipe mix jars.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with any lids not fitting...</li>
            <li> I used these to put shae butter in them to past out as party favors at my son babyshower.  </li>
            <li> I like to include small samples of creams, ointments and lip balms</li>
            <li> Purfect for small amounts of lotions or creams.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with leaks, lids not fitting or anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought these to make lip balm for a baby shower favor and the tops did not fit!</li>
            <li> Too small for our lip-balms, but they are functional and would work for some applications.</li>
            <li> however they are really really small</li>
            <li> i did not think they were going to be as small as they were</li>
            <li> Or goof for small storage</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to overfill them or the lid issue is worse.</li>
            <li> However, the lid can sometimes be hard to put on and remove.</li>
            <li> Slow on fulfilling order once you pay.</li>
            <li> A few were broken.</li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> I could have sold my product with dangerous bits of sharp plastic, not happy.</li>
            <li> Some were broken, cracked or scratched.</li>
            <li> I did recieve 50 jars and none were broken or damaged.</li>
            <li> came broken...</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t be fooled by the poor reviews.  </li>
            <li> packaging that these arrived in was poor quality.</li>
            <li> ordered set of 50, received 52 lids and 49 jars, two of which wish broken.  </li>
            <li> Nothing was broken and all the lids screwed on with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I like the item but was disappointed as I thought they would interlock with each other.</li>
            <li> I read the product reviews on this and thought that these were going to be thin, cracked, and some would be useless.  </li>
            <li> so sad</li>
            <li> Just plain and boring.</li>
            <li> Really bad quality.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> And worst of all...they&#x27;re scratched.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these tiny containers.  They&#x27;re perfect for samples for my small business.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Arrived early, just as it says ..</li>
            <li> The clear tops are awesome, MUCH better than the black top ones, I wanted 3 gram containers, but am glad these were the only ones available, as it has been very useful.</li>
            <li> Cheap, intact, lids all seem to fit. Perfect</li>
            <li> Serve their purpose :) I use for small product samples.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased by how quickly I received my order. The size is perfect for what I was looking for, essential oil infused lotion samples.  All of the containers were in great shape, nothing broken or scratched.  I also like that it&#x27;s clear so people can see what they are getting.  Not great if your product is super light sensitive, but this is only sample size... the idea is that whatever you put in it will be used up quickly. The price was great too.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> These are great! Wyill definitely buy them again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> They work. Fits as much as a standard lip balm container. Good product.</li>
            <li> used to hold homemade beauty products</li>
            <li> Works well for my project</li>
            <li> Love these little containers.  Great quality and worked perfect for what we needed them for!</li>
            <li> These are cheap.  Don&#x27;t expect much from them, but they don&#x27;t cost much, so you get what you pay for.  I am a makeup artist and use these little plastic jars for leaving my clients with a lip touchup for later in the day, and it serves my purpose perfectly, as I only expect them to last for a single use.  I will order again once this bag runs out.</li>
            <li> Perfect container for elementary school students to use for their homemade lip balm. Small enough to put in pockets and just the right size to use as &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; for family members. See through container makes it &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; for students to see the color / color combination they make in each container.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the caps like some of the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is supposed to go in these but primer and foundation leaked all over the place so I won&#x27;t be buying them again for my needs of giving samples to customers.</li>
            <li> These are a little bit smaller than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast exactly as described great price.</li>
            <li> These are nice little containers for lip gloss, sample face creams and hand lotions. They are just the size I needed. They were well packaged and the lids in tact and Wrapped neatly in plastic and sent in a box. They are as discribed.. Good quality for the price. I would recommend these containers to others. I will only order these from Beauticom, because I know for sure what I&#x27;m getting from them. I will order again when I run low. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Guess I should have looked at the size closer first. FYI it&#x27;s the exact size to fit 5 nickels in</li>
            <li> perfect size for my lip glosses</li>
            <li> Items arrived very quickly and were just as I expected! Using them for all kinds of makeup samples and depotting NYX jumbo eye pencils. Great price!!</li>
            <li> I order this so other nursing students and I could put Vicks VapoRub in them. Occasionally, we encounter smells that are a little difficult to handle so we put a little Vicks under our noses. These were prefect for us! They fit perfectly in our pockets. We all carry them with us and put backups in our purses. The only complaint we have is that sometimes the lid does not screw on quite right - but it is really not that big of a problems for us. Definitely a multi-use product!</li>
            <li> These are great little containers. Have proven to be watertight, good quality for the price. Perfect size for travel or sample giveaways.</li>
            <li> Slow on fulfilling order once you pay.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Good size for lip balm &amp; samples of my homemade products! Great bargain!</li>
            <li> Just plain and boring. When I put my product in it, the plastic broke. I could have sold my product with dangerous bits of sharp plastic, not happy.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A HOME BUSINESS SELLING ARBONNE BOTANICAL BASED SKINCARE.These are perfect for samples.of creams and such.</li>
            <li> Shipment on time. Perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li> Worked great to store all my shiro cosmetics samples. No problem with the quality or lids.</li>
            <li> These were actually a bit small for what I intended them for but they do the job! I use them for holding face lotion and also for this coconut oil concoction I make to ward off illnesses like the flu. They do not leak, which I love! And they actually do hold quite a bit of product, I just wish they were about twice the size they are.</li>
            <li> Came as expected. Haven&#x27;t put to use yet. Planning on using for many different items.They&#x27;re just right size if you do crafts.</li>
            <li> I order the containers because I was making homemade lip balm. The containers are smaller than what I expected, but the job got done.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers are chipped, but for the amount you&#x27;re getting, it&#x27;s worth it. I was testing lip glosses so I wanted cheap ones and these were perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great value</li>
            <li> Will order again...great size for giving little samples to people.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for VBS!</li>
            <li> Made lip balm for Christmas gifts.  Containers worked great!  One batch filled 25. I do not like having a # of words required on review!</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for my home made lip scrubs! The plastic is thick and strong!</li>
            <li> they work great! they are a perfect size and do the job wonderfully. i would recommend these to my friends.</li>
            <li> A++ thank you, the product is great!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for seed beads and other jewelry making supplies.</li>
            <li> Some were broken, cracked or scratched.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning to make a bit of salve, and bought these to house the result. There are a few concerns I have, and I&#x27;ll probably go for a different product in the future. They seem to work well enough though, and so I am using those I&#x27;ve bought. I will also remember them if I need similar containers for dry materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was simple, but as there wasn&#x27;t any apparent damage, sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the jar lids seem a bit off center. Some of the lids didn&#x27;t feel as snug as others. I am only comfortable using these for my salve because it is fairly solid at room temperature.</li>
            <li> I am happy! Great deal, good quality works exactly like I need it to. Thank you very much. Gracias! Gratzie</li>
            <li> I bought these to put my home made lip balm in. They were the right size and as advertised. I might consider a bigger size next time. But the lids fit well and screw on tightly. Good purchase. I bought them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> my daughter makes lip balm with her friends for fun and these are perfect</li>
            <li> I love these for my Rodan + Fields Skincare business! [...] they are perfect for giving samples to all the individuals looking for better skin.</li>
            <li> Good quality! i had put some Cocoabutter Vaseline in one of mine that i used for chapped lips... forgot i left in pocket and washed my pants... and no leak! all in place. didn&#x27;t get on my clothes! amazing!</li>
            <li> Great for samples, travel and just a little for your daily purse.</li>
            <li> I really love these little containers. They are about as big around as a quarter and are great for putting small items in. Or if you like to make home-made lip gloss and give some to friends it&#x27;s great for that too.</li>
            <li> I needed to send some cosmetic samples out and these were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Just the right size for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;They came quickly too.  Will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for homemade lip balm.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but the edges of the lids and the containers both had plastic flanges that have to be filed or broken off.</li>
            <li> Great size for lip balms I make.  The lids fit tightly and don&#x27;t come off, so they&#x27;re safe to carry in a pocket or purse.  Good value.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for holding home made lip balm. Small- made for great stocking stuffers for male and female coworkers</li>
            <li> I am a consultant for Rodan + Fields and these are perfect to use to give samples to my clients. [...]</li>
            <li> The size is about what I expected, but the problem is that about five of the fifty I received were stuck and I couldn&#x27;t open them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to depot my NYX jumbo shadow pencils.  I&#x27;ll also use these when I break a shadow or lipsticks, or when I need to take a small sample with me.</li>
            <li> Tiny clear plastic containers. Perfect for lip balm. Arrived intact. All containers have lids that seal and open easily.</li>
            <li> perfect for homemade lip balms, salves and ointments in a 1 tsp amount.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them to make lip balm with my 9 year old niece and wound up&lt;br /&gt;using them for my business needs too.</li>
            <li> Good value for making lip balms.  I give it three stars because of the 50 containers, about 10 of them were extremely difficult to open because they were not threaded properly...slowed things down for me.  Other than that I felt it was a good value.</li>
            <li> great fit and comfortable</li>
            <li> I only had one cap that didn&#x27;t thread correctly. These work very well for my application.</li>
            <li> Perfect for samples.  Very handy.</li>
            <li> This product works well for samples or for travel, when you don&#x27;t want to carry the weight of a larger product in your luggage or purse.</li>
            <li> The caps fit the bottoms and served the purpose for which they were purchased!</li>
            <li> Make sure you look closely at the measurements. They are much smaller than what I was anticipating. They still work well for what I plan to use them for (cosmetic creams). But the pictures posted are deceiving.  They&#x27;re pretty cheap looking and feeling, but you can expect that when they ARE so cheap. So far no issues with them.</li>
            <li> I own a small business that makes body butters and bodes scrubs, and I use these jars as sample jars for potential customers. They&#x27;re the perfect size, and I&#x27;m never afraid of any leaks with these. They keep my products safe and fresh, and the price is perfect for FIFTY OF THESE!! I was a bit hesitant to buy these because they were smaller than I wanted, but they ended up being perfect. These containers would also be great for eyeshadow or lip balm.</li>
            <li> If you are making your own product to put in these containers then you will eventually be determining that these are a little costly for what they are. I love the concept and I the product is adequate for what I need but there is nothing about them that should make them cost what they do. I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much but when you add it up in the long run, the cost is just too high. If the price was lower or there was something special or extraordinary about these, they would have received more stars.</li>
            <li> perfect size for lip gloss favors</li>
            <li> These were perfect for what I wanted them for. I made up lip balms for Christmas presents which these were the perfect size for but I also used them for my sample size homemade deodorant to hand out at the gym.</li>
            <li> these have a great look &amp; are a nice sample size, bur, the top could screw on more securely, however.</li>
            <li> Count &#x3D; 51.&lt;br /&gt;Crystal clear as promised.&lt;br /&gt;5 Gram capacity looks about right (but I did not specifically measure fort that).&lt;br /&gt;And finally, they looked, felt and smelled brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a non cosmetic pot jar expert, I placed my confidence in this seller and was extremely pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using them to put in the dried herbs I grew this past year to include in recipe mix jars.</li>
            <li> Perfect for one dose of meds. I don&#x27;t wear make up so don&#x27;t use it for that.</li>
            <li> They are just as I expected. I did recieve 50 jars and none were broken or damaged. However, the lid can sometimes be hard to put on and remove.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about buying these because of some of the reviews, but i took a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did! These are perfect for what I purchased them for and so far all the lids fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my skin care samples, they were exactly what I was looking for. They one inch round labels fit perfectly on top to label what it is for potential customers, the only reason scored 4 out of 5 is I ended up with multiple extra lids for the jars not sure why they were in my package</li>
            <li> I like the item but was disappointed as I thought they would interlock with each other. I use them for my pills everyday and they are a good size</li>
            <li> these are really tiny!&lt;br /&gt;None came broken... I had no problems with any lids not fitting... I was able to use every last one of them w/o a problem.  They work great.  I filled them with hot lotion that cooled off in them and then put the lids on.  I can definitely recommend these :)</li>
            <li> I purchased these containers for homemade lip gloss, they&#x27;re a bit smaller than I would have wanted but they work. The lid screws on nicely and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with cracked or missing lids. I haven&#x27;t tested them with liquid to see how well the lid seals things in but for my solid lip gloss, they work just fine.  Again, a little on the small side for lip gloss, they&#x27;d be a perfect size for handmade mineral eye shadows.</li>
            <li> We made lip gloss and put them in here. I punched out cute Hello Kitty pictures and used them as party favors. The one inch circle punch fit perfect for the top of these. I used a medicine syringe to add the liquid lip gloss to these because a spoon was a little messy. It worked out great!</li>
            <li> I was trying to figure out a way to organize my earrings and was contemplating buying those 7-day pill dispensers when I came across these.  I purchased the 50 pack and it is the best purchase ever!  I can fit one pair of earrings in each, the lids screw on which means no losing any contents, and the best part is that the containerers are clear so I can see what earrings are in them without havng to open boxes to find what I want.  I&#x27;m now thinking about using the extra containers to store my thin chains and pendants too.  It&#x27;ll certainly be more effective than having them get tangled together.  Highly recommened as a jewely storing device!!</li>
            <li> I used these in my beauty products line. I made homemade lip gloss and poured it in these and they turned out fantastic!</li>
            <li> I made grapefruit mint scrub and put it in these little containers for gifts. I like the jars. They seal well and look nice and they shipped quickly. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used these to put shae butter in them to past out as party favors at my son babyshower.  The guest loved them.</li>
            <li> I like to include small samples of creams, ointments and lip balms so my customers and friends can try before they buy the new line . Great also for pink sparkle lip balm as a party favor for a girls bday party .</li>
            <li> They are so tiny and so cute. Perfect for what I needed them for.</li>
            <li> My friend that I ordered this for was very well pleased and happy she has all ready started using them and putting product in them.</li>
            <li> Great. Plastic containers.  Purfect for small amounts of lotions or creams.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Perfect sample size.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! These work perfectly for samples!</li>
            <li> Of the 50 5-gram pots I received, only 43 are usable.  Several of the pots have misstamped lids and/or rims, and a couple have edges way too sharp for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using these to store many of my small beads so they will work ok.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t use these for any of my balms or sample cosmetics as they feel so very cheap I&#x27;d be embarrassed to give to a client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Mine were purchased through the seller eRiver so maybe a different seller provides a higher quality item.)</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use as sample containers for my homemade balms. The containers are fairly flimsy and feel cheap but work perfectly fine as cheap sample containers for small amounts of product. The lids stay in place though it is cheaply made and sometimes it takes a moment to get the lid lined up completely. Not entirely dissatisfied but I likely won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> These work great for customer samples!</li>
            <li> I use these for my Perfectly Posh samples and they are the perfect size! I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> About half of these don&#x27;t fit together. I recycled what didn&#x27;t work (not worth the fuss).</li>
            <li> Did what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> If buying these for cosmetic samples I recommend buying ones with colored lids. These are a great sample size but the clear lids make them look less professional.</li>
            <li> Purchased these specifically for storing the lip balm that I made with my daughter.  These are the perfect size for our needs.</li>
            <li> Great Product Thank You</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size.  I fill them with my samples they are light weight and easy to send out.</li>
            <li> takes long to get it, but great packagin and complete product</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for my homemade lip balm</li>
            <li> There were a few pots that were missing the bottoms, only having lids. There was at least one pot that was broken and wouldn&#x27;t open. I did like them though. Perfect size for my homemade lipbalm.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and use these to depot my lipstick - a New Tube of Lipstick fits perfectly! Came packaged great and shipping was on time! ...Lids fit great and secure</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I thought they&#x27;d be and are serving my purpose. But if you need to clean one out (I needed to adjust my recipe &amp; therefore boil the wax out/off of them to reuse, as only boiling water will remove wax residue...) DO NOT BOIL!!! Boiling it will make it expand and the tops will no longer fit! So some got wasted...</li>
            <li> Works well for the project I used it for. Two lids came with cracks, but I still used them. Using for household use now, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Love these! I bought these so my sister and I could share makeup like pigments and stuff. Turns out these are great for putting any foil samples you get! Makes them last longer after you use the product and more convenient too!! They are a little cheap feeling but they definitely do their job.</li>
            <li> These were a lot smaller than I was hoping. Some of the lids don&#x27;t close right. And worst of all...they&#x27;re scratched. Came in a plastic bag so that might&#x27;ve added to the damage. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll reorder again.</li>
            <li> Some of the lids were cracked but other than that, good purchase and price :)</li>
            <li> These containers are exactly what I need for samples of my products.  The lids screw on easily, and tightly.  Great little containers.</li>
            <li> I received only one broken one. Rest were great.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to make lip gloss and they are fine for that. I don&#x27;t like the fact that they come bagged with some of the lids attached and some loose but that&#x27;s a minor issue really, it just makes it difficult when you&#x27;re trying to fill them with lip gloss quickly and you have to sort through to find the ones that are already unsealed.</li>
            <li> Works great for my product samples! Great price!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality  product for small amounts of lip balms or salves. Packaged nicely, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> These have worked out great. A few of the lids I had to screw on a few times and they are a little loose but overall they worked great for my homemade lip balm.</li>
            <li> I am giving 3 stars to the product not to Myo Makeup who is an excellent seller. I got the jars quickly and professionally packed, however, they do not hold up to carrier oils and all crack. I even had vitamin E and Aloe in one and after a day or two the product leaked everywhere. This is probably better for powders and glitter than liquids. Somewhat disappointed. Going to try them with mixing foundation and if they crack then will end up giving them to some who can use them as i very rarely use eye shadow and i do not do arts and crafts. Wish these would have worked out for me and i strongly suggest anyone meaning to use these for any type of cream think twice before purchasing.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased these containers I thought they would be larger, however I discovered they are perfect for sample sizes.  I make body butters and I can put enough in them for my customers to have a nice sized sample and my inch round lables are a perfect fit for the container tops.</li>
            <li> I decided to depot my lipsticks to preserve space. Now, my intentions are to preserve space, not necessarily organize, so a regular palette type of depotting wouldn&#x27;t work. Then I thought about putting them into little jars instead, and found these. It&#x27;s so perfect for things like lipgloss or lipstick because it can contain the entire thing. They&#x27;re tiny, yes, but big enough to fit an entire tube of lipstick, so I don&#x27;t have to do any guess work with where to cut off the stick and what not. Overall great for me, just depends on what you want it for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Lotion Samples! Well made.</li>
            <li> did just what i needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent small jars - perfect for my homemade under-eye cream. Tops screw on and off easily, but tight well. Good little size.</li>
            <li> I read the product reviews on this and thought that these were going to be thin, cracked, and some would be useless.  Please don&#x27;t be fooled by the poor reviews.  I don&#x27;t know if the supplier on these varies, as that might explain the discrepancies, but my package contained well package sets of these.  They are made of a sturdy, plastic, and I&#x27;ve not had any to not thread nicely.  I would absolutely purchase this again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Some of the lids would not screw on the pots.  Also, rough cut edges on lids.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had problems like some of the other reviewers. I can see how you could over tighten these but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with leaks, lids not fitting or anything else. I&#x27;ve been using these for travel. It holds (for me) a weekend worth of hair, face, etc. product. I&#x27;ve also given these to friends who wanted to try cosmetic/hair products that I have and they think these containers are very cute.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for my daughter&#x27;s spa birthday party for individual lip gloss. The size and quality of the product was perfect. The girls liked how the containers made their homemade lip gloss look like &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; from a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging that these arrived in was poor quality. It looked like a busted open original package was patched up with a ziplock bag. The containers were spilling out into the box when I opened it. Nothing big that affected my satisfaction with the actual product, but when I purchase something brand new I want it to be unopened.</li>
            <li> I bought these to make lip balm for a baby shower favor and the tops did not fit! They looked nice, and were shipped quickly, but we had to go through and try each top with each jar to figure out which one fit...some of them would not fit on any jar; quite a few even cracked. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Product is a little smaller than advertised.  Too small for our lip-balms, but they are functional and would work for some applications.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these they were packaged nicely. This time they were packaged in a loose bag. And several are broken. Otherwise I like these.</li>
            <li> I used for lip gloss, they are made will.  Tops fit, and the perfect size.  I will buy these again</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller then I like them to be but it will work.</li>
            <li> This product seals tightly and is perfect for small quantities that need to stay fresh and sealed.  never had any leakage or problems, and have used many</li>
            <li> love this size. Quality &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making own cosmetics. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> bought this set to wrangle in the circus that my makeup collection had become.&lt;br /&gt;Looks so much cleaner and neater now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canisters are small, but perfect for my purposes!&lt;br /&gt;Came in individually wrapped plastic sleeves, in one big bag. None were broken, all the lids screwed on correctly, happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again</li>
            <li> Sometimes the lids don&#x27;t fit on just right, but they do all close, and for the price it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Really bad quality. Doesn&#x27;t open and close easy. Saw good reviews, that was the reason I chose this product. When contacted seller about the return, his reply was - quoting: &amp;#34;These are only $0.10 per piece. Better quality are considerably more money, and you are certainly welcome to seek them out.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Rude and unprofessional !&lt;br /&gt;Keep away!</li>
            <li> These little pots are great for samples of my body scrubs! Made very well!</li>
            <li> I like these for sharing lotion samples with my friends and potential customers. They close tightly, so there is no worry of leakage.</li>
            <li> it was a good product over all however they are really really small i did not think they were going to be as small as they were but i guess that is my failt for not looking at the size befor i actually payed for them... but either way i will fing use for them over all i love them but i just wish they were bigger ... my mistake.</li>
            <li> Bought these to make cosmetic bag size raw shea butter containers.  I&#x27;ll also use them when I&#x27;m painting and want to save a specific color I&#x27;ve created to use the next day.</li>
            <li> We made a lip balm at my daughter&#x27;s bday party, and this little tub was the cheapest I could find on short notice. I haven&#x27;t had issues with the leaking like the other reviews, but I haven&#x27;t given them a chance to melt by leaving them in a car, etc. At room temp. they seem to be just fine, and everyone at the party loved them (even the boys took one home... for mom). Very sturdy, and only trouble with 2 of the 50 with the threading being a bit off. Overall, at 30 cents each, happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> There was a lot of them that was very hard to get open because they were stuck or screwed on to tightly</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Rodan + Fields business!</li>
            <li> I use these to make samples of products for customers, and they work really well! The lids stay on and seal well, and they are very durable.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for samples of my pink zebra sprinkles for party in the go...perfect</li>
            <li> Very small but they were just as expected. Perfect for making our own lip balm.</li>
            <li> These containers are perfect. A little lighter in weight than others, by 0.4 gm, but definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good quality use for makeup samples</li>
            <li> I use them for pest control I collect samples in them and they work they are tight. Seal.</li>
            <li> bought for lip balm, they&#x27;ll make a perfect container for it....but unexpectedly great for storing seed beads</li>
            <li> They are exactly what i expected, I love them. thanks</li>
            <li> NEVER RECIEVED PACKAGE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These containers are practical for my sample product and I like them very much.  I would recommend them to others too!</li>
            <li> Perfect, it was just as described, arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> A few a little won&#x27;t but ok containers</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product for helping with my new business</li>
            <li> I use these when I make homemade lip glosses with my granddaughter! All non-toxic ingredients: In a double boiler, or a pot with a stainless steel bowl on top of pot, (that makes a double bolier). With water in pot bottom pot, add in top bowl, Prue Castor Oil, (1/2 tsp), and Prue Shea Butter, (1/2 tsp), and one half of any color YOU choose, Non-Toxic Crayola crayon. On medium high heat, stir for one minute, or until fully melted, then pour into containers like this one, let cool, and you just made your own non&#x27;toxic lip gloss! Lip wands, (100 Count Disposable Lip Gloss Wands Applicators Thin Black Handle Flocked ) go great with your lip gloss!!!! ENJOY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this is perfect for setting my homemade lip glosses and lipsticks. I like them. They are the perfect size. I really like them.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I made lip gloss to give as gifts at Christmas. These were the perfect size and a great price!</li>
            <li> This product arrived with postage due and pickup required at USPS station 17 miles away.  I contacted the seller and they responded immediately with crediting me with the postage due.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was sufficient to avoid damage to the containers.  I will order from this seller again.  These containers are perfect for home crafted lip balms, eyeshadows, and other cosmetic uses.  My grandchildren and I make our custom blended lip balms for gifts.  Recently, we made custom party favors for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday sleepover.  The youngsters delighted in choosing their personal blend of organic products.</li>
            <li> These are so great and have so many uses! I put extra make up for travel and even some medication for travel. They are pretty sturdy and seem well made. You get a bunch of them for not a lot of cash. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own lipglosses, and these little jars are great.  I make the glosses, put them in the pots (I usually need a few for each gloss that I make), and then close them up and go.  Simple but perfect!</li>
            <li> Love those, use them for my left over lipsticks so that I can throw away the applicators. Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Good product, overall, but a few of them had small cracks, or slight damage that wouldn&#x27;t usually matter, but we were storing lotion in them, so we didn&#x27;t want it to spoil.....</li>
            <li> They work for my lip balms and that&#x27;s what I got them for so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> A few were broken. Lots with scratches.</li>
            <li> Just ok some units cracked</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need. Wish they came in smaller quantities, but they seal and stay shut in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> These are great for holding small parts, beads, coins or whatever you can think of. Screw on lids for security.</li>
            <li> They came from China in a cardboard box and that was it. Not really nice looking as they are marked up as would happen if the plastic was just throwned togethet in a box. I will have to wash them since this is for lip balm. If your planning to sell lip balm this will not make your product look great and for my girls who are 9 it will do.</li>
            <li> I use these for samples of a product I make.  They are the perfect size to offer enough product to give potential customers a good idea of how well it works. The brilliant color of the product shows through the side walls after labels have been applied also.  Simple and attractive.</li>
            <li> ordered set of 50, received 52 lids and 49 jars, two of which wish broken.  the complete ones are ok though just keep it in mind</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for storing many cosmetics conveniently, especially if you are into mixing your own colors and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> They were fine just smaller than expected not recommended for bho  unless u want half gram&lt;br /&gt;containers other than that no</li>
            <li> Love these! brand new, clean, and just as described. They close very tight and don&#x27;t spill. I use them for oil samples.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for what we needed!</li>
            <li> I bought these little jars to put facial product samples in for my business and they worked perfectly. The products looked great in them and looked very professional. My only gripe was the packaging was a little overkill. TONS of tape.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for lip balm or lip scrub. I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> great product so I purchased it 2x but then my 2nd order didn&#x27;t come in.  so sad but they reimbursed me with no problems so they get 4 stars</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and when I opened it up not all 50 containers were there. If I can get the replacements by this weekend then I will change this review but until then it will stay a 2.</li>
            <li> These arrived unbroken, and packaged in sets of 10, and are as expected. Some minor surface imperfections (scratches) as you would expect with this type of material.  The photograph makes them look a bit more stylized than they are -- these are simple thin-walled hard plastic jars with a screw top lid of the same material. Here are the dimensions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- They are about 11/16&amp;#34; tall including the lid.&lt;br /&gt;-- The diameter is 1 1/8&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-- The interior dimension fits a quarter coin, exactly&lt;br /&gt;-- They hold 1 teaspoon of contents to the level where the screws for the lid begin (a stack of 4-5 quarters)&lt;br /&gt;-- They hold 1.5 teaspoons of contents to the very top (a stack of 7 quarters)&lt;br /&gt;-- The lid will accommodate a 1&amp;#34; circle label (I used label paper and a 1&amp;#34; paper punch).&lt;br /&gt;-- I have filled with water and with oil, and they haven&#x27;t leaked (so far, 1 day, on their side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps with your project!</li>
            <li> Got mu product extremely fast. Great for making your own lip balm and lipsticks. which is what I use it for. Or goof for small storage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the fault of the seller ..... I had no idea how big a 5 gram container is.&lt;br /&gt;They are quality containers with a good screw on lid.&lt;br /&gt;They are about half the size if what I expected for an eyeshadow container.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect little containers for diy lip balm. I love them. The only thing I would suggest is the sellers check each one before shipping as two of them are missing caps so their useless.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for any samples I&#x27;ve provided to my customers.  I&#x27;ve put lotion and capsules in them without any problems with leaks.  So far all of the lids have worked great and are easy to screw on and off.  Exactly what I needed for a great price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter and myself to make our own lip balms.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for our needs.  We received 50 containers with lids.  Nothing was broken and all the lids screwed on with no problems.  Shipping was fast too.  Very pleased.  Would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product and more than met what I wanted. Just make sure you count all tops and bottoms before using them. I was short 9 bottoms in one shipment.  Quickly got a refund and reordered again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Quite a bit smaller than I was anticipating, but still nice containers for smaller beads.</li>
            <li> Good size, easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Comes with 50 PIECES. NOT 50 CONTAINERS. Just a heads up!</li>
            <li> Use these for sample containers of homemade hand/body cream.  Make several fragarences so try to have samples for trial.&lt;br /&gt;Great size and good quality</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughters spa themed birthday party to use for the girls to put their homemade lipglosses in. They are smaller than I wanted but they are sturdy and good quality and served their purpose well. The girls got a few each and loved them so I am happy with them and the price.</li>
            <li> I love them for samples, however not good for liquids!</li>
            <li> These containers were exactly what I needed for my hair samples.  They are not completely leak proof but were suitable for my needs.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my samples!! Not too big, not too small and clear which I love!  Will definitely order these again soon!</li>
            <li> These were way smaller than I expected, but that&#x27;s my fault. They&#x27;re not the best quality, but they&#x27;re not bad quality either. You won&#x27;t find these to be of much use for travel, but they were able to meet my intended purpose. I get a lot of foil samples of beauty products like foundation, primer, BB Cream, etc and most of the time, I can get two and sometimes three uses out of a foil packet. I got a primer sample that yielded three uses, after the first use I squirted the rest into one of these and was able to have it easily packaged in one of these for the remaining two uses. These containers also allow for a more sanitary storage. Overall, these were a good value.</li>
            <li> Precisely what I needed for making lip balm for gift baskets.  All 50 arrived in perfect condition and they screw closed very securely.</li>
            <li> These are perfect to give out very small samples--especially liquids--I&#x27;m sure there are other great uses but that is what I use them for with my business. They have a textured rim so it seals tightly and won&#x27;t spill. Please make sure you are turning it closed tightly and you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the results! I think the price is great too and a &amp;#34;worth it&amp;#34; business expense!</li>
            <li> These jars are amazing! Great for the price. The ONLY negative thing to say is that the jars are not the most efficient with retaining liquid.</li>
            <li> I only received 25 of the 50 containers</li>
            <li> Will work well for samples holds about .15-.20 ounces</li>
            <li> I have to say they are ok...I ordered some previously on ebay and loved the other ones...These are a bit cheap looking and feeling....I guess they are just ok....</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected but will work.</li>
            <li> It did leak the less viscous (watery) materials. I am pretty sure that I closed the container tightly but I will not use it again for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great seller!!!  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> High quality product, and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for sampling lotion. You can get easily about 4 uses on the hands, and even more if you are sparing. You can&#x27;t beat the amount of them for the price, and they aren&#x27;t low quality by any means! They shut tight, and they are beautiful and clear.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my homemade lip balm. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect for making my homemade lip balm.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Just what I needed for my body scrub samples.  Great Price.</li>
            <li> So many little carefully individually wrapped little acrylic containers...&lt;br /&gt;Wow.&lt;br /&gt;They are excellent for cosmetic samples.</li>
            <li> Nice little lip gloss containers.</li>
            <li> I used these for lip balm. They are smaller than regular lip balm pots which makes it nice for gifts, because it takes less balm to make more items. They are sturdy, however some of the lids do not screw completely shut. You have to be very careful not to overfill them or the lid issue is worse. I haven&#x27;t noticed any leaks, and since I&#x27;m not selling my product the random lid not closing all the way isn&#x27;t too much of an issue for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought. The picture could use a coin or an inch ruler as a guide</li>
            <li> A few were cracked, don&#x27;t try putting liquid in or anything that&#x27;s oily. Will leak.</li>
            <li> Loved them but they were too large for my mailing boxes.</li>
    </ol>
