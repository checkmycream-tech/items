            <li>and she liked it</li>

            <li>I love the distinct sandal wood in the perfume, great for the spring season.</li>

            <li>I am in love with the smell of this, and it lingers on the clothes to a minimum that throughout the day I can still smell it.</li>
            <li>And it matters for a perfume to not smell so overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I just love Hanae Mori Butterfly Eau de Toillette by Hanae Mori for Women.  </li>

            <li>Its my daughters favorite.  </li>
            <li>I bought a refillable perfume dispenser from Perfumania ($10), and fill it from this bottle to take on my many business trips.</li>

            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>

            <li>and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>My wife brought a tester from a friend, and I love the smell of it on her.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Soon as I sprayed it, I fell in love all over again.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this from another vendor, but was satisfied with the product I received through Amazon Market as well, which is to be remarked upon, as that is not always so.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of so many perfumes</li>
            <li>I love Hanae Mori.  </li>

            <li>I have worn this fragrance for over a decade and love it still.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought perfume at a discount before which has been authentic.</li>
            <li>I just love the way this smells on my wife.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume</li>

            <li>Nice floral scent , light and refreshing</li>
            <li>I had always preferred the more fruity smelling perfume but felt it wasn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li>So I set out to find me a more sophisticated perfume that I enjoyed but also felt was appropriate for my age.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of a room fragrance plug-in, like the Kitchen or Caramel or Sugar Cookie scents from Bath &amp; Body Work or Yankee Candle, but more layered &amp; sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Love the scent</li>
            <li>also noted that this scent was in a lot of reviewer&#x27;s top 10 lists for 2013.</li>
            <li>Favorite.</li>
            <li>It reminds me more of a body oil than a perfume, except that it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I wear it all the time! :)</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance, but not on me.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>

            <li>So glad to have found it here.</li>
            <li>It smells vanilla-y to me (though the description says that&#x27;s almond) and is on the sweeter side but not disgustingly so.</li>
            <li>I am glad this product was just as it was described.</li>
            <li>I especially liked buying it through Amazon at such a discounted price!!</li>

            <li>Amazon also offers the best price and needless to say, I am completely happy with my purchase of this wonderful smelling perfume and with amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Very clean, not too spicy or floral.</li>
            <li>I first found this fragrance in Tahiti and loved the smell, up to that point</li>
            <li>This is the first time I buy this perfume, my husband loved it.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed with my purchase!</li>
            <li>After borrowing my daughters perfume on our last visit there, I knew I needed to have my own!!  </li>
            <li>By the way, the refillable dispenser is a great way to try new scents.</li>
            <li>At the top of the bottle there is a part that provide valve place on the bottle easily.</li>
            <li>This is a nice mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>When I found it here on Amazon at such a great price, I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Very special fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Scent was not as strong or nice compared to buying it full price at Bloomingdales.</li>
            <li>So I recommend this if you want a light feminine scent :).</li>
            <li>My favorite at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li>rather than for special occasions!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly powdery smelling, but awesome :).  </li>
            <li>Loved finding it at this great price, it&#x27;s almost half</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to find it online for a better price.</li>
            <li>Not my first purchase of this perfume, love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant very oncommon smell, best for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Plus this product shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>A lot of perfumes I didn&#x27;t like as the smell was way too strong or was not feminine smelling to me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who does not like strong smelling perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It is very light, but it doesn&#x27;t fade away quickly .</li>
            <li>Mild scent and very light ....</li>
            <li>stays on for the whole day, it&#x27;s very sexy and fruity.</li>
            <li>but this scent is much more sweet and intoxicating.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell that lingers from this fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I received it extremely quick (3 days after I ordered it!)  </li>
            <li>the scent is light.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Light scent.</li>
            <li>IT doesn&#x27;t matter what day it is, if I&#x27;m in public, someone remarks how great I smell.</li>
            <li>I went home and looked it up on line and found it for $34.00 with free shipping...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is among my top 5 favorite perfumes because it maintains so much nuance on drydown.</li>
            <li>I love how light and fresh it smells.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to give this to my mom or sister since it had such great reviews and was so cheap on Amazon...</li>
            <li>This is a very nice fragrance that is light enough for the work place.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, and it lasts for hours, unlike some that you put it on and can&#x27;t even smell it right after you put it on.</li>
            <li>It has a very distinct and assertive quality.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a special occasion, but for daily wear, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>her unique scent, I&#x27;d order it for myself.  </li>
            <li>It has a light sweet scent with a hint of musk.  </li>
            <li>we love the product and will definitely be interested in reordering again</li>
            <li>I recommend this fragrance to anyone looking for a unique scent.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I save so much more than when I purchase this exact item at a department store.</li>
            <li>This is a unique, feminine scent with notes of powder, flowers, vanilla, and something else...</li>
            <li>One I wear on special occasions.</li>
            <li>This scent is by far, the most unique and signature!</li>
            <li>I have paid more for it in the past and since I have amazon prime it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet</li>
            <li>I wore this fragrance several years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh light fragrance; not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smells more like alcohol than the real one.</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast and packaged securely!</li>
            <li>It is very feminine, and I&#x27;m glad it works with my skin.  </li>
            <li>.. it used to be $90 a 3.4 bottle at sephora back in the day, but it&#x27;s just so good</li>
            <li>This is not the true perfume.</li>
            <li>vanilla and sweet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good price that I don&#x27;t have to worry about using it up.</li>
            <li>It is such a good buy on Amazon</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to many purfumes but his one has become my standby -</li>
            <li>- I love it so much</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews that said what a lovely, unique smell this had, therefore maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>it smells like vanilla but isn&#x27;t super sweet</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It was also super quick to arrive.</li>
            <li>But then it also appears to wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of \\&quot;Hanae</li>
            <li>Scent fades rather quick</li>
            <li>This seller delivered quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Normally this is my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>This is for sure a new fragrance that I hadn&#x27;t used .</li>
            <li>I read on the internet that the Ragdoll perfume is something of a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; of this Hanae Mori one, so I bought it with high hopes of nostalgia, and was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a truly remarkable fragrance unlike any other.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great - nothing to heavy or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Light and really yummy</li>
            <li>it is a great everyday scent...</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent, so soft, so lovely was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>this is not the real thing the smell last for just a bit of time and can say it smells good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>April 13th, 2014 Amazon Marketplace made a replacement order for me and now I have to wait another 4 days as the perfume is considered a hazardous material and cannot be shipped 2-Day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth twice the price</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>Product was what I ordered and came in good shape with absolutely no breakage.</li>
            <li>I am a 23 year old so-cal girl and love this scent.  </li>
            <li>, i have the largest size and it&#x27;s SO worth</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, it lasts, it smells more like vanilla even though it&#x27;sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Soft but memorable scent-</li>
            <li>so I hope I can find someone who does like it but just plan to fumigate my brother&#x27;s car with it for fun as of now...</li>
            <li>Price was good, better then the stores at least.</li>
            <li>I loved that fragrance so much and was sad when they changed the formula to something not that great.</li>
            <li>I now can use it daily and enjoy the scent I love.  </li>
            <li>knew right then</li>
            <li>The lady at Nordstrom was right...</li>
            <li>however this one I received isn&#x27;t even the right color</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Mother&#x27;s day gift, I usually buy the men&#x27;s version because it is more popular...</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my Mom, she&#x27;s worn this fragrance in the past, and its smells really great on her.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was excited and had high expectations.</li>
            <li>The color of the perfume was very light also compared to my bottle that I still had a bit left in.  </li>
            <li>That is how I first became aware of Hanae Mori.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought it from a shop.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts longer than most of the perfumes I have recently used.</li>
            <li>never fails that when I have this on, I get compliments.</li>
            <li>I like the pretty box</li>
            <li>but the product shipped during a hot week.</li>
            <li>My wife fell in love with this scent several years ago but was running out.</li>
            <li>its soo much cheaper!</li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>However, the first scent that came out of the bottle was an overpowering alcohol aroma.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>and I was horrified when my first friend sprayed it on.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is not expensive, and you get a lot for the price.  </li>
            <li>I put it on and felt pretty.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was very happy!</li>
            <li>For me it was worth it and its a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very different from most mainstream perfumes.</li>
            <li>Department stores carry this perfume for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>Love to wear it when I don&#x27;t want something strong or heavy.</li>
            <li>a sweet but mature smell got tons of compliments !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells Great and Subtle Sweet&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a young 20 something who is along the transition into being more of an adult.</li>
            <li>This scent is so delicate and lovely, but also quite distinctive - I have never gotten more compliments on a scent I was wearing.</li>
            <li>Oh and I compared the packaging from amazon and my bottle from the dept store, they were both completely the same, really glad to know that it was not a fake!</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells like vanilla, berries and flowers, and is sweet, very feminine and classy!  </li>
            <li>Amazing smell that is classy, not too young (flowery) and not too old (musk).</li>
            <li>I was worried it might not be the true Hanae Mori or that it would be old.  </li>
            <li>Not too cloyingly sweet, yet not too &#x27;old person&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, sweet smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is exquisite--it&#x27;s light, sweet, and slightly powdery and smells fresh as a breeze blowing through a flower</li>
            <li>buy from other website with more reputable names such as fragancenet.com or sephora..</li>
            <li>It is not too strong but there is enough to it that you can smell it.</li>
            <li>Reeks of pure alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle</li>
            <li>My wife fell in love with this perfume as we  were shopping around the mall, since her birthday was coming up shortly, I knew something she loved a lot, so as soon as I got home checked about 10 sites for price, and I found it at Amazon , a bigger bottle for 40 % less, so I ordered it ,</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing this perfume and have received various compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>Not so, it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li>you put too much on it</li>
            <li>Also, perhaps I received a knock-off, and not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I got it for my wife and she loves it, I&#x27;m very please with it and the time it was deliver.</li>
            <li>A bit disappointing since the scent is so beautiful!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and powdery.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast also</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I am really finicky when it comes to fragrances and haven&#x27;t bought any for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use it very often because it cost so much.  </li>
            <li>Shipping speed was fast</li>
            <li>I wear it on special days and on days that I want to feel special so in other words-</li>
            <li>Wow... The reviews for this perfume were right on the money.</li>
            <li>It was light, floral, and subtle, unlike many perfumes I&#x27;ve sampled in department stores.</li>
            <li>It keeps its original fragrance, and is only \\&quot;one\\&quot; of a couple of perfumes on the market today that is \\&quot;engineered\\&quot; to do this.  </li>
            <li>I adore the smell of this perfume and many other as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I love two other Hanae Mori scents - Couture and Mystical Moon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle enough to not overpower you yet pretty unforgettable once you smell it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong scent and lasts a long time but no one in my family thinks it smells good, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Moreover, given the reviews, many of which describe a light fragrance, it is heavier than anticipated when initially applied and irritates my sinuses with its harsh undertone.</li>
            <li>Beautiful nostalgic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the price (less than half of what Penney&#x27;s priced it at), the checkout was simple, and the delivery very speedy.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrance - you must try this!  </li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and very distinct has</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular Hanai fragrance nearly 3 years ago &amp; have been buying it ever since!!</li>
            <li>They did offer 1 month free extension on Prime Membership (which I thoroughly enjoy) but am a tad let down that an item I ordered over the weekend arrived today when an item I ordered LAST WEEK is just now being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Sweet and fresh and to me a slight sent of powder.</li>
            <li>I wanted the fragrance , once I smelled the scent in a high priced store, and Amazon got it to me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and subtle, and like another reviewer wrote, you can wear a lot of it and it still won&#x27;t be overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Sadly, the staying power isn&#x27;t that great, though.</li>
            <li>It is feminine, romantic, young and sweet.</li>
            <li>She loves Hanae Mori and its normally priced at $90.</li>
            <li>I get multiple compliments on the scent and the price is right.</li>
            <li>The sandal wood smell is rare, although very different from real sandal wood (which might be strange for perfume but I like it very much).</li>
            <li>Smoky sweet smell for the discerning nose...not a common scent but something familiar about it that is comforting.</li>
            <li>new-</li>
            <li>My new fav scent.</li>
            <li>Live this perfume.  </li>
            <li>It is a very soft scent.</li>
            <li>Not the same as the original, scent doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>It has a soft  fragrance!</li>
            <li>of my favorites by far!</li>
            <li>Above statement is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Mori\\&quot; for several years and find that the shelf - retail price can be pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>The size is compliant with airline rules, and you can keep trying new scents before spending the bigger money to buy a whole bottle of a perfume.</li>
            <li>She marveled at how large the bottle was, especially when I told her the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I am stuck with a perfume that is way too brown in color and smells like pure alcohol, doesn&#x27;t last like it</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent that is hard to describe but the moment I smelled it I instantly thought it smelled &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Young or old spray and wait for the complements</li>
            <li>There are the fragrance kiosks which sell it, but I think the price is still killer on Amazon, no annoying mall hustlers, gas to waste and time.</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old and discovered this perfume years ago.  </li>
            <li>When I first spay this perfume I actually do not love the initial smell, but when it settles into the skin, it smells fantastic without having that \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; sent.  </li>
            <li>But then I completely forgot about it and was quite surprised when he gave me it as a gift.</li>
            <li>I have to go to a regular department store to now get the real stuff</li>
            <li>When the perfume arrived was surprised by the size.</li>
            <li>The only downside is I don&#x27;t fee like it has real staying power.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased it at a local department store for twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Product  arrived early, was packaged well as not to break.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying Butterfly by Hanae Mori over the last few years.</li>
            <li>Recently, I was looking for a new perfume and decided to buy the Hanae Mori one.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and was very surprised it was the larger size.</li>
            <li>Apparently I had pointed it out to him in a magazine saying the description sounded like something I would like.</li>
            <li>Some people&#x27;s natural chemistry just reacts differently with scents then others.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing not an imitation.</li>
            <li>Its not full of all the synthetic oils, its pure.  </li>
            <li>Not really sure how sandalwood and patchouli create such a mesmerizing scent</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And it matters for a perfume to not smell so overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I just love Hanae Mori Butterfly Eau de Toillette by Hanae Mori for Women.  </li>

            <li> I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Soon as I sprayed it, I fell in love all over again.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this from another vendor, but was satisfied with the product I received through Amazon Market as well, which is to be remarked upon, as that is not always so.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of so many perfumes</li>

            <li> I had always preferred the more fruity smelling perfume but felt it wasn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li> So I set out to find me a more sophisticated perfume that I enjoyed but also felt was appropriate for my age.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of a room fragrance plug-in, like the Kitchen or Caramel or Sugar Cookie scents from Bath &amp; Body Work or Yankee Candle, but more layered &amp; sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Love the scent</li>
            <li> also noted that this scent was in a lot of reviewer&#x27;s top 10 lists for 2013.</li>
            <li> Favorite.</li>
            <li> It reminds me more of a body oil than a perfume, except that it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I wear it all the time! :)</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance, but not on me.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>

            <li> Very special fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Scent was not as strong or nice compared to buying it full price at Bloomingdales.</li>
            <li> So I recommend this if you want a light feminine scent :).</li>
            <li> My favorite at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li> rather than for special occasions!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly powdery smelling, but awesome :).  </li>
            <li> Loved finding it at this great price, it&#x27;s almost half</li>

            <li> It is very light, but it doesn&#x27;t fade away quickly .</li>
            <li> Mild scent and very light ....</li>

            <li> but this scent is much more sweet and intoxicating.</li>

            <li> It has a very distinct and assertive quality.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a special occasion, but for daily wear, it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> Smells more like alcohol than the real one.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast and packaged securely!</li>
            <li> It is very feminine, and I&#x27;m glad it works with my skin.  </li>
            <li> .. it used to be $90 a 3.4 bottle at sephora back in the day, but it&#x27;s just so good</li>
            <li> This is not the true perfume.</li>
            <li> vanilla and sweet.  </li>

            <li> It is such a good buy on Amazon</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to many purfumes but his one has become my standby -</li>
            <li> - I love it so much</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews that said what a lovely, unique smell this had, therefore maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> it smells like vanilla but isn&#x27;t super sweet</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It was also super quick to arrive.</li>
            <li> But then it also appears to wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of \\&quot;Hanae</li>
            <li> Scent fades rather quick</li>
            <li> This seller delivered quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Normally this is my favorite perfume</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> This is for sure a new fragrance that I hadn&#x27;t used .</li>
            <li> I read on the internet that the Ragdoll perfume is something of a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; of this Hanae Mori one, so I bought it with high hopes of nostalgia, and was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a truly remarkable fragrance unlike any other.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great - nothing to heavy or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Light and really yummy</li>
            <li> it is a great everyday scent...</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent, so soft, so lovely was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> this is not the real thing the smell last for just a bit of time and can say it smells good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> April 13th, 2014 Amazon Marketplace made a replacement order for me and now I have to wait another 4 days as the perfume is considered a hazardous material and cannot be shipped 2-Day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth twice the price</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> Product was what I ordered and came in good shape with absolutely no breakage.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old so-cal girl and love this scent.  </li>
            <li> , i have the largest size and it&#x27;s SO worth</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, it lasts, it smells more like vanilla even though it&#x27;sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Soft but memorable scent-</li>
            <li> so I hope I can find someone who does like it but just plan to fumigate my brother&#x27;s car with it for fun as of now...</li>
            <li> Price was good, better then the stores at least.</li>
            <li> I loved that fragrance so much and was sad when they changed the formula to something not that great.</li>
            <li> I now can use it daily and enjoy the scent I love.  </li>
            <li> knew right then</li>
            <li> The lady at Nordstrom was right...</li>
            <li> however this one I received isn&#x27;t even the right color</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Mother&#x27;s day gift, I usually buy the men&#x27;s version because it is more popular...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mom, she&#x27;s worn this fragrance in the past, and its smells really great on her.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was excited and had high expectations.</li>
            <li> The color of the perfume was very light also compared to my bottle that I still had a bit left in.  </li>
            <li> That is how I first became aware of Hanae Mori.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought it from a shop.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts longer than most of the perfumes I have recently used.</li>
            <li> never fails that when I have this on, I get compliments.</li>
            <li> I like the pretty box</li>
            <li> but the product shipped during a hot week.</li>
            <li> My wife fell in love with this scent several years ago but was running out.</li>
            <li> its soo much cheaper!</li>
            <li> and I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> However, the first scent that came out of the bottle was an overpowering alcohol aroma.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> and I was horrified when my first friend sprayed it on.  </li>
            <li> This perfume is not expensive, and you get a lot for the price.  </li>
            <li> I put it on and felt pretty.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very happy!</li>
            <li> For me it was worth it and its a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very different from most mainstream perfumes.</li>
            <li> Department stores carry this perfume for a much higher price.</li>
            <li> Love to wear it when I don&#x27;t want something strong or heavy.</li>
            <li> a sweet but mature smell got tons of compliments !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells Great and Subtle Sweet&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a young 20 something who is along the transition into being more of an adult.</li>
            <li> This scent is so delicate and lovely, but also quite distinctive - I have never gotten more compliments on a scent I was wearing.</li>
            <li> Oh and I compared the packaging from amazon and my bottle from the dept store, they were both completely the same, really glad to know that it was not a fake!</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells like vanilla, berries and flowers, and is sweet, very feminine and classy!  </li>
            <li> Amazing smell that is classy, not too young (flowery) and not too old (musk).</li>
            <li> I was worried it might not be the true Hanae Mori or that it would be old.  </li>
            <li> Not too cloyingly sweet, yet not too &#x27;old person&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft, sweet smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is exquisite--it&#x27;s light, sweet, and slightly powdery and smells fresh as a breeze blowing through a flower</li>
            <li> buy from other website with more reputable names such as fragancenet.com or sephora..</li>
            <li> It is not too strong but there is enough to it that you can smell it.</li>
            <li> Reeks of pure alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle</li>
            <li> My wife fell in love with this perfume as we  were shopping around the mall, since her birthday was coming up shortly, I knew something she loved a lot, so as soon as I got home checked about 10 sites for price, and I found it at Amazon , a bigger bottle for 40 % less, so I ordered it ,</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing this perfume and have received various compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> Not so, it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li> you put too much on it</li>
            <li> Also, perhaps I received a knock-off, and not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I got it for my wife and she loves it, I&#x27;m very please with it and the time it was deliver.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing since the scent is so beautiful!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very feminine and powdery.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast also</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I am really finicky when it comes to fragrances and haven&#x27;t bought any for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use it very often because it cost so much.  </li>
            <li> Shipping speed was fast</li>
            <li> I wear it on special days and on days that I want to feel special so in other words-</li>
            <li> Wow... The reviews for this perfume were right on the money.</li>
            <li> It was light, floral, and subtle, unlike many perfumes I&#x27;ve sampled in department stores.</li>
            <li> It keeps its original fragrance, and is only \\&quot;one\\&quot; of a couple of perfumes on the market today that is \\&quot;engineered\\&quot; to do this.  </li>
            <li> I adore the smell of this perfume and many other as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I love two other Hanae Mori scents - Couture and Mystical Moon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle enough to not overpower you yet pretty unforgettable once you smell it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong scent and lasts a long time but no one in my family thinks it smells good, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Moreover, given the reviews, many of which describe a light fragrance, it is heavier than anticipated when initially applied and irritates my sinuses with its harsh undertone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful nostalgic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the price (less than half of what Penney&#x27;s priced it at), the checkout was simple, and the delivery very speedy.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrance - you must try this!  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and very distinct has</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular Hanai fragrance nearly 3 years ago &amp; have been buying it ever since!!</li>
            <li> They did offer 1 month free extension on Prime Membership (which I thoroughly enjoy) but am a tad let down that an item I ordered over the weekend arrived today when an item I ordered LAST WEEK is just now being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Sweet and fresh and to me a slight sent of powder.</li>
            <li> I wanted the fragrance , once I smelled the scent in a high priced store, and Amazon got it to me</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and subtle, and like another reviewer wrote, you can wear a lot of it and it still won&#x27;t be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the staying power isn&#x27;t that great, though.</li>
            <li> It is feminine, romantic, young and sweet.</li>
            <li> She loves Hanae Mori and its normally priced at $90.</li>
            <li> I get multiple compliments on the scent and the price is right.</li>
            <li> The sandal wood smell is rare, although very different from real sandal wood (which might be strange for perfume but I like it very much).</li>
            <li> Smoky sweet smell for the discerning nose...not a common scent but something familiar about it that is comforting.</li>
            <li> new-</li>
            <li> My new fav scent.</li>
            <li> Live this perfume.  </li>
            <li> It is a very soft scent.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original, scent doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> It has a soft  fragrance!</li>
            <li> of my favorites by far!</li>
            <li> Above statement is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Mori\\&quot; for several years and find that the shelf - retail price can be pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> The size is compliant with airline rules, and you can keep trying new scents before spending the bigger money to buy a whole bottle of a perfume.</li>
            <li> She marveled at how large the bottle was, especially when I told her the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I am stuck with a perfume that is way too brown in color and smells like pure alcohol, doesn&#x27;t last like it</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent that is hard to describe but the moment I smelled it I instantly thought it smelled &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Young or old spray and wait for the complements</li>
            <li> There are the fragrance kiosks which sell it, but I think the price is still killer on Amazon, no annoying mall hustlers, gas to waste and time.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and discovered this perfume years ago.  </li>
            <li> When I first spay this perfume I actually do not love the initial smell, but when it settles into the skin, it smells fantastic without having that \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; sent.  </li>
            <li> But then I completely forgot about it and was quite surprised when he gave me it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have to go to a regular department store to now get the real stuff</li>
            <li> When the perfume arrived was surprised by the size.</li>
            <li> The only downside is I don&#x27;t fee like it has real staying power.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased it at a local department store for twice as much.  </li>
            <li> Product  arrived early, was packaged well as not to break.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying Butterfly by Hanae Mori over the last few years.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was looking for a new perfume and decided to buy the Hanae Mori one.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and was very surprised it was the larger size.</li>
            <li> Apparently I had pointed it out to him in a magazine saying the description sounded like something I would like.</li>
            <li> Some people&#x27;s natural chemistry just reacts differently with scents then others.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing not an imitation.</li>
            <li> Its not full of all the synthetic oils, its pure.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure how sandalwood and patchouli create such a mesmerizing scent</li>
            <li> Also has such a gentle &amp; appealing get smell that you don&#x27;t have to worry you are offending or making anyone sick if you spray extra.</li>
            <li> First because you run the high risk of it being fake and second of all you CAN NOT return it.</li>
            <li> The smell last all day long</li>
            <li> i just spray it on my decor pellows in my bedroom and even that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> My gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but every time I spray it on myself or pillow before sleeping, the effect is just wondrous.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks a little different, especially the lid feels lighter and the white parts on glass look whiter, not just frosted.</li>
            <li> I would love this as a home fragrance spray, especially in late Fall and through to the holidays.</li>
            <li> This is a soft fragrance for everyday, with a vanilla association even though it has no vanilla in it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
            <li> This lasts on me for so long</li>
            <li> The only other scent I wear is Chanel Mademoiselle which doesn&#x27;t even warrant the amount of compliments I receive.</li>
            <li> This is her second since someone stole her other bottle.</li>
            <li> Other retail places double the price for half of the amount.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve purchased this for every woman I&#x27;ve ever spent extended time with.</li>
            <li> This has a heavy alcohol smell and is definitely not what I have at home.  </li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering, but soft and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I think the perfume must have lifted out of it, maybe due to heat?</li>
            <li> The smells stays with me all day and doesn&#x27;t wear off like other perfumes do.  </li>
            <li> I see other people have noted that they can&#x27;t return the stuff.  </li>
            <li> I realize a lot of people are rating this product negatively, due to the smell.</li>
            <li> To me the scent is fairly typical - just like any average drug store perfume.</li>
            <li> And the price is half of what a perfume store at the mall was selling it for.</li>
            <li> No wonder it was less than half the price...</li>
            <li> Anyway this perfume is actually very expensive in the stores, I purchased 2 of the larger bottles through Amazon for the same price that I bought the small bottle in a major dept store.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with Amazon for the first time in a long time.  </li>
            <li> You can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Packed w plastic-sealed-but missing packing materials on inside of box.</li>
            <li> It was too much trouble for me to go to the post office and return</li>
            <li> It was one of the few scents that I did not allergically respond to</li>
            <li> but it was not available.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the alcohol/&amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; scent wore off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is some kind of horrible knock-off.  </li>
            <li> So, I have wasted $93.  </li>
            <li> Thank you, needed it after mine ran out after a few years.</li>
            <li> I ordered on Amazon and it came within a few days.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours, I don&#x27;t notice the smell at all.  </li>
            <li> My friend wore this scent a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> There is barely a trace of fragrance over a very unappealing heavy alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> I received this and scent was very weak actually couldn&#x27;t smell it at all  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product at 50% less than department store prices and approximately 35% less than discount store prices.</li>
            <li> only the tracking was all wrong...</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe they changed the scent these past couple of years...</li>
            <li> it makes me want to puke and on top of that it gives me a terrible headache.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering like some other perfumes I have bought in the past!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately perfume&#x27;s a difficult thing to describe and review, but I highly recommend this scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too strong and disgusting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s orange and has a strong alcohol smell, very disappointing!!!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a common product defect for Hanae Mori bottles.</li>
            <li> this perfume scent sucks.</li>
            <li> Or at least try it in stores before you buy it.</li>
            <li> However, for both product that part were broken after a few use.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed and wanted to return it but due to hazard issues, perfume is non-returnable.</li>
            <li> not authentic!  </li>
            <li> I mean seriously, I&#x27;m overjoyed!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle fragrance</li>
            <li> It did cross my mind to return it because I thought maybe it was a bad batch ???</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed cuz the scent is not the same .</li>
            <li> but the bottle is poorly made.</li>
            <li> I have gone through two bottles of real, this is FAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> It came broken</li>
            <li> And when I opened it it looks like it&#x27;s broken before shipping</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like it was supposed to, and dried down to a horrible waxy smell, like an unscented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s irritating that Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Hanae mori is an expensive fragrance you can&#x27;t find in department stores!</li>
            <li> I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> In any event, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I also learned that a lot of perfumes made in america are made with a corn base or wheat base which can cause headaches but this is from a rice base which is hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li> Horrible....</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not really sure how sandalwood and patchouli create such a mesmerizing scent, I&#x27;ve purchased this for every woman I&#x27;ve ever spent extended time with. Now this was for my daughter, hoping she will begin the same with another man</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy from this seller!</li>
            <li> i love it.  the scent is light.  The box colors either red or blue are not different scents.  It is all the same scent.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Great price and quality! Will order again when she runs out.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is to die for. I get so many compliments when I wear it. My husbands loves it too</li>
            <li> Nice smell and fast shipping</li>
            <li> My favorite and great price!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great customer service from Amazon. I love this perfume. The smell last all day long and I must say it&#x27;s one of a kind. Ladies this is a must buy; it won&#x27;t go un noticed.</li>
            <li> Affordable and the smell is just like in stores!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.   It is one of her favorite parfumes.  Good Value for item.</li>
            <li> I received this and scent was very weak actually couldn&#x27;t smell it at all  but I am rating them a 5 for there awesome customer service outstanding they truly know how to provide customer service and I won&#x27;t hesitate to try it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy Hanae Mori&#x27;s perfume for awhile and I am not disappointed with my purchase! I am in love with the smell of this, and it lingers on the clothes to a minimum that throughout the day I can still smell it. And it matters for a perfume to not smell so overwhelming. So I recommend this if you want a light feminine scent :). My husband loves it xD.</li>
            <li> I just love Hanae Mori Butterfly Eau de Toillette by Hanae Mori for Women.  I ordered the 3.4 ounce because this is a fragrance I love to wear every day!  It is definitely a more sophisticated fragrance.  The fragrance smells like vanilla, berries and flowers, and is sweet, very feminine and classy!  It has a very distinct and assertive quality.  If you are looking for a new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrance - you must try this!  Also, the fragrance will not change \\&quot;chemistry\\&quot; after it is worn all day.  It keeps its original fragrance, and is only \\&quot;one\\&quot; of a couple of perfumes on the market today that is \\&quot;engineered\\&quot; to do this.  I hope I am saying this correctly, but I believe they call it a \\&quot;linear\\&quot; perfume.  I highly recommend this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume came to me via my daughter.  I could barley smell it but friends would ask me WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?&lt;br /&gt;I knew right then and there that was the one for me. The vanilla scent, so soft, so lovely was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. My husband liked the smell too.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite perfume. Good price on Amazon. Smells sweet &amp; I always get compliments!</li>
            <li> Love this scent...a hint of lychee.</li>
            <li> this is not the real thing the smell last for just a bit of time and can say it smells good but the bottle is poorly made. i don&#x27;t even wear it now i just spray it on my decor pellows in my bedroom and even that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Got for a gift. She loved it. Smells sexy</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this, everyone stops me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing. I have been wearing this close to a decade and I have to say it&#x27;s held up. It just smells yummy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent.  My wife loves it, and so do I.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS PERFUME AND WON&#x27;T WEAR ANYTHING ELSE.  I love it too, and if I didn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;d be &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; her unique scent, I&#x27;d order it for myself.  Maybe I will anyway!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I adore the smell of this perfume and many other as well.  Young or old spray and wait for the complements</li>
            <li> Its my daughters favorite.  It was her xmas present that came days after xmas</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance several years ago and loved it. It is a fresh light fragrance; not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume. Light scent. I bought a refillable perfume dispenser from Perfumania ($10), and fill it from this bottle to take on my many business trips. By the way, the refillable dispenser is a great way to try new scents. I own 4. Perfumania (400 locations in the US) will refill them for $10 from any of the perfumes they sell. That is how I first became aware of Hanae Mori. The size is compliant with airline rules, and you can keep trying new scents before spending the bigger money to buy a whole bottle of a perfume.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price!!  You cannot buy this product in the store for what I paid.  I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for over 10 years and love it!</li>
            <li> I like Hanae Mori smell and 2nd time I am buying it. The first one I bought it from a shop. Second time I bought it from Amazon. Same thing happen for both product. At the top of the bottle there is a part that provide valve place on the bottle easily. However, for both product that part were broken after a few use. Now the bottle&#x27;s top/valve is not working.so the perfume has a connection with air. I think this is a common product defect for Hanae Mori bottles.</li>
            <li> One I wear on special occasions. You can wear everyday. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume. Lovely. My favorite. Great price. Excellent price!!!</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume and speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  Not overpowering.  Just wonderful.  And the price is half of what a perfume store at the mall was selling it for.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Sephora and just had to have a bigger bottle. The fragrance is exquisite--it&#x27;s light, sweet, and slightly powdery and smells fresh as a breeze blowing through a flower field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is among my top 5 favorite perfumes because it maintains so much nuance on drydown.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  think is authentic.  The aroma goes a way in an hour</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original, scent doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Great deal for price &amp; quantity. Also has such a gentle &amp; appealing get smell that you don&#x27;t have to worry you are offending or making anyone sick if you spray extra.</li>
            <li> Its OK.. I feel it must have been sitting on a shelf for a while because scent wears off very easily.. Hmmm .. been wearing scent for over 10 years and never had this issue. Will purchase from Nordstrom&#x27;s on next purchase.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BUT IT DOES NOT SMELL THE SAME AS WHAT A PURCHASED AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Mother&#x27;s day gift, I usually buy the men&#x27;s version because it is more popular...but this scent is much more sweet and intoxicating. Got here on time and made my mom incredibly happy.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Hanae Mori Butterfly.  It has a light sweet scent with a hint of musk.  It is not overpowering, but soft and subtle.  I enjoy wearing this perfume and have received various compliments on it.  The scent lasts longer than most of the perfumes I have recently used.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I&#x27;ve worn it for years.  I get compliments everytime I wear it.  Loved finding it at this great price, it&#x27;s almost half what I pay for it at the department store.  I was worried it might not be the true Hanae Mori or that it would be old.  Not so, it&#x27;s the real deal and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> After searching for this at the mall (Penney&#x27;s, I believe) for a shade over $90, we decided to check online.  Very impressed with the price (less than half of what Penney&#x27;s priced it at), the checkout was simple, and the delivery very speedy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance. My wife brought a tester from a friend, and I love the smell of it on her.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance. The scent last all day.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this wonderful perfume years ago, and had always told people it was my favorite, yet for some reason I never purchased a full size bottle. Finally I was letting one of my friends smell the tiny remaining drops and decided that is was time I just go ahead and order it. So I did. When it arrived, I was scared it might not smell like the amazing scent I remembered it to be. Soon as I sprayed it, I fell in love all over again. WONDERFUL SCENT!</li>
            <li> This is a soft fragrance for everyday, with a vanilla association even though it has no vanilla in it.  I fell in love with this from another vendor, but was satisfied with the product I received through Amazon Market as well, which is to be remarked upon, as that is not always so.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell that is classy, not too young (flowery) and not too old (musk). Am almost out and would buy again.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this fragrance</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times and the price here is the best with fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;It never fails that when I have this on, I get compliments. It&#x27;s not over powering and you probably won&#x27;t even smell it on yourself which is great for me.. I suffer from migraines and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of so many perfumes but this has never given me a headache!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Product arrived well-packaged and on-time. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Every thing with the order went perfect. .. we love the product and will definitely be interested in reordering again</li>
            <li> I love Hanae Mori.  It has a soft  fragrance! My husband likes the fragrance and gives it to me for my birthday!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Hanae Mori perfume!!  After borrowing my daughters perfume on our last visit there, I knew I needed to have my own!!  Love the &#x27;light&#x27; flowery scent!!  Not overpowering like some other perfumes I have bought in the past!!</li>
            <li> Love it and great price</li>
            <li> i have always loved this fragrance. it&#x27;s clean and fresh. this is always a winner. i would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Nice.  Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. It&#x27;s by far my favorite perfume. It was also super quick to arrive.</li>
            <li> Its amazing,,,, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Lady&#x27;s you have to try it.&lt;br /&gt;My girls were so enthusiasm with the smell of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fav of mine. The price is great and the scent is light, feminine and a tad sweet. I love it</li>
            <li> I got a bad bottle. It didn&#x27;t smell like it was supposed to, and dried down to a horrible waxy smell, like an unscented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s irritating that Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells Great and Subtle Sweet&lt;br /&gt;Makes you smell amazing&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive&lt;br /&gt;Overly Priced&lt;br /&gt;If you put too much on it&#x27;ll be over powering</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! And I always get compliments on how great it smells.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, very classic and pleasant!!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is difficult to find. I love the light floral scent!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews that said what a lovely, unique smell this had, therefore maybe my expectations were too high. Also, perhaps I received a knock-off, and not the real thing. In any event, I am disappointed. To me the scent is fairly typical - just like any average drug store perfume. In fact, it reminds me of a perfume I had as a teenager, called Sand and Sable. Moreover, given the reviews, many of which describe a light fragrance, it is heavier than anticipated when initially applied and irritates my sinuses with its harsh undertone. But then it also appears to wear off quickly. I like the pretty box - it reminds me of a water colour painting - but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe I found this on Amazon! Used to wear this years ago. It&#x27;s a lovely warm scent and just as I remembered.</li>
            <li> I love the distinct sandal wood in the perfume, great for the spring season.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is light and kind of powdery.  It smells great and is appropriate for day or evening, and for any age.  I bought it as a birthday gift for my 59 year-old mother and she loved it!  She receives compliments on it every time she wears it.  She also wears Angel, and She by Emporio Armani.  I recommend this fragrance to anyone looking for a unique scent.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with Amazon for the first time in a long time.  Ordered on April 7th 2014, received tracking confirmation it would deliver by 4/14/2014 only the tracking was all wrong...&lt;br /&gt;On April 13th, 2014 Amazon Marketplace made a replacement order for me and now I have to wait another 4 days as the perfume is considered a hazardous material and cannot be shipped 2-Day.  They did offer 1 month free extension on Prime Membership (which I thoroughly enjoy) but am a tad let down that an item I ordered over the weekend arrived today when an item I ordered LAST WEEK is just now being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume smells amazing by the way.  Tested it at a local Sephora where it was sold for $65.00.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance for me.  I have used it for years and have never found anything that smells as good on me.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my second girlfriend an she loves the smell. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s her body chemistry but this perfume smells amazing on her</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for over a decade and love it still.&lt;br /&gt;I always receive compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have gone through two bottles of real, this is FAKE!!!! Avoid! The bottle even looks different. Packed w plastic-sealed-but missing packing materials on inside of box. The bottle looks a little different, especially the lid feels lighter and the white parts on glass look whiter, not just frosted. Looks cheaper. Label on bottom not centered, or even close to centered.detIls give replicas away if you pay attention Smells more like alcohol than the real one. I&#x27;ve bought perfume at a discount before which has been authentic. This one is NOT.</li>
            <li> I just love the way this smells on my wife. It&#x27;s unique but extremely pleasant. It&#x27;s worth twice the price</li>
            <li> Love love this scent!!! So glad I found it again! Product arrived fast and packaged securely! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It came broken And when I opened it it looks like it&#x27;s broken before shipping</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I was so excited to find it online for a better price. Definitely would recommend to friends</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance if you&#x27;re looking for something that wears off nicely. It isn&#x27;t too over powering and has a nice scent when it wears off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular Hanai fragrance nearly 3 years ago &amp; have been buying it ever since!!</li>
            <li> Perfect packaging same potency as dept stores.  Beautiful nostalgic fragrance. Smoky sweet smell for the discerning nose...not a common scent but something familiar about it that is comforting.</li>
            <li> This is the best unheard of ever ! Lasts a long time and very distinct has a sweet but mature smell got tons of compliments !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant very oncommon smell, best for everyday use. Lasting power is satisfactory, and it&#x27;s not overpowering. worth the price</li>
            <li> one of the best fragrances on my gf, I love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for 10 plus years . I was a bit disappointed cuz the scent is not the same . It&#x27;s very light where you can&#x27;t smell lt. The color of the perfume was very light also compared to my bottle that I still had a bit left in.  It did cross my mind to return it because I thought maybe it was a bad batch ??? It was too much trouble for me to go to the post office and return so I kept it.</li>
            <li> I love this and I bought for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, too.  She was happy.</li>
            <li> You  will  love  this  perfume  its  very  light  and  smells  wonderful.</li>
            <li> Scent does not last long. Price is good though.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents and can&#x27;t beat the price! Very happy!! I would order this again.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent. It is very light, but it doesn&#x27;t fade away quickly . I wear it daily and I  regularly receive compliments. I work as a nurse and this is pleasant throughout my shift without being intrusive or offensive to those with fragrance sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Hanae Mori perfume!</li>
            <li> The perfume was delivered very quickly and in good state. The packaging is ok and the smell is very nice and durable. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Wow... The reviews for this perfume were right on the money. The perfume smells so nice and lasts all day. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about this perfume even at the end of work.</li>
            <li> Good price for my favorite perfume</li>
            <li> Amazon is amazing... I wanted the fragrance , once I smelled the scent in a high priced store, and Amazon got it to me so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the excellent service.  I wear the cologne every day and find it light and so delightfully delicious!</li>
            <li> Great product, price is very reasonable. Other retail places double the price for half of the amount. This is the real thing not an imitation.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for 5 years, I know what it smells like, love it. This was delivered in the evening and we were home but the product shipped during a hot week. Reeks of pure alcohol.  I need to throw it away, no returns allowed. I think the perfume must have lifted out of it, maybe due to heat? There is barely a trace of fragrance over a very unappealing heavy alcohol smell. No returns allowed which I did not know. Essentially throwing $45 in the trash. Last time I purchase perfume on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love that it smells like vanilla. I get a lot of compliments on this fragrance every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing this fragrance for years and it seems to smell the same on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites by far! Men love it to!</li>
            <li> love the price and the scent</li>
            <li> I got it for my wife and she loves it, I&#x27;m very please with it and the time it was deliver. thank you</li>
            <li> My wife fell in love with this scent several years ago but was running out. It was one of the few scents that I did not allergically respond to so I was determined to locate it. And God bless Amazon...there it was.</li>
            <li> Love, and great price.</li>
            <li> Love it....its soo much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Above statement is exactly what I wanted. Product was what I ordered and came in good shape with absolutely no breakage.</li>
            <li> Super authentic!!! No shadeness here! I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of \\&quot;Hanae Mori\\&quot; for several years and find that the shelf - retail price can be pretty pricey. The price I paid for \\&quot;my signture scent\\&quot; was a total deal! I mean seriously, I&#x27;m overjoyed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will forevermore continue to purchase Hanae Mori from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done!</li>
            <li> Mild scent and very light ....I&#x27; m happy to get this and i will buy for the next bottle!  Try it</li>
            <li> This scent is by far, the most unique and signature! I&#x27;m a nurse and can wear this to the hospital as to not come off as wearing a fragrant scent. This is perfect if you want to smell clean, light, yet carry a signature like no one else. IT doesn&#x27;t matter what day it is, if I&#x27;m in public, someone remarks how great I smell. The only other scent I wear is Chanel Mademoiselle which doesn&#x27;t even warrant the amount of compliments I receive. I LOVE THIS SCENT! If you like vanilla, light floral type scents, this is perfect for you. Go to your local department store and sample it. There are the fragrance kiosks which sell it, but I think the price is still killer on Amazon, no annoying mall hustlers, gas to waste and time.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Use it every night after my shower. It is a very soft scent.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is absolutely amazing!!!  I wanted a great smelling perfume for my wedding day and this one is the best!!!  The smells stays with me all day and doesn&#x27;t wear off like other perfumes do.  Amazon shipped it immediately and I received it extremely quick (3 days after I ordered it!)  Amazon also offers the best price and needless to say, I am completely happy with my purchase of this wonderful smelling perfume and with amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go, people say, &amp;#34;You smell great!&amp;#34;  I also bought the men&#x27;s cologne for my husband.  He has the same response.  He said that no one has ever commented on his cologne.  That I was I continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Nice floral scent , light and refreshing</li>
            <li> I am a young 20 something who is along the transition into being more of an adult. I had always preferred the more fruity smelling perfume but felt it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; enough. So I set out to find me a more sophisticated perfume that I enjoyed but also felt was appropriate for my age. A lot of perfumes I didn&#x27;t like as the smell was way too strong or was not feminine smelling to me. This one was perfect however! It has a nice scent that is hard to describe but the moment I smelled it I instantly thought it smelled &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;. It is not too strong but there is enough to it that you can smell it. I absolutely adore it and think it is perfect for someone of any age.</li>
            <li> I have always used eau de toilette Hanae Mori  Its all I use</li>
            <li> The best. The cost on Amazon beats the retail stores by miles, and it&#x27;s the same product. I will repeat my order, and would recommend it to my girl friends. K. Anselmo</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. Not too cloyingly sweet, yet not too &#x27;old person&#x27; smell. It&#x27;s subtle enough to not overpower you yet pretty unforgettable once you smell it. My gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but every time I spray it on myself or pillow before sleeping, the effect is just wondrous.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of a room fragrance plug-in, like the Kitchen or Caramel or Sugar Cookie scents from Bath &amp; Body Work or Yankee Candle, but more layered &amp; sophisticated. I would love this as a home fragrance spray, especially in late Fall and through to the holidays. But for me personally, I can&#x27;t stand it as a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I love two other Hanae Mori scents - Couture and Mystical Moon.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for my favorite perfume!  Can now wear it whenever I want...rather than for special occasions!</li>
            <li> Smells incredible and much cheaper than at Macy&#x27;s.  Very happy with this purchase. Will buy again and so happy with the price.</li>
            <li> Love the scent but it does not seem to stay. Was hoping to get the parfum but it was not available.</li>
            <li> Scent was not as strong or nice compared to buying it full price at Bloomingdales. A bit disappointing since the scent is so beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Hanae Mori smells great and I&#x27;m regularly wearing it. It is feminine, romantic, young and sweet. The sandal wood smell is rare, although very different from real sandal wood (which might be strange for perfume but I like it very much).</li>
            <li> I sprayed a bit of this perfume in the Charles de Gaulle airport (Paris) a year or two ago and I instantly fell in love. It was light, floral, and subtle, unlike many perfumes I&#x27;ve sampled in department stores. Recently, I was looking for a new perfume and decided to buy the Hanae Mori one. When it arrived, I was excited and had high expectations. However, the first scent that came out of the bottle was an overpowering alcohol aroma. Thankfully, the alcohol/&amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; scent wore off after a few hours. I was not impressed and wanted to return it but due to hazard issues, perfume is non-returnable. Amazon&#x27;s customer service was wonderful and took care of my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall point: this perfume scent sucks. Or at least try it in stores before you buy it. Who knows, maybe they changed the scent these past couple of years...</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!  Fast shipping!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I first found this fragrance in Tahiti and loved the smell, up to that point I was solely a Chanel No 5 user.  I now alternate the fragrances, depending on my mood.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mom on Christmas, and ended up buying it for myself shortly after. This scent is so delicate and lovely, but also quite distinctive - I have never gotten more compliments on a scent I was wearing. The floral scents dominate but it&#x27;s almost spicy in a way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noted that this scent was in a lot of reviewer&#x27;s top 10 lists for 2013. I&#x27;m not surprised. Great for gifting if you are unsure what your giftee likes.</li>
            <li> I always get perfume and never use it because it causes headaches, but I found this perfume at Nordstrom and fell inlove.  Its not full of all the synthetic oils, its pure.  I also learned that a lot of perfumes made in america are made with a corn base or wheat base which can cause headaches but this is from a rice base which is hypoallergenic.  The lady at Nordstrom was right...it WILL NOT cause headaches.  I love how light and fresh it smells.  Its beautiful.</li>
            <li> Not my first purchase of this perfume, love, love, love it.  I get multiple compliments on the scent and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints.  I am 27 years old and discovered this perfume years ago.  It is my sent.  When I first spay this perfume I actually do not love the initial smell, but when it settles into the skin, it smells fantastic without having that \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; sent.  I always get compliments on how good I smell when I wear this.  Plus this product shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Favorite. Perfume great price</li>
            <li> My favorite at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li> Great price!!! I purchased this product at 50% less than department store prices and approximately 35% less than discount store prices.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing Honae mori for years! Love the smell, and it lasts for hours, unlike some that you put it on and can&#x27;t even smell it right after you put it on.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it and so did I.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got me this for my birthday. Apparently I had pointed it out to him in a magazine saying the description sounded like something I would like. But then I completely forgot about it and was quite surprised when he gave me it as a gift. Good thing HE remembered because I love it! It&#x27;s super soft and subtle, and like another reviewer wrote, you can wear a lot of it and it still won&#x27;t be overwhelming. It reminds me more of a body oil than a perfume, except that it lasts for hours. Great value, and great smell. It&#x27;s very feminine and powdery. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This scent is so vanilla and musk it makes me want to puke and on top of that it gives me a terrible headache.  Tried to let my daughter wear it but even on someone else it&#x27;s too strong and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, affordable every day scent, I love it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a special occasion, but for daily wear, it&#x27;s great. I get a lot of compliments.  I had no problem with the seller, I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> not authentic!  it does not smell or last throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;i compared with one purchase from department store and it&#x27;s definitely different in terms of smell and longevitity when worn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the big one.  My wife loves it and was very surprised it was the larger size.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 bottles of this stuff.  This is not the Hanae Mori that I have.  I have already given 2 of the bottles as gifts and I was horrified when my first friend sprayed it on.  This has a heavy alcohol smell and is definitely not what I have at home.  This is some kind of horrible knock-off.  I have another bottle left that I was going to give to my hairdresser at Christmas.  Well...that ain&#x27;t happening.  So, I have wasted $93.  I see other people have noted that they can&#x27;t return the stuff.  I have to go to a regular department store to now get the real stuff as I just can&#x27;t let my friends think that this is what Hanae Mori smells like. Horrible....don&#x27;t buy this junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a truly remarkable fragrance unlike any other.  I wear it on special days and on days that I want to feel special so in other words- I wear it all the time! :)</li>
            <li> Brought this for my girl and she loved it. It&#x27;s the best smell a woman could have! Shipped fast also</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing.  Love to wear it when I don&#x27;t want something strong or heavy.</li>
            <li> Hanae Mori smells soooo good.  It is a very light smell and lasts all day.  Every time that I wear this perfume, I always get a lot of compliments.  This perfume is not expensive, and you get a lot for the price.  I would recommend this to anyone who does not like strong smelling perfumes.  This one is perfect.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent on me, thank you</li>
            <li> My daughter was overjoyed to receive this product. She marveled at how large the bottle was, especially when I told her the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance, but not on me.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it to my daughter and she liked it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try something new- guess I&#x27;ll stick to Oscar!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  A friend had given her a sample of it and she liked it.  She was very very pleased with the surprise and when we go out she smells great!</li>
            <li> i love love love this fragrance. stays on for the whole day, it&#x27;s very sexy and fruity. its just great</li>
            <li> What a great price for this luscious cologne with sandalwood in it. I wish there were creams and powders! I also wish I&#x27;d found this fragrance years ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so in love with my Hanae Mori</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li> My new fav scent. Delicious and changes from floral to a gourmand light vanilla. It brightens my mood when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old so-cal girl and love this scent.  It&#x27;s slightly powdery smelling, but awesome :).  Also try flowerbomb and/or sunset heat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing HM for years now.  It is a wonderful perfume, lasts all day and I am always getting compliments about it.  I am often asked what perfume it is.  It is very feminine, and I&#x27;m glad it works with my skin.  I love HM.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!!! This lasts on me for so long and I get so many compliments! This is a scent I can&#x27;t go without!</li>
            <li> i love this scent. it smells like vanilla but isn&#x27;t super sweet, it&#x27;s like the perfect combo of sweet and floral... i love it, i have the largest size and it&#x27;s SO worth the price.. it used to be $90 a 3.4 bottle at sephora back in the day, but it&#x27;s just so good, i wear it often... so worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! The scent is exceptional. It&#x27;s soft, it lasts, it smells more like vanilla even though it&#x27;sandalwood. It&#x27;s great. It makes you feel sexy!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Hanae Mori but please don&#x27;t order perfumes from Amazon. First because you run the high risk of it being fake and second of all you CAN NOT return it. I am stuck with a perfume that is way too brown in color and smells like pure alcohol, doesn&#x27;t last like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy from other website with more reputable names such as fragancenet.com or sephora.. don&#x27;t mind paying the extra bucks for return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that Amazon is great for everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MB</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy this perfume, my husband loved it.</li>
            <li> Thank you! You guys did an awesome job!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fragrance that is light enough for the work place.  Very clean, not too spicy or floral.</li>
            <li> Soft but memorable scent- This was a great price for this product.</li>
            <li> My wife fell in love with this perfume as we  were shopping around the mall, since her birthday was coming up shortly, I knew something she loved a lot, so as soon as I got home checked about 10 sites for price, and I found it at Amazon , a bigger bottle for 40 % less, so I ordered it ,</li>
            <li> Scent fades rather quick</li>
            <li> When the perfume arrived was surprised by the size. There was more fl oz then I expected. Absolutely beautiful light fragrance. The shipping was fast. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years! Smells great.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! I always get compliments on it and asked what it is.</li>
            <li> This is not the true perfume. What I received in the mail is definitely a diluted version and I even went into a trusted store to try the actual bottle and it does not smell the same. I am extremely disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Hanae mori is an expensive fragrance you can&#x27;t find in department stores! So glad to have found it here. Rich, sweet smell for an awesome deal</li>
            <li> This is for sure a new fragrance that I hadn&#x27;t used . But it is really nice get lots of compliments when I wear it !!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this perfume from Sephora and instantly became hooked. It smells vanilla-y to me (though the description says that&#x27;s almond) and is on the sweeter side but not disgustingly so. Unfortunately perfume&#x27;s a difficult thing to describe and review, but I highly recommend this scent. One spray lasts almost all day for me. It was WAY cheaper on Amazon than at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. I bought this to use with the Hanae Mori Body Cream and the two together are delightful.</li>
            <li> I am glad this product was just as it was described. Macy&#x27;s wanted 100.00 for the same bottle. I am loving the price I paid and the packaging the perfume came in.</li>
            <li> Just awesome and great price!</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying Butterfly by Hanae Mori over the last few years. It&#x27;s a soft, sweet smell. I especially liked buying it through Amazon at such a discounted price!!</li>
            <li> My cousin gave me a sample of this perfume and I had to buy it the most wonderful one of the most loveliest sents I&#x27;ve ever smelled</li>
            <li> Definitely love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very special fragrance.  This seller delivered quickly and efficiently.  Great service and really yummy perfume.  If you have never tried it, you should.</li>
            <li> I was excited to give this to my mom or sister since it had such great reviews and was so cheap on Amazon... but no one likes it (mom is around 55 and sister is around 30). It&#x27;s a very strong scent and lasts a long time but no one in my family thinks it smells good, unfortunately. It&#x27;s a large bottle so I hope I can find someone who does like it but just plan to fumigate my brother&#x27;s car with it for fun as of now...</li>
            <li> The mom was happy I got her favorite perfume. I was Glad I checked on here before walking into a department store. :)</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume. my boyfriend loves the smell. this is also my cheaper here then in the department stores</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful for springtime going into summer.  And this price tag here is infinitely cheaper than Sephora, which sells this size for $90.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the price was awesome...I have paid more for it in the past and since I have amazon prime it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> ONE OF TWO OF MYBALL TIME FAVORITE PERFUMES.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely delicious! Sexy,&lt;br /&gt;Warm, everything a woman should embody! Would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the size. Will definitely purchase again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Wife absolutly loves this.  Now her favorite.</li>
            <li> I am really finicky when it comes to fragrances and haven&#x27;t bought any for over 10 years. Then someone gave me a sample of Hanae Mori. I loved it! I put it on and felt pretty. Since I started wearing Hanae Mori, I have gotten so many compliments from guys and girls alike and they are mesmerized. Best choice I could make. So Happy!</li>
            <li> Live this perfume.  vanilla and sweet.  I will use this often because I get many compliments  when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I realize a lot of people are rating this product negatively, due to the smell. I purchased this for my Mom, she&#x27;s worn this fragrance in the past, and its smells really great on her. Some people&#x27;s natural chemistry just reacts differently with scents then others. Anyway this perfume is actually very expensive in the stores, I purchased 2 of the larger bottles through Amazon for the same price that I bought the small bottle in a major dept store. It was at my home in 2 days and my Mom was thrilled. Needless to say, I was very happy! Oh and I compared the packaging from amazon and my bottle from the dept store, they were both completely the same, really glad to know that it was not a fake!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, and at the best price!  Thank you, needed it after mine ran out after a few years.</li>
            <li> I sampled this in a dept. store and when I got home, I knew I had to get it.  I ordered on Amazon and it came within a few days.  The smell is great - nothing to heavy or overpowering.  Its just how I imagine that perfume should smell.  The only downside is I don&#x27;t fee like it has real staying power.  After a few hours, I don&#x27;t notice the smell at all.  For me it was worth it and its a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, the product was exactly as described. Love this perfume. Price was good, better then the stores at least.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mild fragrance. Nice for winter, as it smells like a musk, vanilla combination, somewhat reminds me of bbw vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Sally Ragdoll perfume (before they changed the formula). I loved that fragrance so much and was sad when they changed the formula to something not that great. I read on the internet that the Ragdoll perfume is something of a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; of this Hanae Mori one, so I bought it with high hopes of nostalgia, and was not disappointed! Lovely scent, thank you!</li>
            <li> I was walking through a department store one day and this wonderful scent crossed my path. I asked the lady what she was wearing and she said &amp;#34;Hanae Mori&amp;#34;.  This is the best price I have ever found!</li>
            <li> Normally this is my favorite perfume however this one I received isn&#x27;t even the right color it&#x27;s orange and has a strong alcohol smell, very disappointing!!!!</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my mother and law and she liked it so i loved it. Great Birthday Gift.</li>
            <li> Great price!  I save so much more than when I purchase this exact item at a department store.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price compared to macy,etc.</li>
            <li> Great price.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Sent this as a gift for my mom. She loves this. This is her second since someone stole her other bottle.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my sister. She loves Hanae Mori and its normally priced at $90. In department stores. I saved a bundle! Defiantly would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I had purchased it at a local department store for twice as much.  I didn&#x27;t want to use it very often because it cost so much.  When I found it here on Amazon at such a great price, I was thrilled.  I now can use it daily and enjoy the scent I love.  It&#x27;s such a good price that I don&#x27;t have to worry about using it up.</li>
            <li> Love it! Sweet and fresh and to me a slight sent of powder.</li>
            <li> This is a unique, feminine scent with notes of powder, flowers, vanilla, and something else...maybe almonds? Whatever it is, the effect is great. It&#x27;s a subtle fragrance that&#x27;s very different from most mainstream perfumes. Sadly, the staying power isn&#x27;t that great, though.</li>
            <li> Love love this perfume my favorite</li>
            <li> What you see, is what you get! The products I received were exactly as what was advertised at a great price. Product  arrived early, was packaged well as not to break. I am very pleased with my order!</li>
            <li> Light and really yummy</li>
            <li> I love the sweet smell that lingers from this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Department stores carry this perfume for a much higher price. It is such a good buy on Amazon</li>
            <li> My friend wore this scent a few years ago.  We were shopping @ Sam&#x27;s Clu recently and she bought a bottle for $44.00.  I went home and looked it up on line and found it for $34.00 with free shipping...What a deal! it is a great everyday scent...just right...sweet but also seductive....</li>
            <li> The gift went over as good as one could expect. It arrived on time and well protected. Of course she picked it but I did the shopping.</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to many purfumes but his one has become my standby - I use it all the time - everyone tells me how good I smell - I love it so much I got my husband the men&#x27;s set of face balm and parfume</li>
            <li> This perfume did not smell anything like the same one I had purchased at the department store... No wonder it was less than half the price...&lt;br /&gt;Also, no returns on perfume because it is considered hazardous material....</li>
            <li> Great price for largest size. Authentic. Very happy with product. Favorite perfume. Shipping speed was fast</li>
