            <li> I expected it to be sheer and light...</li>
            <li> Read carefully before ordering---lesson learned!</li>
            <li> It is small enough so that I may carry it in my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> I ordered 8 small vials at $0.25 each for a total of $2.00.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint I have, of course, is that it&#x27;s too small and won&#x27;t last longer than a month.</li>
            <li> The product arrived partially used with no top!</li>
            <li> Really small size for the price...</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> So disgusting and disgusted with it!</li>

            <li> I thought it smelled nice on my wife. She liked it it. Like any perfume it&#x27;s personal preference. It&#x27;s a 4 only because it&#x27;s not in her top 5.</li>

            <li> I wanted to try this fragrance &amp; @ the 5 cent price was just right.  I find that Estee Lauder/Clinique perfumes stay/smell wonderful on my skin &amp; the scent lasts so much longer due to the high oil content in these fragrances.  No need to tick-dip w/ these brands!</li>
            <li> Like my comment above, I just love this scent</li>
            <li> I expected it to be sheer and light...it is soooo not</li>

            <li> It is small enough so that I may carry it in my pocketbook. Thanks for making this size for easy traveling also. I would recommend this to anyone that likes this fragrance. I love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 8 small vials at $0.25 each for a total of $2.00.  The seller charged me over $35.00 for shipping!!!  Canceled the order. Seller trying to get rich on shipping charges. The product itself may have been good but the shipping charges were extremely over-priced.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing...</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. It smells like a run of the mill fragrance that you would smell anywhere on anyone. Nothing unique about it.</li>
