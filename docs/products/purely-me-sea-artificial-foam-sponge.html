            <li>Nice sponge.  </li>
            <li>Does not fall apart and creates a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great service, THANK YOU !</li>
            <li>It is very absorbent which makes for a nice foamy lather, for a delightful shower or bathing experience.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size and lathers up well.  </li>
            <li>Your product was the best no least.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and great customer service.</li>
            <li>Great product and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be cheaper just to find a couch on the side of the road and cut out your own sponges :).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it - it falls apart very quickly!</li>
            <li>NICE LARGE TO MEDIUM SIZE, GREAT FOR THE BATH.</li>
            <li>so it has a very light scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used much better sea foam sponges.</li>
            <li>Wuite satisfied.</li>
            <li>This sponge is way better than anything I can get around my house.</li>
            <li>It holds more water before squeezing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SPONGE.</li>
            <li>Really love it.</li>
            <li>This is an ok sponge</li>
            <li>These seem to be more hygienic.</li>
            <li>For how much more it was than alternatives, I&#x27;d expect better.</li>
            <li>I love these sea foam sponges.</li>
            <li>I think that anyone looking for a good sponge is better off buying the cheaper ones at a walgreens from time to time instead of spending as much on a sponge like this.</li>
            <li>THE QUALITY, MOST IMPORTANT. .</li>
            <li>Not too soft or scratchy&#x3D; works great</li>
            <li>but it crumbled easily.</li>
            <li>it is nice and consistent though.</li>
            <li>It was about half the size of my pinky fingernail, and perfectly shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sponge works just fine</li>
            <li>This was exactly the sponge I wanted and in a size that fit nicely in my hand while showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft and good quality</li>
            <li>I was hoping more for a gentle scrub with a more textured surface and easily squeezable.</li>
            <li>Closest this sponge came to the sea was on a container ship from some ecological sewer in China.</li>
            <li>It came in a timely manner and was packaged securely.  </li>
            <li>They will make your body wash lather up wonderfully (and last longer, as you just don&#x27;t have to use much at all).</li>
            <li>It is a good sponge, not as soft as I prefer</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it is man made material.</li>
            <li>What really makes this nice is that when it dries it does not have a foul smell like many natural sponge products have.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;rope&amp;#34; they hang with is good quality as well, so these will last a while.</li>
            <li>I just wish my son didn&#x27;t love it so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge, I bought as an alternative to using a puff and glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>This sponge seems to be made of a &amp;#34;sponge alternative&amp;#34; that makes it tougher on the body than a true sponge.</li>
            <li>but, other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It also dries quickly</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This sponge feels nice, not rough on the skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and shipped on time!</li>
            <li>Also it is firm and gives a really great feel against the body as it feels like it cleans yet</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 10 month old and I am glad i did.</li>
            <li>I love it because it naturally exfoliates with use.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>The string was useful but after a couple months, the sponge started degrading where the string passes through the sponge.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect much more life out of a shower scrubby, and you should replace them that frequently anyway.</li>
            <li>Soft, comfortable, well-sized for the job and rinses cleanly.  </li>
            <li>almost right away</li>
            <li>Pretty new to lufas, this was way better than the Dove thing I tried first.  </li>
            <li>They lather well with good quality soap and has a slight exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li>So soft and quickly delivered!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t what I really wanted even the one i thought i was getting!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>love the way i can apply body wash one time and do not have to keep reapplying; as squeezing the sponge produces enough suds with one application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different sea sponges in the last year and this has been the best.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it holds up over time</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The good side is it feels like it will last longer than my natural one did due to it having a more uniform shape.</li>
            <li>If you really want a sponge that is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t lather a lot then this is for you.</li>
            <li>I will never buy Purely Me again.</li>
            <li>It works good and has a decent lather but doesn&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li>and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge</li>
            <li>Holds water really well too.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>; Soft Touch is frequently out of stock, but it feels almost as soft as &amp;#34;Purely Me&amp;#34; but is much, much more durable.</li>
            <li>This was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real thing, not some plastic substitution.</li>
            <li>I was looking for real shower sponge.  </li>
            <li>Really like this sponge.  </li>
            <li>but I will say I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I use natural sea sponges a lot and actually like this better.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the sponge, not too harsh.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that while it has nice strong and sturdy string for hanging the string is a bit short and it does not hang from all parts of the shower or bath to dry.  </li>
            <li>Just abrasive enough to feel like you&#x27;re getting really clean, but never irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>The string, I thought, at first, would be a bit of a nuisance, but actually has proven quite useful both for drying, and for wrapping around a finger to hold onto the sponge when you need both hands in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>It has a few small tears, but still functions perfectly.</li>
            <li>I used a lot of baby sea sponges, but they were going old very fast.</li>
            <li>Has remained as soft and sturdy as my first day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still like new!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sponge for any desired use.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a little more scratchy for the exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li>They are more fragile than rubber sponges and mesh shower balls, so they don&#x27;t last as long, but they are well worth what you pay for them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems to hold up pretty well -- unlike my previous, softer sponge which began to fall apart fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I was showering with this the first time and, while scrub-a-dub-dubbing, I heard a small &amp;#34;plink&amp;#34; sound.</li>
            <li>It is very soft, lathers well and rinses well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this sponge was in a local store.</li>
            <li>You can get better quality for less at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li>If other reviewers are saying the sponge is breaking quickly</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Too soft.</li>
            <li>This sponge is soft and absorbs/holds lots of soap.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like a natural sponge to me at all.</li>
            <li>Soft</li>
            <li>IT IS SOFT, AND HOLD THE BODY WASH LONGER PERECTLY.</li>
            <li>it is soft and not like cleaning with a brick as some sponges tend to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wish it was not so extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Soft too.</li>
            <li>Of course the sponge/luffa/washcloth you prefer is personal and, therefore, very subjective</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>It quickly develops tears near the center of the sponge, no matter how careful I am.</li>
            <li>but so far no indication that it shouldn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Replaced the old one, always buy the same</li>
            <li>The first day I got it, it split in half.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s flat and not bumpy like the natural sponges.</li>
            <li>They dry quickly, so I prefer these to the nylon loofahs that stay wet long after a shower.</li>
            <li>Except for being a little larger than I&#x27;d imagined, the bath sponge was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Most other sponges I&#x27;ve purchased fail to live up to their advertised size.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was looking for real shower sponge.  </li>
            <li> Really like this sponge.  </li>
            <li> but I will say I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I use natural sea sponges a lot and actually like this better.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the sponge, not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that while it has nice strong and sturdy string for hanging the string is a bit short and it does not hang from all parts of the shower or bath to dry.  </li>
            <li> Just abrasive enough to feel like you&#x27;re getting really clean, but never irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> The string, I thought, at first, would be a bit of a nuisance, but actually has proven quite useful both for drying, and for wrapping around a finger to hold onto the sponge when you need both hands in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> It has a few small tears, but still functions perfectly.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of baby sea sponges, but they were going old very fast.</li>
            <li> Has remained as soft and sturdy as my first day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still like new!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sponge for any desired use.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a little more scratchy for the exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li> They are more fragile than rubber sponges and mesh shower balls, so they don&#x27;t last as long, but they are well worth what you pay for them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to hold up pretty well -- unlike my previous, softer sponge which began to fall apart fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I was showering with this the first time and, while scrub-a-dub-dubbing, I heard a small &amp;#34;plink&amp;#34; sound.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, lathers well and rinses well.  </li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this sponge was in a local store.</li>
            <li> You can get better quality for less at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li> If other reviewers are saying the sponge is breaking quickly</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Too soft.</li>
            <li> This sponge is soft and absorbs/holds lots of soap.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like a natural sponge to me at all.</li>
            <li> Soft</li>
            <li> IT IS SOFT, AND HOLD THE BODY WASH LONGER PERECTLY.</li>
            <li> it is soft and not like cleaning with a brick as some sponges tend to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wish it was not so extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Soft too.</li>
            <li> Of course the sponge/luffa/washcloth you prefer is personal and, therefore, very subjective</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> It quickly develops tears near the center of the sponge, no matter how careful I am.</li>
            <li> but so far no indication that it shouldn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Replaced the old one, always buy the same</li>
            <li> The first day I got it, it split in half.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s flat and not bumpy like the natural sponges.</li>
            <li> They dry quickly, so I prefer these to the nylon loofahs that stay wet long after a shower.</li>
            <li> Except for being a little larger than I&#x27;d imagined, the bath sponge was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Most other sponges I&#x27;ve purchased fail to live up to their advertised size.  </li>
            <li> Remains soft both when wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The foam is soft and not scratchy, holds soap well and has not begun to break down yet.</li>
            <li> Stiff enough it&#x27;s a cleansing scrub; soft enough it&#x27;s not an abrasive attack!  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I wash it out with water after each use and leave it flat on my shower rack to air dry.</li>
            <li> This is not a natural sea sponge.</li>
            <li> Too dense and takes way too long to wring out.  </li>
            <li> I actually cut it like a bagel in half , like someone suggested here, and I am using one part only for now.</li>
            <li> This thing is tough to squeeze, especially because is is large.</li>
            <li> We regularly order these about every other month.</li>
            <li> It is basically a very firm foam with a soft surface.</li>
            <li> I usually shower once a day (occasionally twice a day) and I can only get ~3 months out of them before they start to fall apart.</li>
            <li> The next day it split in half again.</li>
            <li> , the last one started falling apart in less than 2 weeks, maybe I&#x27;m too rough for it, I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> Sponge is not too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> Way cleaner and easier to wring out than I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> bought this sponge because washcloths are forever slipping out of my grip.  </li>
            <li> Holds plenty of water and soap and does not feel rough against the skin.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Once I rinsed the shampoo out of my eyes, I looked down and found a tiny little spiral shell on the floor of the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other luffas that start to break apart</li>
            <li> It is a little rough</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> , some buyers seem to be confused that it is a natural sea sponge, it is not, it is synthetic.</li>
            <li> And once they stopped carrying them I had to hunt the brand down online.</li>
            <li> I even find that I require much less shower gel</li>
            <li> Torn apart with slight use.</li>
            <li> Within a week or two it was tearing in half from the string hole and eventually tore completely in half.</li>
            <li> Sponge is hard and rough.</li>
            <li> I shower everyday</li>
            <li> well and makes me feel like I might be scrubbing off some dead skin.</li>
            <li> Used everyday for 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the body wash I have been using is not drying to the skin so the sponge does not get dried out like it</li>
            <li> Sorry to take so long.</li>
            <li> I am cutting the string off and maybe cutting down the size because it&#x27;s almost too much for my small hands to hold.</li>
            <li> But seriously, if you don&#x27;t believe me, tear off a small piece and put a lighter to it, it will melt and you will see the nonflammable chemicals separate.</li>
            <li> 5 1/4 inches diameter by 2 inches thick</li>
            <li> I felt that the puffs were too plastic and artificial feeling and sometimes shower gel gets wasted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how they can claim something so patently false.</li>
            <li> These sea sponges tend to be expensive.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty new to lufas, this was way better than the Dove thing I tried first.  Way cleaner and easier to wring out than I expected</li>
            <li> Terrible. Do not waste your money. You can get better quality for less at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li> This is not a natural sea sponge. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> GREAT sponges. They will make your body wash lather up wonderfully (and last longer, as you just don&#x27;t have to use much at all). The &amp;#34;rope&amp;#34; they hang with is good quality as well, so these will last a while.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it - it falls apart very quickly!</li>
            <li> Too soft. Not exfoliating at all.  Too dense and takes way too long to wring out.  I&#x27;ve used much better sea foam sponges.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 10 month old and I am glad i did. I used a lot of baby sea sponges, but they were going old very fast. This product looks durable. I actually cut it like a bagel in half , like someone suggested here, and I am using one part only for now. So happy with it</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge but it doesn&#x27;t last very long, the last one started falling apart in less than 2 weeks, maybe I&#x27;m too rough for it, I&#x27;m a guy LOL. Plus I find it in the local supermarket for around 3 bucks.</li>
            <li> We regularly order these about every other month. It does begin to tear after about two-months of use. But for the price, it&#x27;s a great sponge. I am pretty sure it is man made material.</li>
            <li> I shower everyday and I&#x27;ve had this sponge for 6 months now and it&#x27;s still like new! It feels like someone sprinkled sugar on it so it has a very light scrub. Holds water really well too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how they can claim something so patently false. Closest this sponge came to the sea was on a container ship from some ecological sewer in China.</li>
            <li> fell apart after 5 uses</li>
            <li> Your product was the best no least. A refreshing shower was a good result! Thanks</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I really wanted even the one i thought i was getting!</li>
            <li> it came as advertised and is an excellent sponge. thank you so much. hugs  carl  GOD BLESS</li>
            <li> I have bought this sponge several times elsewhere. It quickly develops tears near the center of the sponge, no matter how careful I am. I found another sponge at Harris Teeter called &amp;#34;Soft Touch.&amp;#34; Soft Touch is frequently out of stock, but it feels almost as soft as &amp;#34;Purely Me&amp;#34; but is much, much more durable. I will never buy Purely Me again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Nice sponge.  Works will with my bath gel.  Does not fall apart and creates a nice lather.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> These sea sponges tend to be expensive.  This was reasonable. I love it because it naturally exfoliates with use.  I recommend this multi-purpose shower item.</li>
            <li> Lasted me about two months. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and shipped on time!</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge for my wife. She loves the sponge and asked me to order another one for a backup.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered processed perfectly on time. Wuite satisfied. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This sponge is way better than anything I can get around my house. This is the 3rd or 4th I&#x27;ve bought and will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge!  I use natural sea sponges a lot and actually like this better. It holds more water before squeezing. I ordered one for my Grandson&#x27;s bath too. Quick shipping and great customer service.</li>
            <li> This sponge is soft and absorbs/holds lots of soap.  I wish it was a little bit bigger but, other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it.  You will probably want to cut the rope off; I found it to be bothersome.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to use. Sponge is hard and rough.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> If you really want a sponge that is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t lather a lot then this is for you. It will not exfoliate your skin. It is basically a very firm foam with a soft surface. I was hoping more for a gentle scrub with a more textured surface and easily squeezable. This thing is tough to squeeze, especially because is is large. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a natural sponge to me at all.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son. Awesome sponge! It&#x27;s a real thing, not some plastic substitution. I just wish my son didn&#x27;t love it so much. Now I can&#x27;t buy one for myself for the fear of confusion.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Soft, comfortable, well-sized for the job and rinses cleanly.  It also dries quickly and I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this sponge.  The string, I thought, at first, would be a bit of a nuisance, but actually has proven quite useful both for drying, and for wrapping around a finger to hold onto the sponge when you need both hands in the bathtub.  Very happy with purchase and would buy another from this seller if needed.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and all intact.  The sponge lathers and rinses well!</li>
            <li> Thought it had a suction cup. Still good.</li>
            <li> Soft but it crumbled easily.</li>
            <li> Sorry to take so long. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the sponge, not too harsh.  The string was useful but after a couple months, the sponge started degrading where the string passes through the sponge.  It&#x27;s getting close to breaking apart.</li>
            <li> I was showering with this the first time and, while scrub-a-dub-dubbing, I heard a small &amp;#34;plink&amp;#34; sound. Once I rinsed the shampoo out of my eyes, I looked down and found a tiny little spiral shell on the floor of the shower. It was about half the size of my pinky fingernail, and perfectly shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a review of the actual sponge, it lathers well, scrubs well and makes me feel like I might be scrubbing off some dead skin. All the things I want in a bath sponge.</li>
            <li> love the way i can apply body wash one time and do not have to keep reapplying; as squeezing the sponge produces enough suds with one application.</li>
            <li> perfect! Love it! Fast shipping, great service, THANK YOU !</li>
            <li> good quality. It is a little rough</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SPONGE. IT IS SOFT, AND HOLD THE BODY WASH LONGER PERECTLY. IT SHOULD HAVE A LONGER STRING ATTACHED.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the same model I&#x27;d had for a couple of years or so. This is one of the best sponges I&#x27;ve found. Just abrasive enough to feel like you&#x27;re getting really clean, but never irritating to the skin. Really love it.</li>
            <li> It is a good sponge, not as soft as I prefer but it does the job. I think that anyone looking for a good sponge is better off buying the cheaper ones at a walgreens from time to time instead of spending as much on a sponge like this. That will be my next move.</li>
            <li> scrubs all the bits it needed to. Lasted for a good 6 months maybe? I don&#x27;t expect much more life out of a shower scrubby, and you should replace them that frequently anyway.</li>
            <li> This is an ok sponge but it&#x27;s flat and not bumpy like the natural sponges. I was hoping this would be a little more scratchy for the exfoliating effect. The good side is it feels like it will last longer than my natural one did due to it having a more uniform shape.</li>
            <li> Great sponge!  What really makes this nice is that when it dries it does not have a foul smell like many natural sponge products have.  It is very absorbent which makes for a nice foamy lather, for a delightful shower or bathing experience.  Also it is firm and gives a really great feel against the body as it feels like it cleans yet it is soft and not like cleaning with a brick as some sponges tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only downside is that while it has nice strong and sturdy string for hanging the string is a bit short and it does not hang from all parts of the shower or bath to dry.  If the string was just a bit longer it could be hung on the faucet.</li>
            <li> Very soft and good quality</li>
            <li> It works good and has a decent lather but doesn&#x27;t last all that long. I usually shower once a day (occasionally twice a day) and I can only get ~3 months out of them before they start to fall apart.</li>
            <li> It is what it looks like! Has texture, holds water. I am cutting the string off and maybe cutting down the size because it&#x27;s almost too much for my small hands to hold.</li>
            <li> Nice pair of sponges! They lather well with good quality soap and has a slight exfoliating effect. They dry quickly, so I prefer these to the nylon loofahs that stay wet long after a shower. These seem to be more hygienic.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge, I bought as an alternative to using a puff and glad that I did.  I felt that the puffs were too plastic and artificial feeling and sometimes shower gel gets wasted. This sponge feels nice, not rough on the skin at all.  I even find that I require much less shower gel so that is a definite bonus.  I will be switching permanently to bath sponges over bath puffs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different sea sponges in the last year and this has been the best.  It is very soft, lathers well and rinses well.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks so I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it holds up over time but so far no indication that it shouldn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Product measures 5 1/4 inches diameter by 2 inches thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this sponge because washcloths are forever slipping out of my grip.  No problem holding onto this sponge, no matter how vigorously I use it.  Holds plenty of water and soap and does not feel rough against the skin.</li>
            <li> Replaced the old one, always buy the same</li>
            <li> Excellent for coiling.</li>
            <li> Started crumbling after only 2 months.  For how much more it was than alternatives, I&#x27;d expect better.</li>
            <li> Torn apart with slight use. Not a lasting product.</li>
            <li> It s a good product but I wish it was not so extremely soft. it is nice and consistent though.</li>
            <li> I love these sea foam sponges. They are not abrasive on your skin at all. They are more fragile than rubber sponges and mesh shower balls, so they don&#x27;t last as long, but they are well worth what you pay for them.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Quick shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Awesome sponge! So soft and quickly delivered!</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected. I was looking for real shower sponge.  This sponge seems to be made of a &amp;#34;sponge alternative&amp;#34; that makes it tougher on the body than a true sponge. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Everything you would expect from a sponge you get.  Quality materials lead to enhanced product life.  Sponge is not too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> The first day I got it, it split in half. The next day it split in half again. Now I have pieces of it all over my tub.</li>
            <li> Most other sponges I&#x27;ve purchased fail to live up to their advertised size.  This one does and is 2-3X cheaper to boot.</li>
            <li> While the name &amp;#34;Sea Foam Sponge&amp;#34; might imply it is from the sea, it is not, it is a polyurethane based product. Essentially the same material seat cushions are made from. After the chemicals are mixed together, air is injected as the mix is extruded, giving it the &amp;#34;natural sponge&amp;#34; look. It&#x27;d be cheaper just to find a couch on the side of the road and cut out your own sponges :). But seriously, if you don&#x27;t believe me, tear off a small piece and put a lighter to it, it will melt and you will see the nonflammable chemicals separate.</li>
            <li> Good sponge. Used everyday for 4 months. Remains soft both when wet or dry. Has held its shape and consistency throughout. Gives great suds. I wash it out with water after each use and leave it flat on my shower rack to air dry. No odor or mildew issues. Has remained as soft and sturdy as my first day use.&lt;br /&gt;Please let amazon know if this review was helpful.</li>
            <li> Really like this sponge.  It&#x27;s a nice size and lathers up well.  Soft too.</li>
            <li> Update - Bought this sponge in March of 2015 and over a year later it is still in one piece. It has a few small tears, but still functions perfectly. If other reviewers are saying the sponge is breaking quickly it could be because of the type of soap they use. I have noticed that the body wash I have been using is not drying to the skin so the sponge does not get dried out like it would from harsher soaps. I think this is the key to why it has lasted over a year and still going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge works just fine, some buyers seem to be confused that it is a natural sea sponge, it is not, it is synthetic. The foam is soft and not scratchy, holds soap well and has not begun to break down yet. I say yet because they do breakdown, I purchased one a while ago and it lasted about 4-5 months before it began to tear and fall apart. Hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Except for being a little larger than I&#x27;d imagined, the bath sponge was exactly what I wanted.  It came in a timely manner and was packaged securely.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sponge for any desired use.</li>
            <li> Exceed it my expectations, will definitely come back for another one.</li>
            <li> excellent product. exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This sponge would have been alright if it had lasted longer. Within a week or two it was tearing in half from the string hole and eventually tore completely in half.</li>
            <li> NICE LARGE TO MEDIUM SIZE, GREAT FOR THE BATH. .LIKE THE QUALITY, MOST IMPORTANT. .</li>
            <li> A great product, doesn&#x27;t come apart like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> All is well. 2nd time purchase</li>
            <li> Not too soft or scratchy&#x3D; works great</li>
            <li> Stiff enough it&#x27;s a cleansing scrub; soft enough it&#x27;s not an abrasive attack!  This was exactly the sponge I wanted and in a size that fit nicely in my hand while showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to hold up pretty well -- unlike my previous, softer sponge which began to fall apart fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Of course the sponge/luffa/washcloth you prefer is personal and, therefore, very subjective so I wouldn&#x27;t presume to recommend this to everyone but I will say I really like it.  The first time I purchased this sponge was in a local store. And once they stopped carrying them I had to hunt the brand down online. Why? I&#x27;ve used other luffas that start to break apart almost right away - that&#x27;s not the case with this sponge.  What else can I say?  It&#x27;s lathers well.  It isn&#x27;t abrasive.  It lasts for quite a while.</li>
